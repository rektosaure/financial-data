My name is Matthew, and I'll be your facilitator today. I'd like to welcome everyone to the UPS Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. PJ Guido, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nPJ Guido\n\nInvestor Relations Officer\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the UPS Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; Brian Dykes, our CFO; and a few additional members of our executive leadership team. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2024 Form 10-K and other reports we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. Unless stated otherwise, our discussion refers to adjusted results.\nFor the third quarter of 2025, GAAP results include a net charge of $164 million or $0.19 per diluted share, comprised of after-tax transformation strategy costs of $250 million, which were partially offset by an $86 million benefit from the reversal of an income tax valuation allowance. A reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted amounts to GAAP financial results is available in today's webcast materials. These materials are also available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. And now I'll turn the call over to Carol.\n\nCarol B. Tomé\n\nChief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThank you, PJ, and good morning. To start, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to all UPSers for their dedication and hard work. The third quarter brought a wave of tariff changes, some expected, others unforeseen, and our team navigated these complexities with exceptional skills and resilience. At the same time, we continued advancing our network reconfiguration, a critical step in shaping the future of our U.S. business. Amid this significant transformation, I remain deeply impressed by the determination of UPS and their steadfast commitment to serving our customers and building a stronger, more agile UPS.\nTurning to our results. In the third quarter, consolidated revenue was $21.4 billion. Consolidated operating profit was $2.1 billion and consolidated operating margin was 10%. The cash flow pressures we saw in the second quarter eased during the third quarter. As a result, our year-to-date free cash flow reached $2.7 billion. In the third quarter, our focus on revenue quality continued. And as expected, our U.S. average daily volume, or ADV, declined from last year. The largest drivers of the U.S. volume decline were the planned glide down of Amazon volume and a targeted reduction in lower-yielding e-commerce volume. Our focus on revenue quality yielded solid results as U.S. revenue per piece grew by 9.8% in the third quarter. By coupling solid revenue per piece growth with outstanding expense control, we were able to grow our U.S. operating margin by 10 basis points to what we reported last year on an ADV decline of $2.3 million or 12.3% -- in our international business, total ADV grew 4.8%.\nOur priority is to our customers. And during the quarter, we ran our international network with agility, rerouting capacity to where our customers needed it. Looking at export ADV, it increased 5.9%, marking the fifth quarter in a row of growth. But due to the changes in trade policy, export volume fell in our higher-margin lanes and grew in our lower-margin lanes. This volume mix change pressured our international operating margin and also pressured our forwarding business. On a positive note, we continue to see strength in health care with strong revenue growth in the third quarter year-over-year, driven by our portfolio of health care logistics solutions.\nAs Brian will provide more details on our financial performance, let me provide some operational updates. In recent years, the spotlight on international commerce and the intricacies of supply chains has intensified. And in 2025, we're witnessing the most profound shift in trade policy in a century. At UPS, this is our domain. Every day, we connect businesses and customers across more than 200 countries and territories, ensuring goods move seamlessly across borders. That includes navigating the complexities of customs brokerage, where we're one of the world's largest customs brokers, managing millions of customs entries annually. Our success is powered by deep expertise, exceptional talent and cutting-edge technology.\nWith our next-gen brokerage capabilities, we harness AI to digitally process over 90% of our cross-border transactions, delivering speed, accuracy and reliability at a global scale. Following the elimination of the de minimis exemption for U.S. imports, UPS experienced a tenfold surge in daily customs entries. We responded swiftly, upgrading our shipping systems to capture the expanded data requirements mandated by U.S. customs and border protection. To manage the increased volume and complexity, we enhanced our customs brokerage capabilities by integrating Agentic AI. This advanced technology streamlined formal entry processes. At UPS, we don't just move goods, we remove friction. By absorbing regulatory complexity, we help our customers minimize disruptions and keep global commerce flowing. And due to the investments we've made in our brokerage business, we can absorb this complexity without adding cost that isn't offset by revenue.\nAs you know, we have a goal to become the #1 complex health care logistics provider in the world. To that end, we are making great progress towards our acquisition of Canadian-based Andlauer Healthcare Group. The addition of Andlauer's capabilities will further strengthen our solutions in global health care logistics, particularly in North America. We expect to close this transaction in early November.\nNow touching on DAP, our digital access program. We have more than 8 million SMBs on DAP. And in the first 9 months of the year, we generated over $2.8 billion in global DAP revenue, an increase of 20% year-over-year. DAP continues to be an important SMB growth engine. And for the full year, we expect to deliver over $3.5 billion in global DAP revenue.\nBefore we move on, let me provide updates on our Amazon glide down effort and our Ground Saver product. Our Amazon glide down efforts are proceeding as planned. As expected, in the third quarter, we experienced a stepped-up volume decline with Amazon. Versus last year, Amazon's total volume decline in the third quarter was 21.2% compared to 13% for the first half of the year. In tandem with this change, we are continuing to reconfigure our U.S. network. We closed an additional 19 buildings, bringing our total so far this year to 93 buildings. Further during the quarter, we completed a successful voluntary retirement program for many long-term drivers who welcome the opportunity to retire from UPS after decades of dedicated service. In total, our network reconfiguration and cost-out efforts are on schedule and the profit improvement we expect to see from the Amazon glide down initiatives is on plan. In a few minutes, Brian will provide more details about our progress here.\nMoving to Ground Saver. In the third quarter, our Ground Saver average daily volume declined 32.7% year-over-year due primarily to the actions we've taken with Amazon and to trim lower-yielding e-commerce volume. We recently reached a preliminary understanding on revenue and rates with the United States Postal Service to support last-mile delivery for our Ground Saver product. There's still more work to do, but we are confident we will come to an agreement that ensures our service levels will remain best-in-class, which brings me to peak. As we've discussed, our top 100 customers drive about 80% of our peak surge each year, and we expect that to be the case again this year. Early forecasts from these customers suggest they are planning for a good peak that will result in a considerable surge in volume from our current volume levels. But remember that given the Amazon glide down plan, we expect total peak average daily volume in the U.S. to be down year-over-year.\nOperationally, we're poised to deliver a strong peak season driven by several key factors. First, thanks to strategic enhancements made to our Network of the Future initiative, we're operating more efficiently than ever. These changes will allow us to reduce reliance on seasonal hires and significantly cut back on lease trailers, vehicles and aircraft compared to previous years. Much of this efficiency is powered by automation. Over the past year, we've deployed new automated systems in 35 facilities. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate 66% of our volume will move through automated processes, up from 63% during the same period last year. Second, as we approach the peak shipping window, we'll continue to leverage our proven technologies and scale the network where needed, all while maintaining a sharp focus on service quality. These advancements position us to run the most efficient peak in our history. We've set the standard for holiday shipping, 7 consecutive years of industry-leading service, and we're confident that our operational strategy and commitment to excellence will make it.\nWith the uncertainty around tariffs now somewhat resolved and clear peak forecast from our largest customers, we're in a stronger position to offer guidance than we were at the end of the second quarter. As I wrap up, let me share our financial expectations for the fourth quarter. We anticipate consolidated revenue of approximately $24 billion and consolidated operating margin of approximately 11% to 11.5%. Brian will walk you through the details of our fourth quarter outlook shortly. Amid a rapidly evolving global landscape, UPS is executing the most significant strategic shift in our company's history. We're focused on winning where it matters most, capturing high-value parts of the market and onboarding customers with increasingly complex logistics needs. Our company is rock solid strong with more than sufficient liquidity to deliver upon our transformation and return capital to shareowners. The changes we're implementing are designed to deliver long-term value for all stakeholders. So with that, thank you for listening. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThank you, Carol, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll cover 3 areas, starting with our third quarter results. Next, I'll discuss progress with the Amazon volume glide down and our network reconfiguration and cost-out efforts. Then I'll close with our expectations for the fourth quarter and capital allocation for the full year.\nMoving to our results. Starting with our consolidated performance. In the third quarter, revenue was $21.4 billion and operating profit was $2.1 billion. Consolidated operating margin was 10%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.74. $0.30 of EPS came from a sale-leaseback transaction involving 5 properties completed in the third quarter, which resulted in a $330 million pretax gain on sale. This transaction was part of a broader strategy aimed at freeing up capital for reinvestment as we reconfigure our network. The leases are structured to maintain operational continuity for our business. And as a result, we have not adjusted this gain on sale in our non-GAAP presentation.\nNow moving to our segment performance, starting with U.S. Domestic. In the third quarter, we continued to improve the mix of volume in our network and our disciplined approach to revenue quality meaningfully offset the impact lower volume had on revenue. Additionally, the team did an excellent job managing expense throughout the quarter, resulting in an improvement in U.S. domestic operating margin. For the quarter, total U.S. average daily volume was down 12.3%, primarily due to the glide down of Amazon volume and our focus on improving revenue quality. Total air average daily volume was down 13.9%, mainly due to Amazon. Health care and high-tech customers both showed growth in air average daily volume in the third quarter, which was the third consecutive quarter of positive momentum from these key industries. Ground average daily volume was down 12% year-over-year. Within Ground, Ground Saver ADV declined 32.7% due primarily to the actions we've taken with Amazon and to trim lower-yielding e-commerce volume. As a result, our more premium ground commercial and residential services made up over 84% of our total ground average daily volume in the third quarter. That's the highest percentage we've seen in more than 5 years.\nNow moving to customer mix. SMB average daily volume was down 2.2% versus last year. However, we continue to see bright spots in SMB health care and automotive as well as growth from DAP, our digital access program. In the third quarter, SMBs made up 32.8% of total U.S. volume, which is about a 340 basis point improvement compared to last year. In the third quarter, B2B average daily volume finished down 4.8% compared to last year due to softness in retail and in manufacturing activity. B2B represented 45.2% of our U.S. volume, which was a 350 basis point improvement versus last year. B2C average daily volume was down 17.6% year-over-year.\nMoving to revenue. For the third quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $14.2 billion, which was down just 2.6% year-over-year against an ADV decline of 12.3%. Our revenue performance reflects strong growth in revenue per piece and air cargo. In the third quarter, revenue per piece increased 9.8% year-over-year, which was the strongest revenue per piece growth rate we've seen in 3 years. Breaking down the components of the 9.8% revenue per piece improvement, base rates and package characteristics increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 350 basis points. Customer and product mix improvements increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 400 basis points. The remaining 230 basis point increase was from fuel.\nTurning to costs. In the third quarter, total expense in U.S. domestic was down 2.7%. The decline in total expense was primarily driven by our actions to reduce hours and operational positions with volume. Looking at cost per piece, we were up against a tough comparison from last year. This comparison, together with the costs associated with delivering Ground Saver volume and the contractual union wage increase that went into effect on August 1, resulted in a cost per piece increase of 10.4%. The U.S. Domestic segment delivered $905 million in operating profit and operating margin was 6.4%.\nMoving to our International segment. Through ongoing shifts in trade patterns spurred by changes in U.S. trade policy, we are continuing to operate our global network with agility to serve our customers. As a result, in the third quarter, International delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of growth in average daily volume and revenue. In the third quarter, total international ADV increased 4.8%, led by Europe and the Americas regions. International domestic average daily volume increased 3.6% compared to last year, led by Canada. On the export side, average daily volume increased 5.9% year-over-year, driven by the agility of our network to adjust to changing trade lanes and led by strength between European countries. As the third quarter played out, we saw a decline in U.S. imports, led by an ADV decline on the China to U.S. lane of 27.1%.\nTurning to revenue. In the third quarter, international revenue was $4.7 billion, up 5.9% from last year. Operating profit in the International segment was $691 million, down $101 million year-over-year, reflecting pressures from trade lane shifts, product trade down and lower demand-related surcharges. International operating margin in the third quarter was 14.8%.\nMoving to Supply Chain Solutions. In the third quarter, revenue was $2.5 billion, lower than last year by $715 million, of which $465 million was due to our divestiture of Coyote in the third quarter of 2024. Within Supply Chain Solutions, demand softness in Air and Ocean Forwarding resulted in lower market rates, which drove a decline in revenue year-over-year. Logistics revenue was down year-over-year, driven by a decline in Mail Innovation. This was partially offset by revenue growth in Healthcare Logistics. And UPS Digital, which includes Roadie and Happy Returns, grew revenue by 9.5% year-over-year. In the third quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $536 million. Operating margin was 21.3%. Our results in Supply Chain Solutions this quarter include the impact of the sale-leaseback transaction, which generated the $330 million one-time gain that I mentioned earlier.\nTurning to cash and shareowner returns. Year-to-date, we generated $5.1 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow of $2.7 billion. We finished the quarter with strong liquidity and no outstanding commercial paper. And so far this year, UPS has paid $4 billion in dividends.\nNow let me provide an update on our cost out and network reconfiguration efforts. In conjunction with our actions to significantly reduce the amount of Amazon volume in our network, we are executing the largest network reconfiguration in our history and will remove approximately $3.5 billion in related costs this year. We've made a lot of progress since our last earnings call. Let me walk you through the details. Total Amazon volume was down 21.2% compared to the third quarter of last year. We achieved our reduction target in the portions of the Amazon volume we are exiting, and we grew the portions of Amazon volume that we are continuing to serve.\nNow let's look at the savings we've generated so far this year. As a reminder, we are tracking our savings within 3 cost buckets. They are variable costs, which primarily captures operational hours, semi-variable costs, which reflects operational positions and fixed costs, which includes closing buildings and reducing expense from support functions through our efficiency reimagined initiative. Looking at variable costs. Total operational hours continue to move down with volume. So far this year, we are down more than 16 million hours, and we are on track to reach our reduction target of approximately 25 million hours for the year.\nMoving to semi-variable costs. Attrition and operational positions accelerated each month during the quarter, and we finished down nearly 34,000 positions year-over-year, which includes a reduction from our driver voluntary separation program. Nearly 1/3 of the reductions occurred in September. In our fixed cost bucket, year-to-date, we have completed the closure of 195 operations, including closing 93 buildings. As we are closing buildings, we are also investing through our Network of the Future efforts. And as Carol mentioned, we've deployed additional automation in 35 facilities. And while we expect to be busy processing volume during peak, we also plan to deploy automation projects in 7 additional buildings in December. Lastly, savings from our efficiency reimagined initiatives continued to accelerate in the third quarter.\nPulling it all together, we are making meaningful progress executing our strategy. So far this year, we've reduced expense by $2.2 billion, and we're on track to achieve our 2025 expense reduction target of approximately $3.5 billion.\nNow moving to our outlook. At the consolidated level, we expect fourth quarter revenue of approximately $24 billion and an operating margin of approximately 11% to 11.5%. Looking at the segments in the fourth quarter. Starting with U.S. Domestic, we expect revenue to be around $16.2 billion in the fourth quarter, driven by the continued volume reduction with Amazon and strong revenue per piece growth. And we expect an operating margin of approximately 9.5% to 10%. In terms of peak, in the U.S., we expect heavier volume earlier in the peak period, and we have 1 additional delivery day compared to last year, which gives us more flexibility. The network reconfiguration and additional automation we deployed through Network of the Future set us up to deliver a more efficient peak and another year of industry-leading service for our customers. In short, we're ready for peak.\nTurning to International. We expect the dynamic environment we've experienced throughout the year will continue. With this in mind, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be approximately $5 billion, and we expect an operating margin of between 17% and 18%. In Supply Chain Solutions, we expect revenue in the fourth quarter of around $2.7 billion and an operating margin of approximately 9%.\nLooking at capital allocation for the full year, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $3.5 billion. We are planning to pay out around $5.5 billion in dividends, subject to Board approval, and we have completed the targeted share repurchase of about $1 billion of our shares. Lastly, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 23.75% for the full year 2025.\nBefore I close, let me comment on our financial condition. UPS is rock solid strong, and we have plenty of liquidity to continue executing our strategy and return value to our shareowners. And following the completion of our acquisition of Andlauer, we expect to end the year with around $5 billion in cash. So with that, operator, please open the lines for questions.",

You may rejoin the queue for the opportunity to ask an additional question.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Carol.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you, PJ, and good morning. To begin, I want to thank all UPSers for their hard work and efforts as we've made material progress against the strategic actions we laid out in January. Those actions include accelerating the glide down of Amazon volume, transitioning our Ground Saver product, and generating savings through our Efficiency Reimagined initiatives. During the quarter, our team of dedicated UPSers remained focused on execution while keeping supply chains moving and delivering best in class service.\nOur Q2 financial results reflect the impact of a complex macro environment driven by ever evolving trade policies as well as the significant actions we are taking to strengthen UPS's competitive and financial positioning. Looking at our Q2 results, consolidated revenue was $21.2 billion, consolidated operating profit was $1.9 billion, and consolidated operating margin was 8.8%.\nAs Brian will provide more detail regarding our financial results, I'd like to comment on what we are seeing from a business climate perspective and then spend my time talking about the progress we are making on our strategic action. So first, our thoughts on the business climate.\nDespite uncertainties around trade policies in the Q2, the overall US economy demonstrated continued resilience. But our sector, specifically the US small package market, was unfavorably impacted by US consumer sentiment that was near historic lows. A recent research report from McKinsey showed that in the face of tariffs and other uncertainties, consumers are trading down while at the same time splurging. For the first time in three years, consumer spending on discretionary categories like restaurants and automobiles outpaced growth in essential items.\nAnd on the commercial side of the economy, manufacturing activity in the US remains soft. These macroeconomic dynamics impacted overall market demand as well as demand by customer segments and product. In the quarter, our overall US average daily volume declined by 7.3%. But due to our strategic actions, we saw a positive shift in the mix of business as revenue declined by just 0.8%.\nMoving to the business climate outside of the US, trade follows policy and generally tariffs are not good for trade. With the announcement of certain changes to trade policies in Q2, we saw that play out. For example, looking at our China to US trade lane, an increased tariff and the elimination of de minimis exceptions resulted in a year-over-year drop in average daily volume of 34.8% for the months of May and June. Our China to US trade lane is our most profitable trade lane and the volume decline here pressured our international operating margin. But it's important to remember that with policy changes, trade doesn't stop, it moves. Given our global integrated network, we are well positioned to service these moves.\nAs an example, in Q2 we saw volume in our China to the rest of the world trade lanes increased by 22.4%, and we nearly doubled our capacity between India and Europe to meet the growing export demand on that trade lane. Further, with the investments we've made in brokerage capabilities in Q2, nearly 90% of all cross-border transactions were processed digitally.\nGiven our proven trade expertise and vast global network, our customers are coming to us for solutions that will help them navigate tariff uncertainty. In fact, so far this year we've engaged in over 600 supply chain mapping assessments to help customers visualize, evaluate, and optimize their global supply chains, including looking at opportunities for nearshoring. Speaking of nearshoring, last year we announced our plan to acquire Estafeta, a Mexican logistics company. Clearing regulatory and pre-closing conditions is turning out to be a slow process, but we continue to be bullish on the opportunity here. Growing our international small package business remains a strategic priority for us and we see an opportunity for outpaced growth in this $99 billion addressable market.\nIn our supply chain solutions business, global freight forwarding was also impacted by changes in trade policies, with revenue falling more than we expected. This softness was partially offset by solid growth in our digital and healthcare subsidiaries as we continue to build out those businesses.\nNow to an update on our strategic actions. First, our Amazon glide down efforts are for the most part proceeding as planned in concert with our network reconfiguration efforts. So far this year we've closed 74 buildings. Each building had a closing checklist of over 1,000 steps, and I'm happy to report that the closures went smoothly with minimal issues. From a staffing perspective, our attrition rate was lower than we anticipated, which resulted in higher expense than we planned. From a part-time hourly position perspective, we believe most of this will correct over time. Further, we've announced a Voluntary Separation Program for all full-time US drivers. We've seen a lot of interest in the program so far, and participating drivers will leave UPS starting at the end of August.\nFinally, while our plans are not completed in concert with the Amazon volume decline, we will be closing more buildings and sorts during the back half of this year.\nAs we told you last quarter, this year we expect to remove approximately $3.5 billion in expense from our base business. Part of this effort rests with our Efficiency Reimagined initiatives which launched in the Q1 and accelerated in the Q2. With Efficiency Reimagined, we are redesigning end-to-end processes to drive savings like a new global payment strategy. Here we've centralized how we make and receive payments under a digital-first strategy which will drive efficiency for UPS and improve the customer experience.\nSecond, during the quarter we took a hard look at our economy product we call Ground Saver. For UPS, we believe Ground Saver should be a product that complements an array of products used by our customers and not be a product just by itself. During the quarter we took deliberate pricing actions to manage our Ground Saver volume, and as a result the volume in this product declined by 23% year-over-year. A small portion of the volume decline was directly related to our Amazon glide down plan, and the rest was primarily related to volume declines from non-US based e-commerce companies.\nAs you will recall, at the end of last year we insourced from the USPS the last-mile delivery of our Ground Saver product. This decision, while right for the customer experience, pressured our financial results as delivery expenses were somewhat higher than we anticipated. We are working on solutions to relieve this pressure in the back half of the year.\nBefore I wrap up, I want to touch on a positive in our business, and that's Healthcare Logistics. Healthcare Logistics remains a key driver of growth for all three of our business segments. Complex Healthcare Logistics is an $82 billion addressable market, and we are laser-focused on becoming the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world. To that end, we are leading radiopharma logistics globally, and in addition lead US Integrators in terms of CEIV certified cold chain cross-dock building.\nAlong with growing healthcare organically. We remain committed to inorganic growth too. Like with our previously announced planned acquisition of Andlauer Healthcare Group, Andlauer supports our focus on complex healthcare and will enhance our cold chain and pharmaceutical transportation capabilities in the Canadian and US markets. We expect this acquisition to close before the end of the year.\nNow moving to our outlook for our sector, this remains a very unsettling time. Changes in trade policy have not been cemented, and the impact on customer demand and the overall economy is unknown. While our customers who have scale may be able to thwart the impact of rising costs due to tariffs, many of our SMB customers may not. Further, peak plans have not yet been submitted by our customers, which is an indication that they too are having difficulty in forecasting demand for the holiday selling season.\nGiven that we are not providing any forward looking revenue or earnings guidance, but as Brian will detail, we are focusing on what is within our control, which is the Amazon volume glide down plan, the execution of our network reconfiguration, and ongoing efforts to drive productivity. As I wrap up, I want to touch on our financial position.\nUPS is rock solid strong, and so is our dividend. The UPS dividend is backed by solid free cash flow and a strong investment-grade balance sheet. We know how important the dividend is to our investors, and you have our commitment to a stable and growing dividend in closing. Over the past five years, we've operated in a dynamic and complex world. Today's world is the same, complex and dynamic. But we would argue that the dynamics impacting today's marketplace are very different than the dynamics caused by that pandemic, or high inflation, or labor disruptions, or war. Changes in trade policies are impacting global trade and demand. It will likely all settle down at some point, but for now it is a very volatile environment. But we're not letting this knock us off our strategic plan.\nAt UPS, we are proactively taking action to put our company on a much stronger footing and position our company well for the future. We are focused on serving our customers, growing in the more complex and economically attractive parts of the market, and creating value for our shareholders. Our founder Jim Casey said. Our horizon is as distant as our mind's eye wishes it to be. We've got our eyes on the future. So with that, thank you for listening and now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThank you Carol and good morning everyone. This morning I'll cover three areas starting with our Q2 results. Then I'll discuss progress with the Amazon volume glide down, our network reconfiguration efforts, and our efficiency reimagined initiatives. Lastly, I'll comment on our capital allocation priorities for the year. Moving to our results starting with our consolidated performance in the Q2, revenue was $21.2 billion and operating profit was $1.9 billion. Consolidated operating margin was 8.8%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.55. Now moving to our segment performance and starting with US domestic through our Amazon volume glide down strategy, we are shifting the mix of our US business. We are laser focused on improving revenue quality and the changes we are making are beginning to show up in our results for the quarter.\nTotal US average daily volume was down 7.3% primarily driven by our planned glide down of Amazon volume and revenue quality efforts.\nTotal Air average daily volume was down 11.6% when excluding Amazon. Total Air ADV increased 1.4% driven by healthcare and high-tech customers. Ground average daily volume was down 6.6% year-over-year, and within ground, Ground Saver ADV declined 23.3% primarily due to the pricing actions we took on e-commerce volume in the Q2. Ground Saver made up the smallest portion of our total ground volume that we've seen in two years. This shift is a proof point showing positive product mix improvement in terms of customer mix. ADV growth within our small- and medium-sized customers was lower than we anticipated. Year-over-year, the SMB growth rate was flat. However, we saw some bright spots in SMB, healthcare, manufacturing, and automotive. In the Q2, SMBs made up 32% of total US volume, a 230 basis point improvement compared to last year.\nLooking at enterprise customers excluding Amazon, average daily volume was down 10.4% versus last year due to a combination of our revenue quality actions and overall softness in the market for the quarter. B2B average daily volume finished down 2.3% compared to last year due to softness in manufacturing activity. B2C average daily volume was down 10.9% year-over-year primarily due to the actions we took to improve revenue quality. B2B represented 43.7% of our US volume, which was a 220 basis point improvement versus last year. Moving to revenue for the Q2, US domestic generated revenue of $14.1 billion, which was down slightly to last year mainly due to the decline in Amazon revenue, which was partially offset by increases in air cargo and revenue per piece. In the Q2, revenue per piece increased 5.5% year-over-year.\nBreaking down the components of the 5.5% revenue per piece improvement, the net impact of base rates and package characteristics increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 250 basis points. Customer and product mix improvements increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 200 basis points. Lastly, fuel drove a 100 basis point increase in the revenue per piece growth rate. Turning to costs, total expense in the Q2 was flat compared to last year, including an increase in air cargo. Looking at cost per piece, it increased 5.6%. This was primarily due to the short-term pressure we experienced from some of our Ground Saver volume as well as the timing of employee attrition associated with our network reconfiguration. The US domestic segment delivered $982 million in operating profit and operating margin was 7%.\nMoving to our international segment, as Carol mentioned, the trade patterns we anticipated played out about as we expected, but the magnitudes were different, particularly in May when the tariff changes and the de minimis exclusion for products from China took effect. In the Q2, total international ADV increased 3.9% with all regions growing average daily volume versus last year. International domestic average daily volume increased 1.5% compared to last year, led by Canada. On the export side, average daily volume increased 6.1% year-over-year. US trade policy changes during the quarter resulted in a 34.8% decline on our China to US lane in May and June, which was higher than we expected. Partially offsetting this decline, in the Q2 we saw growth of over 20% out of China to the rest of the world. At UPS, we run our global network with agility.\nThis allows us to pivot into areas of opportunity and reduce costs in areas under pressure. With service in over 200 countries, we are where our customers need us to be. During the Q2 we made over 100 adjustments to add or cancel flights in our Asia, Europe, and US International lanes as our customers responded to changing tariffs and adjusted their supply chain.\nTurning to revenue in the Q2, international revenue was $4.5 billion, up 2.6% from last year. Revenue per piece declined year-over-year due to geography mix and lower demand-related surcharges. Operating profit in the international segment was $682 million, down $142 million year-over-year, reflecting pressure from trade lane shifts, product trade down, lower demand-related surcharges, and the investments we are making to expand weekend services in Europe. International operating margin in the Q2 was 15.2%.\nMoving to Supply Chain Solutions in Q2, revenue was $2.7 billion, lower than last year by $594 million. 90% of the decrease in revenue was due to our divestiture of Coyote in Q3 2024. Within Supply Chain Solutions, air and ocean forwarding revenue was down year-over-year. The decline in the air and ocean freight was driven by changes in tariffs resulting in demand softness and lower market rates. Healthcare Logistics grew revenue by 5.7%, and UPS Digital, including Roadie and Happy Returns, grew revenue 26.4% year-over-year. Lastly, in Q2, we adjusted our process for how we handle volume and mail innovation, improving the profitability of this business. In Q2, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $212 million. Operating margin was 8%.\nTurning to cash and shareholder returns year to date, we generated $2.7 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow was $742 million. In the Q2, we made voluntary pension contributions, accelerated investments related to our network reconfiguration, and experienced temporary working capital pressure primarily due to changes in tariffs. We expect these will normalize in the second half of the year. We finished the quarter with strong liquidity and no outstanding commercial paper, and so far this year UPS has paid $2.7 billion in dividends.\nNow let me provide an update on our cost out and network reconfiguration efforts related to our Amazon volume reduction actions. We are removing approximately $3.5 billion in cost this year while undertaking the largest network reconfiguration in our history. On our last earnings call, we shared a tracker to help you see our savings progress. Here we've grouped the associated cost savings into three buckets: variable cost, which primarily captures operational hours, semi-variable cost, which reflects operational positions, and fixed costs, which includes closing buildings and reducing expense from support functions. Through our Efficiency Reimagined initiative.\nAmazon's average daily volume rate of decline in the Q2 was a little lower than we expected, which followed the Q1 where their ADV rate of decline was higher than we expected. When looking at the first six months of 2025, Amazon's ADV declined 13% compared to last year. Now that we are in the second half of the year, we expect to accelerate the pace of Amazon's volume decline to approximately 30% year-over-year in each of the third and Q4s. Now let's look at the progress with our network reconfiguration and efforts to remove expense associated with the Amazon volume decline.\nStarting with variable costs, total operational hours pace down with volume in the first half of the year, and we are on track to reach our reduction target of approximately 25 million hours this year.\nMoving to semi-variable cost. Year to date, operational positions have been reduced by nearly 9,500. As Carol mentioned, our attrition rate was lower than we anticipated. In terms of part timers, we expect the attrition rate to synchronize over time for full timers. We recently announced a Voluntary Separation Program for all US drivers, and one week into the offer we are seeing a level of interest that's in line with our expectations.\nIn our fixed cost bucket. Year to date, we've completed the closure of 155 operations, including closing 74 buildings. We continue to evaluate the network and the impact of the Amazon volume decline and expect to close additional buildings and operations in the back half of 2025. While we've been rightsizing the network, we've also deployed additional automation to continue to drive efficiency. Lastly, as Carol mentioned, savings from our Efficiency Reimagined initiative accelerated in Q2. Putting it all together, we remain on track to achieve our 2025 expense reduction target of about $3.5 billion. Partially offsetting this reduction is the higher than expected Ground Saver delivery expense.\nMoving. To the rest of 2025. There's a lot of uncertainty right now due to tariff and trade changes, and the potential impacts on consumer behavior is unknown. Because of this, we see a risk for greater variability in SMB and enterprise volume. Additionally, in the US, while we are confident in the strategic changes we are making with our network reconfiguration and revenue quality focus, two impactful changes remain uncertain. First, the timing with implementing Ground Saver solutions is pending, and second is the full impact of the driver Voluntary Separation Program and related take rate and departure dates.\nFor all these reasons, we are not providing any forward-looking revenue or operating profit guidance. Our expectation is that there will be more certainty at the end of the Q3, and we will have a better read on peak and the timing and scale of these initiatives.\nWe are, however, confirming our 2025 capital allocation expectations. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $3.5 billion. We are planning to pay out around $5.5 billion in dividends subject to board approval, and we have completed the targeted repurchase of about $1 billion of our shares. Lastly, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 23.5% for the full year 2025.\nSo, with that, operator, please open the lines for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now conduct a question and answer session. If you have any questions or comments, please press star then one on your phone. Our first question comes from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Sir, please go ahead with your question.\n\nJustine Weiss\n\nAssistant Vice President and Senior Research Associate, Bernstein\n\nHi everyone, thanks for taking the question. This is Justine Weiss speaking on behalf of David Vernon.\nSo I'm just wondering, is the lack off guidance, in some ways, a sign. That things are worse, or is this purely about things still being uncertain? And also, how do you feel about progress on cost cuts being enough to exit with domestic margins at double digits?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, Justine, thanks for your call and question, and I'll start with the rationale for not providing guidance first. We debated this a lot, but there's so much uncertainty out there. We are building scenarios, and the range of the scenarios, well, it's wide enough to drive one of our 18-wheelers through, so we elected not to provide guidance. Let me tell you why. First, if I look at the volume in July, it's actually a bit better than what we've been seeing. But part of that in the United States anyway was influenced by Amazon, Prime Day, and other retailers who had similar like promotions. So we're not sure that the volume in July is an indicator of the volume for the rest of the quarter.\nFurther, the volume outside the United States was strong too, but we believe that's because companies were purchasing inventory ahead of the 1 August tariffs. So July, while good, we don't think is a predictor necessarily of the rest of the quarter. Why because of the uncertainty, as we look at the tariffs, there are a number of tariffs that are slated to go in on 1 August. We don't know if that's going to happen or not. There only have been six trade deals that have been negotiated. So there's a lot of uncertainty regarding the tariffs as it relates to the China tariff. That agreement expires on 12 August. Now it's rumored that that will be extended, but we don't know. And so there's uncertainty around tariffs and then there means there's uncertainty around consumer demand. So consider this.\nAt the end of Q1, you know our customers had inventory and they sold that inventory down in Q2. They're now at a point where they need to replenish their inventories. If you're an SMB customer sourcing from China alone, you could see that your cost could increase by 55%. As we recorded, our SMB volume was flat year on year. We just think there might be some risk to SMBs in Q3. We just don't know. Finally, we don't have peak plans yet. So all these things make the range of revenue for Q3 very wide. Now, on the expense side, I'm certainly pleased with the progress our team is making in terms of delivering the $3.5 billion in cost out that we laid out at the beginning of the year. I'm very pleased with that.\nBut there are a couple of things that we have to work on. First, the attrition related to our Amazon volume glide down was not as high as we expected it to be. What we're seeing is that the longer a building is closed, the higher the attrition rate. The majority of the closures that occurred in Q2 were back-end weighted. So we expect the attrition to get higher as time progresses. So this should take care of itself from a part-time hourly perspective. And to address the full-time driver roles, we've offered this voluntary buyout. We don't know the take-up yet. We don't know the cost associated with that take-up or the benefit associated with that take-up. So that's to be seen.\nAnd finally, on Ground Saver, while we're pleased with the customer experience that we have been providing with Ground Saver, the algorithm that we modeled for delivery density didn't hold true in the Q2, and as a result, we had more delivery stops than we had in time anticipated. We're working through that algorithm, but we have also re-engaged with the USPS. There's new leadership there. You have excess capacity. So we're working through a number of different solutions on Ground Saver. We don't know the outcome of that yet, but we expect to know that hopefully in the quarter.\nSo at the end of all of this, by the end of the Q3, we think we'll have more certainty on tariff. We think we'll have more certainty on peak. We think we'll have more certainty on cost so that we can come back and give guidance for the Q4. Now, with all that being said, Brian, maybe you could kind of give some shaping for the Q3 just to help people with their model.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah, thanks, Carol. And I think Carol hit on all the right points. Right. So volume remains depressed right now. Right. And there's the possibility, particularly with our retail and SMB customers that look, it could get better, it could get a little bit worse as we go in. And we're dealing with the lower attrition and higher Ground Saver cost as we've got. So as you think about Q3 margins, they could be pressured a little more than we thought earlier in the year, even more than the kind of normal seasonality that we have from Q2 to Q3. International and FCS. I mean, you see in the performance, things are holding pretty well. We expect those to be about the same. And we're going to get clarity as we go through the quarter on this. Right.\nWhat we can say, look, is we've got a high degree of confidence and I think it's starting to show in the results that the actions that we're taking are setting ourselves up for the longer term. Right. The rev per piece is turning. The growth in international is positive, and this is going to put us in a much more competitive position, not only to drive growth in the future, but expand margin.\n\nJustine Weiss\n\nAssistant Vice President and Senior Research Associate, Bernstein\n\nAll really helpful. So it sounds like basically exiting domestic margins at double digits is just a bit uncertain right now.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWe'll have more certainty by the end of Q3.\n\nJustine Weiss\n\nAssistant Vice President and Senior Research Associate, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes to the line of Ariel Rosa of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nBen Mohr\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHi, good morning. This is Ben Mohr of Citi on for Ariel Rosa. Thanks for taking our question. At this rate of the China to US parcel lane shifts to the rest of Southeast Asia, like Vietnam or Thailand to the US, when do you expect to fully lap those costs on the trade lane shifts, and with your total investment and infrastructure in the rest of Southeast Asia as it stands, is there enough excess capacity to handle these shifts, or will you need to make additional infrastructure investments into Southeast Asia in order to handle these shifts?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, we're really pleased with how our integrated network is meeting the demands of our customers. And Kate, why don't you give some color?\n\nKate Gutmann\n\nEVP and President of International, Healthcare, and Supply Chain Solutions, UPS\n\nYeah, absolutely. So I think you may recall we engaged with tens of thousands of customers to see how we could help them with supply chain shifts. Some of them were able to move faster than others. Some are waiting for the outcome of the tariffs. But that said, we've unlocked the growth of rest of world to rest of world. Now, the China to US, as we indicated, was down, and then the China rest of world is up.\nWe have shown agility, and to the question on capacity, we are shifting our resources around, and we do it very quickly so that we can capture that growth. In terms of investments, we actually were building out an Asia diversification strategy for the last few years, and with that we actually were seeing, call it 10% type growth that we're unlocking.\nSo it's not a cost, it's actually alignment of resources. Now to the increased trade lane flow outside of the US. So we are capturing that. China again, rest of world over 20%. You mentioned Southeast Asia, Malaysia, Vietnam, all growing over 20%. We've doubled India. So we are seeing that UPS's global integrated network is capturing that growth now as we deal with the revenue per piece changes. So again it's not the cost side as much as the revenue per piece. We are unlocking that profitable growth and we will be harnessing more of it. As the India's get stronger, you'll see heavier weighting and that too is profitable to offset a China.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nMaybe just a couple of other comments about investments, because to Kate's point we got ahead of this. We are expanding our air hub in Hong Kong. We are building a brand new air hub in Philippines, and that positions us very well for these changing shifts in trade lanes. I think it's important to remember that of the 80 largest trade lanes in the world, 49 have an Asian country on one end of the trade lane, and 22 have an Asian country on both ends of the trade lane. So the investments that we laid out several years ago now will be able to capitalize on these shifting trade lanes.\n\nBen Mohr\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nGreat. Thanks so much, and maybe if I can ask a follow-up. More domestically, we've seen smaller parcel carriers taking share in the parcel market. Names like LaserShip, SpeedX, some gig economy carriers that compete with your Roadie. Do you see them, as you work on existing or prospective customers that put out RFPs to bid, what's your view on their strategy? They seem to be competing on price and less comprehensive service. What's your strategy to maintain your competitive moat?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, competition is good. I will say that our offering is very different than theirs because we do operate an end-to-end network and I mean end-to-end, from one coast to the other coast and every aspect of the supply chain. We can meet our customers' needs from a market share perspective. We look at the addressable market and for us we define the addressable market as the market that excludes Amazon and excludes packages that are less than one pound. That market in the Q2 was soft, but we gained share. We're very proud of the fact that we gained share in that market even in this highly competitive environment.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nCarol, if I can just add one. Tying that because I think it's really important that the revenue per piece growth of 5.5% is starting to show that the strategy of dynamically changing the volume in the network working. Right. And if you look at the segments where it really matters for us, SMB, our penetration was up 230 basis points. Commercial, our penetration was up 220 basis points. We actually saw our zone, which means people who are using our end-to-end network over long distances, got longer for the third straight quarter. Right. The pace of the weight decline, which has been an industry trend, is slowing. Right. So we are shifting the volume and the characteristics in our network to customers that see value in our service offering.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWe could talk a lot about the capabilities that we offer that our competitors do not. Like on healthcare, we have special labels that our competitors do not. Or we have RFID tagging on our packages that our customers do not. Or we have returns, boxless, labelless returns that our competitors do not. So from a capability perspective, we will continue to invest in the capabilities that set us apart from our competitors.\n\nBen Mohr\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for your time and insights as always.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And we do ask that participants please ask one question. Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Chan of Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector, Stifel\n\nHey, good morning, everybody, and thanks for the question here. Just wanted to dig into the SMB results a little bit more and see if you could provide some thoughts around whether that is all just policy uncertainty, and something you think could accelerate if maybe we get more clarity on the macro, or if there's anything maybe coming from competitive pressure as some of your peers are chasing that business as well.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nSo as we said, our SMBs are a bit challenged. We talk to our SMB customers to understand how they're thinking about the current trade environment. And many of them are wrestling. They want to find different alternatives of sourcing, but if they knock on the door, they're not necessarily getting attention from the countries where they might be able to move their sourcing through. So there's really a lot of trade uncertainty out there.\nAnd it's not just trade uncertainty. Some of them are finding that in today's environment, credit conditions have tightened up a bit on them. So it's not that they don't have access to capital in the ways that they have seen in prior years. So there are a number of just challenges this group is faced with. Our job is to listen to them through our supply chain mapping capabilities.\nHelp them think about how they might move their sourcing around, help them think how they might be able to reduce their costs by moving inventory in different places or using different modes of transportation. So with over 600 supply chain mapping projects in the Q2, many of that came from the SMBs and Matt is here. Matt, is there anything you'd like to add on SMBs?\n\nMatt Guffey\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial & Strategy Officer, UPS\n\nI'd just highlight one thing just to complement what Carol said. I think SMBs are disproportionately impacted in this space. However, they're looking to UPS and where the strength of our capabilities, the strength of our network is really what positions us well right now. They come to us one because they trust the brand. But to Carol's point, they're looking to where they should source and should they ship manufacturing, they're looking at modes. Do you keep it near? Do you put it on an ocean container?\nWhen we think about in the end. We do think about coast to coast, but we think about it globally, across the world because we have an integrated network that positions us to win in that space.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nI might highlight health care as well. In the SMB we are seeing the shining light through our differentiated capability with our lab placards, and our US operators are delivering 99% plus on basically doctor's office is an assurance that your lab sample will go back to the lab, your specimen be tested, and literally we get into Worldport up to call it 1:00AM and it's back on to the patients. If it's a treatment doorstep by 10:30AM, I mean that is exceptional service.\nMaybe one other comment, just a bright spot on SMB World and that's our digital access platform. That platform continues to provide excellent service for our customers. We have 41 partners on that platform serving over seven million shippers and we saw good growth on that platform. Again in Q2.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector, Stifel\n\nThat's great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from the line of Chris Weatherby of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nRob Salmon\n\nVP, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning guys. It's Rob Salmon on for Chris. With regard to the outlook that you just provided, Brian, in terms of the second half shape of the margins, could you discuss a little bit more how international package margins trended over the quarter as you saw the much bigger declines on that Asia, China, US trade lane and what your expectations are? Looking out to Q3, I thought I heard flattish, but it would be really helpful if we could get a little bit of color given the cost adjustments that you guys were making there.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nSure. Rob, I do think it's worthwhile to brag a little bit on the international and the air team here because we did see the trade flows play out about as we expected. But as Carol mentioned, the magnitudes were very different. Right. And so we did see that China to the US decline more than what we expected. We saw China to the rest of the world increase more, particularly in specific lanes. Within Q2, we made over 100 ad hoc adjustments to our air network to flex to what our customers needed us to do, which I think is a tremendous accomplishment for the international team. And it shows up in the export growth numbers that were really, really strong. Now what that does mean is look, there's some frictional costs right, as you're adjusting that air network.\nI think as we move through the Q3 and we get more certainty on tariffs, we get more certainty on orders for peak from our customers, we'll be able to harden off the capacity on those lanes, get the assets in the right place, and continue to drive the margin. Right now we think it's kind of the same Q2 to Q3, but as we get more certainty, that allows us to make adjustments that can drive the margin back to where we think international can be. High teens over the long term.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nPart of the margin contraction was due to less demand related surcharges this year than last. When do we lap that, Brian?\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nWe'll lap that in Q4.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nRavi Shankar\n\nExecutive Director and Head of India Equity Sales, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks, everyone. Carol, you said that the Amazon glide down is proceeding for the most part as planned. Can you shed some light on what is not going as planned? Maybe. Is it just the shifting rate of drawdown in Q1 and Q2 or is there something else different than expected?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nIt's simply the attrition rate. The attrition rate is not where we thought it would be. As I mentioned, Ravi, the building closures were back end weighted towards the end of the quarter. What we see as time goes on, the longer a building is closed, the higher the attrition rate to make that real for you. In the first month of closure, it's in the single digit. By the third month of closure, it's 25%. So the turnover on the part time hourly side is going to normalize over time. As time progresses on the full time drivers, they have the opportunity to bump into a building. They can follow the work and bump into the building if there's no driving work. That's fine for them if they choose to do that.\nBut we are offering them an opportunity to leave with a nice check if they say that's not work we want to do. And if you think about our drivers, Nando, tell me how many of our drivers have been driving for 35 years or more?\n\nNando Cesarone\n\nEVP and President US, United Parcel Service\n\nYes. So 84% to 85% of our drivers are at the top end of our pay scale and anywhere from 25 to 40 years of service. We have thousands and thousands of drivers that we're entertaining a buyout package. And just one comment on the Amazon drawdown, that is our biggest concern, but something we have to deal with that we had modeled a little differently. But on the whole, when you look at the variable expense that Brian had talked about, 8 million hours in the quarter, the semi-variable, 9,500 more employees, and we see part-time trading faster than full-time. So we'll be at a, call it, even as we continue drawing down on Amazon. So the real concern is in our full-time category.\nAnd then for our fixed buildings, I'd say it's mostly administrative, so payroll, assigning people to the right new facilities and new positions. But in the end, 74 facilities, 155 operations I think done rather smoothly, and our service continues to be very strong.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nSo I couldn't be more pleased with how we're progressing on this strategic pivot. It's just, we modeled an attrition rate that didn't hold in the Q2, but we expect that to correct over time.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nAnd Rob, one other thing I would just add because I think it's important on the top line, the volume. We've worked very closely with Amazon on the glide down and how we do this in an orderly manner for both our network and their network and customers. And it's all going very well. As you think about the pace of that, we always said.\nThe first half was around 13% and the second half jumped to 30%. Just to kind of give you context on that, what that means is from the Q2 to Q3, the decline is an incremental sequential 500,000 pieces. Right. And so that's why we're moving to get ahead of the cost out. Nando's team's got a great plan on how we pull down on the assets, the hours, and the people as we go into the second half. And we're tracking to that $3.5 billion cost takeout.\n\nNando Cesarone\n\nEVP and President US, United Parcel Service\n\nIf I could just add also, that's a big number, 30% when you think about it. But we're going to feather into a peak season in a much more efficient way. As we think about peak and the spike, although we don't have 100% of the picture yet, we will see that that Amazon glide down feathers into peak very nicely for our company.\n\nRavi Shankar\n\nExecutive Director and Head of India Equity Sales, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's really helpful detail. Is there a risk that the slower attrition rate could put that $3.5 billion of cost savings at risk or maybe shift the timing out a little bit? Or do you expect that to catch up over time?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWe expect that to catch up over time.\n\nRavi Shankar\n\nExecutive Director and Head of India Equity Sales, Morgan Stanley\n\nUnderstood. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Connor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live.\n\nConor Cunningham\n\nDirector of Travel and Transports Research, Melius Research\n\nHi, everyone. Thank you. Maybe just sticking with the facility closures. So you did 74 in the first half. I was hoping you could level set on what you expect to do in the second half. And in the same context, could you talk about how much volume is going through fully automated facilities and where you expect that to end in 2025? The bigger question I have though is that all enough that we get to the point where we can start to see margins uptick next year. I realize there's a lot going on in the world, but just as you level set today, just how that's all going right now. Thank you.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nSure. Thank you very much for the question and on the building closures. But we're evaluating a number of different options. There's several buildings that we're looking at, and we'll come back with more information on how many that we're going to do. Because there's the Amazon piece, and then there's also the macro, and we've got to take into account the impact on the entire network. So we'll provide more color on that, on the automation look. We continue to invest in automation within the network because remember, we're not just sliding down Amazon volume and e-commerce volume. We're also investing to be a more efficient network. That's going to make us higher margin as we go forward. In the Q2, 64% of our volume went through automated facilities, up from 60% in the Q2 of last year.\nSo we continue to make material improvement, and those automated facilities give us more flexibility to add sorts, be more dynamic with how we manage the volume, and ultimately will help us scale more efficiently for peak, drive better cost structure as we reset the network.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nConnor, this is a big strategic pivot and the reason why we're doing this is to grow the US margin. So we are all hands on deck here to grow the US margin.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nBut I think it's another great proof point. Look, we got a proof point in we're getting the right volume into the network, we're getting more volume through automation, and ultimately, Carol, you're exactly right. That drives better long-term margins.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jordan Allinger from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah. Hi, morning. Curious. I know there's a lot of peak uncertainty out there, and perhaps customers are waiting and seeing to see what happens, and to the extent maybe that delays stuff coming in and containers on ocean ships, etc. I mean, is it possible if the consumer stays resilient that your peak season surge as people need faster air could actually give some tailwind to back half of the year or at least the Q4? Thanks.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nIt's absolutely possible. We just don't have the plans yet. I talked to a CEO recently and I said what do you think about peak? He says I'm planning to win. Which tells me that he's planning to have a pretty good peak here.\nWe will have a better sense of this, though, at the end of the Q3, at which time we will plan to give you guidance.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, great. Good morning. I guess on ground margins, maybe two parts. Carol, I think I'm a little confused on your answer to Ravi on the Amazon side where you talked about the time of facility closures relative to the attrition rate. I just want to understand though the concept. Is the volume still on target with as you expected, or it sounded like this quarter was a little lighter in terms of fading away, and so I'm just not certain. Is that changing the plans from the pace you're moving Amazon? I got the you're going to accelerate to 30%. But I just want to understand if something happens where they don't fade away, and then secondly, on the Ground Saver.\nAre you surprised that you won the business two quarters ago? Are you confident still to get to the double-digit margins? I'm just surprised in such a short timeframe from winning the contract that we're not seeing there's cost adjustments that need to be made. Maybe you could talk about that.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS",
    "content2": "All right, so on the Amazon glide down, the glide down, I'll just give you the numbers. Q1, the glide down was 600,000 pieces a day. And Q2, the glide down was 400,000 pieces a day. It was a little lighter than we had anticipated, but that's because of volume we wanted to keep. You know, as you recall, there's, we have a very complicated relationship with Amazon, and part of it is volume that we want to grow and keep, and part of it is volume that we want them to deliver.\nAnd the volume that we want to grow and keep. It was better than we anticipated. So I give that a check in the right direction. The only thing that's off is the attrition rate. And the attrition rate, we had modeled an attrition rate based on when we thought it would come in.\nIt's coming in a little bit later than we thought, but it's still going to come in. So from a full year perspective, very pleased with the Amazon slide down. Now on Ground Saver, we too had a modeled algorithm that we put into our plan regarding delivery density per stop. That algorithm did not hold. And so what we found is that we had more expense than we had anticipated in the Q2. To dimensionalize that for you, it was about $85 million. We are working on operational changes that we could make. But we also have re-engaged with the USPS. There's new leadership there. They have excess capacity, and so we're having a discussion with them. Brian, what would you like to add?\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nI think, look, we also have a very complicated relationship with the USPS as well. I want to distinguish Ground Saver, which was our former SurePost product, where we insource the volume from the USPS, from the air cargo volume that we won last year. The air cargo volume, look, it's going great, it's fully implemented. Teams work really well together. As with every relationship, there's operational stuff that we're constantly working on to make each other better. I think that's been a win for the USPS, it's been a win for us, and it's driving accretive margin. The Ground Saver, where we insource our former SurePost volume, is causing a little bit of the cost inflation.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHelpful clarification. Thank you, Brian. Thank you, Kath.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nJoe Hafling\n\nVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Good morning, this is Joe Hafling on for Stephanie Moore. Busy day for transports today, Carol. I kind of wanted to go back to peak season and understanding that, you know, we'll get more clarity as kind of the year progresses. I'm sure you've seen maybe some of the same calls that we won't see a peak season this year or that peak season already occurred with all the pre-tariff shipping. I don't know if you had any thoughts on that or if your conversations with shippers where inventory levels currently are. I know the demand picture remains uncertain, but if you could maybe help unpack kind of the puts and takes on thinking about peak season in that regard.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWe have about 100 customers that drive 80% of the surge during peak. Ordinarily, we do not get peak plans until the end of August, and then final plans at the end of September. I think they are going to be pushing them more into September as they are working through their plans. In my conversations with CEOs, no one is telling me they are not going to have a peak, but they are not in a position to dimensionalize that for us, as you can appreciate, because of all the macro issues that we are all facing.\nWe are going to be ready for whatever happens because, to Nando's point, we have more agility in our network than ever before because of the strategic pivot that we have made with our largest customer. We will be prepared up or down, will we not? Nando, what would you like to add?\n\nNando Cesarone\n\nEVP and President US, United Parcel Service\n\nWe'll be prepared if there's a volume influx or a volume reduction. Peak season for us is very variable, so we're able to scale up, scale down as quickly as possible, and those expenses don't linger once we scale down if that's what we need to do. Scaling up, not concerned that, you know, where we currently sit. Again, everything we're doing from network of the future, the scaling down on Amazon, is all feathered into our peak season plans, and it should fit quite nicely and allow us to have a really good quality service peak season as well.\n\nPJ Guido\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, UPS\n\nMatthew, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly, our final question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nJake Lacks\n\nSVP, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, this is Jake Lacks on for Scott. Thanks for your time.\nJust to confirm, are the employee buyouts included in the $3.5 billion of savings, and any early sense on how large this can be? Any updates you can provide on Efficiency Reimagined looking out into 2026, and do you think you can see a similar number as Amazon volumes continue to glide down, or does this lower attrition mean maybe there's some more limited opportunities here?\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks for the question. First of all, yes, the driver separation package is a lever for us to get to the $3.5 billion. It's a means for us to accelerate the attrition levels to get back on plan. We expect that, as Carol said, part timers will work out over time. Full timers will get them on plan. As far as Efficiency Reimagined goes, we're seeing good traction. We saw a steep ramp in the Q2. It'll ramp in the back half, and then that wraps next year. Yes, we would expect as the volume for Amazon continues to decline, Efficiency Reimagined ramps, that it will carry through a similar number to next year.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nIt's early days on the driver buyout, but so far it's progressing as we would expect. Once we have gotten it finished and we understand the dollar or number of drivers who have elected to leave us, we can tell you what the money is.\n\nJake Lacks\n\nSVP, Wolfe Research\n\nAll right, thanks for squeezing me in.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nAppreciate it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'll now turn the floor back over to your host, Mr. PJ Guido.\n\nPJ Guido\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, UPS\n\nThank you, Matthew.\nThis concludes our call. Thank you for joining, and have a great day."

My name is Matthew, and I'll be your facilitator today. I'd like to welcome everyone to the UPS First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise, and the speaker's remarks. After the speaker's remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer period. Any analyst who wants to ask a question, now is the time to press star, then one on your telephone keypad. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. P.J. Guido, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nPJ Guido\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, UPS\n\nGood morning and welcome to the UPS First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Carol Tomé, our CEO; Brian Dykes, our CFO; and a few additional members of our executive leadership team. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2024 Form 10-K and other reports we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. Unless stated otherwise, our discussion refers to adjusted results.\nFor the first quarter of 2025, GAAP results include a net charge of $83 million or $0.09 per diluted share, comprised of after-tax transformation strategy costs of $44 million, and a non-cash after-tax impairment charge of $49 million, primarily related to asset and investment impairments. These charges were partially offset by a $10 million benefit for the partial reversal of an income tax valuation allowance. A reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted amounts to GAAP financial results is available in today's webcast materials. These materials are also available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. If you wish to ask a question, press star and then one on your phone to enter the queue. Please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.\nYou may rejoin the queue for the opportunity to ask an additional question. Now I'll turn the call over to Carol.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you, PJ, and good morning. In the face of a very dynamic environment, I'm pleased with our first quarter performance. To begin, I want to thank all UPSers for delivering outstanding service to our customers. I also want to recognize the excellent progress our teams have made in executing the strategies we announced on our last earnings call. There is a lot going on at UPS and in the world, so let's move to our results. In the first quarter, our consolidated revenue was $21.5 billion, a decrease of 0.7% versus last year, and in line with our expectations. Consolidated operating profit was $1.8 billion, an increase of 0.9% compared to last year. Consolidated operating margin was 8.2%, up 20 basis points versus last year, and diluted earnings per share were $1.49, up 4.2% from last year.\nConsolidated operating profit, operating margin, and diluted earnings per share were slightly ahead of our expectations. Of note, our U.S. domestic segment increased operating profit by $164 million year-over-year and expanded operating margin by 110 basis points. While our revenue and volume in the first quarter was in line with our expectations, results by month were not. Starting with the U.S., while we expected negative ADV growth given our Amazon glide-down plan, January's ADV decline was less than expected, marked by positive average daily volume or ADV growth in certain B2B, SMB, and healthcare customers. Then, as we moved into February and March, uncertainty surrounding global trade policies and other matters led to a drop in consumer confidence and muted demand from some enterprise and SMB customers. As a result, the decline in U.S. ADV for the months of February and March was higher than we expected.\nLooking outside the U.S., demand for U.S. inbound services surged as customers pulled forward inventory purchases ahead of expected tariff changes. In response, we leveraged the flexibility of our global portfolio with the power of our next-gen brokerage technology, which helped our customers avoid border disruptions and kept their supply chains moving. As a result, in the international segment, our U.S. outbound volume increased 9.5% in Q1. In January, we announced three strategic actions to drive our business to a more profitable, agile, and differentiated UPS. Let me provide a high-level update on our progress. Let's start with our plan to accelerate the glide-down of Amazon's volume. You'll recall that we reached agreement with Amazon to reduce their volume in our network by more than 50% by June 2026. Note that the volume we are transitioning out is Amazon's fulfillment center outbound volume.\nThis volume is not profitable for us, nor a healthy fit for our network. The Amazon volume we plan to keep is profitable, and it is healthy volume. In other words, volume where we can add value, like returns and seller-fulfilled outbound volume. In the first quarter, Amazon's ADV decline ran slightly ahead of plan, but is expected to be on plan by the end of the first half of this year. The Amazon glide-down plans have been integrated into our Network of the Future initiative. We are executing the largest network reconfiguration in our history. We will optimize the capacity of our network with expected volume levels, as well as increase productivity through additional automation. With this reconfiguration, we will also lessen our dependency on labor, reduce the capital requirements needed to run the network, and will drive structural operating margin and return on invested capital improvements.\nWhile this may be the largest network reconfiguration in our history, we've got experience that gives us confidence that we will be able to complete our plans with very little customer disruption and at the right cost to serve. Over the last couple of years, we've demonstrated our ability to manage hours and labor in line with changes in volume, all while staying within the confines of our labor agreement. In 2024, we successfully closed 11 buildings, and the learnings from those closings became the blueprint for our network reconfiguration approach. We are moving very quickly. In this first phase, we will complete 164 operational closures, including 73 building closures by the end of June. There's more to come. While our building footprint is changing, our pickup and delivery footprint is not. We remain committed to providing industry-leading reliability to all customers across the country.\nWe'll just do it with fewer buildings. For our larger customers, we are working with them to update their operating plan. And for our SMBs, in the areas where we're closing buildings, UPS will still be accessible and convenient for customer drop-offs and pickups due to our network of 5,300 UPS stores, 29,000 drop boxes, and UPS access points. 90% of the U.S.. population lives within five miles of these locations, and about two-thirds of them are open on Sundays for added convenience. In a moment, Brian will provide more details on our cost out and network reconfiguration progress. Our second strategic action was the insourcing of SurePost final mile delivery. We smoothly absorbed that volume into our network and adjusted operating plans to address the additional stops associated with the final mile. Earlier this month, we replaced the SurePost product with Ground Saver.\nThis is a new and differentiated domestic economy service that balances speed and reliability for our customers while allowing significant operational flexibility for UPS. The third strategic action we announced was our Efficiency Reimagined initiative, which is designed to deliver $1 billion in savings by improving many of the ways we do business, including the elimination of manual tasks and enhancing our purchasing processes. We've made good progress here, and as planned, we expect to accelerate the benefits beginning in second quarter. Moving to our strategic growth updates, we are focused on improving revenue quality and growing in the best parts of the market, like healthcare, international, B2B, and SMB.\nLast week, we entered into an agreement to acquire Andlauer Healthcare Group, a move that will bolster our healthcare capabilities in Canada by adding 39 dedicated healthcare facilities across the country, along with cold chain packaging and specialized transportation solutions. The acquisition of Andlauer supports our goal of becoming the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world. We expect this acquisition to close in second half of 2025. Touching on SMBs, in the first quarter, SMBs, including platforms, made up 31.2% of our total U.S. volume. Looking at DAAP, our digital access program, in the first quarter, global DAAP revenue grew by 24% year-over-year. Finally, during the quarter, we reintroduced UPS Ground with Freight Pricing, which provides exceptional value for shipments weighing more than 150 pounds.\nThis positions us to be the only small package carrier that offers parcel-like pricing for less than truckload shipments, which is a true differentiator. Let's turn to a discussion about tariffs and our approach to managing through what is turning out to be a very complex and ever-changing topic. From an exposure perspective, our U.S. import volume is roughly 400,000 pieces per day, which from a volume perspective is less than 2% of our total global ADV. From a revenue perspective, last year's revenue on our China to U.S. trade lanes represented 11% of our total international revenue, and revenue from other trade lanes to the U.S. represented roughly 17% of our total international revenue. Our China to U.S. trade lanes are our most profitable trade lanes.\nIn the U.S., we've talked with our top 100 customers to understand how their business is being impacted, both directly and indirectly, by changes in trade policy. These customers have told us that they are exploring various options to address the tariffs, from absorbing the cost to pushing them into retail prices, to asking suppliers to help defray the expense. At this point, it remains an open question as to what path they will choose and what the potential impact could be on consumer demand and our business. For the rest of the world, through the middle of April, we have interviewed nearly 45,000 international and freight-forwarding customers to ascertain their shipping plans.\nFor small package shippers, over 95% of those customers have told us that they expect to maintain their current business models, while the rest are considering several options, including trade shifts, transportation mode shifts, or exiting the business. Most of these customers are also telling us that they are letting inventory levels sell off, which will lead to lower shipping activity, at least for now. Freight-forwarding customers are telling us that where they can, they are looking to move from air freight to ocean freight. From an internal exposure perspective, we've looked at our purchasing and capital plans to estimate any potential tariff-related cost increases that may come our way. Roughly $2.7 billion of our annual direct purchases are sourced outside of the U.S., with little exposure to China. From a service perspective, we are focused on making it easier for our customers to do business.\nOur next-gen brokerage capabilities make it easier for our customers to reclassify goods under Harmonized Tariff Schedule codes and clear customs easily. Our new Global Checkout product makes it known what customers will pay for duties, taxes, and fees. Using artificial intelligence, Global Checkout enables our customers to display to their customers a guaranteed landed cost, covering all duties, taxes, and fees during online checkout. This eliminates surprise import fees at delivery and provides a much better customer experience. Global Checkout is available in 43 origin countries, and UPS is the only global carrier that offers a guaranteed landed cost that's integrated into shipping and billing technology. Finally, for customers who need it, UPS provides bonded warehousing and Foreign Trade Zone-enabled solutions. Moving to our outlook, given the uncertainty in the market, there is a wide range of possible outcomes.\nWe continue to model different scenarios, but these are just scenarios. The world hasn't been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years. So the only thing we're certain of is we don't know which, if any, of our scenarios will play out. But by modeling different scenarios, we'll be able to adjust to rapid shifts in the business. Regarding our expectations for the full year, should market and economic conditions stabilize to be more in line with the assumptions we used to build our 2025 plan, we would be confident in the full-year outlook we provided in January. Given today's level of uncertainty, however, we are not providing any updates to our consolidated full-year outlook at this time. We think instead it's prudent to focus on what we can control and continue to execute against our strategic and financial goals.\nToday, we're providing second-quarter guidance based on April results and our expectations for the balance of the quarter. Once we are through the second quarter, we will hopefully have more clarity about tariffs and trade and the implications for demand dynamics, and we'll provide an update at that point. In the face of uncertainty, there are some notes. We are confident in our position as a trusted leader in global logistics. And with the agility of our integrated network, our broad reach, our portfolio of services, and our proven trade expertise, we are well-positioned to enable our customers to navigate a changing trade environment. Further, the strategic actions we launched in January to reconfigure our network and reduce costs across the business could not be timelier. The environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS.\nWith that, thank you for listening. Now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThank you, Carol, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll cover three areas, starting with our first-quarter results, including cash and shareholder returns. I'll provide more detail on our cost out and network reconfiguration progress as we reduce the volume we deliver for Amazon. Lastly, I'll touch on tariffs and trade policy changes and comment on our outlook for 2025. Starting with our consolidated performance. In the first quarter, we generated $21.5 billion in revenue, a decline of 0.7% compared to the first quarter of last year. Consolidated operating profit was $1.8 billion, an increase of 0.9% versus the first quarter of 2024. Consolidated operating margin was 8.2%, an increase of 20 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year.\nDiluted earnings per share was $1.49, up 4.2% from the first quarter of 2024. Now moving to our segment performance. As Carol mentioned, while volume and revenue performance in the quarter were in line with our expectations, our monthly performance was not. In U.S. domestic, following a strong January relative to our expectations, uncertainty in the market began impacting consumer behavior. Demand shifted down in February, falling further than our expectations and normal shipping patterns, and remained at that level in March. For the quarter, total U.S. ADV was down 3.5%. Ground average daily volume decreased 2.5% year-over-year, and total air average daily volume was down 9.6%. Excluding the volume decline from Amazon, total air ADV grew 6.2%, driven by demand from healthcare and high-tech customers.\nWithin Ground, our new economy product called Ground Saver, which replaced SurePost, had an ADV decline of 8.4%, primarily due to pricing actions we took to grow yields on e-commerce volume. This is the first ADV decline we've seen in this product in five quarters as we have leaned into revenue quality. For the quarter, B2B average daily volume was up 1.5% compared to last year. Growth was driven by returns, which increased 8.8% year-over-year. We also saw ADV strength from healthcare and high-tech customers. B2C average daily volume decreased 7% year-over-year, driven by our managed decline in volume from Amazon, our focus on revenue quality, and some demand softness. In terms of customer mix, we saw strong ADV growth from SMB customers of 4%. In the first quarter, SMBs made up 31.2% of total U.S. volume.\nThis is the highest SMB concentration we've seen in 10 years, and it is driving meaningful change in overall volume and revenue quality. Moving to revenue, for the first quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $14.5 billion, up 1.4% compared to last year, driven by increases in air cargo. In first quarter, revenue per piece increased 4.5% year-over-year, which was the strongest revenue per piece growth rate we've seen in eight quarters, and it partially offset declines in volume. Breaking down the components of the 4.5% revenue per piece improvement, the combination of base rates and package characteristics increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 240 basis points. The net impact of customer mix and product mix increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 170 basis points. Lastly, fuel drove a 40 basis point increase in the revenue per piece growth rate.\nTurning to costs, total expense increased 0.2%, including an increase in air cargo. We continued to drive efficiency in the quarter as we reduced purchased transportation costs from insourcing 100% of Ground Saver volume for final mile delivery, partially offsetting the increase in delivery costs. We lowered small package block hours within our air network in response to the changing volume levels. These cost reductions were partially offset by expenses related to challenging weather. In the first quarter, cost per piece increased 3.7%. U.S. domestic segment delivered $1 billion in operating profit, a 19.4% increase compared to the first quarter of 2024. Operating margin was 7%, a year-over-year increase of 110 basis points. Moving to our international segment, we leveraged the agility of our integrated global network to navigate this period of uncertainty and grew international average daily volume for the second consecutive quarter.\nTotal international ADV increased 7.1%, with all regions growing average daily volume versus last year. International domestic average daily volume increased 4.8% compared to last year, led by Canada. On the export side, average daily volume increased 9.3% year-over-year. Asia and Europe delivered double-digit export growth throughout the quarter. And at a country level, 15 of our top 20 export countries grew export ADV. In the first quarter, international revenue was $4.4 billion, up 2.7% from last year, as we expected. Revenue per piece declined year-over-year due to a stronger U.S. dollar and lower demand-related surcharges. Operating profit in the international segment was $654 million, down 4.1% year-over-year due to a mixed shift to more economy services in Europe, lower demand-related surcharges, and investments we are making to expand weekend services in Europe. International operating margin in the first quarter was 15%.\nMoving to supply chain solutions. In the first quarter, revenue was $2.7 billion. Revenue decreased $471 million, driven by a reduction of $563 million in revenue from Coyote due to our divestiture of this business in 2024. Within supply chain solutions, air and ocean forwarding revenue was flat the last year. Air freight revenue was slightly lower year-over-year due to lower volume, which was more than offset by higher market rates in ocean. Core logistics grew revenue by 5.1%. UPS Digital, including ROE and Happy Returns, grew revenue 32.5% year-over-year. In the first quarter, supply chain solutions generated operating profit of $98 million. Operating margin was 3.6%, a decline of 320 basis points compared to last year, primarily driven by cost pressure in our Mail Innovations business. This is a postal injection product, and our contract with U.S.PS expired at the end of 2024.\nThe new rates from the U.S.PS are causing short-term cost pressure, which we expect to address as we make adjustments to that business. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $222 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $37 million, which was higher than we anticipated due to updated expected return on asset assumptions. Our effective tax rate for first quarter was approximately 22.5%. Turning to cash and shareholder returns, in first quarter, we generated $2.3 billion in cash from operations. Free cash flow for the period was $1.5 billion. Also, in first quarter, UPS paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders, and we repurchased $1 billion of our shares, completing our share repurchase target for the year. Now, let me provide an update on our cost out and network reconfiguration efforts.\nAs we've discussed, we are reducing the amount of volume we deliver for Amazon by more than 50% by June of 2026. Associated with this volume reduction, we are undertaking the largest network reconfiguration in our history. This effort has been combined with our Network of the Future initiative, as both will help drive us to a more efficient network. The first phase of our network reconfiguration includes 164 operational closures, including 73 building closures by the end of June of this year. There's more to come. These actions will enable us to expand our U.S. domestic Operating Margin and increase profitability. Our reconfiguration plan is comprehensive and includes everything from closing buildings, reducing positions, and cutting support costs through Efficiency Reimagined. To help you track along with our progress, we've grouped associated costs into three buckets.\nFirst is variable cost, which captures operational hours and flexes down quickly with volume. Second is semi-variable cost, which is represented by operational positions and will also be adjusted to match volume levels. Third is fixed cost, which includes closing buildings and reducing expense from support functions, both of which have specific completion dates assigned. Our network reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined program is aligned with our anticipated Amazon volume reduction in 2025 and is expected to remove $3.5 billion in expense this year. Splitting the savings between our three cost buckets, approximately 35% of our cost reduction will come from variable cost, about 35% will come from semi-variable, and about 30% will come from savings and fixed costs. Now, let me walk you through some of the details and how progress accelerates through the year. Starting with the pace of Amazon's volume decline.\nIn the first quarter, Amazon ADV was down 16% year-over-year, which was more than we originally planned. Second quarter, Amazon ADV is also anticipated to be down 16%, which is less than we originally planned. Looking at the first and second quarters together, our total expected Amazon decline for the first half of 2025 is on track. In the back half of this year, the ADV decline is expected to be approximately 30% in each of the third and fourth quarters. Looking at variable cost, this year, associated with the Amazon volume decline, we plan to reduce total operational hours by approximately 25 million hours. Our reduction in hours was on track through the first quarter. Moving to semi-variable cost, our operational reduction target for 2025 is around 20,000 positions.\nPosition changes are not only connected to the buildings we are closing, but will also be made across the entire U.S. network. Our planned reductions are in line with the total Amazon volume decline, and our semi-variable cost out efforts were on track through the first quarter. In our fixed cost bucket, we expect to close 73 buildings by the end of June. About 2/3 of the buildings we are closing are in the eastern part of the country, with the remainder in the west. As an engineering-driven company, we've developed a detailed checklist for each building closure to ensure that we continue to provide industry-leading service to our customers, assist our employees through these changes, and leverage our network planning tools and other technology to efficiently process volume in our network.\nAnd lastly, as Carol mentioned, our Efficiency Reimagined initiatives that are redesigning many end-to-end processes, like procurement and customer onboarding, are underway, and we expect to accelerate these savings starting in second quarter. We are pleased with the progress we made in first quarter with our cost out and network reconfiguration efforts related to the accelerated glide-down of Amazon volume. And we are on track to achieve our 2025 cost reduction target of $3.5 billion. Now, turning to guidance for 2025, the macro environment is highly uncertain due to changing trade policy and tariff uncertainty. As a global carrier, the eventual outcomes could result in pressure in some parts of our business and create new opportunities in others. We've modeled several different scenarios for how the balance of the year might play out so that we can quickly pivot, continue supporting our customers, and lean into growth.\nAnd as Carol mentioned, we're also closely monitoring our direct exposure related to our purchasing and capital plans. Today, I'll provide you with our outlook for the second quarter. We are not providing any updates to our consolidated full-year outlook until there's more certainty in the macro environment. Let's start with our assumptions for the second quarter. In our international business, we have factored in announced tariffs and changes to de minimis exemptions. We also expect weakening demand on the China to U.S. trade lane will be partially offset by two factors. First is growth on China to non-U.S. lanes, and second is growth from the rest of the world inbound to the U.S.. In our U.S. domestic business, we have included our expectations for the impact of volume and mix from the current levels of consumer demand.\nAnd lastly, we are implementing changes with how we process volume within our Mail Innovations business. In second quarter, on a consolidated basis, revenue is expected to be approximately $21 billion, and operating margin is expected to be approximately 9.3%. In the U.S., in second quarter, we expect ADV to be down about 9% and revenue to be down low single digits compared to last year. SMBs will be disproportionately impacted by the uncertain environment, which will add some pressure to operating margins. We expect the U.S. domestic operating margin to expand by approximately 30 basis points compared to last year. Turning to international, we expect revenue to be down approximately 2% to last year and operating margin to be in the mid-teens due to lower demand-related surcharges and trade uncertainty.\nAnd in Supply Chain Solutions, in the second quarter, revenue is expected to decline approximately $500 million due to the reduction in revenue associated with Coyote in the same period last year. Operating margin is anticipated to be in the high single digits. And finally, in the second quarter, in total below the line, we expect approximately $160 million in expense, and we expect the tax rate to be between 23% and 23.5%. In closing, I'll note that this uncertain environment reinforces why we've taken action to reshape our volume mix, pull cost out, and reconfigure our U.S. network. We are focusing on controlling what we can control and executing our strategy to improve the long-term profitability of our U.S. business, drive cash generation, and deliver shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the lines for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll now conduct a question-and-answer session.\nIf you have any questions or comments, please press star one on your phone at this time. We do ask that while posing your question, please pick up your handset if you're listening on speakerphone to provide optimum sound quality. Our first question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Sir, please go ahead with your question.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYes, good morning. Thanks for the question. Wanted to see if you could give a sense of, I guess, the cost, how much of the $3.5 billion full-year cost kind of comes through, and how does it build through the year? And then is that like a full offset to the reduction in Amazon revenue or kind of more or less? So maybe it's more on that. I don't know if you want to offer a thought on how that flows into 2026 as well.\nMaybe that's asking too much, but if you have kind of a similar number in 2026 or more or less. So more on the Amazon cost takeout in $3.5 billion would be great. Thank you.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nSure. Thanks, Tom. Yeah, so on the $3.5 billion, if you think about it in the buckets that we laid out, right, the variable cost is going to come out in line with the Amazon volume, right, as we kind of laid it out. The semi-variable cost is generally going to follow the same pattern. The fixed cost, what we described is we will be closing 73 buildings in second quarter. So there's more fixed cost, about 60% of it is weighted towards the back half. Efficiency Reimagined is also in that and is also about 60% in the back half.\nSo you think across those three buckets, generally the first two will follow Amazon volume and the others will be back half weighted.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThe Amazon volume decline is higher in the back half of the year than it is in the first half.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nCorrect. As we laid out, it's about 16% in the first half, 30% in the second half.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nLooking to 2026?\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nIn 2026, look, we will wrap because remember, in the Amazon glide out, it's over the course of 18 months. So in the first half of 2026, there will be incremental, both variable, semi-variable, and fixed cost reductions that will lay out as we get into the back half of the years. Those will be incremental to the $3.5 billion that's in 2025.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nSo do we think of it as kind of an exact match or do you take out more cost than the revenue you lose?\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nWell, I think if you look at what we talk about with the revenue and the cost that we're taking out, we are making structural changes to the business to improve the margin. Tom, I think we talked about the revenue that we're losing was non-nutritive to the business, and so we are taking out more cost.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThe one thing I would add is on Efficiency Reimagined. That's really not tied to the Amazon volume decline. That's about making our business more productive. And how does that play out?\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah. So Efficiency Reimagined is all about making processes more efficient within the business.\nAnd so as we do that, we will also be taking out about $500 million this year, rolling to $1 billion into 2026 that is going to be back half weighted in 2025, but will be incremental to the piece that's just directly related to the Amazon volume. It is included in the fixed cost bucket that we laid out, but it's about process redesign around restructuring of the business.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks for the time.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from Ari Rosa from Citigroup. Your line is live.\n\nAri Rosa\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHi, good morning. Carol, you mentioned this objective of being less dependent on labor going forward. I think there was a headline we saw the other day that you were testing out robotics and leveraging more warehouse automation. Could you just talk about those efforts and how that fits into the Efficiency Reimagined initiative?\nWhat kind of cost savings do you expect to realize from that over the longer term? Thanks.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, as part of our Network of the Future initiative, we are looking at automating our buildings by automating the sort, but there's much more to automation than just automating the sort. We're also looking at the use of robotics for automatic label application, many other automatic opportunities, unloading and loading trailers, as well as how we sort packages in certain of our functions. And maybe I'll turn to Nando for a little more comment on that.\n\nNando Cesarone\n\nEVP and President U.S., UPS\n\nYeah, sure. So what you're going to see at the end of this is 400 facilities that are either partially or fully automated.\nOn top of that, we're working ahead of ourselves, as new automation technology, the application of AI in certain areas to help us with labor, is introduced into these operations, and that allows us to really take cost out of the network. And also, the end state is 200 facilities that will be closed in our network. And of course, as we work through this, we're creating capacity for ourselves through the productivity improvements. And again, as we look at this, we've developed really good muscle here, and we're moving at a speed that we're all really happy with. But the end result will be a much more efficient operation with less dependency on labor. And as we grow and scale up, that's going to continue to provide benefits for UPS.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nAnd so that activity, coupled with our Amazon activity, gives us confidence that we'll reach that 12% U.S..\noperating margin by the end of 2026.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThat's right. And I would say, as Carol and Nando have articulated, we're not stopping, right? So while we're drawing down less efficient capacity, we're automating at the same time. We told you in the fourth quarter that 63% of our volume went through automated hubs. That's now at 64%, which is up about 4.5% year-over-year. And so we're moving towards a more efficient, more scalable network faster.\n\nAri Rosa\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is live.\n\nScott Group\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. So I just want to understand of the $3.5 billion, how much has been realized to date in Q1? And then when I look at Q1 margins domestically improved 110 basis points, I think you said second quarter only 30 basis points.\nIs that a function of more macro getting worse, or is that, I guess, why are we seeing a deceleration in the margin improvement in Q2, as I would imagine the cost savings are ramping?\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nSure. So Scott, just to hit on the first point, about $500 million of the $3.5 billion is in Q1. And like I said, that will ramp as both the Amazon volume comes out as well as our initiatives ramp as we go through Q2. There's a couple of things happening in Q2. The first is we have, as we outlined, we built into our guide the expectation from our customers of what the announced tariffs will be, right? The net impact of that is that we do see some volume deceleration in both enterprise and SMB, particularly in SMBs.\nThey do not have the tools to deal with the changes that our enterprise customers do. That will put some pressure on RPP and margin. The second piece I would add is, look, we're closing 7% of our U.S. buildings in the quarter, right? So we have built in some chaos costs in order to manage the volume and maintain service as we go through that process.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nMaybe just a little bit more color on the SMBs. Many of our SMBs, as we talk to them, are 100% single sourced from China. This is causing so much uncertainty in the marketplace because the administration has announced, as you know, a 145% tariff on China goods starting May 2nd and the elimination of the de minimis exception.\nSo our SMBs who don't have the working capital capabilities to pull forward inventory are saying, \"Wow, how are we going to handle this cost increase that's coming our way?\" It doesn't mean that they're not trying to look for alternate forms of supply. They're working with original equipment manufacturers trying to move to other countries. But as you can appreciate, the large companies get to take the first phone call, and they're the ones that are willing to work on changing supply chains. So we just want to factor that into our forecast for Q2. Understanding candidly, there's so much uncertainty around the China tariffs. We know it's been announced. We don't know actually if it will happen. We don't know if it will stick. There are many things we don't know, but we thought it was prudent to factor that into our view.\n\nScott Group\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nYour next question is coming from Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, hi. Realizing the tariff stuff and supply chains are a bit of a moving target right now. Any updates on sort of your secular viewpoint for domestic and international volume growth, sort of factoring out Amazon now that you're reducing it and maybe contemplating, I don't know, shifts in supply chains moving away from China, rest of the world? I know you'd given some thoughts on that at your investor day a while back. Any updates given all the noise that's going on right now? Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, Jordan, you're right. It's a very uncertain market. But if we go back to the beginning of the year, the small package industry in the United States was expected to be very low single-digit growing from a volume perspective.\nIf you look at value, including GRI increases, again, low single digit. Outside of the U.S., it's a big addressable market. We size the market outside the United States as $99 billion. And it was expected to be growing in the mid-single digits. Including in that $99 billion is about $18 billion of healthcare, which was expected to grow in the high single digits. And all of those growth projections were as of the beginning of the year. Healthcare continues to be a bit isolated from this. We had good healthcare growth. Healthcare is reflected in all three of our operating segments. We had good healthcare growth in the first quarter. If you look at average daily net revenue, which adjusts for one less operating day, it was up nearly 5% year on year. So we were pleased with that performance.\nWhat I'm happy about from a UPS perspective is because of our presence in over 200 countries and territories around the world, we can move where supply chains move. They're going to move. We know they're going to move. We can move where they move. We've got a proof point. If we go back to 2018, when China tariffs were imposed, we saw trade move. China to U.S. declined, but China, the rest of the world increased. It all leveled out. Our international business actually grew. Because of our integrated network and our presence, we'll be able to manage through this.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is live.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nVice President and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nSo Brian, maybe just to clarify, if we take the $3.5 million of cost savings that we're going to get this year, can you just give us an annualized number of what that would look like for 2026? And then my question is really around the domestic side of the business with the SurePost insourcing. You guys put a pretty healthy price increase in there. Could you give us a sense for whether you're seeing any book away or any sort of movement away in volume for stuff that you would have wanted to keep in that insourcing or whether those pricing gains are actually sticking in there? Thank you.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah. So Dave, on the first point, so the $3.5 billion is an end year 2025 number.\nI would expect a similar number as we do a kind of a similar type drawdown into 2026. But we'll clarify that as we go later into the year. On the Ground Saver volume, so we have seen Ground Saver decline. It's down about 8.5% in the quarter. But I will say the majority of that has been intentional decline with specific customers as we both adjust the cost structure to now an insourced model and the new product, as well as we lean into revenue quality. So there has been some intentional decline of less nutritious business.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nAnd we would expect to see that in Q2 as well.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nVice President and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nBut you're not seeing any sort of additional churn or turnover from the competition with the post office?\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nOkay. We're not.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nAnd maybe it's a little more color there.\nThat's one reason why we insourced it, because of the reliability that we provide to our customers. Our on-time in the delivery was almost 97% in first quarter.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from Chris Wetherbee from Wells Fargo. Your line is live.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nManaging Director and Head of Transportation & Shipping Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe a question on international. I think you noted for second quarter, mid-teens margins, I guess also that the China-U.S. lane was the most profitable. Just want to get a sense. Is this sort of the right profitability level for the business going forward, assuming things don't change materially on the tariff side with China? Just kind of get a sense of maybe if there's specific items impacting second quarter or is this more of a run rate just given what the trade looks like in second quarter?\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah.\nSo in second quarter, there's a couple of moving pieces here because, as Carol mentioned, trade flows are shifting, and that's what we anticipate as well. So I outlined in my prepared remarks how we think about the move in international. We expect China to the U.S. to decline a little less than 25%, but that's going to be offset by material improvements in China to the rest of the world and the rest of the world to the U.S.. So there's some shifting trade lanes that we're anticipating in the second quarter guide that we expect to see. Now, what that means is China to the U.S. is our most profitable trade lane. There will be a little bit of profit headwind. Look, longer term, we expect international to get back to this mid to high teens margin as a long-term margin.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nI think the first quarter margin was suppressed a bit because of investments we're making in Europe for weekend delivery. We will lap those investments later in the year, so that will give us margin expansion at that point. We really like the volume that we're seeing as we provide that weekend service for our customers. So this is a good investment that we made.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nManaging Director and Head of Transportation & Shipping Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Your line is live.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, great. So maybe just digging in on that international side, the de minimis impact and kind of the flow through, and then maybe the sensitivity. Carol, you mentioned kind of the postponing of shipments from the small shippers. Is this something you think we're drawing?\nIt sounded like Brian said we're drawing down inventories that we should expect some sort of snapback once these tariffs are settled. Is that kind of how you're thinking about kind of the pace of goods? Just want to understand because you're giving us 2Q thoughts. You pulled the full year just thinking about how quick we could see that reverse and maybe as policy is set.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYeah. So the real point of uncertainty is this China tariff matter. We're hoping to have that clearer by the end of second quarter. The de minimis implications means that for China imports, they will be charged duties and tariffs for $800 or less. That hadn't been the case before. So we have factored that into our outlook for our SMBs because they could be impacted by this. We think they will be impacted by this.\nBut in terms of clearing goods across the borders, we are well positioned to do that. In fact, we clear goods without manual intervention about 85% of the time. So we're in great shape to be able to clear these goods if more items are coming through with tariffs identified on them. What else would you want to add to that, Brian?\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nI think what you're outlining are some of the scenarios that we've been running. Time is a big factor here on when this gets resolved. The final levels is a big factor here. And ultimately, how our customers end up dealing with it from a price or a margin standpoint. So those are a lot of the things that we're looking at. That's why there's so much uncertainty in the back half because all those will ultimately impact the U.S..\nconsumer, and we're trying to help our customers deal with it.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, current consumer sentiment is down from where it was at the beginning of the year. The consumer is still pretty healthy. And so to your question about, well, if inventory levels are being drawn down, will it snap back? Well, commerce needs to continue. So one would assume that it will come back, may come back from a different country as importers change their source of origin. But we're prepared to handle that given our breadth and our presence.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThat's right.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nI guess if I can just clarify, maybe what I'm confused at is international seems to be kind of in line with the street, but U.S., that's where the change seems to be made.\nI just want to make sure that's the message you're sending because that's down maybe a bit more, 300 basis points more than where expectations were.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah. So Ken, yes, you're right. Because in international, remember, as we said, there's going to be some offsetting trade flows here that help the international business balance the China to the U.S. trade lane. But ultimately, where a lot of the uncertainty lies is what's the impact to the U.S. customer base?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nSo Kate, maybe you could give some more color on what we mean by these trade shifts. For example, China Plus One and what you're seeing with these new countries.\n\nKate Gutmann\n\nEVP and President International of Healthcare and Supply Chain Solutions, UPS\n\nYeah, absolutely. So just to bring it to life, the export out of the non-China Hong Kong lane is up double digits from the remainder of the countries.\nA lot of that has to do with the investments that the company made three years ago to really unlock the right to win in that space. And then all regions around the world grew the export. So we are seeing the shift occur. Carol mentioned the 44,000 customers that we interviewed on their supply chains. We're helping SMBs try to move their manufacturing sourcing to, for instance, Mexico, so that down the road, they would have sourced more near to the U.S.. But it is the rest of the world is growing. I'll give South Korea one shout-out. We talk about our complex healthcare focus as well as international. It's a great market where they both come together, and it's growing 24% export. So it shows that commerce keeps going, health keeps going, and we are positioned with our global network to catch it.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nSo hopefully that helps, Ken.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYeah, definitely helps. Appreciate the thoughts. Thanks, guys.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jason Seidel from TD Cowen. Your line is live.\n\nJason Seidl [Managing Director, Industrials\n\nAirfreight & Surface Transportation Research Analyst] (TD Cowen)\n\nThank you, operator. Hey, Carol, hey, Brian, and team. Thanks for all the thoughtful data points and feedbacks here that you've provided today. I wanted to focus a little bit on you talked about 95% of your customers said they're sort of maintaining their outlook, but will sort of draw down inventories for the moment. So it's sort of a two-part question. Number one, what does that do to volumes when your customers are drawing down inventories? And number two, how long do you think they have in terms of an inventory drawdown so we could sort of level set expectations?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, it depends on the importer. Some importers were buying ahead 30 days, 60 days, 90 days.\nYou can imagine that the larger importers, which would be the larger retailers, were doing that 30, 60, 90 days. Don't think it goes much beyond that because there's no capacity to hold the inventory. When we say 95% have started to change or not change their business model, it means they're not changing how they ship their products to the United States. So that, I think, is encouraging to us because they're not thinking about exiting the business. They're going to stay in the business. They're going to let inventory levels roll down. They're going to hope to have certainty on China, and then they'll decide what they do going forward.",
    "content2": "Jason Seidl [Managing Director, Industrials\n\nAirfreight & Surface Transportation Research Analyst] (TD Cowen)\n\nOn a roll down in inventory, that would put pressure on your volumes, at least for the near term.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nBut again, remember, trade lanes are shifting.\nSo that means trade from China to U.S., they will move to other trade lanes. So as Brian just shared with you, we're not expecting a big difference in our international business in the second quarter.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nNo, no. Jason, as I mentioned before, so we expect just under 25% decline in China to the U.S.. That's offset by a 40% increase in China to the rest of the world, right? And so we're seeing these things shift because manufacturers in China are not slowing down. They're shifting where the goods are going.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nAnd they're providing incentives to make that happen to their Chinese companies.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYep.\n\nJason Seidl [Managing Director, Industrials\n\nAirfreight & Surface Transportation Research Analyst] (TD Cowen)\n\nAnd Brian, as it shifts to sort of a China Plus One, I guess, outlook there, do you need to shift some costs around to handle increased business, or do you have capacity in some of those other areas?\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nSo we manage our network on a variable basis like that all the time. That's core to work at UPS, is shifting the assets around to flex where our customers need us to be. And that's part of having a globally integrated network. We can clear it. We can move it. We can deliver it in any country in the world where you need us.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nAnd as air volume comes down in the United States, it frees up lift for outside of the United States. So the power of the integrated network is really helpful in this ever-changing environment.\n\nJason Seidl [Managing Director, Industrials\n\nAirfreight & Surface Transportation Research Analyst] (TD Cowen)\n\nAppreciate the color and thanks for the time as always.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Your line is live.\n\nStephanie Moore\n\nSenior Vice President Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you. Actually, maybe a continuation on that last question and conversation.\nAnd normally, I would never ask this at the end of April, but maybe as you speak to your customers and they think about peak season, have you had any conversations with how they would look to prepare, especially in the light of kind of what we just discussed and the drawing down of inventory and taking a bit of a wait-and-see approach? But at some point, do we get to the point where there could be a bit of a squeeze here into the summer months as we start to prepare for kind of peak season shipments? And what could still be a pretty disrupted supply chain environment? So any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYeah. I think your question is actually quite timely because most retailers would have to put orders in now for peak.\nAnd so we are starting to talk to our customers to understand what their plans are. Remember, we deal with very large enterprise retailers who have the financial wherewithal to manage through tariffs. Smaller retailers, we've heard anecdotally that some of them are rethinking their peak holiday orders. But those are smaller retailers. For us, from an exposure perspective, I think we're in a pretty good place. But we will continue to have those ongoing discussions given the uncertainty we have with the China tariffs. That's why it will be so helpful to have that resolved, however it gets resolved. Brian, any color you can?\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nAnd Stephanie, I think, again, this hits on uncertainty and scenarios, right? Because there's a scenario where it gets resolved, orders go in. There's one where it gets delayed, things move from ocean to air, which is good for us, right?\nWe're able to flex our network to help people fulfill peak orders, right? There's others where it gets pushed even further, and we see supply shocks. We're looking at all those different scenarios so we can move as quickly as we can and pivot the business.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nOur peak planning has already begun. Right now, it's about scenarios, isn't it, Nando?\n\nNando Cesarone\n\nEVP and President U.S., UPS\n\nYes.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWe're thinking about various scenarios on how we will be prepared to deliver another great peak.\n\nNando Cesarone\n\nEVP and President U.S., UPS\n\nYeah. It actually will work out in the end. When you think about peak season, we put out a lot of variable costs. It's not a cost that goes on forever in terms of hiring helpers, temporary employees. We charter aircraft or lease aircraft during peak season. Those would be considerations we make as we see the volume unfold, whether we need those resources or not. Or not. Yeah.\n\nStephanie Moore\n\nSenior Vice President Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGreat.\nWell, I appreciate the time. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan. Your line is live.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe just one follow-up and then a question on capital allocation. Just on the pivot to the China Plus One strategy, how quickly do you think the supply chain can really do that, especially with some of the SMBs? And are you seeing a big offset there? I think Brian mentioned China to the rest of the world, but what about the rest of the world to the U.S.? And then also for Brian, could you just run us through capital allocation priorities, maybe the cash cost for restructuring with this plan underway? Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nSo rest of the world to U.S., remember, it's 17% of our international revenue, 3% of our total revenue.\nSo from an exposure perspective, this is manageable exposure. Kate, what are you seeing in rest of the world to the U.S.?\n\nKate Gutmann\n\nEVP and President International of Healthcare and Supply Chain Solutions, UPS\n\nYeah. So we are seeing that we've got the growth out of Europe, for instance, to the U.S., in the exports growing very nicely in a high single-digit factor. We're seeing Asia, Vietnam, Thailand also to the U.S. growing exports near double digits. So I would tell you that it's shifting. It's already occurring. So to your point about the manufacturing and how fast, that's Carol's point about there's planning underway. The SMBs are looking at how they could source from manufacturing. The big companies get the first slot, basically, of these manufacturers. And the SMBs are working through where they would, how they would go to nearshoring. I love the China plus analogy because this is basically the continuation of that, but magnified.\nThe world is shifting already. And again, that double-digit growth that I'm emphasizing is the proof point tied to that.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nAnd I think it's important to remember rest of world is really a 10% universal tariff. So it's China that's the real uncertainty, I think, facing the economy. It's rest of world 10% is a manageable tariff.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThat's right. And just to put a pin in before I hit on capital structure, Kate mentioned the investments we made before. They really helped facilitate this. And we're continuing to do that with air expansions in Cork and Taiwan, and continued investment in nearshoring. All these things are going to help us manage tariffs not only today, but get better as we go into the future. So I think they all set us up for long-term benefit. Hitting, Brian, on your point around capital allocation, no change to our capital allocation policies.\nSo I think we feel very comfortable where the balance sheet is. We're at 2.26x debt to EBITDA, which is below our 2.5% target. We closed the year with $5 billion in cash on balance sheet. None of our CP on our $3 billion program is issued, so plenty of liquidity. So we feel very good about cash generation in the year coming, balance sheet strength, and liquidity. On the charges associated with the restructuring plans, think about it as about 60% cash, 40% non-cash. But I will tell you, remember, that number is going to continue to be updated as we work through the year and we work through additional assets that will be taken down. And when we roll into H1 2026 and we take kind of the second tranche out.\n\nPJ Guido\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, UPS\n\nMatthew, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks for covering all that.\nThank you. No worries. Certainly. Our final question comes from Bruce Chan from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector of Transportation, Stifel\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. And thanks for all the helpful color here. Maybe just a broader question. If I'm not to be a negative Nancy, but if I start to think about potential recessionary scenarios, we've had periods of decelerating volumes on uncertain macro to look back to. But as far as I'm aware, never one where you've been undertaking such a big network realignment. Does that reduce your flexibility or optionality in terms of responding to lower macro demand, maybe, for example, taking down transpacific flights or flexing labor down even more within the confines of your labor agreement? Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nI actually think we're adding more agility and nimbleness to our business than we ever have.\nIf you think about the volume that we're gliding down from Amazon, 60% of the volume that we're gliding down is not profitable for us. By gliding that down, we actually give ourselves financial flexibility to address other scenarios that might come our way. So while we have a lot to do to make this happen, we're building in flexibility and agility that we've never had before, being so dependent on that one customer for volume and growth. So we are working through a number of scenarios, aren't we, Brian? We are. We're going as dark as we can and as optimistic as we can. And through all the scenarios, I've seen nothing but ways that we can manage through.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThat's right.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nTell us that you'd like to add.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nSo look, we outlined that we're going to be exiting 164 operations and 73 facilities by the end of June.\nThere's another approximately 50 that we're evaluating after that. And we'll continue to look at that. So I think it's important that, look, we're building a muscle here. And we're building a muscle that's going to allow us to flex the network in a new way that we've done before. The second piece is, I would say, as we consolidate to a more automated network, it gives us better efficiency with how we manage the volume to flex both up and down. And so we feel that even in those scenarios where the volume comes down even more, we're going to be in a more efficient network, and we've got the ability to go deeper on how we manage the cost in order to offset it.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nAnd just maybe one other thought.\nOne reason we're so focused on healthcare, complex healthcare, is it is a recessionary group, and it's going to grow. So this differentiates us from just delivering a sweater in a box. It's complex logistics. It's the future of our company. So we're committed to continuing to make inorganic growth acquisitions like the Andlauer announcement, as well as the growth of core business, positioning UPS for their future.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector of Transportation, Stifel\n\nGreat. Really helpful. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'll now turn the floor back over to your host, Mr. P.J. Guido.\n\nPJ Guido\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, UPS\n\nThank you, Matthew. This concludes our call. Thank you for joining, and have a great day."

My name is Greg Alexander, and I will be your facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise, and after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer period. Any analyst that wants to ask a question, now is the time to press 1 and 0 on your telephone keypad. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. P.J. Guido, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nP.J. Guido\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, UPS\n\nGood morning and welcome to the UPS fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Carol Tomé, our CEO, Brian Dykes, our CFO, and a few additional members of our executive leadership team. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which are described in our 2023 Form 10-K and other reports we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS investor relations website and from the SEC. Now let me share a reporting change we've made between business segments.\nEffective with the fourth quarter of 2024, USPS Air Cargo results have been moved from Supply Chain Solutions to the US Domestic segment. We made this change to align with our management structure and to simplify intercompany allocations and reporting. This change is visible in the web schedules that have been posted on the UPS investor relations website. Note that US Domestic revenue per piece, and cost per piece metrics are not impacted by this change as USPS transacts with us on a weight basis, not on a per piece basis. Unless stated otherwise, our discussion today refers to non-GAAP adjusted results.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024 GAAP results include a non-cash after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $506 million, total after-tax transformation strategy costs of $73 million, after-tax asset impairment charges of $46 million, and an after-tax cost related to the withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan of $14 million. The after-tax total for these items is $639 million or $0.74 per diluted share. Additional details regarding year-end pension charges are included in the appendix of our fourth quarter 2024 earnings presentation that is posted to the UPS investor relations website. A reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted amounts to GAAP financial results is available in today's webcast materials. These materials are also available on the UPS investor relations website. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference.\nIf you wish to ask a question, press 1 and then 0 on your phone to enter the queue. Please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. You may rejoin the queue for the opportunity to ask an additional question. Now I'll turn the call over to Carol.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you, P.J., and good morning. We have a lot to cover today. I'll begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year results. Then I'll provide an overview of the moves we are taking in 2025 to drive our performance. Brian will wrap up our prepared remarks with more detail about our financial performance and our 2025 outlook, and will leave plenty of time for questions. But first let me start by thanking UPSers for their hard work and efforts as we executed another outstanding peak. For the seventh year in a row, we were the industry leader in on-time service during peak season, the most important time of the year for our customers. In the face of a compressed holiday period, our people, enabled by the agility of our integrated network, did what they do best and that's deliver for our customers.\nMoving to our results, the positive momentum we saw in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter. Compared to last year, consolidated fourth quarter revenue increased 1.5% to $25.3 billion. Operating profit was $3.1 billion, an increase of 11.2% from last year, better than we expected, and consolidated operating margin was 12.3%. Importantly, our US domestic operating margin was over 10% for the quarter, reflecting improved revenue quality and strong expense control.\nLooking at the full year, consolidated revenue was $91.1 billion, slightly above last year. Consolidated operating profit totaled $8.9 billion, and consolidated operating margin was 9.8%. We generated $10.1 billion in cash from operations in 2024, and we returned $5.9 billion to share owners in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Before I discuss our plans for 2025, let me share a few operational and financial highlights. In 2024, we continue to grow our US SMB penetration and finished the year with SMBs making up 28.9% of our total US volume, an increase of 30 basis points from last year. DAP, our Digital Access Program, was a big driver of the increase, and in 2024 we generated $3.3 billion in global DAP revenue, a 17% increase year over year.\nAs we've discussed, we are moving from a scanning network to a sensing network through our Smart Package Smart Facility RFID initiative. In 2024, we equipped nearly 60,000 US package cars with sensors, which represents 66% of our fleet, eliminating 12 million manual scans per day, and enhancing package visibility for our customers within the Network of the Future. In 2024, we accelerated operational closures and completed nine more than planned, resulting in 49 operational closures which included permanently closing 11 buildings. We did this while continuing to deliver outstanding customer service. Today, about 63% of our US volume now flows through our automated facilities compared to 60% in 2023.\nFinally, we took actions in our healthcare logistics business to further support our growth plans. Earlier this month we completed the acquisition of Frigo-Trans, a European healthcare logistics company specializing in cold chain, and in December we opened two state-of-the-art healthcare cross-dock facilities in Italy and Germany. These moves further expand our cold chain capabilities to serve a growing European market.\nBefore I talk about 2025, I'd like to take a short look back at the last five years. In June of 2020, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, we launched our better, not bigger strategy hinged on three customer first, people led, innovation driven. For the first few years, we focused on growing select markets and optimizing financially attractive volume, including volume from SMBs and healthcare customers. Further, we focused on making productivity a virtuous cycle by launching Transformation 2.0, and we began a portfolio optimization program including selling our LTL freight business and making a few strategically important acquisitions. From 2020 through 2022, we delivered solid financial results in line with our strategy at a time when much of the world was struggling due to the challenges presented by the pandemic.\nIn 2023, our financial results faced unexpected challenges due to an unfavorable economic environment and a prolonged labor negotiation with the Teamsters. While the labor negotiation caused volume and earnings disruption, we gained certainty regarding our labor costs for the next several years.\nAfter wrapping the first year of our new labor contract in Q3 2024, positive momentum began to build, and we returned to volume, revenue, and operating profit growth. We continued to drive productivity through several programs and focused on revenue quality, and we took further actions to optimize our portfolio by selling our truckload brokerage business known as Coyote, and we entered into agreements to acquire Estafeta, a leading Mexican logistics integrator, and Frigo-Trans. We closed out 2024 with an outstanding peak, delivering best-in-class service and financial results ahead of our target.\nAs we wrapped up 2024, it became clear to us that if we did not address three specific challenges facing us in the US, we could lose momentum. The first challenge relates to the dynamics of the US small package market. Today, it is a slow growth market with changing package characteristics. The second challenge comes from the concentration of volume and revenue we have with our largest customer. Looking ahead, we project this business, if we take no action, will drive diminishing returns. The third challenge is the reliance we have had with the USPS for our SurePost product. In this case, the USPS is changing its operating model, which we believe puts service at risk. We have taken actions to address all three of these challenges head on, including doubling down on revenue quality, and serving the customer segments we want to serve best.\nFirst, we've reached an agreement in principle with our largest customer for a significant reduction in volume, lowering their volume with us by more than 50% by the second half of 2026. With this, we will right size our network and retain the volume that is nutritive for us and for our customer. Second, effective this year on 1 January 2024, we no longer use the USPS for our SurePost product. Service is a fundamental part of our value proposition, and by insourcing this product, we can be certain we deliver great service with no material impact to our financial performance.\nIn connection with these changes, while I'm incredibly proud of the productivity actions taken by our leaders, we've realized we're not done. We are reconfiguring our US network and have launched multi-year initiatives we're calling Efficiency Reimagined which tackle our processes from end to end. From peak hiring practices to processing payments and more, Efficiency Reimagined should drive approximately $1 billion in savings. These significant business and operational changes, coupled with the foundational changes that we've already made, will put us further down the path to becoming a more profitable, agile, and differentiated UPS that is growing in the best parts of the market, namely healthcare, B2B, SMB, and international. We've got some work to do to make this all happen, but there's no better team than the UPS team; we will deliver.\nAs Brian will detail in 2025, these actions are expected to result in expanded operating margins and an improvement in return on invested capital. By taking these actions, we expect by the fourth quarter of 2026 to have a US domestic operating margin of at least 12%. With that, thank you for listening, and I'll now turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nEVP and CFO, UPS\n\nThank you, Carol, and good morning everyone. Our financial performance in the fourth quarter was better than we expected due to our focus on revenue quality and excellent cost management. The positive momentum that we began in the third quarter continued throughout our busiest time of the year. This morning I'll cover four areas, starting with our fourth quarter results, followed by a review of our full-year 2024 results including cash and shareowner returns. I'll provide more detail on the business and operational changes we are making, and I'll close with our expectations for the market and our financial outlook for 2025. Starting with our consolidated performance in the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue and operating profit growth, and margin expansion.\nThis is a continuation of the momentum that we showed in the third quarter and the first time in three years that we've shown growth in the fourth quarter on all three of these financial metrics. In the fourth quarter, we generated $25.3 billion in consolidated revenue, an increase of 1.5% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Consolidated operating profit was $3.1 billion, an increase of 11.2% versus the fourth quarter of 2023, and consolidated operating margin was 12.3%, an increase of 110 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Diluted earnings per share was $2.75, up 11.3% from the fourth quarter of 2023. Now moving to our segment performance, US domestic delivered strong fourth quarter results driven by gains in revenue quality and outstanding cost management.\nDuring the compressed 2024 peak season, our average on time service led the industry by 470 basis points over our closest competitor, which drove high demand for our services, allowing us to continue winning new customers. Throughout peak for the quarter, US average daily volume, or ADV, was flat to last year. Ground average daily volume increased 2.1% year over year, while total air average daily volume was down 12.9%. Excluding the volume decline from our largest customer, total air ADV grew, driven by demand from healthcare and high tech customers. Within ground, SurePost ADV as a percentage of total ADV increased slightly compared to the third quarter of 2024. Through the power of our matching algorithm, we increased SurePost redirects by 660 basis points sequentially from the third quarter, which resulted in half of the surpass volume being delivered by UPS drivers.\nFor the quarter, total B2B average daily volume was down 1% year over year. However, we saw B2B growth from healthcare customers, including healthcare SMBs. On the B2C side, average daily volume was up slightly year over year and made up 64.7% of our volume. In terms of customer mix, we saw strong ADV growth from SMB customers, which grew 4.5% in the fourth quarter, driven by double-digit growth in December. In the fourth quarter, SMBs made up 27.8% of total US volume. This was the highest fourth quarter concentration we've seen in 10 years. For the quarter, US Domestic generated revenue of $17.3 billion, up 2.2% compared to last year due to the strength of small package in December, and increases in air cargo.\nIn the fourth quarter, the revenue per piece growth rate flipped positive for the first time this year and was up 2.4% year over year, which was a sequential improvement of 460 basis points from the third quarter of this year. Breaking down the components of the 2.4% revenue per piece improvement, base rates increased the revenue per piece growth rate around 250 basis points. Strong keep rates on our holiday demand surcharge increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 110 basis points. The net impact of customer mix, combined with product mix and lighter weights, decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 80 basis points. Lastly, fuel drove a 40 basis point decline in the revenue per piece growth rate.\nTurning to costs, total expense increased 1.3% since we lapped the first year of our labor contract at the end of July. This was the first full quarter at a lower contractual union wage growth rate. In fact, the average increase over the prior four quarters was 10.5%. In the fourth quarter of this year, union wage rates increased by only 3%.\nThrough our Network of the Future initiative, we exceeded our initial target by completing 49 operational closures this year, including 11 buildings. By leveraging our technology and increasing automation, we processed and delivered the same amount of volume in the fourth quarter as last year, but we did it with 3 million pure hours. While delivering excellent service. We lowered small package block hours within our air network in response to changing volume levels. Purchased transportation and other expenses declined as we insourced 50% of SurePost volume during the fourth quarter, and we tightly managed rental equipment through peak. Lastly, our safety performance was better than we expected and drove a benefit in casualty expense.\nLooking at cost per piece throughout the fourth quarter, in the peak period, we leveraged technology and our proven practices to hold the increase to just 0.9%. The US domestic segment delivered $1.8 billion in operating profit, an 11% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, and the operating margin was 10.1%, a year over year increase of 80 basis points.\nMoving to our international segment, for the second quarter in a row, our international business grew revenue and operating profit, and expanded operating margin. Total international average daily volume growth flipped positive for the first time in three years and was up 8.8% year over year. International domestic average daily volume increased 5.8% compared to last year, driven by strong performance in Canada, and on the export side, average daily volume increased 11.7% year over year, with all regions delivering ADV growth. Asia export average daily volume was up 15.4%, delivering growth for the third consecutive quarter. At the country level, 17 of our top 20 export countries grew export ADV, led by Mexico and Germany. In Germany, which is our largest export market, export average daily volume increased 8.6% compared to last year.\nIn the fourth quarter, international revenue was $4.9 billion, up 6.9% from last year. With all regions growing revenue year over year, international generated positive operating leverage, driven by our ongoing network optimization and cost management efforts. Operating profit in the international segment was $1.1 billion, an increase of 18.1% year over year. Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 21.6%, an increase of 210 basis points from a year ago.\nMoving to Supply Chain Solutions, in the fourth quarter, revenue was $3.1 billion. Revenue decreased $306 million, with the reduction impacted by $588 million in revenue from Coyote in the 2023 period. Revenue within our Forwarding and Logistics businesses increased $282 million. Looking at the key drivers, air and ocean forwarding revenue was up 10.3%, led by continued strong market demand out of Asia, and logistics revenue grew by 16.2% in the fourth quarter. Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $284 million, down $24 million year over year, which included an impact of $13.5 million of operating profit from Coyote in the same period in 2023. Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 9.3%, an increase of 20 basis points compared to last year.\nWalking through the rest of the income statement, we had $229 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $67 million, and our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 20.5%, lower than our expectations due to discrete items.\nNow, let me comment on our full year 2024 results. For the full year 2024, revenue was $91.1 billion, a slight increase over 2023. We delivered operating profit of $8.9 billion and a consolidated operating margin of 9.8%. We generated $10.1 billion in cash from operations, and continued to follow our capital allocation priorities. We invested $3.9 billion in CapEx, we distributed $5.4 billion in dividends, we repaid $3.8 billion in debt that matured during the year, and at the end of the year our debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.25x. Lastly, we completed $500 million in share buybacks in 2024.\nIn the segments for the full year, US domestic operating profit was $4.5 billion and operating margin was 7.5%. The international segment generated $3.4 billion in operating profit and operating margin was 18.7%, and supply chain solutions delivered operating profit of $1 billion and operating margin was 8%. Which brings us to 2025. As Carol described, we are taking a set of strategic actions to address the challenges facing our US business head on. Execution is already well underway, and these actions together will create a more agile and profitable UPS.\nLet me provide more detail on what we're doing. I'll start with the agreement in principle we've reached with our largest customer to significantly reduce the volume we deliver for them. The accelerated decline has already begun and will step up meaningfully so that by the second half of 2026, their volume will be down by more than 50% of what it was at the beginning of the year.\nThe speed of the glide down is five times faster than our initial glide down efforts between 2021 and 2024. The results of this change will be lower overall volume levels, but an improved customer mix at a significantly higher revenue per piece. We are deliberately shifting our business and increasing our focus on growing higher yielding volume and value share. Lower overall volume levels from this customer will lead to lower revenue dollars in the near term. However, we expect to grow revenue per piece through shifting our customer mix and by leveraging our Architecture of Tomorrow pricing technology. This will enable us to continue the strong base rate improvements in 2025 that we delivered from our enterprise and SMB customers in the second half of 2024.\nAdditionally, we will double down on growing volume and revenue in the best parts of the market for us, including SMB, Healthcare, and B2B. In terms of SMBs, this year we expect to take the SMB percent of our US volume to 32%, and the momentum will continue for the longer term. Now looking at cost, as we bring volume down, we will not only reduce the hours and miles associated with this volume, we will be able to take out fixed costs to match our capacity to our new expected volume levels. All facets to the network are included in the reconfiguration, and we expect to close up to 10% of our buildings, cut back our vehicle and aircraft fleets, and reduce labor. The right sizing of our US capacity allows us to accelerate our network as a future initiative.\nWe will be able to more quickly bring down less efficient capacity while further investing in automation across the network, getting us to a more efficient US network faster. The capital requirements to run our reconfigured network will also decrease. We will share more details on our execution plan on our first quarter earnings call in April.\nNow turning to the changes we made with SurePost. As of 1 January 2024, we began delivering 100% of our SurePost volume, and in mid January we implemented a 9.9% average rate increase on SurePost. Offering a reliable economy service is an important part of our product portfolio and overall value proposition. The changes we made give us greater point-to-point operational control and the ability to provide better service to our customers. Which brings me to our Efficiency Reimagined initiatives. Lower overall volume and a reconfigured US network create an opportunity for us to increase efficiency by redesigning processes from end to end. Through Efficiency Reimagined, we expect to deliver approximately $1 billion in savings.\nPulling it all together, even while we're undergoing the largest network reconfiguration in our history, we expect to expand US domestic operating margin in every quarter of 2025, with the full year operating margin approaching 9%. As the impact of our cost out efforts increase over the next 18 months, we expect the pace of operating margin improvement to accelerate into 2026, where we expect by the fourth quarter to generate a 12% US operating margin, and we see even more upside potential in the longer term.\nTurning to guidance for 2025, starting with the macro, S&P Global forecasts global GDP growth of 2.5% compared to 2024. Real exports and global industrial production are both expected to increase around 2% year over year. In the US, manufacturing is expected to turn positive for the first quarter of 2025 after seven quarters of negative year over year growth, and the consumer is expected to remain resilient.\nMoving to our 2025 financial outlook, for the full year 2025 on a consolidated basis, revenue is expected to be approximately $89 billion, and operating margin is expected to be approximately 10.8%. Our guidance for 2025 does not reflect any significant potential global trade implications due to changes in tariffs. Now let me give you a little color on the segments. Looking at US Domestic, as a result of the actions we're taking, full year 2025 revenue is expected to decline 2.3% year over year, driven by an ADV reduction of about 8.5%, partially offset by strong expected revenue per piece growth of approximately 6%. We will wrap the newly onboarded USPS Air Cargo business. We expect the intended volume and revenue declines to accelerate as we progress throughout the year.\nFull year operating margin is expected to be approximately 8.8%, an increase of 130 basis points compared to 2024, and to provide a little shape for the first quarter, which has one fewer operating day compared to the first quarter of 2024. We expect revenue to increase nearly 1% year over year despite ADV being down approximately 4%, and we expect to expand operating margin by approximately 140 basis points year over year. Moving to the international segment, we expect mid single digit ADV growth throughout the year, but with lower demand related surcharges than we've seen in prior years. For the year, we expect 2025 revenues to increase approximately 2.5% year over year with an operating margin of around 18.6%.\nLooking at the first quarter, we expect revenue to be flattish compared to the same period last year, and operating margin to be moderately down year over year due to lower demand-related surcharges and in supply chain solutions. For the full year 2025, we expect revenue to be approximately $11 billion and operating margin to be approximately 8.5%. In SES in the first quarter, revenue is expected to decline about $500 million due to the reduction in revenue associated with Coyote Logistics in the same period last year. Operating margin in SES in the first quarter is anticipated to be low to mid single digits due to pressure from purchased transportation costs related to our mail innovations business. We expect the first quarter to be the lowest SES operating margin in 2025.\nFor modeling purposes, in total below the line, we expect approximately $780 million in expense, with a little more than half in the back half of the year. We expect pension expense to be approximately $37 million for the full year 2025, which is $306 million higher than in 2024, primarily due to the impact of market shifts in interest rates on our pension assets. Last year, we included a slide in the appendix of today's webcast deck to provide you more detail on pension. The webcast deck is available on the UPS investor relations website.\nNow let's turn to our expectations for cash and the balance sheet. We expect free cash flow to be approximately $5.7 billion, including our annual pension contribution of $1.4 billion. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $3.5 billion. While we are accelerating our Network of the Future initiative, our reconfigured US network should require less investment in vehicles and aircraft as we right size the capital base. We are planning to pay out around $5.5 billion in dividends in 2025, subject to board approval. We expect to buy back around $1 billion of our shares. Lastly, we expect the tax rate for the full year to be approximately 23.5%, as we expect the current US corporate tax regime to remain. We've covered a lot today. We are moving quickly to continue our momentum.\nThe results of our actions will be an even stronger, more agile, and more profitable UPS that's growing in the best parts of the market that value our end-to-end inte. With that, operator, please open the lines for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your first question today comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good morning. You got a lot of big things going on. Wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about how can we build confidence that against a pretty meaningful drop in revenue from the Amazon change that you're able to, I guess, quickly enough get out to fixed costs so that as opposed to seeing deleveraging and margin pressure, that you're seeing the margin improvement that you're talking about. I think just a bit more of kind of how that equation can play out, recognizing that we think of the network as having a fair bit of fixed cost to start with. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nTom, happy to do that. Maybe I'll just start by talking about the Amazon announcement. We've been a partner to Amazon for nearly 30 years, and we hold that company in high regard. Amazon is our largest customer, but it's not our most profitable customer. Its margin is very dilutive to the US domestic business. Our contract with Amazon came up this year, and we said it's time to step back for a moment and reassess our relationship because if we take no action, it will likely result in diminishing returns. We considered a number of different options and landed on what we think is the best option for our company, and that is to accelerate the glide down of their volume with us, as we commented in our prepared remarks, by more than 50% by June of 2026.\nAs you pointed out, Tom, there are a lot of assets and resources that support that Amazon volume. As we glide down the volume, we will also be gliding out those assets and resources, which gives us the margin expansion that we've explained. Now I'll turn it over to Brian so you can explain how the cost will come out.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nEVP and CFO, UPS\n\nSure. Thank you. Tom, as we said before, clearly there's a lot of stakeholders involved here and we needed to make this announcement so we can engage with those stakeholders. You're absolutely right in your intuition that this is going to require a reconfiguration of the network so that we bring the fixed asset base, the buildings, the vehicles, the aircraft, in line with the new volume levels. We'll give you a lot more color on how we're going to roll that schedule out on the first quarter earnings call once we have a chance to engage all the stakeholders involved. I do think that is the key here. That is the mission. Quite frankly, it's already underway with our teams.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nOne reason for a glide down over 18 months rather than six months is because we wanted to make sure that we didn't strand cost. Now, clearly our labor costs will flex with volume. As volume goes up, we have more hours. As volume comes down, we have less hours. That's just part of the DNA of how we operate our business. We have, I think, proven in 2024 that we can close buildings because with Network of the Future, we did just that. We closed down 11 buildings with improved service. Nando, would you like to comment on that?\n\nNando Cesarone\n\nEVP and President of US Operations, UPS\n\nSure. Thanks. Good question. Tom, just to give you comfort here, you'll know that five facilities already in January have been partially or completely closed. This year we'll have 140 active Network of the Future projects. 61 of them will go live this year, of course, just driving up the number of shipments that run through our automated facility. That gives me a lot of confidence, gives our people a lot of confidence. We feel good about these moves, and we're ahead of schedule.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, hi. Just to follow up on the SurePost side of things, maybe give some sense for how much volume, sort of. Is going to be pulled into the network. Can the network as it's currently constituted today, ready from day one to move all the volume that the Post Office had done? Maybe along with that, can you touch a little bit? Is some of this bringing SurePost in house designed in part at least to replace or infill some of the Amazon business going out in terms of network density.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, Jordan, thanks for the question. Let's step back for a moment. On SurePost, all SurePost products are sorted through our buildings. We had used the USPS for last mile delivery for a portion of that. Through our engineering and IT matching algorithms, we've been able to redirect a lot of the SurePost volume back into the network, in fact, for delivery by our people. In fact, in the fourth quarter, 50% of the SurePost volume was delivered in the Brown network. As we came to the decision to insource all of it and have it all delivered by our network, it was simply a matter of, well, service.\nUp until this year, we had been injecting into the last mile network of the USPS, and the service there was good. As I think you know, the USPS is changing their operating model. As a result of those changes, we were going to have to insert upstream into their sorting facilities. We were very concerned about service deterioration. At the same time, they were going to increase their cost to us. That value proposition of an increased cost as well as deteriorating service, well, that did not work for us. In the middle of December, we determined that we would insource 100% of the SurePost volume, which we have done. I'm pleased to say that's gone very well for us. Yes, we have a few more delivery stops per car, but interestingly, we are not driving more miles.\nWhen we look at the financial impact in sourcing SurePost, we feel very good that it's actually not going to have a material impact to our business at all. We did make a GRI increase, I will admit, but from an operating perspective, it's going swimmingly well. Nando, would you like to add?\n\nNando Cesarone\n\nEVP and President of US Operations, UPS\n\nYeah, sure. Jordan, there are multiple opportunities for us to match shipments. Now, as we control that volume over multiple days, we've also adjusted our algorithm to really target stops or stop matching to 100 ft of a regular stop. Certainly, this helps us smooth the daily dispatch for our employees. Resources in terms of spiking one day versus another, we're able to flatten that and keep the staffing picture very linear for the company. In addition to that, of course, we're exploring different ways on how we can move the volume through slower networks because it is an economy service. As we look at rail and how we leverage rail across the country, as well as ground movements, we make sure that we're hitting our service portfolio.\nEarly days show, as Carol had said, mileage index looks good, packages per car look good. The just overall performance right now, just really proud of the team, and they continue to try to optimize this service as we go forward.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nEVP and CFO, UPS\n\nNando, if I could just add one thing because I think it relates to the prior question as well, I think the investments that we have made in the network and the technology allowed us to insource almost 1.5 million stops within a matter of weeks. I think it's a testament to the operators, but also a testament to the agility that we've created in the network, and that will help us as we move forward with the reconfiguration that we're undertaking. The other thing I do think is important that you should know is that we have included some expectation that there could be some churn. Right, you know, with the GRI and the changing service. There are some customers that this might not work for, and we've taken that into account in our forecast.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, good morning. A couple questions for you here on this, on sort of the guidance and the growth outlook. You know, when we think about the 10.8% margin that we're going to have for full year 2025, Brian, is there any way to think about what that number would look like if you had sort of adjusted the network at the start of the year? I'm just trying to get a sense for what the run rate level of margin would be if you didn't have the deleveraging that would ultimately come with lower volume. Carol, can you maybe talk about what the growth picture looks like, X the glide down?\nThere's a lot of concern in the market right now from investors around. The organic or lack of organic growth in the small package business. I'm just trying to get a sense for how you guys are thinking about the growth outside of the glide down in the next two years. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nHappy to do that.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nEVP and CFO, UPS\n\nSure. Why don't I take the margin question first? Dave, I think what we built into our forecast is we are going to be taking the fixed cost out commensurate with the volume drawdown as we go through the course of the year. That will also accelerate as we go into 2026, and you'll see an improvement in margin. As we said, we expect to get to the 12% as we go through 2026. I think what's really important is you take a step back and you look at what's going on. Even though volume is going to decline relatively significantly in the US, rep per piece is going to go up 6%. That will be a combination of customer mix, product mix, but also the continuation of the good base pricing discipline that we showed in the first quarter.\nBy taking this, I would say, relatively non-nutritive volume, we're unlocking the ability for us to control our margin profile as we move forward and really push it not just to the 12% but beyond as we move forward and we grow in the areas where it's most important for us.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nDavid on the growth algorithm, the small package market, excluding Amazon, is projected to grow in the low single digits in 2025. We project to take share. One area of share will be on SMBs. We're really proud of the performance we've seen with our SMB growth. Nearly 29% of total business in the US in 2024. We're going to take that up to 32% in 2025, on our way to 35% in 2026 and beyond. That's just one aspect of growth. We can look at it through a customer segment, or we could also look at it through capabilities. What we're really focused in right now is focusing on complex logistics that differentiate us away from the rest of the competition. How did we grow SMBs?\nBecause we've invested in our Digital Access Program, we've invested in pricing Architecture of Tomorrow, which is moving us from the art of pricing to the science of pricing. It allows us to put more potential bids through Deal Manager, winning more with less discounting, providing better service for that customer. We're also growing into the healthcare space. We're growing into the B2B space through store replenishment. We created a store replenishment system in 2004 with 15 retailers and almost 3,000 stores across the nation, helping them with time-definite delivery into their stores, which helps drive their productivity.\nWe're going to take share in this slower growth market, but we're not going to cap our margin because had we not accelerated the Amazon volume down, we would be capping our margin in a slow growth market. Now we have an opportunity to grow and grow margin too. Now you might put the math together for David.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nEVP and CFO, UPS\n\nYeah, David, I think it's important because you're absolutely right. There's a lot of moving parts in how we go from 2024 to 2025. If you look at the change in the revenue, the $91 to the 89, take SES out of it because that's really related to Coyote. You've got about $1.5 billion of revenue decline associated with Coyote. You just look at the domestic business. Look, the actions that we're taking with our largest customer are going to draw down revenue about $2.5 billion. We've got growth, right, that's going to plug that gap of over $1 billion, which, as Carol said, is really focused in SMB, enterprise, and these differentiated capabilities that are going to allow us to grow in the market and take share.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nAll right, thanks. If I could just squeeze one more in here. Carol, I think in your point about share, the post office is raising rates to you and lowering service levels. Is it fair to think that they're doing that to the broader market as well, which kind of increases some of the share take opportunity, or is that not the right way to think about it?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nI think that's absolutely the way to think about it.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nJoseph Hafling\n\nVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, this is Joe Hafling on for Stephanie Moore. I maybe wanted to stick on that point on the SurePost and USPS. In the past you had talked about handing off that final mile being really high ROIC for you guys. I guess what's changed and maybe how you guys are operating the network now and bringing those volumes in house that you feel comfortable kind of bringing in all those volumes and can still see good returns.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, it first starts with service. We pride ourselves on service. We have the leading on time service of any competitor. If you don't deliver on that value proposition, you can lose. We wanted to first deliver service, but then we wanted to make sure that we can make a buck on this business too. Nando, you might just reemphasize how we're operationalizing the insourcing.\n\nNando Cesarone\n\nEVP and President of US Operations, UPS\n\nYeah, sure. In the past we'd really have only one shot to match a shipment to a UPS shipment, and that was the morning of arrival. Now we've got multiple days, and our technology is able to see through those days to match as many as we can. In fact, I think last year around +30% matched. We're in the 50s now, and we continue to refine that number as we start looking at proximity deliveries to UPS already scheduled ground packages. I think one of the bigger ones is just smoothing, or the ability to smooth dispatch across the week, which avoids any spikes. Therefore, we don't need to staff up to one day of the week. In reality, we staff through the entire week, which brings its own inefficiencies.\nLook, we've got the best dispatch technology that any company would want to have, and we are utilizing it to the fullest extent. We don't mind what we see in terms of results right now. I think they've done a great job being efficient and putting that volume into our network.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nMatt, you might talk about how we are priced to relative to the market.\n\nMatt Guffey\n\nChief Commercial and Strategy Officer, UPS\n\nYeah. As Carol mentioned, we came out with the 9.9% GRI, and we made sure that we aligned the value to service, number one. What's most important is to protect the service of our customers that we just highlighted. I'd ask you just to remember a couple things. SurePost is a product in our full portfolio. When our customers buy, they don't just buy the SurePost product, they also buy our Ground Residential, which is our premium offering. Both of these, you know, the product was designed and the way we priced it to be, it's an economy product that is less time sensitive. Both Ground Residential and Ground SurePost will provide service and reliability to our customers, and we price accordingly to the value.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nEVP and CFO, UPS\n\nJoe, on the ROIC point, I just want to point out, you know, one of the things we take a lot of pride in is getting the most out of our assets at UPS. We do. You can see from our CapEx forecast, we are not going to be adding assets for this volume. It fits into the network, and as Nando said, we are able to work it into the dispatch, and we are focused on managing the capital base and driving ROIC higher, which you see in our 2025 guide.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYeah, we anticipate based on the numbers we've just laid out for you today that our return on invested capital will grow about 300 basis points year on year.\n\nJoseph Hafling\n\nVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the thoughtful answer, guys.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, great. Good morning. Can you qualify what Amazon revenues were for the full year? I know this was the first time you gave a mid year at 11.5%. I don't know if you gave a final year. As Amazon takes back those volumes, can you maybe talk about competition now in different segments? I guess you've always said the reason why they stick with you is you do different things for them, such as returns, pickups, things that they rely on you. Does this mean we should expect an increasing amount of competition in areas that you kind of had kind of moat around. As your specialty versus the market? How should we think about that from a competitive standpoint? Thanks.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYes. For the full year, Amazon made up 11.8% of our total company revenue. From a competitive perspective, I think it's important to note that Amazon will remain a customer of UPS when we finish our accelerated glide down on those areas that are a win for us and a win for them. They have a one way network, as you know, and we can handle things today that they can't handle. Amazon, when you think of them as delivering packages, you think of them as a vertically integrated retailer because that's what they are, ignoring their AWS business. That's what they are, a vertically integrated retailer who needs some help with some things. We're going to provide that help for them in a more nutritive fashion when we reach the accelerated glide down.\nI will tell you, Ken, this was not their ask, this was us. This was UPS taking control of our destiny. We'll be working with them, of course, on the accelerated glide down because they've got to figure out how to catch some of this volume. We are not anticipating changes in the competitive environment as a result.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. I guess if I could throw a follow in the pace of the consolidated facility shutdowns. Nando, you were talking about how you've already started that. Is there kind of numbers you can throw out, maybe update us on how quick you can get some of those out.\n\nNando Cesarone\n\nEVP and President of US Operations, UPS\n\nYeah, Ken, as I mentioned before, we've got a lot of stakeholders that we need to talk to related to the network reconfiguration. We're going to lay that out for you on the first quarter call. It's fair to say it will accelerate as we go through the year, especially in the second half and then into the first half of 2026. Give us until April and we'll lay that plan out for you.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thanks. Appreciate the time.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nNando Cesarone\n\nEVP and President of US Operations, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ari Rosa from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nAri Rosa\n\nSenior Analyst and Equity Research, Citigroup\n\nHey, good morning. A lot of changes underway. Carol, I was hoping maybe you could paint a picture for us of how you envision the future of UPS, say 5 or 10 years from now. Specifically, you talked about some of these growth areas. Maybe you could give us some color on how you see kind of the TAM of those growth areas, whether it's healthcare or SMB, and what role UPS plays within that market such that the top line revenue growth doesn't experience the material decline that I think a lot of people are perhaps concerned about this morning. Thanks.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you for that question. I love to talk about our future because I think our future is very bright. We are leaning into the system segments of the market that value our end-to-end network. We're doing it through differentiated capabilities. When you think about the future of UPS, think about complex logistics where we are providing solutions for the segments of the market that no one else has. Think about RFID tagging, which started as a productivity initiative for us, has turned into an inventory management opportunity and benefit for our upstream customers. Think about healthcare. Healthcare is such an opportunity for us. You know, the healthcare market growth slowed down a bit in 2024. The market grew 2.5%, we grew 5%. Our healthcare revenue for the year, about $10.5 billion.\nWe've got plans to take that to $20 billion by 2026. The TAM, the addressable market just in complex, is over $80 billion. To break down that $10.5 billion for you, we've got $5 billion in complex, $1.5 billion in clinical, and about $4 billion in non complex. We are going to over index on the complex and clinical over the next several years. As we think back now on these differentiated opportunities, international diversification is also an opportunity for us. You know, a couple of years ago we realized that manufacturers in China were moving to a China Plus One strategy where they weren't exiting China, but they were moving manufacturing to other locations like Vietnam. We got ahead of it. We expanded our operations, and we see in these trade lanes where we expanded operations, 20% growth, 30% growth.\nInternational diversification is another opportunity for us. This is not a company that's shrinking. This is a company that's gliding down its largest customer, but it's not a company that's shrinking. It's a company that's growing. We laid out some revenue targets and operating margin targets a year ago in March. We're going to hit the operating margin targets. We are absolutely confident on that. We will reset the revenue targets once we get through all this because we need to give you color and clarity as to where we're taking the top line. There's plenty of growth ahead for us. A differentiated UPS complex logistics, which is in the premium part of the market.\n\nOperator",
    "content2": "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Weatherbee from Wells Fargo, please go ahead.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nManaging Director, Head of Transportation, and Shipping Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Carol, maybe I could pick up on that last point. You know, I think the 2026 question is an important one, and I get the margin mix up as a result of some of the glide down here. I guess as we think about this process, is there a way you can give us comfort that we won't be sort of in a flattish or maybe down earnings scenario for a multi-year period of time? I guess in other words, maybe more directly, can you grow earnings in 2026? If you can, can you walk us through maybe some of the parameters?\nI know you want to lay them out more in more detail in April, but I think just given sort of the magnitude of what we're talking about here, some help around kind of guide points for 2026 I think are important.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nI think that's absolutely a fair question. As I thought about this last night, I was like, they're going to ask this question. We need to come out and do that for you. I'm not going to do it on today's call. We need to come out and do that for you in a thoughtful way, so we can give you the TAMs. We can show you how we're growing. We can do that in a thoughtful way. Brian? I don't know. We'll figure out a time to do that this year. Maybe at the end of the first quarter, we'll figure out a time to do that. Is there any color that you want to share right now?\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nEVP and CFO, UPS\n\nYeah. Chris, while we will absolutely lay out 2026, I just want to make sure that we're also clear on what 2025 is going to look like because, you know, we do have both plans. As we draw down the volume, we will be taking fixed costs out. We also have Efficiency Reimagined that we talked about. That's going to drive $1 billion in cost savings through process improvement that's also underway. We're starting to see results from it, and it's an exciting program because it makes us a much more agile organization. As we progress through the quarter, we will expand domestic operating margin in every quarter of this year, right? We will expand it every quarter of this year, and we will finish with almost 130 basis points better than we finished last year.\nThat's going to accelerate as we go into 2026, and we'll lay that out for you on a coming call.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWe're growing profit dollars, not just margin. We're growing profit dollars.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nEVP and CFO, UPS\n\nYeah.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nI think we're not shrinking the profit dollars, we're growing the profit dollars.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nManaging Director, Head of Transportation, and Shipping Research, Wells Fargo\n\nThat's something we can think about in 2026 as well.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYeah, absolutely. Because we will accelerate the cost out related to the fixed cost.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nManaging Director, Head of Transportation, and Shipping Research, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYeah.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, Carol. You said a few times that this business has been very dilutive to margin. I'm just wondering, like, would you characterize this as a mid single digit margin, a low single digit, a no margin business? That's the first thing. I totally get the mix impact here. When I just think about price, right, if we're losing 10% to 15% of the volume and we to some extent need to backfill that, does that in any way change your pricing discipline? Last thing, I know I'm asking a lot, but last thing, do you think we should just assume that the other 50% of this business goes away in a few years when the contract comes up again?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nI'll answer the last part first. I don't think so. Think about returns. We have 5,200 UPS Store locations that make it very convenient for customers of Amazon to return their Amazon packages. We do that very, very well for Amazon. There is a place where a parity, if you will, between our two companies. I don't think it will go all away. I think we're landing at the right spot with this accelerated guide down. I think it would be inappropriate for me to talk about the price profitability of any account.\nThis is extraordinarily dilutive. I'll leave it at that. Perhaps you could back into the number if you look at the percentage of revenue and the volume that we described, and that might help you think about the dilution. Brian, anything you want to add to that?\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nEVP and CFO, UPS\n\nScott, I also want to be, because you asked about pricing discipline, and I think this is a really important point because we're reconfiguring the network to the new volume level. We're not chasing volume in order to fill empty capacity. The capacity will adjust to the new volume level, and that's really a key point because we have shown pricing discipline in the second half of 2024. We saw great revenue per piece growth in the fourth quarter, and that's going to extend into 2025 and be a portion of the revenue per piece improvement that we see. That pricing discipline is implemented. We've got processes in place, and we absolutely are going to continue to keep that going forward.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nDo you think you can reduce capacity one for one with the volume drop here?\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nEVP and CFO, UPS\n\nYes.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYes.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you, guys, appreciate it.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nRavi Shanker\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you. Just a few things.You've quantified the Amazon revenues a couple of times now. Can you quantify what percentage of the US domestic volumes are Amazon? I think that's pretty important, stat for doing the math here. Also, to your point on the returns, I think Amazon did start trialing an in-house return program last year. Do you see risk to that scaling up over time as well?\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nEVP and CFO, UPS\n\nRavi, on the volume, if you think around 20% of the volume in the US network, 20%, 25, depending on the time and the price, look on the returns and I'll let Matt talk a little bit about our returns portfolio in a second. What I would say is there's a lot of return solutions in the market. Here's what I know. Our returns growth continues to grow with the UPS Store. We have a great footprint, we have a great customer experience. Matt, maybe you want to talk a little bit about how we've been adding to that.\n\nMatt Guffey\n\nChief Commercial and Strategy Officer, UPS\n\nYeah, I think just Carol hit on it. When you think about the physical footprint that we have in the United States, physical 5,200 stores give us access and the proximity to very, very close to most consumers in the US. Just the overall experience. Right is the key component. Returns in reverse logistics is hard to do, and this gives us a capability, and we continue to build on that. Let me just give you one other example though. We've also added, if you remember, we acquired Happy Returns. This complements that returns experience because now not only do you have the physical, but you can also do the digital, which is a no box, no label, which drives a much better experience for the consumer, for UPS, and for our customers as well. We continue to add to this and believe that we have the best in class returns portfolio.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nI might dimensionalize the glide down in a different way just to help you in the modeling. Between 2021 and 2024. On average, the glide down was about 250,000 packages per day per year. Between 2024 and 2026 on average, the average is just an average, but the average between 2024 and 2026 will be 1.25 million packages per day per year. 5x as fast as what we did before.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brian Osenbeck from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck J.P. Morgan)\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of follow ups here. Given that big impact on volume, and I'm assuming Amazon was a pretty big peaker during peak season, can you talk about the broader implications for the network for peak season? I know you're going to give us more update in April after, I'm assuming, you speak to the Teamsters about this big change, but can you give us a sense in terms of what maybe complications you can encounter with that? Can you still reach Sunday delivery with SurePost? Thank you very much.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nFrom a peak perspective, we'll operate peak like we do every other year. We won't have as many leases. I suspect we'll operate just like we do any other year. What would you like to add?\n\nNando Cesarone\n\nEVP and President of US Operations, UPS\n\nRegarding peak, we stretch our network with variable costs, so we'll rent equipment, we'll set up temporary sort facilities. A lot of that's not going to be required. We'll lease aircraft, we won't need to. We rent tractors, trailers, shifters, and all that stuff from our vendors. Clearly, as the volume settles, that's an opportunity for us to not rent those pieces of equipment this peak season. I think we've built that little hedge for ourselves with the variable cost, that we're just going to pull all that back in.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nCarol and Nando, I think we've seen more change in the parcel space in the last two years than the prior 15. Can we talk another big picture question here? When we roll out to 2027, 2028, number one, do you think that we've seen the last of the big shoes to drop on some of the changes to the competitive landscape, cost structures, that sort of thing with you and your competitors? Could there be more seismic shifts? You already talked a bit on a previous question about where you think you, UPS, win in that long term landscape. Can you talk a little bit about your competitors? Like where do FedEx Ground and Ground Economy win and have an advantage? Where does USPS Ground Advantage win? Where do the regional or gig economy players win? Just to think about the competitive landscape more holistically, longer term. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, there's a lot to that question, and we were focusing our comments today pretty much on 2025 and cheating in a little bit to 2026, but happy to think big picture on 2027 and 2028. I think the world is changing, and the rate of change is accelerating. It's hard to imagine a big, you know, big shoe to drop. I don't think we fully understand the impact of generative AI and what it can mean for productivity amongst industries broadly. It certainly is an opportunity for us to drive productivity and a better customer experience. Would it put us at a competitive disadvantage to anyone? I can't see that. In fact, I think we're ahead of most companies in this space. I need to be mindful that that's changing. We need to be mindful that trade follows policy, and tariffs aren't necessarily good for trade.\nThere may be changing trade lanes. I don't know if it's a big shoe to drop, but it could be changing trade lanes. We do know of the largest trade lanes in the world, they're in Asia. We're expanding our air hub in Hong Kong and building new in Philippines. We're going to be ready to take advantage of these changing trade lanes, however they may come about. There's a lot of opportunity for UPS to grow in the differentiated logistics, complex logistics world. With the capabilities that we are enabling throughout our business, it creates stickiness with customers like we've never seen before. Perhaps that's a big shoe to drop because our churn improved more last year than it's been since I got here. From a competitive positioning perspective, I do believe stickiness puts us at a point of differentiation.\nNow, perhaps when we come back, Brian, and do the addressable markets and where we're going to grow and the revenue, we can talk more about our competitive positioning. Trust me on this, we take every competitor and we tear it apart to understand where we may have a gap and how we might need to fill that gap. I'll give you two examples. In Europe last year, we didn't have an economy product and that was a problem for us. Our IT team, working with our pricing team and our operating team in Europe, fast trained that, tracked that, didn't they, Kate?\n\nKathleen Gutmann\n\nEVP and President of International, Healthcare and Supply Chain Solutions, UPS\n\nSure did. Growing double digits.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nGrowing double digit. We needed to offer a weekend solution. What did we do on weekend Kate?\n\nKathleen Gutmann\n\nEVP and President of International, Healthcare and Supply Chain Solutions, UPS\n\nRolled it out. First mover in Canada, now in Europe and major countries, especially in Western Europe. Both of them exceeding the revenue targets and doing better on the cost side of it because we just built it into our regular efficiency that we do around the world.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nIf we see a gap that we need to fill, we do it.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Bruce Chan from Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Stifel\n\nYeah, thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. I think it's very encouraging to see some of the proactive changes here, and maybe I'll just focus in on SPSF because it strikes me that the RFID initiative is very helpful in optimizing your assets with some of these fairly significant market developments. Looks like you're underway in phase II. Maybe what's the target for rollout across the entire package car fleet, and any comments that you have around the timeline, especially in phase III, would be great.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nNando, would you like to take that?\n\nNando Cesarone\n\nEVP and President of US Operations, UPS\n\nYeah. We've got a schedule, of course, prepared, a dedicated team to execute the changes. As we talk about the changes to Amazon and other changes here with SurePost, that schedule is completely linked to our financial plan, and we have full confidence that we can execute those changes. In addition to what Carol mentioned earlier, especially with RFID tagging, we've got an opportunity to pull customers in, where the stickiness just becomes a real big discussion and decision if they ever want to really disconnect from that technology, because it's going to not just help delivery of packages, but also their back office environment, which we're really excited about.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWe should be rolled out this year. From a customer stickiness perspective, Matt, you can give a couple of examples.\n\nMatt Guffey\n\nChief Commercial and Strategy Officer, UPS\n\nYeah. What Nando just highlighted and Carol framed is really important because we do get from RFID some productivity benefits and efficiency benefits, but from a customer value proposition, it's resonating very, very well. When you think about how you connect it to our total value proposition in the B2B or commercial space, you know, we typically think industrial and high tech in some of these areas, but retail is a big driver through store replenishment. This has really enabled us to win in this space we brought over.\nIf you heard Carol in her opening comments, she highlighted 15 retailers that we've already onboarded and large enterprise retailers in the United States that really love the RFID capability because they have inbound visibility to what's hitting their docks, and it allows them to spread their workforce and how they inbound that volume. It also, again, complements us from a commercial perspective because we can deliver many packages to that one location. The last piece I would add on to that, which, when you couple this together, is we are able to give these retailers inbound delivery windows, and it allows them that flexibility. You have the physical capability, but then you have the visibility through RFID. We believe we're just on the edge of something great here to work with our retailers to continue to grow.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nIt improves their stocking, it reduces their labor hours. A win, win. We'll continue to lean into that in a big way, and we're ahead of the game here when we look around the competitive landscape around the world.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Carol, maybe just a quick two-part one here on capital. Given that you're right sizing the domestic network right now, what would be the right level of maintenance CapEx for the business, and is $3.5 billion the level you took it to this year, which is, I think, a pretty drastic cut from where you thought you'd be a year ago. Is that sustainable? In that same context, how prudent is a $1 billion share repurchase this year with anticipated dividend payments of $5.5 billion, especially when your payout ratio looks like it's going to be approaching 80% of trailing earnings when I think you're targeting something closer to 50%. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nOn the capital side, Brian, I'll let you address that, and then I'll talk about the allocation to share owners.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nEVP and CFO, UPS\n\nSure. Yeah, Brandon, and thanks for the question because capital management is very important to us, and you see we have brought down the capital. Now, what I will say within that CapEx plan, we are fully funding Network of the Future. I think, in concert with the network reconfiguration, that's going to allow us to take that 63% of volume processed through automated facilities up significantly as we rationalize less efficient conventional capacity. We're fully funding that, and we're moving forward with it. Where we are able to tighten up is the volume drawdown will allow us to operate with, quite frankly, fewer vehicles, fewer aircraft, and fewer buildings, and that's what we're anticipating. I think as you think about going forward, we will be managing the capital base.\nThinking about CapEx in line with depreciation is where we think that we're going to need to manage it as we continue to automate, but also manage the capital base as we improve ROIC, that's realistic. If you go back and you look at kind of before we were allocating a lot of capital into a specific customer, that's kind of where we were.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nTo your question about is it prudent to buy back shares, and what about your payout and isn't it too high, I think it's important to note that we have a very strong liquidity position. We had a benefit from 2024 on a tax payment that we will pay in 2025. If you push that tax payment back into 2024, we're actually generating more cash in 2025 than we did in 2024. Strong liquidity with access to capital. From a dividend payout perspective, we're targeting 50% of earnings, and we're higher than that. It's important to note, however, that it's distorted because of the below the line non-cash pension expense.\nIf you ignore the non-cash pension expense, the payout ratio isn't as high as appears at its base. Plenty of liquidity to pay the dividend and on the share repurchases. The way we're thinking about it today is our compensation plans are dilutive from an EPS perspective. $1 billion just basically protects the dilution. What Brian and I have talked about is why don't we debt finance that? With the yield on the stock and the after-tax cost of the debt, it's a really good trade because the after-tax cost of the debt is lower than the yield on the stock. That's what we're thinking about in terms of how we would fund a share repurchase.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nP.J. Guido\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, UPS\n\nGreg, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. That question comes from the line of John Chappell from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good morning. Just quick market one. You know, I understand that you implemented the GRI for SurePost, Brian. You talked about strong RPP growth of 6% for US Domestic, which is obviously going to be a big mix impact as well. We're kind of hearing in the market, and Carol highlighted some of the challenges on kind of core volume of some pricing pressure overall just on core organic business. Are you seeing any of that? Is there a little bit more competitive spirit out there, I guess, to kind of maintain and or grow share? Just given some of the challenges in the core markets.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nI think our fourth quarter results are proof positive of the strength of our pricing approach. We had very strong keep rates on our base rates, as well as our holiday demand surge charge. Our GRI on our core business is 5.9% for 2025. We're going to keep probably 50% of that. The 6% RPP growth, you can break it down a third, a third, a third, can't you? Brian, why don't you go ahead and do that.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nEVP and CFO, UPS\n\nThat's right. If you think about where that's coming from, Carol's exactly right. It's about 1/3 from the strong base rates. Look, I'll be honest with you, there's nothing sexy about it. This is a grind, and Matt and I spend every Monday morning going through how we're seeing the market evolve, the pricing, and looking at how customers are performing. We've created a lot of discipline around that. It's a rational pricing environment, but we're getting really smart about how we do it, and that helps us get the keep. I'll let you elaborate on it, one.\nSecond. On the mix. On the other pieces though, you've got 1/3 that base rates, you've got 1/3 that's customer mix driven. Right. As Carol said, our focus on SMBs is allowing us to win there. When you look at it, we won through Peak and SMBs, and we also won through Peak on premium products. Right. Which is the other 1/3 of the rep per piece improvement. Matt, do you want to add anything?\n\nMatt Guffey\n\nChief Commercial and Strategy Officer, UPS\n\nI think you hit on two points that are important. One is we just put a lot of rigor and discipline behind the pricing, our pricing practices here. We'll continue that to Brian's point. It is an interesting stat because in Q4 we really leaned in on the premium segment. 60% of our wins in Q4 were in the premium segment, and that's focused on the products that value our end-to-end network, what Carol highlighted as complex.\nThe last thing I would just highlight is, look, we've talked to you about Architecture of Tomorrow, which is our pricing technology, and we've talked to you about Deal Manager, which allows us the ability to leverage pricing science for SMBs. Now, with Deal Manager, in the fourth quarter, 96% of our deals we've been able to price up to $10 million off came through Deal Manager, which allows us speed, we can turn time, and we can customize them for unique for the customer. It's given us a lot of flexibility to drive the right value for our customers, but also align our cost and our prices there.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now turn the floor back over to your host, Mr. P.J. Guido.\n\nP.J. Guido\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, UPS\n\nThank you, Greg. This concludes our call. Thank you for joining, and have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation, and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect."

I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Q2 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise, and after the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.\nAny analyst that wants to ask a question, now is the time to press one, then zero on your telephone keypad. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. PJ Guido, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nPJ Guido\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, UPS\n\nGood morning and welcome to the UPS Q2 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Carol Tomé, our CEO; Brian Dykes, our new CFO; and a few additional members of our executive leadership team. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2023 Form 10-K and other reports we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. Unless stated otherwise, our discussion today refers to adjusted results.\nFor the Q2, GAAP results include an after-tax charge of $120 million or $0.14 per diluted share, comprised of a one-time payment of $94 million to settle an International regulatory matter and transformation and other charges of $26 million.

Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. If you wish to ask a question, press one, and then zero on your phone to enter the queue. Please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. You may rejoin the queue for the opportunity to ask an additional question. Now, I'll turn the call over to Carol.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you, PJ, and good morning. Let me begin by welcoming Brian Dykes as UPS's new Chief Financial Officer. With over 25 years of multinational experience with the company, Brian brings deep financial and strategic experience to our executive leadership team. Welcome, Brian. Our Q2 performance was a significant turning point for our company as we returned to volume growth in the United States for the first time in nine quarters. I would like to recognize and thank UPSers for their hard work and efforts in delivering these results.\nAt the beginning of the year, we shared our outlook for 2024 based on four key planning assumptions. The first planning assumption acknowledged the front-loading of cost associated with our new labor contracts, which we believed would cause our financial performance to reflect a backfill effect, with first half 2024 earnings down as much as 30% and second half earnings returning to growth. In the first half of the year, our earnings were in line with the down 30% scenario. The second assumption was that we would return to volume growth, which we did in the US during the month of May. Further, while International volume growth in Q2 was down 2.9% year-over-year, we saw growth in certain markets.\nThe third planning assumption was based on our Fit-to-Serve initiative to right-size our management structure, and we are on track with this initiative to deliver roughly $1 billion in savings by the end of the year. Finally, we said we would explore strategic alternatives for our Coyote, and we did, leading to a pending sale to RXO at considerably more than our carrying value. The key assumptions we used to build our plan are holding with one distinction, and that's US volume mix, both in terms of product and customer segmentation. During the quarter, we experienced a shift toward value products, with shippers choosing ground over air and SurePost over ground. There was also a notable shift in product characteristics, with a surge in lightweight short-zone volume moving into our network. We will discuss the full year impact of these shifts in a few moments.\nLet me first highlight our Q2 results and then provide a few updates on our longer-term strategy. In the Q2, consolidated revenue was $21.8 billion, a decline of 1.1% versus last year. Consolidated operating profit was $2.1 billion, down 29.3%, and consolidated operating margin was 9.5%. At our March Investor Day, we set forth our declarations to become the premium small package provider, the premium logistics orchestrator, and the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world. To that end, we said we would pursue certain inorganic opportunities, and we have.\nAs you've seen, we just announced our plans to acquire Estafeta, a leading Domestic small package provider in Mexico. This is a big win for UPS, and it's a big win for our customers. By combining Estafeta with the end-to-end services we already have in Mexico and connecting it to the global reach of our integrated network, we will greatly enhance our logistics orchestration capabilities for customers that are shifting manufacturing and distribution closer to the United States. We are targeting to close this acquisition by the end of this year.\nLet me share a few other strategic updates, starting with customer first. In healthcare, we just opened our first dedicated healthcare facility in Dublin, Ireland. This 82,000sq ft facility provides storage and fulfillment for a range of complex pharmaceutical and healthcare products. In the Netherlands, we increased the size of our flagship facility in Roermond to now more than 235,000sq ft, including expanded ultra-cold storage capabilities to support the growing market of complex biopharma products. Looking at SMBs, we continue to add partners to our Digital Access Program, or DAP, meeting small businesses where they are. In the first six months of this year, DAP generated $1.5 billion in revenue, and we are well on our way to achieving our 2024 DAP revenue target of over $3 billion.\nBecause speed will always be important to our customers, in the US, we expanded our weekend service offering to six additional markets. With this service, we provide deliveries one day earlier than competitors who don't offer weekend pickup services. In fact, we are the only private US-based carrier that provides both commercial and residential pickup and delivery services on Saturdays as a general service offering. Outside of the US, we are continuing to enhance our portfolio to support our customers as they balance the need for speed with cost. For example, in record time, we launched enhancements to our worldwide economy service globally. This is an e-commerce solution for non-urgent cross-border shipments.\nHere, we created a true door-to-door service with customs clearance and delivery fees baked into the solution, making the experience simpler for the shipper and the receiver. In Asia, over the last several quarters, we've made a series of network enhancements, with the latest being in Taiwan. Because Europe is a top three export destination for Taiwan, we've expanded our capacity by 30% and extended pickups to as late as midnight. These enhancements enable our customers, including high-tech manufacturing and automotive shippers, to better serve their European customers by reaching their destination in just two business days. In supply chain solutions, we've expanded our supply chain operations at our Frankfurt Airport Gateway by adding nearly 25% more warehouse space. This facility is a major SCS hub for Central Europe, where it connects all transportation modes.\nIn this expansion, we can now provide even greater flexibility to the region's growing technology and healthcare industry. Importantly, also in SCS, we are onboarding the new USPS Air Cargo business with plans to be fully implemented before peak. The onboarding has gone well, and we continue to expect this business to be margin accretive for the company. Now, let's turn to innovation-driven progress with Network of the Future. In the first half of 2024, we completed 35 operational closures, which included closing five buildings, and we are on plan to complete an additional five operational closures in the second half of this year. Simultaneously, we are continuing to automate more of our operational tasks.\nFor example, in the US, we are automating the dispatch process for our package car and feeder drivers to reduce dispatch staffing by half. We deployed Phase I of the project, and so far this year, we've reduced staffing by 26%. As we continue deployment, we expect to achieve our reduction target by 2026. As a reminder, these actions are outside of Fit-to-Serve and are part of Network of the Future. Lastly, touching on Smart Package Smart Facility, which is our RFID solution, we are moving from a scanning network to a sensing network.\nAs we've discussed, we're adding RFID readers to our package cars, but we're not stopping there. We're moving upstream. First, we are enabling customers to print RFID labels themselves. Second, we are installing readers at customer dock doors. This will enable immediate visibility as our trailers are loaded for pickup. This solution provides a significant competitive advantage to us and to our customers.\nMoving to our financial outlook, Brian will provide more details. Let me share a few highlights. First, while we have entered into an agreement to sell our Coyote business, we are retaining Coyote revenue and earnings in our outlook until the transaction is consummated. Second, while our first half earnings were in line with the low end of the guidance we provided, our revenue came in just short of the low end. Given the current volume momentum we are now experiencing in our business, we are resetting our revenue guidance, taking us to the midpoint of our original revenue guide.\nFor operating profit, as we look to the back half of the year, in the US, we expect the same volume mix characteristics as we had in the first half of the year, which compresses revenue per piece growth. While we still expect an operating profit backfill effect with solid earnings growth in the back half of the year, the growth rate will not be as high as we projected at the beginning of the year. Accordingly, we are adjusting our full year operating margin guidance to reflect the nature of the volume flowing through our US network. As a result, we now expect consolidated revenue of approximately $93 billion and a consolidated operating margin of approximately 9.4%.\nImportantly, we expect to exit the final month of 2024 with a US operating margin of 10%, which creates a solid footing as we drive the US business to a longer-term operating margin target of 12%. One last comment before I hand the call over to Brian. We believe it is important to have a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, with the first uses of capital going back to the business and to pay our dividend, and then any excess cash being used for share repurchases.\nAs we have fine-tuned our capital requirements for Network of the Future, we expect to spend less than we originally anticipated. Further, with the pending sale of Coyote, we expect to free up cash that was not in our original guidance plan. As a result, we are restarting our share repurchase program with the intent of repurchasing about $1 billion of shares annually, including roughly $500 million in 2024. With that, thank you for listening, and let me turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThank you, Carol, and good morning, everyone. First, I'm very thankful for the opportunity to lead the global finance organization and work with the entire leadership team to achieve the targets we set. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us and the right team to achieve our goals. I'm also particularly eager to meet our investors as I hit the road over the next few weeks. This morning, I'll review our Q2 results, provide an update on capital allocation, and lastly, provide additional detail for our 2024 financial outlook.\nFirst, our results. The Q2 represented an important turning point for our business. In the US, volume inflected positively, and it was the last full quarter of the high wage growth rate associated with the first year of our new Teamsters contract. Outside the US, we saw pockets of demand improved in each export region, driving growth in many of our more profitable lanes. Additionally, through our Fit-to-Serve initiative, we've reduced our workforce by over 11,500 positions, which has translated into approximately $350 million in savings for the first half of 2024.\nAs Carol said, we are on track to deliver roughly $1 billion in savings by the end of the year. Looking at our consolidated performance, in the Q2, revenue was $21.8 billion, a reduction of $237 million compared to the Q2 of 2023. Consolidated operating profit was $2.1 billion, down 29.3%, and consolidated operating margin was 9.5%. Diluted earnings per share was $1.79, down 29.5% from the Q2 of 2023. Now, let's look at our business segments. In the Q2, US average daily volume increased 0.7% year-over-year.\nThis marks a return to positive volume growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2021. Sequentially, when compared to the first quarter of 2024, the average daily volume year-over-year growth rate increased by 390 basis points. At the beginning of the year, we expected to see three things in Q2: volume growth, growth in B2C, and relatively consistent product mix to what we had experienced last year. While we saw strong volume growth in Q2 led by B2C, it came with a different product mix. For the quarter, B2C volume increased 4.8% year-over-year and made up 58.5% of our volume, an increase of 220 basis points from a year ago. This growth was driven in large part by several new e-commerce customers that entered our network.\nB2B average daily volume finished down 4.6%, but returns remained a bright spot and increased 3% year-over-year. From a product perspective, we saw customers trade down between services. Specifically, we saw customers shift from air to ground and from ground to SurePost. As a result, total air average daily volume was down 7.8%, while ground average daily volume increased 2.3%. Within ground, SurePost average daily volume grew 25%, driven by new shippers' product choices, product trade downs, and easier comparisons due to last year's decline in volume during our contract negotiations. By enhancing our matching algorithm, we saw an increase in the percentage of SurePost packages redirected to UPS for delivery.\nAs a result, SurePost redirect increased, returning to 2020 levels. Turning to SMBs, we saw the trend from the first quarter continue, with total SMB volume down until June when it flipped positive. In terms of total volume, SMBs made up 29.7% in the Q2. For the quarter, US Domestic generated revenue of $14.1 billion, down 1.9% compared to last year. Revenue per piece was down 2.6% year-over-year.\nLet me break down the components of the revenue per piece decline. Base rates increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 90 basis points. The combination of product mix, lighter weights, and shorter zones decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 310 basis points. The remaining 40 basis point decline in the revenue per piece growth rate was due to the combination of changes in customer mix and fuel. Turning to costs, total expense increased 3.2% in Q2. Union wage rates increased 11.7%, driven by the contractual increase that went into effect in August of last year.\nThe US Domestic team took several actions and executed on productivity initiatives to partially offset the increase in compensation rate. We leveraged Total Service Plan and network planning tools to reduce total operational hours by 1.4%, while volume grew 0.7%. Through Network of the Future, we had 17 operational closures in the Q2, bringing our year-to-date total to 35. Because we're routing more volume through our automated facilities, we've permanently closed five buildings so far this year. We lowered block hours by 12.5% versus last year. We recorded our best auto safety results in 10 years, driving a better outcome for our people and a better long-term cost picture for UPS.\nPutting it all together, due to the actions we took in the Q2, we held the cost per piece growth rate to only 2.5%, even as union wages increased nearly 12%. This is the lowest cost per piece growth rate we've seen in more than three years. The US Domestic segment delivered $997 million in operating profit, down 40.7% compared to the Q2 of 2023, and the operating margin was 7.1%. Moving to our International segment, the Q2 was a turning point for our International business as well. For the first time in 10 quarters, 11 of our top 20 export countries demonstrated year-over-year average daily volume growth, including several key markets in Europe.\nAt the region level, Asia grew average daily volume and revenue in the quarter. In the Americas region, we continue to see solid signs of the shift in nearshoring. Looking at volume in the Q2, International total average daily volume was down 2.9% year-over-year, which is half the decline we saw in the first quarter of this year. About 3/4 of the decline in the Q2 came from lower Domestic average daily volume, which was down 4.4%, primarily driven by Europe. On the export side, average daily volume declined 1.5% year-over-year.\nHowever, on a sequential basis from the first quarter, export average daily volume improved 210 basis points. While overall export average daily volume was down in Europe and Germany, our largest export market, outbound grew 1%. In Asia, export average daily volume increased 1.7%, and within Asia, export volume on the China to US trade lane increased 20.6%. This is the third consecutive quarter of volume growth on this lane, which is our most profitable lane. Looking at the Americas region, export average daily volume increased 5%, which was the sixth consecutive quarter of growth. As we see the shift to nearshoring continue to take hold, our announced acquisition of Estafeta will further enhance our end-to-end services in Mexico.\nIn the Q2, International revenue was $4.4 billion, down 1% from last year, primarily due to the decline in volume. Revenue per piece increased 2.4%, driven by strong base pricing and the positive impact of region and product mix. In the Q2, total International expense was relatively flat year-over-year. Here, we leveraged the agility of our integrated network to manage block hours down 2.1% compared to last year. Operating profit in the International segment was $824 million, down $78 million year-over-year. Operating margin in the Q2 was 18.9%. Moving to Supply Chain Solutions.\nIn the face of a dynamic market, we remained agile and leaned into areas of growth. In the Q2, revenue was $3.3 billion, up 2.6% year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers, within International air freight, strong e-commerce demand, particularly in China outbound, drove an increase in volume and lifted market rates as demand outpaced capacity, resulting in an increase in revenue. On the ocean side, total volume and revenue was down year-over-year. However, toward the end of the quarter, demand on Asia outbound lanes improved and drove market rates higher. Our truckload brokerage business, known as Coyote, continued to face market pressures, which drove revenue down.\nIn logistics, revenue grew, driven by the impact of MNX and healthcare. In the Q2, supply chain solutions generated operating profit of $243 million, down $93 million year-over-year, reflecting market conditions. Operating margin was 7.3%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $206 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $67 million, and our effective tax rate for the Q2 was 23.4%. Now, let's turn to cash and capital allocation.\nYear-to-date, we've generated $5.3 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow of $3.4 billion. We finished the quarter with strong liquidity and no outstanding commercial paper. In May, we successfully issued $2.8 billion of debt to refinance $1.6 billion in current maturities, which will shore up additional liquidity and support our acquisition strategy. In the quarter, we announced that we would be outsourcing the asset management portion of our pension plan in order to focus squarely on our core business, while adding more expertise and oversight that will benefit UPS retirees. Lastly, so far this year, UPS has paid $2.7 billion in dividends, which brings us to our outlook for the second half of 2024. Global economic growth forecasts remain relatively unchanged in the back half of 2024.\nAccording to S&P Global, global GDP is expected to grow 2.7% for the full year 2024, and US GDP is expected to grow 2.4%. Additionally, as we've discussed, we still expect the US small package market, excluding Amazon, to grow by less than 1%. Looking at our business in the first half of 2024, revenue was below our expectations, and operating profit was at the low end of the range we provided, and finished down about 30%. Based on our performance in the first half of the year, combined with our expectation that the product shift we experienced in the US will continue through the rest of 2024, we have updated our guidance. This includes moving to a point estimate because it represents our best view of the many moving parts within our business.\nWe now expect consolidated revenue to be approximately $93 billion, and because the volume characteristics are different from what we originally anticipated, we now expect a consolidated operating margin of approximately 9.4%. Our guidance includes roughly $1 billion in savings from Fit-to-Serve. As Carol mentioned, Coyote revenue and operating profit remains in our guidance and will until the transaction is executed. Looking at the segments, in US Domestic, we anticipate back half 2024 revenue growth of around 5%, driven by strong volume growth. As you update your models for US Domestic, there are a few things to keep in mind.\nFirst, we expect average daily volume to grow by mid-single digits. Second, we will anniversary the first year of the Teamsters contract on 1 August. Next, product mix is expected to continue to pressure revenue per piece. However, through expense management and slowing labor inflation, we expect to grow Q3 operating profit by double digits and exit the year with a US operating margin of 10%. Lastly, we expect a strong peak driven by volume growth and demand surcharges.\nWithin the International segment, our full year and second half outlook remains consistent with what we provided at the beginning of the year. For second half, we anticipate volume growth rates will inflect positively and the revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. Operating margin in second half of the year in the International segment is anticipated to be approximately 20%. In Supply Chain Solutions, in second half of 2024, we expect revenue to be over $7 billion and an operating margin in the high single digits. Included in our guidance is the newly won air cargo business from the USPS, which will be fully onboarded by the end of Q3. Lastly, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 22% for the remainder of the year.\nTurning to capital allocations, for the full year in 2024, we expect free cash flow to be around $5.8 billion before any pension contributions. We've tightened our capital expenditure forecast and now expect to spend about $4 billion. We plan to pay out around $5.4 billion in dividends, subject to board approval. Given our strong liquidity, while we originally had not planned to repurchase shares, we now plan to repurchase approximately $500 million of shares this year. With that, Operator, please open the lines for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good morning. I wanted to see if you could offer some more thoughts on what's happening with Domestic package volume and the mix effect. If I look at the core ground, so excluding SurePost, it looks like you saw a decline sequentially. Let's say 12.3 million pieces a day in Q1 to 11.7 million, if I exclude SurePost. Do you think is that just market weaker, or is that kind of competitive performance?\nJust wanted to see if you could offer more thoughts on what's happening in Domestic package volume, and then maybe what are key levers to see that mix performance improve as we look at second half? Thank you.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah, thanks, Tom, for the question. I think when you look at the Domestic volume performance from the Q2 and then going forward, in the Q2, there were really two big impacts that were driving the change. One is we did see customers favoring our more economical products, so going from air to ground and within ground, from ground to SurePost. That was across the broad base of customers. We also saw an acceleration of new entrants, new e-commerce customers that were coming into the market that are, quite frankly, running a different model than our traditional customers and are highly leveraging our SurePost product. We saw an acceleration of SurePost.\nThe growth rate is also complicated as you think about what happened in the Q2 of last year because of the type of customers that diverted early as we were approaching the Teamsters contract. It does also skew the growth rate. As we move forward, and you can see it in our forecast and within the guide, that we do expect that mix to rationalize as we move towards the end of the year. We've got line of sight to that in our pipeline and are working to actively pull those through as we kind of balance the mix of products going into the second half.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nAnd maybe a couple of other comments about just the volume. As you saw, our commercial business was down year-on-year, although the rate of decline has moderated greatly. As we look to the back half of the year, we expect that to improve. Our pipeline is quite robust, so we expect to see good movement in that space.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, hi. Good morning. Just again on the trade down from more premium products to economic products, what changes customer behavior to go back? Is it simply the economy? Then what are your thoughts on sort of the B2B side of the equation, which I guess is still under pressure?\nDo you anticipate a step up with more of a focus on just-in-time inventory, a need to move things quicker from that end? And when would you think that timing could look better? Thanks.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, on the B2B front, as we discussed, it was down year-on-year. Part of that was because of customers who left us during the contract negotiation that have not returned. They left us, they locked themselves into long-term contracts, and they have not yet returned. That just gives us an opportunity to win them back for the excellent service that we provide. We've also seen some dynamics within the B2B space occur recently within poolers, companies going out of business like overnight, which gives us an opportunity to bring that business back into our network. It's already starting to flow.\nAs I mentioned, the pipeline of commercial accounts is robust. We expect that to improve dramatically in the back half of the year. On the RPP, it's really interesting. We've had these new e-commerce entrants into the United States, and their volume, well, it's exploded. It was certainly more than we anticipated flowing into our network. To your question, is this a phenomenon forever?\nI don't know. It depends on what consumer demand will be. But we're going to focus on the parts of the market that really value our end-to-end service and expect to see some of the pressure that we saw on the RPP in the Q2 moderate. Brian, maybe you can give a little bit more color on what we think the RPP will look like in the back half of the year.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah. So as Carol mentioned, yes, we do expect the RPP growth to moderate in the back half. Actually, as we move from kind of the -2.6% that we're at to almost approach break-even as we get towards the end of the year. There's a couple of pieces of that. Carol had mentioned the B2B piece. I would say the bright spot within B2B is returns that improved 3%.\nWe are seeing uptake with the addition of Happy Returns into the portfolio. As that pipeline builds and we start to see that pull through, that continues to accelerate our B2B business. The other thing I would say is that we do have a strong pipeline of ground-ready products. And what happens with the SurePost product is it allows you to get new customers in, leveraging that. We get the integration into their systems. We get the pickup process set up, and they become part of the UPS portfolio that then allows us to expand that as we go through these cycles.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nMaybe one other comment about SurePost, because the question may be, do you like that product? We actually like the product. It provides a steady solution for us. We also, through our matching algorithm, we can redirect the packages back into the ground network. In fact, the redirect percentage was 40%. That's returning back to levels we saw during the COVID.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, great. Good morning. Carol or Brian, I guess the spread of margins. Can you talk about kind of the reaction we should see in Q3? I guess typically we see maybe 100 basis points pullback. I just want to get seasonality, or kind of flow that we should expect through the year.\nAnd then I think you mentioned the 90 basis points of pure pricing. I want to understand the margin impact there. Is that just a fraction of GRI? Has that shifted as well? Thanks.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nMaybe I'll talk about the RPP, and then you can talk about the margin. On the base pricing, there are many dynamics on the base pricing. First, we were up against very tough comparisons from a year ago. Why? Well, you'll recall that our volume declined in the United States in Q2 by almost 10%. This was related to noise around the labor contract negotiation.\nIf you look at who declined during that timeframe, it was predominantly dual sourcers who were low GRI customers. Last year's base pricing was a bit artificially inflated because of just the mix change. If you roll forward now to this year, what you see in the base pricing is, okay, the tough comparisons year-on-year, as well as new entrants that don't have a GRI because they're starting to shift with us for the first time. Then finally, if you zoom out and say, well, what's the key rate looking like on those customers who have a GRI? The key rate is looking about 50%.\nSo as we get past this timeframe and get into an easier compare, that's why we think our base rates can improve dramatically from where it was in the second half. Maybe you can talk about the margins.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah. Ken, I'll give you a little bit of shaping for how we think the second half is going to go because we do have confidence in how we're going to be able to pull through the margin. First, if you think about in the US from Q3 to Q4, we expect ADV to be up around kind of mid-single digits. We do, as we just talked about, the decline in RPP growth will moderate to about -1.5% in the third quarter, -5% in the fourth quarter. As we get to peak and we see the holiday demand surcharges, we expect that to get even better.\nWe expect op profits to be up kind of double digits in Q3. In December, as Carol had mentioned before, we're going to hit a 10% operating margin. In International, Q3 ADV is kind of flat to slightly positive year-over-year, with Q4 up mid-single digits and the RPP growth of 1% to 2 year-over-year in the second half. Our Q3 op margin is in the high teens and then getting to over 20% in Q4. Continuing that strong momentum in International. Then we expect a mid-teens revenue growth in SDS and stronger year-over-year profit growth in Q3 and Q4, with the second half up about 20%.\nLook, I think we've got a lot of confidence that we can pull through the second half forecast for a couple of reasons. One is we've got line of sight to the volume. We've shown the volume momentum has been building. We've got a line of sight to the volume that we need to deliver the top line. That helps offset some of the RPP growth, and you can see that in the guide. On the cost side, Fit-to-Serve is on track.\nWe have reduced 11,500, or 90%, of the resources that we had anticipated. Then we've also got line of sight to revenue improvements that are in the pipeline as well that are going to help us drive better profitability as we get to the second half. We absolutely feel confident that we're back to the point of revenue growth, profit growth, and back to margin expansion in the US.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nJust one other piece of color. Don't forget that we're anniversary in our labor contract on 1 August. So the pressure associated with that contract moderates dramatically in the back half.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThat's right. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Ravi Shankar of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nRavi Shankar\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Good morning. A two-parter, if I may, please. I mean, you've done a pretty good job of kind of managing your largest customer in terms of size. Will you be looking to also meter the growth from these new e-commerce customers as part of better, not bigger if the mix is not being helpful? Second question is, can you help us dimension the size of returns in your operation, either in terms of volume or revenue, please? Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nFirst, in terms of our largest customer, we have a very good relationship with that customer. The revenue for the quarter was at 11.5% of total revenue, so about the same as it was a year ago. We look forward to continuing to optimize the relationship we had with that customer. In terms of the new e-commerce entrants that have come into our network, we are focused on serving the segments of the opportunities that really respect our end-to-end network, and we will continue to do that. One reason why we're leaning so hard into healthcare. Another reason why we're leaning so hard into SMBs.\nWe couldn't say enough goodness about our SMB business, particularly our Digital Access Program, where the revenue grew 7.7% year-on-year. We now have 38 partners around the world in that program and over 5.8 million shippers on the program. Returns, Brian, want to comment on that?\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah. So Ravi, returns rolls up into our B2B product and also into the ground commercial breakout that we give. Returns is a portfolio that UPS has had for a long time that we continue to add to and be a leader in. It's one that we've continued to see growth in B2B, even when we've had pressures in other parts of the business.\nIt leverages not only our kind of single-piece returns and technology capabilities that enable customers to integrate with their process, but also the UPS store footprint, which allows us to have a very unique returns offering. Now, when you add Happy to that, we're able to do consolidated returns. It really becomes a unique portfolio that provides growth in B2B.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nAnd Matt Guffey is here. Maybe, Matt, you want to comment on Happy Returns and how the integration's going?\n\nMatt Guffey\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial and Strategy Officer, UPS\n\nAbsolutely. Happy Returns integration has been extremely important. Remember, we made that acquisition last November. We turned on all 5,200 stores in a matter of eight weeks, which gives us great scale. And with this, to Brian's point, it's just not about the digital capabilities, but it's also about that physical footprint and the experience that you can drive for not just the consumer, but also the shipper. We continue to see growth from the Happy Returns portfolio, but it's also complementary to the single-piece returns as well.\nAs we think about no box, no label and consolidation, we're also doing the no box, no label single-piece. It allows consumers and shippers to get the benefit and managing the rules on how they want the returns to come back to them.\n\nRavi Shankar\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Group\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. Brian, can you just clarify? You're saying the US package EBIT will be up double digits. Are you sort of pointing us towards around that 10% growth rate? And then, just because double digits can obviously mean a lot.\nThen, bigger picture, Carol, at the Analyst Day, you talked about industry oversupply. We're seeing negative yields. It doesn't feel like there's a lot of pricing power right now. But in that context, the peak season surcharges coming are really big. We were just surprised by the magnitude of them. I guess my question is, are we at an inflection point where you think you can start pushing price more aggressively?\nThis is a turn. Is this just a unique quarter with a compressed peak? I just want to understand. The peak surcharges seem to go in contrast with what we're seeing in underlying price and yield right now. I just want to understand if we're at a turning point. Well, let's talk about the margin first, and then we'll talk about peak.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah. Scott, I think what I was talking about was the shaping of Q3 to Q4. In Q3, yes, we expect a Domestic package EBIT to be up in the 10% to 15 range. Then it'll moderate a little bit. The growth will moderate a little bit in Q4 as the comp levels out. Carol, do you want to talk about it?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nI'm happy to talk about peak. It is a condensed peak. It's the most condensed peak since 2019. There are only 17 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. As we look at the volume projections for peak, we are expecting on our peak day, which is 18 December, to have the highest volume ever in our network. Now, when you have that kind of volume flowing through your network, you actually have to charge to service it well because you have to hire people and lease aircraft and delivery vehicles, so on and so forth.\nWe think that the prices are going to stick because of what the environment is telling us from a demand perspective. I would also say, candidly, they're up against very easy comparisons from last year because, as you recall, while we peaked, volume was declining in the network. The year-over-year comparisons and the fact that this peak is tight gives us confidence. That being said, we also have an opportunity to price moving from the art of pricing to the science of pricing through the new tools that we have been talking to you about.\nPricing architecture of the future gives us the opportunity to use modifiers and price that creates opportunities for value for our customers as well as value for ourselves. That plus deal manager, which has been a huge home run for us. We are winning more deals at less discounts than we have in the past. And Matt, maybe I'll turn it back over to you for a comment on price.\n\nMatt Guffey\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial and Strategy Officer, UPS\n\nYeah. First off, we think we're competing in a rational pricing environment today. To Carol's point, I think about it in three segments. One, she hit on some of the mediums. We also talked about our Digital Access Program where we have the ability to leverage the architecture of tomorrow. The way to think about the technology, if I could just give you context, is the technology is dynamic pricing across all customer segments and all channels.\nWe've leveraged it to win in the Digital Access Program. Carol highlighted Deal Manager. How you think about now moving forward, which I think is really exciting for us, is now we have the ability through the modifiers that she highlighted to dynamically price across our enterprise customers to better align our price to our cost to serve while also providing the best value for our customers. Hopefully that's helpful, Scott.\n\nScott Group\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, good afternoon or good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Carol, when you came in, there was a lot of focus on value over volume. But here we are guiding down the back half on really easy comps through growth and lower value volume. Has something changed in your focus for the company? What should investors take away from this sort of what seems like a pivot towards chasing volume again?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYeah. We're not chasing volume. We actually accepted new customers into our network with certain volume expectations that blew up on us. We're not chasing it. It's just their demand was much higher than we had anticipated. And so we're laser-focused on focusing on the segments of the market that value our end-to-end network.\nBetter not bigger has not gone away. We'll be managing through this. We need to manage through it, and we will be managing through it. Don't read anything into this other than we had new customers come into our network whose volume blew up. We were able to serve that with the best on-time service of any carrier.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nCarol, if I can just add one thing because I think the value of the volume is also very important. While we had a lot more SurePosts in the network, it is important to reinforce this point that SurePosts ride in the same feeders and the same hubs that all the other packages do, and it helps us drive incremental productivity. Our achievable utilization was up in the feeder network. Our hub productivity was up. Our preload productivity was up.\nWhen you look at what that does with cost per piece, the US business was able to hold cost per piece to a 2.5% growth rate in the face of a 12% increase in compensation rate. So that alone is huge. You layer on top of that the impact that it can have on the delivery side with the redirect and really driving stop and route density. The volume generates productivity improvements throughout the entire network that now we have the ability to manage as we move forward.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nI guess I appreciate that. But when you think about the guidance you just gave for Q3 being up 10% to 15 off a really low base, it just doesn't seem like it's dropping to the bottom line. That's what investors are looking to capitalize on your earnings, not necessarily productivity or cost per piece growth.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYeah. No, we appreciate that. We do. There are a number of actions that we can take to address this, but we thought it was important to provide guidance today that's the most realistic view of the back half of the year.\nDoesn't mean that this is the future of our company. In fact, as we mentioned, we will exit Q2 with a 10% operating margin. That's a significant change from where we have been.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nAll right. Thank you for the time.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe touching on that last response, Carol, what are some of the things that you can do to adjust to the network changes that we're seeing and the product mix changes that we're seeing?\nIs there ability to pull forward, Fit-to-Serve, cost takeout, some of the other network structure changes? I guess just how do you fix profitability running at that lower level as it is right now?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nOne way is to accelerate Network of the Future. I get a review from the team every two weeks on what we're doing in that regard. While we've committed to five additional closures in the back half of this year, I think there's an opportunity to do more. Nando, would you like to comment on that?\n\nNando Cesarone\n\nEVP and President US, UPS\n\nYeah. There sure is. Look, I would just say the Operators and the engineers are in tip-top shape right now. Our network is matching to the actual activity that is occurring. I will tell you there's additional opportunity. As we've closed 35 operations this year, we've got additional in the second half.\nAlso, we're starting on 23 new projects that is going to drive additional automation into our efficiency. As you start to see the efficiency unfold, we talked about the hours versus the volume, our air volume versus block hours. Of course, there's a lot of discussion about SurePost. We're up 300 basis points, making sure we're matching that product with every other package in our network to reduce our operational costs.\nAs we find those opportunities, we continue making sure we're pressing forward. For what it's worth, the value of all of that is one, very efficient, very safe, and pleasing network to our customers.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nAnd Kate, the same is true outside of the United States. So what cost-out activities are you focused on?\n\nKate Gutmann\n\nEVP of Resident International, Healthcare, and Supply Chain Solutions, UPS\n\nYeah. Carol, I think the important move that we made at the start of the year that is playing out in the second half, and you can see it in the margins, of course, is the flattening of our structure. We actually were focused on how do we speed up from the customer to the decision-making, and we eliminated a whole layer throughout the world. We are getting great feedback both from the customer as well as from our people. One example of that, also playing off of what Matt talked about with deal manager, we have actually shaved off two weeks of pricing time Internationally.\nInternational is very complex. Every bid is different countries and different cost structures. To be able to do that and get it down now into a two-day turn time or less for our SMBs, that's why we're seeing an over 60% SMB mix in the International arena as well. So both sides of the profit equation.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nProductivity is a virtuous cycle here at UPS. I think we've shown that we can drive cost out, and we will continue to do that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Bruce Chan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nHey, thanks, Operator. And good morning, everyone. Brian, you talked a little bit about the line of sight of volumes in the back half. I'm wondering if maybe you could give us a bit more color on where RPP or yield trends have been moving into Q3 so far. I ask this because I think we saw a little bit of a deterioration, maybe a surprise deterioration on those metrics last quarter. It seems like that move was not expected.\nI'm just kind of curious what makes you so confident that the mix issues and the trade-down issues that surprised us have kind of stabilized here and won't continue to deteriorate. Then maybe just worth a shot here, but is it possible to talk about what Domestic volume growth would have been without that e-commerce customer?\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nCertainly, on the first point around the RPP growth rate, I think when you take a look at the Q2, you do have to remember the comp is a big issue in the Q2. We did see quite a shift from Q1 to Q2. As we go into Q3 and Q4, we do expect the growth rate to moderate, sorry, the negative growth rate to moderate. It will improve to about -1.4% in Q3, -0.4% in Q4, and that will continue to improve as we go through the back half. There's a couple of things that are going on there.\nOne is we absolutely have line of sight to new customers that are going to be coming on that normalize the mix of volume that we have. Also, we have seen the wave of these kind of new entrants come into the market, and the volume levels are stabilized. We're working with those customers on what those forecasts look like in the back half. We have better line of sight to that. Related to your second question, we invited these customers into our network.\nI think the idea of what they would look like if they weren't there, it doesn't really matter, right? Because they are, they're there. We found a way to make this volume very efficient within our network. And look, we'll continue to grow in the places of the market that are growing faster.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS",
    "content2": "And just on the line of sight question, we've really tightened up the visibility as to when we win an account versus when it actually comes into the network. I will say our visibility there wasn't as sharp as it should have been. We've gotten much better now. We are holding everyone accountable for getting the cardboard onto the package cart. And that makes a, well, it may not be cardboard. It may be a poly bag, but the package onto the package cart.\nSo I feel much better than I have over the past several years, candidly, in terms of our visibility on onboarding.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. Carol, following up on the pipeline, you mentioned that several times in terms of the visibility, the types of customers, the confidence coming through there. Maybe you can elaborate on that last comment given just how that one large customer, our e-commerce customer, surprised the upside when the volumes blew up. And then separately, can you give us an update on the USPS contract, how it's going so far, any surprises, and whether or not that was a big contributor to the updated 2024 guide? Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYes. Yes. To be perfectly clear, there were two new e-commerce customers that came into our network. And you can imagine who they are.\nThese are new e-commerce shippers in the United States whose volume has been quite explosive. We are working through those relationships as we speak. As it relates to the USPS, Nando, would you like to comment on how that's going?\n\nNando Cesarone\n\nEVP and President US, UPS\n\nYeah. Sure. I think with regards to the USPS, both teams are actually face-to-face planning and executing so far close to 50% of the change. We'll continue pushing forward. We'll be fully implemented in terms of the UPS network in place to serve the USPS on 8 September. And contract really starts officially 1 October, where we'll see all of the volume come over to UPS.\nSo far, in recognition of two parties getting together for the first time in this regard, there's been some bumps, but nothing systemic. So it's working out really well on both sides, professionals from the USPS and UPS really doing some good work here.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nConor Cunningham\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nHi, everyone. Thank you. I was hoping you could provide some color just on revenue contribution for Estafeta and then maybe price paid. And then just bigger picture, how you're viewing the M&A landscape now.\nAre you happy with the portfolio? How are the returns of the businesses that you have are acquiring holding up right now? Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWe're super excited about the Estafeta announcement. Acquiring companies in Mexico isn't easy. The teams worked very hard to get us to this point. We'll work through all the closing conditions. We hope to have the acquisition closed by the end of the year. Together, UPS and Estafeta will be a billion-dollar-plus business.\nThis firmly cements our leadership position in North America. And we couldn't be more excited about it. Do you want to take the second part of the question?\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah, certainly. And then, Kate, maybe you'll want to talk about the broader piece of it. But I think Estafeta, just to give you a little bit of context, it covers 95% of the population of Mexico with 145 facilities.\nThis is a fairly large business. It does about 325,000 pieces a day. It gives you context of where it fits into the portfolio. And it fits very firmly within our nearshoring strategy. And Kate, did you want to add anything on that?\n\nKate Gutmann\n\nEVP of Resident International, Healthcare, and Supply Chain Solutions, UPS\n\nYeah, absolutely. So think about, first of all, that 300,000 pieces, all those shippers, they need a transborder or cross-border solution that is quality and that has access to the best small package network in the US. That's what we give it. So it's the additional packages. I'll answer that other part of the question on our track record with the acquisitions. If you look back at Marken, also Bomi, onto MNX, all of them are meeting their business cases as well as their synergy, both on the revenue and cost side of the equation.\nBecause what it does is opens up, again, this end-to-end opportunity to these premium customers. We expect the same thing. We are ahead of the supply chain shift into Mexico. Our supply chain cross-border business is up double-digit. So this will only help with Estafeta as well.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nAnd I know you asked about the purchase price. We typically don't disclose the purchase price, but I can give you a hint. Brian said that we accessed the debt capital markets in Q2 and raised some additional debt capital for growth. It's about $1.2 billion. We're not spending $1.2 billion on the business. So that gives you a sense of where the purchase price is going to be.\nIn terms of the portfolio of assets that we have, we looked at strategic alternatives for Coyote. We are delighted to reach an agreement with RXO to sell Coyote to that business at a great value, higher than our carrying value. And the multiple on EBITDA was over 12x. I'm just really pleased with the value that we received or will receive when we close that transaction. And we're always looking at the portfolio of assets.\nAre there other things that we can optimize or monetize? We're never done. But there's nothing large that would need to be talked about today.\n\nBrian Dykes\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nStephen, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from the line of Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nAnalyst, Susquehanna\n\nThanks for taking my questions. If you go back to the trade-down discussion in the SurePost, can you talk a little bit high level about how that business moves through your network and what's different about it that better matches the cost of that package with the lower yield for that package? And just extending that a little bit further, if SurePost is a higher mix of the Domestic business than you'd expected longer term, what nuance changes would there need to be with the network to make that a better fit? Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, SurePost is a great product in many ways. As I mentioned, it is a Sunday solution for us. And we are, with our matching algorithm, able to redirect volume. So it's delivered in our ground network. Maybe Nando, you want to give a little bit more color of how does that work?\n\nNando Cesarone\n\nEVP and President US, UPS\n\nYeah, sure. And as Brian mentioned earlier, I mean, SurePost is going to flow through our network, regular feeders, regular hubs, and sortation. What we're working on and very close to solving is looking ahead more than one day so we can match even more of those SurePost shipments. So right now, if a package shows up at a destination that particular morning, we will match that package with other deliveries for that day. The option moving forward is to look for additional matching opportunities.\nWe're very close to that solution so we can actually look further out. In total, as I said before, we're matching a lot more, about 3% more than last year. And each one is offsetting the cost and providing profitability to that shipment or that delivery, if you will, to that one location.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nSo that matching capability then creates more delivery density, which is a big value unlock for us. We've talked about in the past, every 10 basis points of improvement is a couple hundred million dollars. So this is an important initiative to make this product even more attractive to us over time.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nAnalyst, Susquehanna\n\nThank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nI would now like to turn the—I would now like to turn the conference back over to our host, Mr. Guido. Please go ahead.\n\nPJ Guido\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, UPS\n\nThank you, Stephen. This concludes our call. Thank you for joining and have a good day.\n\nOperator\n\nYou have reached a non-working number at UPS. Please hang up and dial one."

Consolidated operating margin was 8%. Our operating profit performance was a bit better than we expected due to higher productivity. At our investor and analyst day last month, we shared our three-year targets and how we intend to reach them under our better and bolder approach. We are reimagining our network through Network of the Future, and we are leaning into the parts of the market that value our end-to-end integrated network. For example, we recently announced that UPS will become the primary air cargo provider for the United States Postal Service. Under this contract, we will move most of the USPS air cargo within the United States. The USPS air cargo business fits beautifully with our strategy to grow our B2B business. To win, we put together an innovative and differentiated solution that leverages our integrated network and existing assets.\nThe USPS air cargo business will contribute to top-line growth and be accretive to consolidated and US domestic operating margins. Brian will share more details, including what to expect during the transition period and where this will show up in our financial reporting. Moving to our strategic update, through our customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy, we are investing to grow in the premium parts of the market and drive efficiency. Let me give you a few recent examples. Starting with customer-first, through our on-demand network, we are expanding our addressable market with capabilities like no-box, no-label returns through Happy Returns, and the convenience of our more than 5,200 UPS Store locations. During the Q1, our overall returns volume in the US increased 1.4%, and Happy Returns more than quadrupled its ADV in the Q1. Returns are attractive to us for a couple of reasons.\nFirst, they are typically B2B movements, and as a result, drive pickup and delivery density. Second, our frictionless offering creates customer loyalty and repeat business. We're also expanding our addressable market with capabilities like big and bulky deliveries through Roadie. In the Q1, we launched RoadieXD, which adds cross-dock capabilities to RoadieXL. Our cross-dock solution brings the digital and physical together for long-zone deliveries of bulky items such as grills and furniture that do not fit in the UPS small package network. This is enabling us to unlock additional revenue opportunities in the highly fragmented $60 billion big and bulky market in the US. It's still early days, but this is a large opportunity for us to grow quality revenue and profit, and serve the needs of our customers.\nAs we laid out at our investor day, our long-term target is to grow our US SMB volume penetration to 40%. DAP, our digital access program, is one of the tools we will use to reach this target. Recently, we enhanced our DAP pricing capabilities by launching a solution we call Fastlane. With Fastlane, we can optimize rates and target attractive volume growth, whether it be by partner, by product, or by customer segment, all of which can drive revenue per piece growth. We can even target volume growth by geography to drive density. Prior to Fastlane, rate and other adjustments in DAP could take months. Now we can make them in a matter of days or even hours. In terms of results, in Q1, DAP revenue grew by 3% year-over-year, and in 2024, we expect to generate over $3 billion in global DAP revenue.\nSpeaking of SMBs, over the last year, we've gained traction on improving the customer experience across 16 journeys. Take pickup. We redesigned our process and deployed new driver dispatch technology. This resulted in a 74% reduction in pickup concerns and a Net Promoter Score, or NPS, of 48 for this journey, which is an all-time high for UPS. For our international customers, our next-gen brokerage solution is making it easier for SMBs to navigate the ins and outs of exporting, as evidenced by a 40% decline in custom brokerage holds since April 2023. Turning to healthcare, we aim to become the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world. Healthcare companies are innovating, and so are we. Our latest example is the opening of Labport at Worldport, our global air hub in Louisville, Kentucky. Labport is unique. It's an end-of-the-runway, state-of-the-art facility built specifically for lab customers.\nBy being at Worldport, we can deliver urgent air packages to our lab customers well before the sun comes up, so they can provide diagnostic results by early morning. In terms of healthcare revenue, in Q1, revenue from our healthcare portfolio reached $2.6 billion. Outside the United States, we're continuing to enhance our network to grow our premium international business. Our most recent example is the launch of next-day flights between Shenzhen, China, and Sydney, Australia. The addition of these flights enables faster import and export movements between 11 Asian markets and Australia. Now, exports from Australia can even reach Europe by the next business day. This enhancement further enables us to serve our customers, particularly those that are in high-tech, manufacturing, and healthcare, as they are shifting their supply chains in response to changing international trade flows. Now, let's turn to innovation-driven.\nAs we've discussed, Network of the Future includes physical and digital changes that will deliver benefits in the short-term and the long-term. Smart Package, Smart Facility, our RFID solution, is a great digital example. We are moving from a scanning network to a sensing network. Following last year's Phase 1 deployment to our preload operations, this year we are installing RFID readers in over 40,000 US package cars, with the balance to be completed in 2025. Package car readers will enable us to further reduce our misloads, which will improve efficiency and the customer experience. The physical aspect of Network of the Future has launched, and in the quarter, we continue to close sorts and flow more volume into automated facilities. Most of the Phase 1 major projects we outlined during our investor day have begun and are in the contracting and execution phases.\nInnovation-driven is also about achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. We recently published our 22nd sustainability report, and we are well on our way to achieving our goal. In 2023, our Scope 1, 2, and 3 CO2 emissions declined 8.1% compared to 2022. We operate more than 18,000 alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles in our rolling laboratory, and the use of alternative fuels in our ground operations reached 28.8% last year, keeping us on track to achieve our target of 40% by 2025. Moving to our outlook, we are reaffirming our previously announced 2024 consolidated financial goals. In 2024, we expect to generate consolidated revenue ranging from approximately $92 billion to 94.5 billion and a consolidated operating margin ranging from approximately 10% to 10.6%.\nVersus last year, we still expect first-half earnings to decline and second-half earnings to grow as we lap the first year of the Teamsters contract, and we still expect to exit the year with a US operating margin of 10%. As we move forward, we are staying on strategy, and under our better and bolder approach, we are pursuing our declaration to become the premium small package provider and logistics partner in the world. With that, thank you for listening, and now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover four areas. First, I'll review our Q1 results, followed by our 2024 financial outlook. Then I'll provide some comments on our business with the USPS, and lastly, I'll close with a recap of our 2026 targets. While the macro environment in the Q1 showed improvement in some areas, continued soft demand pressured all three parts of our business. Through the quarter, we adjusted our integrated network to match volume levels and drove out expense while maintaining industry-leading service levels. Moving to our financial results, our overall quarterly performance was in line with our expectations. In the Q1, consolidated revenue was $21.7 billion, down 5.3% compared to the Q1 of 2023. All three of our segments demonstrated cost agility and, on a combined basis, drove down expense by $414 million in the Q1.\nThis enabled us to deliver $1.7 billion in consolidated operating profit, and consolidated operating margin was 8%. Diluted earnings per share was $1.43, down 35% from the Q1 of 2023. Now let's look at our business segments. In US domestic, we remained focused on controlling what we could control to improve volume growth and drive productivity. In the Q1, average daily volume was down 3.2% year-over-year. When looking at ADV sequentially, the growth rate showed strong improvement compared to the third and Q4s of 2023. B2B average daily volume was down 5.5% compared to the Q1 of last year, primarily driven by declines in the retail and manufacturing sectors, and B2B represented 41.6% of our volume.\nLooking at product mix, and in line with recent trends, we continued to see a shift from air to ground as customers prioritized cost savings over transit times by taking advantage of our ground services. Compared to the Q1 of 2023, total air average daily volume was down 8.3%. Ground declined 2.3%, and within ground, SurePost volume grew 10.8%. For the quarter, US domestic generated revenue of $14.2 billion, down 5%. Revenue per piece was relatively flat year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers, base rates increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 240 basis points. This was offset by a couple of factors. First, changes in customer and product mix due to growth in SurePost, combined with changes in package characteristics, decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 180 basis points.\nSecond, changes in fuel prices decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 90 basis points. Turning to cost, total expense was down 0.8%, or $104 million in the Q1. Union wage rates increased 13%, driven by the contractual increase that went into effect last August. Leveraging technology and the agility of our integrated network, we took several actions which more than offset the increase in compensation. We leveraged Total Service Plan and network planning tools to reduce total operational hours by 6.6%, which was more than the decline in average daily volume. We closed 18 sorts and reduced operational resources by 4.8% compared to last year. We lowered block hours by 15.2% versus last year. We reduced management and support staff by approximately 5,400 positions year-over-year. In addition, we reduced purchased transportation by 17%, primarily from our continued optimization efforts.\nAnd lastly, lower fuel costs contributed to the decrease in total expense. The US domestic segment delivered $839 million in operating profit, down 43.6% compared to Q1 2023, and operating margin was 5.9%. Moving to our international segment, the macro environment remained challenged, primarily in Europe and Asia. However, volume growth in the Americas region showed early signs of nearshoring. In the Q1, international total average daily volume was down 5.8% year-over-year. About 2/3 of the decline came from lower domestic average daily volume, which was down 8.1%, driven primarily by declines in Canada and major markets in Europe. On the export side, average daily volume declined 3.6% year-over-year, primarily due to weak manufacturing activity in Europe. In Asia, export average daily volume was down 4.8%, which was an improvement from Q4 2023.\nWithin Asia, export volume on the China to US lane increased 12.8% and showed steady growth for the second consecutive quarter. More than offsetting the overall decline in Asia, nearshoring became evident as export average daily volume in the Americas region increased 3.8%. This was led by SMB customers in Canada and Mexico leveraging our cross-border ground service. In Q1, international revenue was $4.3 billion, down 6.3% from last year, primarily due to the decline in volume. Revenue per piece increased 2% and included a number of moving parts. Strong base pricing drove a 360 basis points increase in the revenue per piece growth rate. A decline in fuel surcharge revenue, combined with a stronger US dollar, negatively impacted the revenue per piece growth rate by 80 basis points. Finally, lower demand-related surcharge revenue decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 80 basis points.\nIn Q1, total international expense was down $163 million, a decline of 4.4%. Similar to previous quarters, we leveraged the agility of our integrated network to reduce block hours by 6.6%. Operating profit in the international segment was $682 million, down $124 million year-over-year. Operating margin in Q1 was 16%. Now looking at supply chain solutions, in Q1, revenue was $3.2 billion, down 5.3% year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers, within forwarding, market rates in international air freight continue to drive down top-line revenue. On the ocean side, excess market capacity continued to pressure market rates and drove a decrease in revenue despite volume growth. Our truckload brokerage unit continued to face soft demand and market rate pressures. Logistics delivered revenue growth and increased operating profit, driven by gains in healthcare.\nIn Q1, supply chain solutions generated operating profit of $226 million, down $32 million year-over-year, and an operating margin of 7%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $195 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $67 million, and our effective tax rate for Q1 was 26.8%. Now let's turn to cash and shareholder returns. In Q1, we generated $3.3 billion in cash from operations. Free cash flow for the period was $2.3 billion. We finished the quarter with strong liquidity and no outstanding commercial paper. Also in Q1, UPS rewarded shareholders with $1.3 billion in dividends. Turning to our outlook, as Carol mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2024 consolidated financial targets.\nFor the full year 2024, on a consolidated basis, revenues are expected to range between $92 and 94.5 billion, and we expect to generate a consolidated operating margin ranging from approximately 10% to 10.6%. Looking at the shape of the year, in the first half of the year, we expect consolidated operating profit to be down between 20% and 30%. In the back half of the year, we expect volume and revenue growth to accelerate as we lap the diversion we experienced as a result of our labor negotiations. Additionally, our labor cost growth rate will drop substantially. We will also see the majority of the $1 billion in savings from Fit to Serve. We still expect revenue per piece to outperform cost per piece. Lastly, in US domestic, we expect to exit the year at a 10% operating margin.\nLooking at cash flow and capital spending, for the full year in 2024, we still expect capital expenditures to be within our target of around 5% of revenue, or $4.5 billion. We're reviewing certain aspects of our pension strategy, and so we expect free cash flow to be within a range of approximately $5.9 to 6.7 billion before reflecting any pension contributions. Now let me share more detail about servicing air cargo for the USPS. This is good business for us, and we are moving quickly to begin onboarding this cargo. We will leverage our integrated network and existing assets, and we expect the majority of the volume will fit within our current US domestic daytime flight operations. Our operators and engineers are already planning the network to support the complete transition to UPS in Q3.\nIn terms of financial reporting, the revenue and expense associated with USPS air cargo will show up in the SCS other line in our financial reporting. Adding the USPS air cargo volume to our existing network will result in a higher share of the network cost being allocated to SCS, indirectly benefiting our US domestic segment. We expect to see a benefit to operating margins this year at both the consolidated level and within the US domestic segment. To wrap up, we are also reaffirming our three-year consolidated revenue and operating margin targets we put forth at our March Investor and Analyst Day. Specifically, we aim to grow revenue to be between $108 and 114 billion by 2026. The high end of the range includes inorganic opportunities, primarily in healthcare and international.\nAdditionally, we expect to expand our consolidated operating margin to more than 13% by 2026, which includes expanding our domestic operating margin to at least 12%. I'll note that the USPS volume is consistent with our better and bolder approach to grow in the parts of the market that leverage our integrated network, and it gives us a strong start toward our 2026 targets. With that, thank you, and Operator, please open the lines.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nEric Morgan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning. This is Eric Morgan. I'm for Brandon. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about the guidance in the first half.\nI know you mentioned Q1 kind of coming in line with your expectations, but you did call out the 40% decline expectation at the investor day. So just wondering if anything happened late in the quarter that drove EBIT above your expectations in the Q1. And then are there anything negative going on in Q2 that led you to maintain the first half guidance rather than raise it similar to the Q1 beat? Thank you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nMorgan, good morning. It's Brian. Happy to take this one. Look, our guidance for the first half of the year remains the same, declining in profit down 20% to 30%, so that's consistent. I did call out at the tail end of the quarter expected -40%. I've said consistently that Q1 would be the tougher quarter in the first half of the year.\nThere were two elements that contributed to beating that 40%. One, on the top line, we did see positive volume momentum going into the end of the quarter. In fact, the last couple of weeks were basically break-even from a volume perspective. I think the last week was about 0%, thereabout. So sequentially, we were seeing improved volume, but the bigger component was just some cost trading between April and March 2024. Things like occupancy and maintenance costs shift in terms of when they hit the P&L between March and April 2024. So no change from a guide perspective, still down 20% to 30%, some cost timing at the end of the quarter there, but the positive was the trajectory of volume momentum. Thanks, Morgan.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThanks. Carol, Brian, can you just provide a bit more details on the contribution margins associated with the USPS contract? This was a zero-margin business that your direct competitor, and somewhat surprisingly, is now moving from your direct competitor to you. It kind of harkens back to kind of pre-2020 when UPS was less price-disciplined. And so can you just assuage concerns that this wasn't one on price and just talk a little bit in more detail? I know you're obviously raising some block hours to service this volume, but what other costs do you kind of expect to bring on to service this billion, billion and a half of incremental revenue? Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, thanks very much for your question, Amit, and we're delighted to have won the air cargo business from USPS. Our team put together an innovative solution using our integrated network.\nAnd in contrast to traditional hub-and-spoke models, we don't have to run all of the air volume through our main air hub at Worldport. Of course, we will use Worldport, but we will also use our regional gateways. That allows for splits to occur outside of the network, so they'll be built at origin, and then we will bypass the main hub and go point to point. This is an integrated solution that's very different than, I think, the former provider offered. We also will use all of the assets of our integrated network, and that'll allow us to actually optimize block hours. Now, in terms of the investments that we need to make to service this volume, we have plenty of space on our existing aircraft, so we won't be purchasing any aircraft.\nWe will be hiring some pilots, but less than 200 pilots, and we factored all of that into the cost model that we built. So this will be margin accretive. It will be EPS accretive beginning in year one and through the life of the contract.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good morning. I wanted to see, Brian or Carol, if you could walk through what are the key pieces of the Q2 versus Q1 ramp in EBIT. And then I guess the same thing for second half. Obviously, you've got Fit to Serve as a significant cost benefit, Q2 versus Q1, but I think just trying to figure out how much of the improvement sequentially is based on volume that you have visibility to and how much would be based on anticipation of improvement in the broader parcel market, kind of macro improvement. Thank you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nHey, Tom, happy to take that. So listen, from a Q1 to Q2 perspective, the shape, if we look at the US, we would expect marginal growth from a volume perspective, which relative to past trends, normally Q1 steps down to Q2 from an absolute volume level. So by maintaining, that'll be a natural accretion from an EBIT perspective.\nThe big component, though, full year on a run rate basis, the Fit to Serve program will generate $1.3 billion in savings, and we're ramping that up in Q2, so that'll be a big driver as well as we think about it. And then from a Q1 to the back half of the year, it's the same three components: Fit to Serve, it's the volume lift along with the drivers of RPP, and then it's the labor contract lapping, which is the big piece in the back end of the year.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nAnd maybe just a few more comments on RPP since our RPP in the US was flat in the Q1. We expect to see RPP growth as we head towards the back half of the year. Why? Well, first of all, fuel prices were a drag on the RPP in the Q1.\nThe projection for fuel is that it's going to increase. We are also announcing a fuel surcharge later today. So those two components of fuel will be a bonus to RPP as we head towards the back half. We also are going to have a pretty peaky peak, we anticipate, for fewer operating days this year than last, which means the demand surcharge should be pretty strong this year compared to last year. And then we brought in a lot of SurePost product into our network. We're meeting our customers where they want to go. We'll be anniversarying a lot of that in the back half of the year as well. So we love SurePost, by the way, but we don't expect to see the drag on the RPP from SurePost in the back half like we did in the Q1. Any other color you'd like to provide?\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nI think all those that you stated, Carol, and then the volume growth, obviously with the comps, it's going to be a big help to us.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst of Transportation and Logistics, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Just sort of curious, you mentioned some actions taken in Q1, like closing sorts and working on peak purchase transport, etc., among other things. Can you maybe talk to some additional actions that are helping to drive the profit uplift from here, not related to the volumes and maybe the headcount reduction? Thanks.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, productivity is a virtuous cycle here at UPS, domestically and outside of the US. And I just can't say enough good things about how our team is running our business. Ours are running under the volume declines. We see higher productivity in cube utilization, packages per hour.\nWe measure productivity in minutes, miles, and packages per hour, and all across the board, we're seeing record levels. One different callout, because we've been talking about this for a while, is safety. Our safety stats, if you will, are the best they've been in five years. And of course, if you run a safer business, well, you don't have as many claims for workers' comp and auto liability. So a real shout-out to our operators. And then finally, you might say, well, why is the productivity getting better? One reason is because our turnover is down. And as people stay in place, well, they're just more productive. But let me throw it over. Nando, is there anything else you'd like to add on the productivity side?\n\nNando Cesarone\n\nEVP and President US, UPS\n\nNo, I'm actually quite impressed with our engineers and our operators. I think the best in the business. We're continuing to follow our game plan that we reviewed with you at the investor conference, which is keenly focused on closing down sorts, moving volume to our automation and our automated facilities. In fact, when I talked about pieces per headcount at our conference, we're actually up 2.7 in March. So we are pushing all of the things that help us be more productive and less reliant on labor.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nKate, outside the United States, in your world, talk about productivity.\n\nKate Gutmann\n\nEVP and President International of Healthcare and Supply Chain Solutions, UPS\n\nYeah, absolutely. It is a consistent value at UPS and something that all of us work very hard towards every day. So when you look at the major regions around the world, we're setting records on our cube utilization, both on the ground and in the air. As our margins show, we have a very good handle on expense management. As we're unlocking more of this segment growth, healthcare specifically, SMB around the world, it only fuels that further.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have a question from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey. Great. Good morning. Just international margins were a bit lower than we expected. Just maybe thoughts on increased costs. It sounded like you threw out some impacts of nearshoring. And then I guess, Brian, just a clarification. You said you're moving the US Postal Service or it will be listed in SCS and benefiting domestic. I just want to understand, are you shifting costs then out of domestic into SCS, or maybe just clarify that comment there?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, first, on the international margin, I think you did a terrific job of managing costs in an environment where demand was down. There was a one-time item that we didn't call out in our prepared remarks, but if you back out that one-time item, the international margin would be 17%. The Q1 is usually our lowest margin quarter. So we anticipate that the international business, and our planning for the international business, to be in the high teens, as we told you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nAnd then on the tonnage, in terms of USPS, comes in through SCS, but because we're using a lot of the US assets, we allocate costs to that business, and that will have a positive benefit on the domestic margin.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nAnd can you clarify what the one-time item was there?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nIt was a cleanup, really, in our revenue data mart. We just had some accounts we wrote off.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks a lot for the time. Appreciate it.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have a question from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, good morning. I got a couple of commercial questions for you. Can you talk about how the volume outlook outside of SurePost is shaping up? I think you mentioned in a couple of pockets the second derivative is getting better. But if you could talk about whether you feel better or worse about where volumes are going to end up in the year today versus when you started the year, that would be helpful. And then the second question would be on SurePost, 10% demand for anything in small package is a very high number. When are you going to have a chance to maybe address pricing in that product? Because it does sound like you have what looks like a relative advantage in terms of marketing against the lower end of the e-commerce small package market.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nSo from a volume mix perspective, if I look at the volume that's in our pipeline, I would say the volume that's in our pipeline is not SurePost. We've got commercial volume in our pipeline, additional enterprise volume in our pipeline. So we're going to meet our customers where they want to go, but the mix is looking very different as we look ahead than it was in Q1. And in terms of pricing, I don't think we're going to talk pricing on this very call, but we always look for opportunities to optimize our pricing.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nAnd the headwind we saw from a mix perspective, Carol alluded to this, in the back end of the year, we are anniversarying a fair amount of SurePost from last peak, and so the overlaps won't drive as big of a headwind.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have a question from the line of Scott.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nGo ahead.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have a question from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Group\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. Brian, so the Q2 guide, I guess, implies EBIT down anywhere from 10% to 30%. So any more directional color there? And then on this revenue cost allocation thing with the post office, is there any way to just quantify what the benefit is to the US margin as you're doing this? And is that already sort of captured in the 10% margin comment for Q4, or does this now take it up versus what you previously thought?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, maybe I'll talk about the full year guidance, and then you can talk specifically about the Q2. One of the questions may be, well, why aren't you changing your guidance now that you won this air cargo business, and you say it's going to be margin accretive? We were highly confident of the range of guidance that we provided at the end of the year, and we're even more confident now. But it's just too early in the year to change the guidance. So once we get through the Q2, we'll tell you what we think the back half of the year will be. On Q2 alone, why don't you talk about that?\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nSure. Scott, we're maintaining the first half at negative 20% to 30% from a profit perspective. So you can choose the element of the range you want to point towards. I think ADV in domestic, we're expecting Q2 to be slightly positive. RPP should be consistent with what we saw, flattish in the Q1, as we move out of the headwinds from a mixed perspective. And as Carol said, fuel and PSS in the back end of the year will help us. Cost per piece will get better in Q2, I'm sorry, in Q3 when we anniversary the cost of the labor contract, but somewhat similar from a Q2 perspective in the US.\nAnd then from an ADV perspective internationally, Kate's looking to see that business improve as we sequentially move over the course of the year. So I guess I would steer you towards the 20% to 30%. We've been very consistent on that from a profit standpoint for the first half, and you can squeeze it.\n\nScott Group\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nAnd then any thoughts on the postal shift and the margin benefit for Q4?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nSo here's what I'd like to do, Scott. Let's get through the Q2, and then we'll come back and give you more color. I'd like to get this volume. I'd like to get some of it into the network. We've modeled it out. I want to actually see how it performs. So we'll give you more color at the end of the Q2.\n\nScott Group\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have a question from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nRavi Shanker\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for the morning, everyone. Carol, in your opening comments, you mentioned that returns were a good business because they were B2B. I'm a little surprised to hear that because, I mean, it almost seems like a C2B type business with pretty high fragmentation in the last mile. So if we can just unpack kind of how that works through the supply chain and kind of the profit contribution of that, that would be great.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you. So we like the return business a lot. You're right. A consumer typically walks into a UPS Store to start the return. And we consolidate the returns at the UPS Store, and they are returned to the shipper. And that would be a B2B return. So if you think about, I'll use our largest customer for an example. We have returns through our UPS Stores with our largest customer. We take in thousands of returns for that customer and package it into one consolidated return that goes back to them.\nSo that's a good business for us. And with Happy Returns, now we were able to offer the same service, which is no box, no label. Same idea. Consumer walks in, they make the return, we consolidate it and return it back. That's how we think about it being a B2B business. And the margins are very attractive to us. It's density. That's one reason why the margins are so good, because you get density.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. Appreciate taking the question. Maybe one for Carol, one for Brian. Carol, can you just talk about, and you don't want to talk about too much about pricing, but your increase in the fuel surcharge by another 50 basis points, I think that's on top of 125 in December. So just wanted to see your thoughts on how the market could absorb that with some excess capacity. And do you still view fuel as sort of a lever in terms of all-in pricing? Then for Brian, maybe you can elaborate on the pension contribution strategy you talked about. It sounded like maybe the cash contribution was on hold until some other options were considered. So any more thoughts on that would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nSo on the fuel surcharge, as we look to the rest of the year, fuel prices are increasing. And this is not atypical for us to adjust our surcharge on the basis of rising fuel costs. You also should know that that doesn't impact all of our customers, clearly. Some are exempted from this. So in terms of the ability to stick, we think it will stick. And just a comment on the capacity. At our investor earnings day, we said there was about 12 million ADV excess capacity in the market, and that equilibrium is about six. You need about six. So really, the excess capacity is around six million pieces a day.\nWe think that will be fully absorbed by 2025. Now, you may say, Why? Well, we're part of that excess. So we're closing sorts. We're taking capacity out of the market. Our Network of the Future initiative is capacity neutral. Also, with our large competitors' consolidation efforts, capacity will be leaving the market. Then another player headquartered in Seattle, well, they're regional, I think, so capacity will be taken out of the market. So we think all that capacity will be absorbed, and the pricing environment is actually very rational.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nBrian, just on your secondary question around the pension, I had quoted free cash flow ex pension of $5.9 to 6.7 billion. We do have annual service costs in the $1.4 billion range. So from a modeling perspective, you can use that as a placeholder. But the reality is we're taking a look at strategic options on pension. It's a little bit too early these days to comment on that, but we'll come back later in the year and share our thinking and some of the actions and activities we're pursuing.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYeah. Our pensions are very well funded. They're over 90% funded. And it gives us an opportunity just to step back for a moment and just look at our asset liability strategy, our funding strategy. So we thought we should just pause right now, take a look at it, and then if we make any decisions, we'll share that with you.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Connor Cunningham of Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nConor Cunningham\n\nDirector of Travel and Transports Research, Melius Research\n\nHi everyone. Thank you. Just curious on your expectations for, I mean, sorry, you talked a little bit about volume inflecting soon, and you just talked about your expectations in terms of volumes as you move from first half to second half. I think previously you were talking about flat up to in the US domestic market, then you came in a little bit ahead. Just trying to understand how the back half starts to look outside of just comps being pretty easy. Thank you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nSo from an ADV perspective in domestic, I think that's where you're headed with a little bit of a slight tick up in positive volume in the Q2. We'll likely finish low single-digit decline in the first half. Second half, we'd expect that to be low single-digit increase. And you can look at it through various different lenses. We're building momentum ever since August.\nEach month is basically getting sequentially better. Each quarter from Q3, Q4, Q1 improves. We'd expect to see slight positive volume trends in the Q2. And then just from a comp standpoint, I mean, if I go back from a trend perspective, over the last 10 years, our Q3 is generally about close to 300,000 ADV better than Q1. So even if we assume flat from a Q3 to Q1, that would be 4.5% growth. So any way you cut it, we see the back end of the year. And most important, it's the visibility on the sales pipeline that we're pulling through and the volume levels we're seeing going into Q2.\n\nConor Cunningham\n\nDirector of Travel and Transports Research, Melius Research\n\nSuper helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Jonathan Chappell of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThank you. Good morning. Brian, you'd mentioned the $1 billion of productivity that you expected to see in the full year 2024 guide. Can you just tell us where that stands after the Q1 and how we think about the cadence throughout the rest of the year? Is it front half loaded, or is it kind of extrapolated evenly by quarter?\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah. The initiative is progressing slightly ahead of plan. Reductions began in March and will continue through Q2. We'd expect more than 80% of the resource reductions to be complete by Q2. We're on track to that $1 billion that I mentioned. And at a full annual run rate going into next year, we'd expect $1.3 billion. So there'll be some benefit early part of next year.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Daniel Imbro of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nYep. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Thanks for your questions. Wanted to follow up on the USPS contract. Carol, the air cargo, I think, should come into your network in the Q4. I think first, any business coming in sooner than that, just to clarify. Then looking at Q4 and the outlook, are there any minimum volume components to the agreement? I mean, obviously, that customer has moved a lot of freight out of the air network as it looks to save costs by using ground. It still looks like ground is cheaper out there. So how do you protect from more of that volume leaving the air cargo market into maybe slower transit times similar to the rest of your business? Thanks.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, clearly, we want to get all the volume onboarded before peak. That's in their interest and our best interest. We will onboard the volume as quickly as we can. Our teams are in Washington, DC, working with the postal service hand in hand as we build our operating plan.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nThanks for taking my questions. As you work on cash flow with the pension strategy stuff you've talked about that we might hear more about late this year, can you talk a little bit about the dividend? If you look at your payout guidance, it implies roughly $13 in earnings at the dividend level that you're paying now. Is there an opportunity to start to raise it more meaningfully before the earnings power of the business gets there, or do you think we need to wait and get more increases like we saw this year until the business is supporting that more linearly? Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWe have a disciplined approach when it comes to capital allocation. The first use of our cash, as you know, is to invest back into our business, and the second is to pay our dividend. We have a targeted dividend payout ratio of 50%. We are higher than that. It's our intent to earn back into a 50% payout ratio over time. We have no intent to cut the dividend to make that math work. We're going to earn back into it. And the dividend's an important part of the value proposition. So we just raise the dividend, and we look to, of course, subject to board approval, we look to raise the dividend every year. Any color you'd like to add there?\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nJust Carol, this year marks the 15th consecutive year we've increased the dividend, and we're committed to a stable and growing dividend. So we will earn back into that, but certainly committed to it.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nI failed to respond to Daniel's question about minimum levels within the USPS contract. I'd like to throw that over to Matt. Matt, could you answer that question?\n\nMatt Guffey\n\nEVP and CCO and CSO, UPS\n\nYes, absolutely. So thank you, Carol. First off, yeah, we do set minimums in the contract. As we built this, we identified a win-win for both the USPS and for us. It's just imperative that, one, we not only have it on the protection for our side and our business on what we're bringing on, excuse me, but also for the USPS, because we want to make sure, as Carol mentioned, that we're onboarded before peak season. We're bringing this on as quickly as possible, and we're working collectively with them. Nando and the team have done a great job with their operational team.And to Carol's point, we're meeting with them every week in DC to continue to onboard that volume to make sure it's a smooth transition.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThanks, Matt.\n\nOperator\n\nStephanie Moore of Jefferies, please go ahead.\n\nStephanie Moore\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to touch back on the volume commentary. If you could maybe discuss, in your eyes, what drove the improvement as the quarter progressed and your expectations into Q2, how much of this was from kind of actions within your own control and then, at the same time, maybe areas where the underlying environment is improving some over kind of what we've experienced over the last year? And in that case, where you've seen that improvement in the macro. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, I give a shout-out to our sales team. The improving volume trends are in large part due to their hard work and efforts. You may recall at the beginning of the year, we said the growth in the market wasn't going to be very growthy this year. So the fact that we're able to see sequential improvement in the magnitude that we're seeing is really because of our sales team. We are winning new. We are gaining additional penetration of existing customers. We are meeting customers where they want us to be. And our sales team will continue to do that around the world. And that's one reason that we're confident in the volume projections that Brian has shared.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Bruce Chan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector, Stifel\n\nHey, thanks. And good morning, everyone. Carol, just coming back to your DAP comment from the beginning of the call, I know that's a big part of your SMB growth efforts. I think you said you grew 3% in the Q1, and I can't help but notice that that's materially slowed in a lot of ways to a 2% growth rate. Yeah, reading a little bit too deeply into the transcript, you said the plan was over $3 billion, and then at the investor day, you said materially over $3 billion. So I just want to know if there's something happening that's driving a slower growth outlook for DAP.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYeah. Thank you for the question. And I think I got it. You broke up a bit, but it's generally about DAP. So last year, in the Q1, our DAP revenue grew 51%, and our volume grew 61%. So we didn't expect to repeat that kind of growth in the Q1 of this year.\nWe were very pleased with how the DAP portfolio performed in Q1 because it was in line with our expectations. We had anticipated a slower growth in Q1 because there were a couple of our partners that we were working on amending the T's and C's. We expected the growth rate to be slower and then to pick up as we move into Q2 and the rest of the year. The projections for the DAP around the world, and we're seeing great growth outside the United States, by the way, the projections for the DAP portfolio by the end of the year is in excess of $3 billion.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector, Stifel\n\nOkay. That's very helpful. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYeah.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Schneeberger\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks very much. Good morning. Carol, could you give us an update on your SMB progress? Curious how you're trending toward the long-term target domestically. And then also, how does international compare? You've spoken in the past about making nice progress there. Just curious, how does that compare to domestic right now, and what type of aspiration can you achieve longer term? Thanks.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYeah. So we're right now at about 29% as of the end of Q1. And as we look towards the end of this year, we should be over 30%, in the low 30s. So we're trending nicely. And Kate, outside the United States, how's SMB performing?\n\nKate Gutmann\n\nEVP and President International of Healthcare and Supply Chain Solutions, UPS\n\nYeah. Our history outside the US is in SMB. So we have a 62% share of SMB, and this is now where we're implementing DAP. So we're only going further. As Carol said, our DAP program and small package around the world is resonating with our SMB shippers as they look for ease and access. So that's excellent. And then I'll just also say in our freight business, we have a DAP-like service, which is our forwarding hub, and it's actually well ahead of plan as well. So SMBs are showing that they really need access through the digital platforms, and it's resonating very well.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nAnd Steven, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will be a follow-up from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, thanks for coming back to me. I just wanted to ask about you mentioned the pricing environment being kind of rational. Could you elaborate on how effective the GRI has been this year? What's the stick rate there? As you think about the underlying performance and domestic yields ex some of the mixed headwinds, could you talk a little bit about the trajectory or the rate of change through the quarter?\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah, Dave. We had expected about a 50% keep rate. We saw roughly 250 basis points in the Q1. So generally in line with expectations. We'd expect that base rate to continue over the course of the year. I think Carol hit on a couple of the key points around the other elements of pricing. There's a fuel piece. There's PSS in the back in the peak season. And then there's the mixed component that we've been talking about, the focus on commercial, on SMB, and healthcare. So all those things combined give us confidence that we'll deliver a low single-digit from an RPP second half of the year.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks, sir.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I will now turn the floor back over to our host, Mr. PJ Guido. Please go ahead, sir.\nThank you, Steven. This concludes our call. Thank you for joining, and have a good day.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nWe're sorry. Your conference is ending now. Please hang up.",

For the fourth quarter of 2023, GAAP results include a non-cash after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $274 million, after-tax transformation and other charges of $154 million, and a non-cash after-tax impairment charge of $84 million related to our Coyote trade name in our truckload brokerage unit. The after-tax total for these items is $512 million or $0.60 per diluted share. Additional details regarding year-end pension charges are included in the appendix of our fourth quarter 2023 earnings presentation that will be posted to the UPS Investor Relations website. Following this call, a reconciliation to GAAP financial results is available on the UPS Investor Relations website and also available in the webcast of today's call. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference.\nIf you wish to ask a question, press one and then zero on your phone. To enter the queue, please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. You may rejoin the queue for the opportunity to ask an additional question. And now I'll turn the call over to Carol.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you, PJ, and good morning. Let me begin by thanking UPSers for their hard work and efforts. I'm proud of our team for their commitment to customer service and for once again making UPS the industry leader in on-time performance not only during peak but throughout 2023. Looking at our volume trends for the fourth quarter, while total average daily volume or ADV declined 7.5% from last year, our performance was a marked improvement from what we reported in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, our salespeople did an outstanding job of winning back diverted volume and pulling through new volume. In fact, US domestic ADV surged 30% from the third quarter to the fourth, which was our highest sequential volume ramp ever. By the end of December, we had won back and pulled through nearly 60% of the volume diverted during our labor negotiations.\nWinning back and winning new volume is part of a program we call Project Brown, and this program will continue into 2024.\nYou will recall that at the end of the third quarter we provided a range of expected revenue and operating profit for the fourth quarter. Looking at our fourth quarter results versus last year, consolidated revenue declined 7.8% to $24.9 billion, which was slightly below the low end of our expectation. Operating profit was $2.8 billion, a decrease of 27.1% from last year, but slightly higher than the low end of our expectations. As a result, our consolidated operating margin was 11.2%, which was well within our expectation for the year. Consolidated revenue was $91 billion, a decrease of 9.3%. Consolidated operating profit totaled $9.9 billion, 28.7% lower than last year, and consolidated operating margin was 10.9%. We generated $5.3 billion in free cash flow during 2023 and we returned $7.6 billion to share owners in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\nBrian will provide more detail about our financial results in a moment.\n2023 was a unique and, quite candidly, a difficult and disappointing year. We experienced declines in volume, revenue, and operating profit in all three of our business segments. Some of this performance was due to the macro environment and some of it was due to the disruption associated with our labor contract negotiation as well as higher costs associated with the new contract. Through the year, however, we controlled what we could control and in many areas we delivered the highest productivity results in our company history and I think most importantly we stayed on our strategy of customer first, people led, and innovation driven. Let me share a few examples of how our strategy is establishing a foundation for future growth starting with customer first. In 2023, our healthcare portfolio achieved our target of $10 billion in revenue.\nHere we've made strong progress towards our goal of becoming the number one complex healthcare provider in the growing $130 billion global healthcare logistics market.\nOur global network of healthcare compliant distribution space topped 17 million sq ft in 2023, and our acquisitions of Bomi Group and MNX Global Logistics have expanded our cold chain capabilities and are enabling us to reach new markets and customers.\nTo support growth in our international small package business. In December we announced plans to build a new air hub at Hong Kong International Airport. This new air hub supports our plans to grow in the best parts of the market, including highly profitable Asia trade lines, and will enable us to expand our export and import business in the region. During the year, we continued to grow our SMB penetration. In 2023, SMBs made up 28.6% of our total US volume, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. Part of this growth came from DAP, our digital access program. DAP has transformed how small companies do business with UPS and in 2023 we generated $2.9 billion in DAP revenue, an increase of 22% year-over-year.\nMoving to people-led in 2023, we delivered a labor agreement that provides certainty for the next five years. Because I'm a big believer in the power of one UPS, this year we are returning to a policy of everyone back in the office five days a week. In terms of our culture, we are a network company not just of logistics capabilities, but of personal relationships too. Which brings me to innovation-driven. On our busiest peak days, we sort over 50 million packages in the US and deliver more than 30 million packages worldwide. How do we do it? By leveraging the agility of our integrated network powered by UPS technology and the skills of our engineers and operating teams. Our network planning tools enabled us to quickly match capacity with volume across the network and drive productivity.\nTechnology also enabled improvements to driver and helper route planning and dispatch, resulting in improvements in density and fewer seasonal support drivers than in prior years.\nIt might surprise you to learn that we typically see an increase in returns volume before Christmas. In fourth quarter we moved lightning fast to integrate Happy Returns. We made box-free, label-free returns available in over 5,000 UPS store locations just eight days after the acquisition closed. Happy Returns digital experience helped drive returns volume in fourth quarter, with momentum extending into first quarter 2024.\nFinally, we continue to deploy transformative technology to increase efficiency within our warehousing facilities. The latest example is our state-of-the-art pick, pack, and ship center in Louisville, Kentucky that we call UPS Velocity. We named it Velocity because it leverages robotics, automation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to streamline fulfillment operations. This facility is capable of processing over 350,000 units per day and enables a best-in-class experience for our customers and their customers. Our Customer First, People-Led, Innovation-Driven strategy is the foundation of our business, and our continued execution of the strategy enabled us to exit 2023 with momentum. But momentum is not enough. We've decided to take some bold moves to rightsize our company for the future and to focus on the key enablers of growth. So today we are announcing two actions.\nFirst, we plan to explore strategic alternatives for our truckload brokerage business known as Coyote. Coyote is part of Supply Chain Solutions and is a business that is highly cyclical with considerable earnings volatility. We will keep you apprised as we move forward with this analysis. Second, we are going to fit our organization to our strategy and align our resources against what's wildly important. This will result in a workforce reduction of approximately 12,000 positions and around $1 billion in cost out this year. Here we've identified new ways of working and are calling this Fit to Serve.\nLet me end by sharing our 2024 outlook. In 2024, the small package market in the US excluding Amazon is expected to grow by less than 1%, and projected market growth rates for the rest of our business segments suggest some improvement, but not until the latter part of the year. In building our 2024 financial targets, we anchored the low end of our guidance on market growth, and for the high end of our guidance included growth we should experience. If we capture market share in 2024, we expect to generate consolidated revenue ranging from approximately $92 billion to $94.5 billion and a consolidated operating margin ranging from approximately 10% to 10.6%. Given the nuances of our new labor contract, there will be stark contrast between our first half and our second half performance.\nFirst half earnings will be compressed and second half earnings will expand in both the low and high end of our guidance range. We expect to exit the year with a US operating margin of 10%. Brian will provide more details in a moment. UPS remains rock solid strong. While our dividend payout is currently higher than our targeted payout of 50% of our prior year's adjusted earnings per share, we are confident in our future. As a result, the UPS board approved a penny increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.62 per share to $1.63 per share. This is the 15th consecutive year we have increased the UPS dividend. Now that 2023 is behind us, we look forward to seeing you at our upcoming Investor and Analyst Day on 26 March 2024. At that time we will share our three year plans to grow and drive shareowner value.\nWith that, thank you for listening, and now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks Carol, and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover three areas starting with the macro and our fourth quarter results. Then I'll review our full year 2023 results including cash and share owner returns. Lastly I'll provide comments on expectations for the market and our financial outlook for 2024. The macro environment in the fourth quarter showed improvement. However, in the transportation and logistics sector, conditions remained under pressure both in the US and internationally due to soft demand and overcapacity in the market. Throughout the quarter, we leveraged the agility of our integrated network to match capacity with demand and we were recognized by an independent third party for providing industry leading service for the sixth peak in a row. Looking at our financial results in the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue was $24.9 billion, down 7.8% from the fourth quarter of 2022.\nAll three of our segments demonstrated agility and, on a combined basis, drove down total expense by $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter year-over-year. This enabled us to deliver operating profit within the range we communicated to you last quarter. Consolidated Operating Margin was 11.2% for the quarter and in line with our expectations. For the fourth quarter Diluted Earnings Per Share was $2.47 and down 31.8% from the fourth quarter of 2022. Now let's look at our business segments. In US domestic, we knew going into the fourth quarter that volume would be ramping up off an exceptionally low third quarter. Our efforts to win back diverted volume and pull through new volume resulted in a record sequential volume surge. Throughout peak, we delivered excellent service to our customers while managing expenses.\nIn the fourth quarter, average daily volume came in at the low end of our range and was down 7.4% year over year. B2B average daily volume in the fourth quarter was down 6.8% year over year, driven by declines in the retail, manufacturing, and high tech sectors. In the fourth quarter, B2B represented 35.5% of our volume, which was up slightly from 35.3% in the same period last year. Also in the fourth quarter, continued macro pressures drove customers to seek economy products as we saw customers shift volume out of the air onto the ground. Total air average daily volume was down 15% year over year and ground average daily volume was down 5.8% versus the fourth quarter of last year. For the quarter, US domestic generated revenue of $16.9 billion, down 7.3%. Revenue per piece was slightly positive year-over-year with a number of moving parts.\nA combination of strong base rates and customer mix increased the revenue per piece growth rate by about 390 basis points. This was offset by a few factors. First, changes in product mix and package characteristics decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 140 basis points. Second, reflecting the lower volume in the quarter peak season, surcharge revenue declined, which reduced the revenue per piece growth rate by about 120 basis points. And lastly, changes in fuel prices decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 110 basis points. Turning to cost, total expense was down 3.6%. And in the face of a 12.1% increase in union wage rates, which was driven by the contractual increase that went into effect last August, we pulled several levers to more than offset the higher expense.\nFirst, we leveraged our network planning tools and Total Service Plan to reduce total hours in the fourth quarter by 10.2%, which was more than the decline in average daily volume. This enabled us to decrease compensation and benefits, which drove down the total expense growth rate by around 30 basis points. Second, lower purchase transportation expenditures reduced the expense growth rate by around 70 basis points, primarily from lower volume levels and our continued optimization efforts. Next, lower fuel costs contributed 160 basis points to the decrease in the total expense growth rate. Lastly, the net of all other expense items and allocations reduced the expense growth rate by 100 basis points. Pulling it all together, these actions helped us reduce US domestic expense in the fourth quarter by $578 million, which was our largest fourth quarter dollar cost reduction ever.\nLooking specifically at peak, as volume returned to the network and our biggest customers drove a surge in peak volume, we ran our integrated network with agility. In fact, in 2023 we closed over 30 sorts, and they remained closed during peak. By leveraging our network planning tools, we took advantage of the flexibility of our integrated network and flowed more volume into our automated buildings and with Smart Package Smart Facility in over 1,000 buildings misload frequency improved 67%, contributing to the superior service we delivered to our customers. The US domestic segment delivered $1.6 billion in operating profit, down 32.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. However, compared to the third quarter of 2023, operating profit in US domestic increased $904 million and was our highest sequential operating profit increase ever.\nOperating margin in the fourth quarter was 9.3%, a 440 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2023. Moving to our international segment, soft demand continued to pressure volumes out of Asia and in Europe. Several key economies remained in recession, which pressured demand and drove a shift away from express services. In response, we focused on revenue quality and adjusted our global network to match changes in geographic demand. Looking at volume in the fourth quarter, international total average daily volume was down 8.3% year-over-year. The decline was primarily due to lower domestic average daily volume, which was down 10.8% driven by declines in Europe, Canada, areas of the world that continue to face persistent inflationary pressures. On the export side, total average daily volume declined 5.9% on a year-over-year basis driven by declines in Europe due to weak macro conditions.\nLooking at Asia, export average daily volume was down 8.9% driven by soft demand in the retail and high tech sectors. However, export volume on the China to US lane, which is our most profitable lane, increased 2.7% driven by SMBs, nearly offsetting the decline in Asia. Over in the Americas region, export average daily volume grew 11.9% led by customers in Canada and Mexico leveraging our cross-border ground service. In the fourth quarter, international revenue was $4.6 billion, which was down 6.9% from last year primarily due to the decline in volume. Revenue per piece increased 3.1%. Strong base pricing and a change in customer mix drove a 420 basis point increase in the revenue per piece growth rate. A reduction in fuel surcharge revenue negatively impacted the revenue per piece growth rate by 60 basis points.\nLower demand related surcharge revenue, which was partially offset by the impact of a weaker US dollar, decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 50 basis points. Moving to expense in the fourth quarter, total international expense was down $152 million primarily driven by lower fuel expense. Additionally, in response to the lower demand environment, we managed our network to match capacity with demand, which included reducing international block hours by 9.4%. Operating profit in the international segment was $899 million, down $192 million year-over-year. Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 19.5%.\nNow looking at supply chain solutions, in the fourth quarter revenue was $3.4 billion, down $435 million year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers in international air freight, overall volumes were down despite a mid-quarter spike in e-commerce. Market rates continued to be pressured resulting in lower revenue and operating profit. On the ocean side, volume increased driven by the retail sector. However, excess market capacity pressured revenue and operating profit within forwarding. Our truckload brokerage unit known as Coyote continued to face pressure from excess capacity in the market which drove revenue and operating profit down. In the fourth quarter forward supply chain solutions generated operating profit of $319 million and an operating margin of 9.4%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $207 million of interest expense.\nOur other pension income was $66 million and our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.5%. Now let me comment on our full year 2023 results. For the full year 2023, revenue declined 9.3% to $91 billion and we generated operating profit of $9.9 billion, a decrease of 28.7% compared to full year 2022. Consolidated operating margin was 10.9%. We generated $10.2 billion in cash from operations and continued to follow our capital allocation priorities. We invested $5.2 billion in CapEx. Additionally, we acquired MNX Global Logistics and Happy Returns. We distributed $5.4 billion in dividends which represented a 6.6% increase on a per share basis over 2022. We repaid $2.4 billion in debt that matured during the year and at the end of the year our debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.2x.\nLastly, we completed $2.25 billion in share buybacks in 2023. And in the segments for the full year, in US domestic, operating profit was $5.4 billion, and operating margin was 9%. The international segment generated $3.3 billion in operating profit, and operating margin was 18.4%, and supply chain solutions delivered operating profit of $1.2 billion, and an operating margin was 9%. With 2023 behind us, let us move to our outlook for 2024. S&P Global is forecasting an improvement in global macro conditions as the year progresses. Outside the US, real exports in Europe are expected to improve each quarter throughout the year. Looking at Asia, we saw positive momentum on the China to US lane exiting the year and remain cautious on the outlook for 2024. In the US, the projected small package market growth rate is just under 1% excluding Amazon.\nA slight improvement is expected in US manufacturing, and the consumer is expected to remain resilient despite lingering inflationary pressures. We've built a plan that reflects the current environment and potential risks that we see. This includes fitting our organization to our strategy and aligning execution to our wildly important initiatives under what we call Fit to Serve. As Carol mentioned, we are exploring strategic alternatives for Coyote, our truckload brokerage business, which will enable us to address some of the cyclical impacts in our forwarding business, and we are reducing our workforce by approximately 12,000 positions. This will cut around $1 billion in cost in 2024. Moving to our 2024 financial outlook, we are providing a range based on volume growth. The low end of the range has UPS growing at market rate, and the high end of the range has us gaining share for the full year 2024.\nOn a consolidated basis, revenues are expected to range from approximately $92 billion to $94.5 billion, and operating margin is expected to range from approximately 10% to 10.6%. In the range provided, we expect to move total average daily volume from negative growth in the first half of the year to positive growth in the back half. This is primarily driven by lapping the volume diversion we experienced in the US last year during our labor negotiations. Additionally, costs will weigh on us in the first half of the year, primarily due to the high labor cost inflation associated with the new contract. Looking at consolidated revenue in the first half of the year, we expect the growth rate to decline with a range of approximately 1% to 2%, with the first quarter driving the decline.\nIn the back half of the year, revenue growth is anticipated to be up within a range of mid to high single digits. Looking at consolidated operating profit, we expect material improvement as the year progresses, with the second half of the year outperforming the first half. Lastly, we expect to generate our lowest consolidated operating margin of the year in first quarter. Now, let me give you a little color on the segments. Looking at US Domestic, average daily volume growth is expected to be within a range of approximately flat to up 2% for the full year. At both the low and high ends of the range, we expect the revenue per piece growth rate to outpace the cost per piece growth rate beginning in third quarter, and we expect to exit the year at a 10% operating margin.\nMoving to the international segment, we expect 2024 average daily volume to be within a range of approximately flat to up around 3% at both ends of the guidance range. Operating margin is anticipated to be in the high teens. And in supply chain solutions for the full year In 2024, we expect revenue to be within a range of approximately $13 to 13.5 billion at both ends of the guidance range operating margin for SCS is expected to be high single digits. And for modeling purposes, in total below the line, we expect approximately $400 million in expense in 2024. This is net of $262 million in pension income. We included a slide in the appendix of today's webcast deck to provide you more detail on pension. The webcast deck will be posted to the UPS investor relations website following this call.\nNow let's turn to full year 2024 capital allocation. Our capital allocation priorities have not changed. We are staying on strategy and will make the best long-term decisions to capture growth, improve efficiency, and deliver value to our shareholders. We expect 2024 capital expenditures to be within our target of around 5% of revenue, or $4.5 billion. Now let's turn to our expectations for cash and the balance sheet. We expect free cash flow to be within a range of approximately $4.5 to $5.3 billion, including our annual pension contributions of $1.4 billion, which are equal to our expected service costs. As Carol mentioned, the board has approved a dividend per share of $1.63 for the first quarter. We are planning to pay out around $5.4 billion in dividends in 2024, subject to board approval. Finally, our effective tax rate in 2024 is expected to be approximately 23.5%.\nIn closing, we look at 2024 as a year to pivot away from negative volume to positive volume growth and from high labor cost inflation to a much lower growth rate. We are laser focused on executing our strategy, controlling what we can control, and improving our financial performance. We look forward to sharing our multiyear targets and details on our strategy and at our Investor Day event on 26 March 2024. Thank you, and operator. Please open the lines.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now conduct a question and answer session. Our first question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nYay. Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess I wanted to start on maybe some of the cost out. You mentioned the 12,000 positions that you're reducing and the $1 billion of cost in 2024. I was hoping maybe you could help us sort of understand the timing of that. So based on a 10% kind of run rate exiting 2024, it would imply that the first quarter is fairly low. So I just want to make sure I understand some of those moving pieces and when that $1 billion is going to start to accrue.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nSure. Happy to give you some color. So we talked about 12,000 heads out. 75% of the reductions will come in the first half, which drive the $1 billion in the 2024 calendar year. But you're absolutely right in terms of the timing and announcement. It'll be back end weighted. And really the thing I'd like to point out, it's a change in the way we work. So as volume returns to the system, we don't expect these jobs to come back. It's changing the effective way that we operate.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nAnd I might just add a little more color if I could, Chris. Today we have about 495,000 UPSers around the world. A few years ago when the COVID demand was peaking, we had 540,000 UPSers. So Kate and Nano have done a masterful job of managing our operational headcount to meet the volume in our company. And they've done that by managing turnover and attrition and closing sorts and reducing block hours, etc.\nWe have about 85,000 UPSers who are management and this could be full time and part time management. The targeted headcount falls really within that group as well as some contractors that will be leaving us. And to Brian's point, this is really about a new way of working. So it's $1 billion of cost out now, but there's even more cost out to come as we have a full year benefit in 2025.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Sanford C. Bernstein\n\nHey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. So just wanted to ask, on the productivity side, obviously ours down more than volume. We've had a couple quarters of that. Obviously not third quarter this year. Is there a point where volume declines become more difficult to offset? I'm just trying to understand the downside risk. Right. If volumes continue to remain flat or weaker than you expect, how should we be thinking about the downside risk on the margin side?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nSo we believe that productivity is a virtuous cycle here at UPS, and I'll give you one example, then I'm going to throw it over to Nando to address this. But if I look at just one metric, cube utilization, we reached the highest cube utilization in our company history at 60%. That's the equivalent of reducing 1,500 loads per day. So that's not an hour, but it's just a cost out. So we've got productivity across the operations. And Nando, why don't you talk about what you're going to do in 2024?\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYes. So David, thanks for the question. For us it is a virtuous cycle. So we're working ahead of any type of volume variability. So whether it goes up or down, we've got some of our best engineers, operations folks, and finance folks identifying additional cost outs as we move forward, as we're executing those ones that we have in front of us. So we feel good that there's a good pipeline of opportunity no matter what the volume does. And as Carol had mentioned, we leverage our hourly headcount and match that to the volume and the activity. And so far, so good, but still lots in front of us and they're pretty meaty. So we feel really good about those initiatives.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nAt our investor day in March, we're going to talk to you about Network of the Future. We've got an integrated network. We don't have to integrate, but we can transform our network with some very exciting ideas. We're going to share that with you in March.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Sanford C. Bernstein\n\nThe rate at which resource needs is going to need to be added back on the other side, maybe we get some volume expansion. Can you talk to the expectations for operating leverage on the upside?\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah, I think as we look to the back end of the year, certainly the volume projections that are in there in terms of the volume growth for the back end of the year in that 2% to 4% range domestically, we start to see CPP growing slower than RPP. And so that balance is what's going to create the Operating Margin. The sorts we closed over 30 sorts, did not reopen them during peak. So we're changing. Nando's doing an effective job of basically managing more volume with less. So we'll continue to drive that.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Sanford C. Bernstein\n\nAll right, thank you, guys.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks, everyone. I just wanted to. Brian, on the guidance, I guess the guidance implies $9.6 billion in operating profits. You've been pretty helpful historically about giving us kind of the first half, second half cadence of that and then. And then just related to that, I want to. I want to make sure. So you said the $1 billion is included in the guidance.\nCan you just expand on that a little bit? Because if I take out the $1 billion, the implied change in profits relative to the improvement of revenue is quite a bit worse. So I'm just trying to understand, you know, what's actually included in the guidance on the $1 billion and how that, how that kind of translates to what you're assuming underneath it in terms of change of profit, relative change of revenue.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nSure. Happy to Amit. So from a shape of the year perspective, the full year we called revenue at 1% to 4%. But based on lapping of the volumes and the contract overlap, we would expect revenue to be flat to down 2% in the first half, up 4% to 8% in the back half. And from a profit perspective, I had mentioned that it's a tale of two cities in terms of halves of the year, the second half of the year, we'd expect profit to grow about 20% to 30%. So Q1 will be the biggest challenge because we're lapping from a volume comp perspective and a full contract. But on a full year basis, we're looking at op margin 10% to 10.6%.\nI think you can expect the second half of the year to be an 11 to 12 in that range and you can back into the first half. In terms of your question of backing out the $1 billion costs. That $1 billion will be a cost benefit in 2024. But I think we've said in the past, Amit, it would take 12 months to digest the new labor cost. We are confident we can get back to consistent expansion of US margins as we lap the first year of the contract. That will be a combination of pricing and productivity. So net, net, it's really lapping that contract. And then you start to get the benefits. As Carol said, some of those benefits would accrue over to 2025 as well.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nAre we done there on the billion or is there like there's $55 billion in total cost? I mean, are we just getting started or like what's the actual opportunity there beyond the billion?\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nSo Carol talked about the differences between Nando and Kate, the operating cost and what we're talking about, management headcount. If you bifurcate the two, I think you're going to hear more at the investor day through things like Network of the Future, how we go after additional headcount in that area. But this would be about a 14% reduction in that 85,000 heads.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWe're never done. We continue to drive productivity. It's a virtuous cycle here and technology has changed so much in the past year. When you think about the advent of generative AI and the applications inside of our business, we're just getting started and I'm really excited about what the future will mean in terms of driving productivity as well as improving the customer experience.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you very much.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks, Amit.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nConor Cunningham\n\nDirector, Melius Research\n\nHi everyone. Just to stick with the productivity side, you've been obviously pretty dynamic with your network and you mentioned, I think, 30 sort closures and whatnot. Can you just talk about the consolidation opportunity in 2024 and how that may play out to drive further efficiencies in the business? Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWe'd be happy to do that, but we're going to kick that question to our March conference because we've got a great presentation to share with you regarding Network of the Future, and it would take up way too much time today to go through that. We want to spend a good amount of time talking to you about that in March. Thank you for understanding.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks, Conor.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nAllison Poliniak\n\nDirector, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning. Just want to turn to the growth aspect of it, I guess more specifically the market share capture. Could you maybe walk through the different levers in terms of. I know you mentioned Project Brown, your ability to recapture diverted volume, but also talking to the SMB penetration, your opportunity on the healthcare side, just any color in terms of where those levers can be pulled for that market share growth in 2024. Thanks.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nI'll start with a few comments about Project Brown. Project Brown really is a new way of going after business. It has many elements to it and I'll make some of those real to you. First of all, we looked at ourselves and said, what's getting in the way of speed? Because it was taking us too long to respond to a customer. We found that we hadn't really declared service level agreements amongst the various groups that participate in this exercise of providing offers to our customers.\nWe've shortened up the time to response and that's important and that's going to be with us now forever. I can make that real for you. Outside of the United States. That used to take 22 days. We dropped it to six days. We're now at two days. That's best in class. We made similar improvements in the United States. Project Brown was also looking at Deal Manager.\nDeal Manager is the new tool that we introduced that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to score a deal and avoid the need for our salespeople to go up to our pricing people for appeals. They can actually see the score of their deal. We've had great acceptance and win rates, 79% win rates with this tool. But we found through Project Brown that we weren't offering all of our products in the tool, and one of the products we weren't offering was SurePost, which is a great product. So we introduced SurePost into the Deal Manager, and we're getting some good return on that. That's particularly attractive for our small and medium sized dot com.\nAnother thing that we did is that we improved and increased weekend pickups in several key markets during the year. I could go on and on and on, but this is a way of operationalizing excellence to drive the business and capture share. So where are we going to capture share? We're going to continue to lean into the small- and medium-sized segment opportunities. We're seeing some real success in that area. We are going to continue to lean into healthcare. When I started here, the healthcare revenues were around $6 billion; now $10 billion. We're going to continue to grow. We'll lay out our three-year growth plans for you at our March investor day. I think you'll be very pleased with that.\nWe're going to continue to sell off the service that we provide and the capabilities that we have that actually no one else has now. That's our integrated network. So at our investor day in March, we'll lay out market share capture. But let me just make the market real for you because this might be helpful too as we think about the addressable market. The addressable market in the United States. It's a little over 50, 52 million packages a day. So there's plenty of addressable market for us to go get and plenty of market for us to get outside of the United States because we are under penetrated in so many areas. One reason I called out our new air hub in the Hong Kong International Airport is that the Greater China Bay area is an unbelievable economic power base.\nThe 13th largest economy in the world. 37% of all China exports go through that airport. And today we have small way over capacity and buildings that are inefficient with lease rates that are sky high. So we are building a 20,000 square meter facility. It will make us the second largest air hub in that important part of the market. So expect to see a lot of growth coming off of that over time.\n\nAllison Poliniak\n\nDirector, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good morning. So I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the competitive dynamic in the market. I know the backdrop is that you had some share loss associated with the Teamsters contract. But it also seems like there might be risk that other competitors are gaining traction in the market. So if you look at Postal Service had, I think, up 7% volumes and they had a new product, the Ground Advantage. And so I guess the question is, is there a risk that the competitive set has got more challenging and how do we think about what you need to do to have a better volume outcome in 2024? Is there more pressure on price or is it a different formula to get the better volume outcome in 2024? Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nI would say that the pricing environment is very rational. You can see that as Brian ticked out the RPP performance in the fourth quarter, we had very strong base rate performance. Now, the RPP was muted because of lower fuel costs, product characteristics, the product mix change, and lower demand surcharges. But the base was very strong and we expect the base to continue into 2024. Our GRI for 2024 is 5.9%. Will we keep all of it? No.\nBut will we keep a lot of it? Yes. Just like we did in 2023. We kept about 60% of the GRI in 2023. So the pricing environment is rational in terms of competitive products. It's incumbent upon us to stay at leading edge and meeting our customers where they want us to be. That's one reason we offered a hyper local product beginning last quarter, which is really a short zone product. We haven't had that before.\nAnd as we look at the offerings that we will go to market with this year, we've got some things underway not ready for prime time. But I suspect looking over at our new Chief Commercial Officer Matt Guffey, that we might be able to talk about that at our March investor conference. And he's nodding his head, so stay tuned for that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you very much. I'm going to defer the big picture stuff to March, but I'm just kind of curious. How did your global view change between when we were discussing the labor deal back in August, September, to the year end? You mentioned the softness in Europe. You mentioned the shift from air to ground, but kind of what were the big changes in your outlook over that four or five month period?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, what really softened up was Europe. If you look at our volume decline, both domestic and export, it was heavily weighted in Europe. In fact, the decline in our export was 94% driven by the softness in Europe. So you see what's happening with industrial manufacturing there; it is just way off. So that is a big change. There are also dynamics happening in air and ocean freight. As you've been watching, we've all been watching the drama in the Red Sea, the fact that the water levels in the Panama Canal are low. And that certainly is causing a lot of chaos, actually, in ocean and air freights. Interestingly, on the air side, both rates and volumes were down. On the ocean side, volumes are up, but as Brian called out, the rates were considerably down.\nAs we sit here today, it's a very dynamic market and ever changing, a little hard to predict candidly because what we're seeing today is for shippers who have high value packages, they're actually, they're worried about the ocean conditions so they're moving to the air. So air rates are tightening a bit, and on the ocean side, because shippers are starting to have to reroute away from the Red Sea or the Panama Canal, the routing is taking longer. So there's some change in the dynamics of the pricing there too.\nWe just have to stay super nimble here, and Kate and her team are doing a great job at that. Kate, what would you like to add here?\n\nKate Gutmann\n\nEVP, UPS\n\nYeah, I would say that the market remains volatile even in Europe. With the drop off and the inflationary softening, we were able to pull back on the cost to deliver a great margin, and that's our commitment. And then to ensure that in the forwarding side of the house as we've done, stay just razor sharp to ensure that we are right on track with any trend that we see.I'm really proud of the team because we have got the initiative to gain those customers with high value goods and that international air freight that's coming as a result.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nJust if I could follow up on that answer. So given the global events with Suez Canal, Panama Canal, looking at the lemonade out of lemons side of this, is this a bigger opportunity for you in Europe or is this a bigger opportunity for air out of Asia?\n\nKate Gutmann\n\nEVP, UPS\n\nIt actually is first showing up Asia to Europe lane. But I will say this is going to be repositioning those vessels around the globe. It's going to be a global event. So we see it as an opportunity throughout, and our sales resources are global, our portfolio is global. So UPS is very well positioned to take it back of it.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks Jeff.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays Investment Bank\n\nHey, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Can you guys speak to your enterprise customers and the volume trends that you saw in the fourth quarter and expectations going into 2024 and maybe compare and contrast that with B2B as well as your small medium business mix.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nSo, happy to Brandon. We were actually pleased with the volume momentum. We were at a low water mark in August of last year down 15% and we saw sequential monthly improvement as we looked at our volume domestically from an ADP perspective down to mid single digit declines in the month of December. So that trend continued to play out well. We're going to see some tough comps though in the first quarter. So I wouldn't expect positive volume growth in Q1.\nWe start to see positive volume growth in Q2 and then certainly in the back half of the year as the comps change. SMB, Carol mentioned very focused on penetration on the SMB side and specifically some of the medium SMB customers. We've stated we would like to see that mix trend up to 30%+; we finish the year at 28 so we're well on our way in that direction.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nMaybe another comment because this is just an interesting observation on the market. If I look at our top five decliners in the quarter, that would include our largest customer, and there's an intentional decline there. If I look at the remaining decliners, it's really interesting to see what's happening. Of those, only one has diverted some volume. They're a dual sourcer, and they have diverted some volume, but they'll stay dual sourcing the rest. Either their business is just way off, or they have worked really hard to create a better experience inside the store to encourage buy online, pickup in store. So there is a bit of dynamic happening within our large enterprise customers. I think for all of us, we're delighted to have anniversaried the demand that we saw.\nNow that that's behind us, now that the volume for the small package market has reverted back to the mean, this is an opportunity now for everyone to grow.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThank you both.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays Investment Bank\n\nThanks Brian.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Helene Becker of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nHelane Becker\n\nManaging Director and Senior Advisor, TD Cowen\n\nOh gosh. Thanks very much, everybody, and thanks, team, for the time. So on Coyote, when you did the acquisition, what did you think the benefits would be that made it important to do the acquisition? And then what actually happened that is causing you to rethink how Coyote fits in the network? And my follow up question is unrelated. You recently bought two 747-8 freighters I saw, and I'm just wondering if you bought those off lease or where they came from since Boeing doesn't make the 747 anymore. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nI'm happy to address the Coyote question to the best of my ability. I was on the board in 2015 when we bought the company, but the strategic rationale was really about expanding the portfolio. It was a very thoughtful strategic rationale to expand the portfolio. What I don't think we fully understood at the time was just how cyclical this business is. I'll make it real for you. When we acquired Coyote in 2015, the revenues in the previous year for Coyote were $2.1 billion.\nDuring COVID Coyote peaked up to over $4 billion in revenue. Well, it's come way down since then. In fact, if you look at our supply chain solutions business, it was down $3 billion year on year, which is 1/3 of the overall company decline. Within that $3 billion, Coyote made up 38% of the decline for the year and 48% of the decline for the fourth quarter. So you can see the volatility in the revenue line. Then we've got our business that has a very low margin.\nSo if you've got that kind of volatility on the revenue line, you're going to have even more volatility on the earnings line. So we're like, gosh, is there another way to skin this cat? Can we think about an alternative that continues to allow us to provide the service, but without all the overhead? Or perhaps this business is worth more to someone else than it is to us. We don't know. We don't know the outcome of our alternative, but as soon as we do, we'll share that with you. And on the freighter question.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nSo the two planes were picked up through Qatar, and really it's part of a broader airline strategy to retire some of the MD-11s in terms of efficiency and sustainability.\n\nHelane Becker\n\nManaging Director and Senior Advisor, TD Cowen\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research",
    "content2": "Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just want to follow up on a couple things on the guidance. Brian, I know you said 10% US margin exiting the year. Any color on the shape of the year? You also talked a couple times about just Q1 being hard. Any more specific color on Q1? And then just lastly, I know every year on this call you typically give an update on the biggest customer exposure. If you can give us an update there? Thank you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nHappy to, Scott. So from a domestic margin perspective, we're looking at the back half of the year being in the range of from an op profit perspective, we're looking at 20 to 30% growth. Scott, from a margin and from a margin will be in the 10 to 10+ range for the fourth quarter. The challenge we have is the first quarter; we actually expect to be down in the neighborhood. We had a low-water mark in Q3 of last year, so we're not going to be down to that point.\nBut I don't think we'll be much better from a margin perspective in the US in the first quarter of this year. From an Amazon perspective, we finished the year at 11.8%, and that was not due to an increase in the business. We're still executing our plan with them. In terms of a glide down, it was more to the overall enterprise revenue coming down as a part of the enterprise.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nIt just came down faster than Amazon.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nExactly. Yeah.\n\nP.J. Guido\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, UPS\n\nSteven, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nGoldman Sachs, VP and Equity Research Analyst\n\nHi. Morning. So I was sort of thinking about the small package growth that you guys targeted at less than 1% this year. Feels pretty conservative after a couple years of probably negative industry growth as well. So I'm just sort of curious what's informing that? Is that your economic outlook, your forecast, and then maybe this is your Analyst Day, you'll address it. But sort of on a normalized basis, what kind of small package domestic growth, underlying industry growth, you think about over a longer term basis? Thanks.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThe longer term view is very good. It's 3%, so that's really good growth actually. We're looking forward to getting into that growth mode. We use a number of external factors to inform our perspective on the market growth. We triangulate from a number of different sources and come up with our best view.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThis is our best view.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Sanford C. Bernstein\n\nOkay, thanks.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks, Jordan.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now turn the floor back over to our host, Mr. P.J. Guido. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nP.J. Guido\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, UPS\n\nThank you, Steven. This concludes our call. Thank you for joining, and have a good day."

I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Q3 2023 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise, and after the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer period. Any analyst that would like to ask a question, now is the time to press the one, then zero, on your telephone keypad. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. PJ Guido, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nPJ Guido\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, UPS\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the UPS Q3 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Carol Tomé, our CEO; Brian Newman, our CFO; and a few additional members of our executive leadership team. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2022 Form 10-K and other reports we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThese reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. Unless stated otherwise, our discussion refers to adjusted results. For Q3 2023, GAAP results include an after-tax charge of $219 million or $0.26 per diluted share, comprised of a one-time payment of $46 million to certain US-based non-union part-time supervisors, transformation and other charges of $70 million, and non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $103 million. A reconciliation to GAAP financial results is available on the UPS Investor Relations website, along with the webcast of today's call.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. If you wish to ask a question, press one, and then zero on your phone to enter the queue. Please ask only one question so that we may allow as many as possible to participate. You may rejoin the queue for the opportunity to ask an additional question. And now, I'll turn the call over to Carol.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you PJ, and good morning. Let me begin by thanking UPSers for their hard work and efforts. Our US labor contract wasn't fully ratified until early September, and I'm proud of our UPSers for staying focused during the entire labor negotiation and for providing industry-leading service to our customers. We expected conditions in Q3 to be challenging, and they were. The global macro environment remained weak, with some countries in recession, which pressured international and freight forwarding volume. And in the US, labor uncertainty negatively impacted volume for most of the quarter.\nFrom a demand perspective, August proved to be the most challenging, as some customers waited for the ratification of our Teamsters contract before returning volume to our network. Since contract ratification, we've been gaining volume momentum. We exited the last week of September with US Average Daily Volume, or ADV, down 7.4%. A marked improvement from the rest of the quarter. Our salespeople have produced record results from the combination of win-back and new customers. To date, we've won back roughly 600,000 ADV of diverted volume, and we are working to win back all diverted volume by the end of the year.\nAnd looking at our sales pipeline, we are pulling through new customers that value our superior on-time performance and want to come to UPS prior to the busy peak holiday season. Moving to our financial results, our Q3 performance fell down considerably from last year. Which was in line with our expectations, impacted in both the timing of contract ratification and higher labor costs resulting from the new labor contract. Consolidated revenue in Q3 was $21.1 billion, down 12.8% compared to last year. Operating profit was $1.6 billion, a decrease of 48.7% from last year, and consolidated operating margin was 7.7%.\nBrian will provide more details on our performance in a moment. With Q3 behind us, we are laser-focused on restoring volume in our network and executing our strategy to deliver shareholder value. So let me turn to our strategic update. Our customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy is enabling us to stay focused on our core business and invest to grow in the most attractive parts of the market, like Healthcare and with SMBs. Starting with customer-first, under our Better and Bolder framework, we recently announced two acquisitions that will further drive growth in healthcare logistics and in end-to-end return solutions.\nOne of our strategic objectives is to become the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world, and we are making bold moves to get us there. Last year's acquisition of Bomi and our recently announced pending acquisition of MNX Global Logistics are two examples of bold moves in Healthcare. MNX is an industry leader in time-critical and temperature-sensitive logistics, tailor-made for the complex needs of global healthcare. By combining MNX with UPS Express Critical and our global integrated network, we will enhance the speed and reliability of our Healthcare portfolio.\nWith MNX, UPS will be able to reach new healthcare markets like in Asia and new customers like the radiopharmaceutical sector. To further support our Healthcare strategy, this year we've opened seven dedicated Healthcare facilities in Europe and in the US, and the acquisition of Bomi further strengthened our healthcare footprint in Europe and Latin America. Since 2020, we have more than doubled our healthcare distribution space globally. These efforts and more are keeping us on track to reach our $10 billion Healthcare revenue targets this year, and we're just getting started.\nTurning to Returns, with the explosion of e-commerce demand, our Returns business has been a key area of growth over the last several years. What we've seen over this time is an increasing desire on the part of both our customers and our recipients for a frictionless and simple end-to-end returns experience. We've been building out this experience, but to help us get there faster. We just entered into an agreement to acquire Happy Returns. A technology-focused company that enables frictionless, no-box, and no-label returns.\nBy combining Happy Returns' easy digital experience and established drop-off points with UPS's small package network and footprint of close to 5,200 The UPS Store Locations, box-free, and label-free returns will soon be available at more than 12,000 convenient locations in the US. But our plans for returns don't stop at convenience. For our enterprise retail customers, we plan to provide a consolidated return solution that will lower their costs and improve their experience. And for UPS, Happy Returns expands our Returns portfolio with an innovative solution that will generate profitable B2B volume and help drive pickup and delivery density.\nFor us, customer-first isn't just about growth. It's about meeting customer needs. To that end, we are continuing to improve the delivery experience with the expansion of UPS Delivery Photo. 92% of our residential stops globally include a photo that shows exactly where the package was delivered. Not only does Delivery Photo provide peace of mind to recipients, but we get fewer calls about missing packages. With Delivery Photo, UPS has seen a reduction in US delivery-related support requests of more than 15%. We are also harnessing our data to deliver more agile and targeted products that meet our customers' needs.\nOur latest example is a new product we call HyperLocal, which leverages the footprint of our US facilities to provide select customers with a fast, next-day delivery option within a metro area. HyperLocal enables us to capture new profitable B2C and B2B volume and was launched in October as a new service offering. Let me quickly touch on DAP, our Digital Access Program. We are continuing to grow SMB volume with DAP. In Q4, we launched 10 new partners in time for peak. In the first nine months of this year, we generated $2.1 billion in DAP revenue, and we expect to deliver $3 billion in DAP revenue for the year. Let's turn to innovation-driven.\nUPS has been a technology company since our founding, and we are adding transformative technology in our operations that will increase efficiency and improve the employee experience. Smart Package Smart Facility, our RFID solution, is one way we're driving efficiency, and I'm pleased that we are wrapping up our Phase one rollout in our US facilities. The improvements we are seeing in our preload operations are even better than we expected, with nearly 200 of our buildings seeing misload rates in one in 2,500 packages or better. Deployment of Phase two is already underway, which equips our package cars with RFID readers.\nOver time, this will allow us to virtually scan smart packages during pickup and eliminate delivery scans during bulk delivery stops, both of which will enhance customer visibility and make our drivers more efficient. Another example of transformative technology is robotics, specifically starting a supply chain solution. We are implementing robotic unload technology inside our trailers to unload packages more efficiently. These robots navigate the inside of a trailer and can unload multiple box types and sizes autonomously. Now, it's still early days with this technology, but we are seeing many opportunities to further expand the use of robotics across our network.\nTurning to Q4, we are preparing for peak. Over the past five years, our service during peak has been better than our closest competitor by an average of 310 basis points. Service matters all the time, but especially at peak. So to prepare, we are collaborating with customers on volume projections and the timing of their promotions. We will also leverage technology like our network planning tools to control how the volume comes in, utilize available capacity, and adjust the network to operate as efficiently as possible. Regarding peak hiring, our people-led strategy enables greater flexibility to serve our customers during the holiday rush.\nFor example, our experienced part-time employees can now become seasonal support drivers. This enables them to deliver packages using their own vehicles before or after their regular shift. In addition, we plan to hire over 100,000 seasonal employees to help process and deliver holiday volume. This year, we've made it even easier and faster to apply for a job as we've shortened the digital process to less than 20 minutes from filling out an online application to receiving a job offer. Regarding our financial outlook, we made changes based on what we are seeing in the market. We still expect to have healthy peak volume in Q4.\nBut based on what appears to be slowing demand in all business segments, we are revising our guidance accordingly. Brian will share more detail in a moment. Back in January, I said that 2023 would be a year of resilience, and it has been. Our founder, Jim Casey, said, Determined people working together can do anything. During the year, we accelerated the deployment of Smart Package, Smart Facility, and made strategic acquisitions to grow in the best parts of the market.\nWe delivered a labor agreement that provides certainty for the next five years. We are operating with great speed and agility, controlling what we can control, and we are staying on strategy. With that, thank you for listening, and now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments today, I'll cover four areas. I'll start with the macro, followed by our Q3 results. Next, I'll cover cash and shareholder returns. Then I'll provide detail around our updated guidance. The macro environment in Q3 was challenging. The weakness we saw in Q2 continued into Q4, especially in Asia and Europe. Real exports and industrial production moved lower due to falling demand, and global consumer conditions did not significantly change. In the US, we faced tough conditions due to several factors. To begin, the volume diversion we experienced in Q2 continued into Q3.\nWhich led to more volume diversion than we anticipated. Next, some customers that diverted waited until our Teamsters contract was fully ratified in September before returning volume to our network. And lastly, we incurred higher labor costs associated with the new contract and added headcount earlier than normal to ramp up for peak so that we can ensure we maintain our industry-leading service levels. Through the end of the quarter, we adjusted our integrated network to support our customers' needs, managed costs, and stayed focused on bringing volume back into our network. Looking at our financial results for the quarter, consolidated revenue was $21.1 billion.\nDown 12.8% from last year. Consolidated operating profit was $1.6 billion, down 48.7% compared to the same period last year. Consolidated operating margin was 7.7%. For Q3, diluted earnings per share was $1.57, down 47.5% from the same period last year. Now let's look at our business segments. In US domestic, we knew Q3 would be a challenge, and it was, due to our labor negotiations, higher costs, and a dynamic economic backdrop. As we discussed on our last call, we ended Q2 with average daily volume in June down 12.2%. As contract negotiations became later and louder, we saw more volume diversion than we anticipated.\nAugust represented the low watermark when average daily volume was down 15.2% year-over-year. Post-ratification, we exited Q3 at half that rate, and we are continuing to see our week-over-week volume levels improve despite a challenging retail backdrop. In the US, in Q4, average daily volume was down 11.5%, and we estimate the impact of volume diversion reduced our volume by approximately 1.5 million packages per day. Moving to mix, in Q3, we saw lower volumes across all industry sectors, with the largest declines from Retail and High-Tech. B2C average daily volume declined 13.4% compared to last year, and B2B average daily volume was down 9%.\nIn Q3, B2B represented 44% of our volume, which was an increase of 120 basis points from a year ago. Also in Q3, we continued to see customers shift volume out of the air onto the ground. Total air average daily volume was down 15.8% year-over-year, with about half of the decline coming from our largest customer, as anticipated. Ground average daily volume was down 10.7%. In terms of customer mix, in Q4, SMBs, including platforms, made up 28.5% of our total US volume, an increase of 20 basis points year-over-year. For the quarter, US domestic generated revenue of $13.7 billion, down 11.1%.\nDespite lower volume, we remained disciplined on revenue quality. In Q3, revenue per piece increased 2%. Looking at the key drivers, the combination of strong base rates and improved customer and product mix increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 410 basis points. Changes in fuel prices decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 190 basis points. The remaining 20 basis points of decline was driven by multiple factors, including package characteristics. Turning to costs, total expense was down 5.1% in Q3. Compensation and benefits decreased the total expense growth rate by around 50 basis points.\nTotal union wage rates were up 11.5% in Q4, primarily driven by the contractual wage increase that went into effect on 1 August. Additionally, we began network preparations for peak. Offsetting the total increase in compensation and benefits, we leveraged our Total Service Plan and Network Planning Tools to reduce total hours in Q3 by 11.4%. We reduced the expense growth rate for purchased transportation by around 190 basis points, primarily from lower volume levels and our continued optimization efforts. Lower fuel costs contributed 170 basis points to the decrease in total expense growth rate.\nThe net of all other expense items and allocations reduced the expense growth rate by 100 basis points. The US Domestic segment delivered $665 million in operating profit, down 60.6% compared to Q3 of 2022, and operating margin was 4.9%. Moving to our international segment, macro conditions were uneven in Q3, with some regions of the world more challenged than others. Continued falling demand pressured Asia, and in Europe, consumers continued to contend with high inflation and tight financial conditions. In response, we adjusted headcount and block hours in our global network to match changes in geographic demand.\nIn the quarter, international total average daily volume was down 6.6% year-over-year. Nearly three quarters of the decline came from lower domestic average daily volume, which was down 9.1%, driven primarily by declines in Europe. On the Export side, average daily volume declined 4.1% on a year-over-year basis. Looking at Asia, export average daily volume was down 8%, and export volume on the China to US. lane, which is our most profitable lane, was down 10.3% year-over-year. One bright spot was the Americas region, where export average daily volume grew 4.7%, led by Canada and Mexico, leveraging our cross-border ground service.\nIn Q4, international revenue was $4.3 billion, which was down 11.1% from last year due to the decline in volume and a 1.4% reduction in revenue per piece. The decline in revenue per piece was driven by several factors. Lower fuel surcharge revenue contributed 230 basis points to the revenue per piece growth rate decrease. A reduction in demand-related surcharge revenue contributed 200 basis points to the decline. Partially offsetting the decline, multiple factors increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 290 basis points, including strong base rates and a weaker US dollar. Moving to Costs, in Q4, total international costs was down $203 million.\nPrimarily driven by lower fuel expense. In response to lower demand, we adjusted our integrated network and cut costs, which included reducing international block hours by 13.9% compared to last year and reducing headcount in operations and overhead functions by a total of 2,300 positions. We did all of this while continuing to deliver excellent service to our customers. Operating profit in the International segment was $675 million, down $329 million year-over-year, which included a $98 million reduction in demand-related surcharge revenue. Operating margin in Q4 was 15.8%.\nNow looking at supply chain solutions, in Q4, revenue was $3.1 billion, down $854 million year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers, let's start with forwarding. In international air freight, softer global demand and lower volume resulted in a decline in revenue and operating profit. On the Ocean side, demand flipped positive, driven by the retail sector and generated volume growth. However, excess market capacity pressured revenue and operating profit. In response to the dynamic forwarding market, we cut operating costs. Within forwarding, our truckload brokerage unit continued to face pressure from excess capacity in the market.\nWhich drove revenue and operating profit down. Logistics delivered revenue and operating profit growth. In Q3, supply chain solutions generated operating profit of $275 million and an operating margin of 8.8%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $199 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $66 million, and our effective tax rate for Q4 was 12.6%, which benefited from certain discrete items, including tax credits and global audit resolutions. Now let's turn to cash and shareholder returns. Year to date, we've generated $7.8 billion in cash from operations, and free cash flow was $4.9 billion.\nSo far this year, UPS has paid $4 billion in dividends, and we've completed $2.25 billion in shared buybacks. Now I'll share a few comments about our outlook. We expected 2023 to be a bumpy year, and it has been. We've navigated record-high inflation, rising interest rates, disruptions in China, a war in Eastern Europe, now a humanitarian crisis in Israel and Gaza, and the disruption around our US labor negotiations. Through all of this, we've remained focused on controlling what we can control, and are continuing to adjust the network to match volume levels and deliver industry-leading service to our customers.\nSince our last earnings call, the global demand environment has slowed, and macroeconomic conditions remain challenging. As a result, we've lowered our full-year guidance and have provided a range to reflect the uncertainty in the market. We now expect consolidated revenue to be between $91.3 and $92.3 billion, and consolidated operating margin to be between 10.8 and 11.3%. Let me walk you through our assumptions for the guidance range. In the US, we are winning back volume at a rapid pace, but we've also seen demand softness due to several factors, with many of our customers who did not divert.\nAdditionally, while consumer spending has been resilient in 2023, headwinds are mounting for the consumer in Q4. And looking at estimates for holiday retail sales this year, increases range from over 4% to 12%. Moving to international, a further downturn in exports and lower consumer spending in some of the largest European markets, including Germany and the UK, are negatively impacting volume. And Exports on our most profitable trade lane, which is China to the US, are not improving at the pace we had expected. Finally, in forwarding, air and ocean capacity has increased, which is putting additional downward pressure on market rates.\nIn fact, in Ocean, there is extreme overcapacity versus demand in the market, and the forwarding demand outlook in Q4 remains weak. Turning to capital allocation for the full year, capital expenditures are still expected to be about $5.3 billion. We are still planning to pay out around $5.4 billion in dividends in 2023, subject to board approval. We have repaid $1.6 billion in debt this year as planned and expect to repay an additional EUR 700 million of debt in Q4. We now expect $2.25 billion in share buybacks in 2023, which we have already completed. In Q4, we are redeploying cash back into the business for growth initiatives.\nSuch as strategic acquisitions to drive shareholder value. And lastly, we expect the tax rate for the full year to be approximately 22%. In closing, while navigating a very challenging macro environment, we remain focused on the job at hand. For the past five years, we have held the record as the industry leader in service during peak. We intend to do it again this year. Thank you, and operator, please open the lines. Steven, we're ready for our first question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll begin the question and answer period, and our first question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe you'd start on the guidance, and specifically for Q4. So I think it implies a pretty meaningful step up in operating profit. We understand that. I'm guessing ADV probably has a significant piece to do with that improvement in the operating profit considering how low it was in Q3. But maybe you could help us bridge from how we're going to get from Q3, which obviously was quite challenged, to what is a significant improvement sequentially. In that context, maybe if you could give us the help of what October ADV looked like on the domestic side. I think that's a very important number. Just kind of curious if you can help us with that too.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nSure, happy to, Chris. Good morning. So if you look at the bridge, I'll take the low end. From Q3, we posted $665 million in operating profit. To get to the low end of the guide, it would require about $800 million in profit. The two biggest drivers of that are volume and revenue quality. The productivity that the teams are generating, NAND in the US, is offsetting the labor contract step up because you'll realize we have three months in Q4, and we had two months of the new labor contract in Q2. Your question on volume, as we think about volume and revenue quality, those two alone provide a majority of the 800 step up.\nBut if you think about where we were in August and where we are in October, the momentum is increasing. We had a low watermark, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, down 15% in terms of ADV volume in August. That translates to around 16 million pieces from an ADV perspective. In October, we're seeing 19 million pieces. So we've seen that step up. I went back, Chris, and looked at last year, and the August to October step up was 1.5 million pieces. This year, the August to October step up is 2.7 million pieces. So from a glide path and a trajectory, we're seeing momentum. The absolute levels are coming up, and that's what led to the guide.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nAllison Poliniak\n\nDirector, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning. I just want to go back to the comments on the recapture trends. I think you mentioned it really started in September in terms of that recapture rate. Is that a huge acceleration in terms of what you're seeing in October? Is it from that recapture? And then also related to that, is there any cost associated with that volume you're recapturing today? Thanks.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, we're really pleased with how we're capturing volume back in our business. We have recaptured over 600,000 pieces per day of the volume that was lost. I will say 50% of that recapture is coming from our largest competitor. The recapture continues day by day, but it's not just about recapturing what we lost. It's about growing new business. You may recall, Allison, at the end of the Q2, we said we had about a $7 billion pipeline of new business.\nToday, we want about 25% of that pipeline. Now, that $7 billion is an annualized number, so all those packages and volume haven't come into the network yet. It will come in over the next year. But I couldn't be more pleased with how our sales team is performing and winning new accounts and winning back volume that diverted.\n\nAllison Poliniak\n\nDirector, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. And just to the follow-up, is there any cost associated with that recapture that you have to make?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThere's no material cost associated with the recapture. Customers are coming back because of our superior service.\n\nAllison Poliniak\n\nDirector, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYep, yep.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nHey, thanks for taking the question, guys. So Brian, you mentioned the $800 million step up. That's incremental sequential from Q3 to Q4. I just wanted to make sure that I heard that correctly. That's the low end of your guidance range assumption?\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThat's right, Dave.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nOkay. And then maybe a bigger picture, right, as we think about the exit rate kind of implied in the guide, I think it works out to something like down 20% year-over-year and even. How do we think about that build back in 2024? The front half, obviously, you have inflation, but you've got the GRI to offset. Should we be expecting that sort of second derivative rate of change to slowly get better and then snap back, or does it get meaningfully better in sort of Q1, Q2? How do we think about the shape of 2024 and how it's stepping up to recover in the domestic margin side?\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nSo two big pieces of sort of forward momentum, Dave. One is the exit rate on volume. Carol just talked about the win back and also the pipeline of new business. So going into next year, getting back on level footing with a system that has higher ADV will help us certainly from a cost and margin perspective. The revenue per piece, we announced a 5.9% GRI, so that'll be coming in. We talked to you recently about the cost overhang of the contract that goes from August to August. So I would tell you from a shape, certainly the first half of the year will be more challenged than the back half of the year.\nBack half of the year, we get into a two to three-year glide path with lower inflation per year, and then so pricing and productivity can help expand the margins. But those are the pluses and minuses as we look into 2024. Obviously, we'll go into a lot more detail 26 March when we get together with you all for our next Investor Day.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nThat rate of change in the first half, better than Q4?\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nLet me come back to you, Dave, but we're certainly building momentum.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nLet's finish up the year, Dave, and then we'll give you some color about 2024.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nIt's always about 2024. Thanks for the time.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks, Dave.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, I was wondering if you could give some color on your confidence level on the new revenue range. How much certainty do you feel the visibility and what frames the high and low end? Thank you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nSo thanks, Jordan, for the question. Look, we feel good about the revenue range. We've narrowed it to $1 billion. And I think the thing that's going to drive the upper end versus the lower end really has to do with the retail backdrop. I mentioned in my script there's sort of the broad range of the online retail sales for the holiday period. To the extent it's in the higher end of that, we'll have more volume and more revenue. To the extent it comes in with some of the risks we're seeing, it's towards the lower end.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks, Jordan.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nMaybe one other comment. Maybe one other comment, if I could, Brian, on the volume range. We know which of our customers peak during peak. There are about 117 customers in the US that make up about 86% of our peak volume. We are sitting down with each of those customers, understanding what their plans are as we work on our operating plans to make sure we deliver superior service. Having that insight, if you will, gives us a lot of confidence in the US volume numbers that Brian shared with you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, you made a couple of comments on the volume that you're recapturing, and I just want to make sure I understand it. I guess it's an important point. So I think, Carol, you said 600,000 pieces a day have been recaptured. But then, Brian, you said kind of last year, the August to October was 1.5 million, and it's 2.7 million increased this year. So that implies, I guess, 1.2 million increase.\nSo I just wondered if you could give a little more perspective of kind of where we're at in October, how much of that lost business has been recaptured. And then I guess another way you framed it was December, you were going to get back to flat volumes before. I think it was a prior comment. Do you still think you can do that, or are we thinking December volumes are down? Thank you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah, Tom. So to frame it up for you, we were trying to get December back to flat versus prior year. I think the guide now implies from a low single digit to a mid-single digit in the month of December, and that's pending some of the backdrop I just talked about in terms of the retail outlook. So from a momentum perspective, I gave an August to an October number. But as Carol mentioned, we lost 1.5, or we had diverted 1.5 million pieces. We've seen 40% of that, roughly 600,000 pieces, already come back to the system. We're also pushing forward with new business that Carol referenced as well.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Stephanie Moore of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Thank you for the question.\n\nJoseph Hafling\n\nVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nThis is Joe Hafling on for Stephanie Moore. I had maybe a conceptual question on sort of the recapture looking in the near term. Given it's peak season and customers are focused on their own execution right now, does this limit your ability to win back volumes in the near term? If shippers don't want to disrupt any of the plans that they've already got in place. Obviously, you've highlighted the capture rate sort of September, October, but just wondering if that slows down as we kind of get into November, December, just as shippers don't want to disrupt their own operations right now.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nActually, it's accelerating. Customers want to come back into our network before peak because of our superior service that we've exhibited over the past five years.\n\nJoseph Hafling\n\nVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGotcha. Thank you so much. It's helpful.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Hey, great.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGood morning. If I could just clarify one thing on the step up. I think, Allison, do you say you're not using increasing pricing as you get toward the tail end of that volume gain? And then my question is on international, right? So you're looking, I guess, Brian, to really snap back closer back to that 20% range. Is that kind of what you're still looking at in terms of margins at international as we move into Q4? Just want to understand the shift from peak versus daily space coming back on and the impacts to margin there.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah, on the first question, Ken, obviously, you've got volume and pricing. I was talking to Allison about the volume component. We have announced a 6 to 7% peak season surcharge. So that's obviously flowing through from a revenue standpoint in Q4 as well.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nI think Allison's question was, are there costs associated with winning back volume? And as I responded, not meaningful. Ken, from time to time, we have found customers who diverted and they entered into longer-term contracts. And we might help them exit those longer-term contracts, but it's not a meaningful discount. It's just we might help them. Nothing measurable.\nOur next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. So hey, Brian, one of the earlier questions about the bridge from Q3 to Q4, you answered it sort of how do we get to the low end. So should we think that the low end of the range is more of your base case? I just want to understand sort of that answer. Then can you just maybe more explicitly just talk about what the margin expectations are for each of the segments in Q4? Just I wasn't sure what you were thinking for each business. [crosstalk] So margin or profit, however you want to answer.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah. I have the walk in front of me for the high end and the low end, so I can give it to either range. I think it's this retail backdrop uncertainty that drives the delta in volume, which drives the delta in profit. So it's the same levers. It's the volume and the revenue quality really driving the majority. It's at a higher component at the high end versus the $800 million I referenced at the lower end. So net net, I think from a margin shape standpoint, we finished Q3 mid-single digit in the US. Obviously, that's a very low watermark driven by the volumes we saw in the quarter.\nWe're looking in the fourth quarter to step back up into that high single digit, low double digit range, getting back to the trajectory. Then from an international perspective, we were at a 15.8% in the third quarter. I think Kate and the team have plans largely through controlling what we can control, whether it's block hours, whether it's headcount, taking that. And they've done a good job of demonstrating that. Q1 was an 18% margin international. Q2 was a 20%. So we're probably in the middle of that range for the fourth quarter. Hopefully, that helps.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you. Yep.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you, operator. Hi, everybody. I guess maybe just a very simple question, I guess, is when do we return to margin expansion in domestic? I mean, RPP/CPP spread was really negatively wide in Q3. I assume it's still negative, albeit less so in Q4. Can we get to a situation where we get back to year-on-year margin expansion in early next year, or do we have to wait until August when the labor really inflation really steps down?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, maybe just an observation on the US margin in Q3. Recall that we had $500 million of expense related to our Kingsford contract in Q3. We backed that out. The US margin would have been 8.5%. 8.5% on volume down 11% is not a bad margin. So we've got a bit of pressure on the margin that we shared with you because of our new contract. The contract is front-end loaded.\nWe're bearing the pain of that front-end load for a five-year contract that's very attractive. The compounded annual growth rate on the five years is 3.3%. So once we get through this first front-end load with 46% of the cost in the first year, once we get through that, the margin is going to grow. It's going to grow in a big way. So hopefully, that's helpful.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nI mean, it kind of is helpful, but I mean, I guess the question is, is that are we stuck in this return profile through the first half of next year and then we see a step function improvement, or can we see improvement as you guys maybe rip out some of those seasonal costs in the first quarter that we can get back to year-on-year growth in the first quarter even?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nAbsolutely. Fair question.\nI mean, let us finish this year. Then we will give you guidance for 2024, and we can break it down by quarter. That's going to be helpful.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Thank you. Yep.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nChristyne McGarvey\n\nVP, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. This is Christyne McGarvey on for Ravi. I wanted to take a step back and ask about kind of the path to some of the longer-term targets that you set out at your previous Investor Day, particularly just on some of the macro assumptions that you think you'll need to get there. We've seen definitely muted consumer spending in the last 18 months, but not a collapse. So how much of an uptick in consumer spending do you need to get there? Or, maybe said another way, kind of, how much do you feel is directly in your control?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nSo, as we look at the small package volume in the United States, what we're seeing is basically a reversion to the mean. So, we're at pre-pandemic levels. And I think our learning, all of our learnings, is that anytime volume spikes because of an event, things are going to revert back to the mean. If you look at the growth rates projected for the small package market in the United States, it's low single digit for the next couple of years. So, we plan to grow not just at the market, but ahead of the market because of the investments that we're making with new products, new capabilities, and actually new acquisitions, which we're very excited about.\nMaybe I'll take a minute to talk about Happy Returns, which we just announced last night. Our returns business has been pretty growthy because of the explosion of e-commerce. It's grown 25% since 2020. We like this business a lot, but we know we can offer a better experience for our retailers because it's expensive. Retailers estimate that between 20% and 30% of all online orders are returned, and it costs them on average about $33 to process that return. So with Happy Returns, we're going to offer consolidated returns for our customers, which will reduce their handling costs and actually improve our delivery density.\nSo it's a win-win-win. So we're going to put the pedal to the metal in terms of growing the returns business because it's a very good business for us and one that our customers need us to solve for. So I'm excited about that. The other acquisition that I'm excited about is in healthcare. Our healthcare business will be $10 billion this year against an addressable market that's over $100 billion. We're going to grow that market. It's got double-digit margins. We're going to grow it because we need to grow it. It's important for the world. It's important for humanity. And we are the best in the world at this. So that doesn't require any consumer spending. That's just leaning into a market share capture with the capabilities that we are investing in, be it cold chain capabilities and more.\n\nChristyne McGarvey\n\nVP, Morgan Stanley\n\nReally helpful. Thank you. Yep.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nPartner, Transportation, and Logistics Equity Research, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you very much. I'd like to drill down a little bit on the macro comments as they relate to domestic. I think it's pretty straightforward what you're saying about Europe and Asia, but can you help put some understanding around your concern for the weaker consumer with student loans and what have you? It does sound like we're going to be in for a reasonable holiday season. Where are you seeing the weakness, whether it's an industry segment or a consumer segment? What concerns you on e-commerce and the domestic consumer?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, we've seen clearly a shift from goods to services. As people through the pandemic started going back to work, taking vacations, eating out at restaurants, going to amusement parks, they're spending their dollars differently. It's not that the consumer is not healthy. They're spending their dollars differently. And what we're seeing with many of our retail customers is a real desire to bring people back into their stores. They should bring people back into their stores because it's their largest investment. So you see retailers offering buy online, pick up in store where they hadn't offered that before.\nSo I can give you example after example of customers, not by name obviously, but customers that are in our top 20, where they're seeing their same store sales down year on year because they're anniversarying the COVID peak, if you will. And they're seeing their online sales down even more. And part of that is because people are going back into stores. Part of that is shifting.\nSo that's the comment that Brian made in his remarks about just some demand softening, is that we do see that with some of our larger customers who didn't divert. But their overall business, and you can look at their guides. I'm not talking about anything that's not public. You can look at their guides where they not only have reported declining sales, but they're guiding softer.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nPartner, Transportation, and Logistics Equity Research, Vertical Research Partners\n\nOkay. Thank you for the clarification.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYeah.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning. And thanks for taking my question. Brian, you did talk about revenue quality initiatives. I know folks have brought up price quite a bit on this call, but can you talk about not just your pricing outlook, but maybe the mix impact from some of these initiatives you've had in the past on small and medium enterprises?\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah. SMEs, Brandon, are a very attractive part of the business, and we've continued to penetrate that market. So that's been favorable from a mix perspective. We are seeing customers trade down, though, from air product to ground. And so we've seen that in the numbers. Air was down more than ground volume. So there's a bit of a headwind there from a customer mix perspective. So overall, we have a customer mix impact as well that's going on. We're gliding down with our largest customer. So there's a shift there that tends to help from an RPP perspective.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nNo, it's interesting. If you go back to 2019, our volume is about the same in the third quarter as it was back in 2019. But our SMB mix has moved from 23% to 29%. And our net revenue per piece has moved from $9.99 to $12.54. So we've been laser focused on improving the revenue quality in our business, and we will continue to do that. Value is defined by what the customer is willing to pay for, and we are improving our experience every day. A good example of that is delivery photo. We're now 92% of all of our residential drops are photographed, which is creating a better experience for our recipients, for our customers, and for us candidly.\nWe're leaning into simplifying the experience and how it is to work with us. And we've talked to you about the widgets that we have at DAP or the improvements that we've made in our claim process. We see our Net Promoter Score now in the high 40s. So we are leaning on that experience because it helps grow the revenue quality, and we're going to continue to do that.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks, Brandon.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just two quick follow-ups, actually. Can you talk about the pace of getting the share back as you go into Q4?\nDo you think perhaps you had the low-hanging fruit, the easier ones to convert back? Do you think that those came back sooner? And maybe the pace from here is a little bit harder. And then on the buybacks, you mentioned you're cutting or at least you're stopping the buyback for the quarter. You've got two acquisitions targeted. I just wanted to make sure it was clear in terms of what those are, if those were the Happy Returns and MNX, or if there's potentially something else that was on the horizon.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nNope. We have nothing else planned on the horizon today. So we'll be buying MNX and Happy Returns this quarter, and it's about $1 billion in total that we'll be spending on those two companies. In terms of the pace of getting shippers, I mentioned earlier it's accelerating because of the fact that peak is nearly on us. So people want to come into the network. Here's the truth, though. It does take time to come back in. I get weekly updates from Nando and the team, from Kate and the team about, Well, how's the volume coming back in?\nAnd I see that, Oh, we've gotten a handshake. We've got an agreement from a customer that's coming back in. And then I see it takes 30 days to get it back on car. And so now I'm like, I want photos when it's on car because I want to make sure it's actually in the network. And that's what we're getting. We're having some fun with that, actually, because we're seeing it picked up from our competitors. That's always fun when you're picking up volume from these competitors. So it's accelerating.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nSteven, we have time for one more question. Okay. With no further questions, thank you for your time and have a good day.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, it does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now hang up.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThank you.",

And now I'll turn the call over to Carol.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you, Ken, and good morning. Let me begin by commenting on our agreement with the Teamsters. We believe this contract is a win, win, win. Together we reached agreements on the issues that were important to Teamsters leadership, to our employees, and to UPS. We have the best people and our new contract continues to reward our employees with the best pay and benefits in our industry. I'll share some highlights of the new contract in a moment. The Q2 was challenging and I'd like to recognize the more than 500,000 UPSers around the world for their hard work and effort and for doing what they do better than anyone and that's deliver industry-leading service. I'd also like to give a special shout out to our salespeople for their dedication to our customers.\nMost importantly, I want to thank our customers for putting their trust and their business with us during our labor negotiations, and for those customers who diverted, we look forward to bringing you back to our network. Moving to our Q2 results, we expected negotiations with the Teamsters to be late and loud, and they were. As the noise level increased throughout Q2, we experienced more volume diversion than we anticipated. Now, when faced with volume declines, some companies might go off strategy or chase unprofitable business, but that is not today's UPS. Today's UPS is focused on the long term. During the quarter, we stayed on strategy and continued to invest in the business. We also maintained our pricing discipline.\nFurther, the investments we've made in our automated success and technology like Network Planning Tools or NPT have enabled greater agility than ever before. As volume levels declined, we demonstrated that agility by quickly adjusting our integrated network and maintaining high levels of productivity. Looking at our Q2 results versus last year, consolidated revenue declined at 10.9% to $22.1 billion under our expectations due to lower volume. But by controlling what we could control, we quickly took cost out of the Network and delivered $2.9 billion of operating profit in line with our expectations. Consolidated operating margin was 13.2%, which exceeded our expectations.\nOver the past three years we've executed several initiatives in support of our customer first people led innovation driven strategy. Let me highlight some recent accomplishments starting with customer first. During the labor negotiation, communication and transparency with customers was a top priority. During the quarter, over 500 UPS executives had regular contact with many, many customers. Our approach with these customers was to keep volume from diverting or, if it diverted, win it back. After the labor negotiation was settled, this approach brought us closer to our customers and we've gained an even better understanding of their end-to-end supply chain which will allow us to better serve them. We are now laser focused on executing our win back initiative and pulling through the more than $7 billion of opportunity in our sales pipeline.\nTo do so, we will leverage our superior service and capability and the investments we've made in the digital customer experience. While all volume winds back and new volume won't happen immediately, we are already seeing some volume return on the digital front. Our Digital Access Program, or DAP continues to grow. We've introduced new plug-and-play technology to make it even easier for e-commerce platforms to connect. In Q2, we added seven new platforms to DAP, including four international platforms. In the first six months of this year, DAP generated more than $1.4 billion in revenue, putting us on our way to achieving our 2023 DAP revenue target of around $3 billion.\nOne of our strategic objectives is to become the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world. In Q2, we further expanded our European footprint by opening our first dedicated healthcare distribution facility in Ireland, giving us certified healthcare facilities in 35 countries. For H1 2023, revenue from our healthcare portfolio reached $4.7 billion. For the full year, we expect to generate $10 billion in healthcare revenue.\nOn the international small package front, we've been quickly expanding in India, which is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. In May of last year we launched MOVIN, our asset-light domestic joint venture, and we recently expanded from three cities to 49 of the largest cities in India, now covering approximately 90% of the B2B market opportunity.\nTurning to people-led, we expect our new labor contract to be ratified in two weeks. Today, I'll just share some highlights, and we will provide more details after ratification. Let's start with weekend delivery. The new contract converts all 22 employees who are our weekend delivery drivers to regular full-time package car drivers. This gives us the flexibility we need to schedule delivery drivers Tuesday through Saturday and provides more work-life balance for our drivers. Further, we kept our Sunday delivery service by maintaining our SurePost product. Moving to working conditions, we will be improving the working conditions for all employees, including air conditioning in every new US package car starting in January 2024.\nWe retained our ability to introduce new technology and the flexibility to use seasonal support during the peak holiday season for our Teamster employees. This contract further strengthens the industry-leading pay and benefits they already enjoy when you look at total compensation. By the end of the new contract, the average UPS full-time driver will make about $170,000 annually in pay and benefits. For all part-time union employees that are already working at UPS by the end of this contract, they will be making at least $25.75 per hour while receiving full health care and pension benefits. In fact, our part-timers are among only 7% of all US part-time workers in the private sector to enjoy these benefits.\nThere's much, much more, but the last point I would like to highlight is the addition of a new paid holiday on Martin Luther King Jr. Day which will be a benefit for all US employees. UPS has a long history of honoring Dr. King and this additional paid holiday aligns with our values. All of this and more helps to make UPS the best place to work. Which brings me to Innovation Driven.\nWe run the most efficient integrated network in the world powered by technology developed by UPS engineers. In the quarter, we leveraged the agility of our network to match capacity with volume level. Key to this agility was NPT, which is a set of technologies that use AI and machine learning to harness the value of our data to quickly make changes to load planning, scheduling, and volume flows across the network. This technology is powerful. In fact, NPT can do it in an afternoon, what used to take a team of engineers months to do. By using NPT with our Total Service Plan, we quickly matched the network to volume level. This resulted in a nearly 10% reduction in hours in the US in line with the decline in volume.\nAdditionally, MPT enabled us to further reduce semi, variable, and fixed costs which Brian will detail in a moment. Importantly, we did all of this while continuing to provide industry-leading service to our customers. There is no finish line when it comes to driving efficiency. For example, we made great progress in rolling out Smart Package Smart Facility, our RFID initiative. At the end of Q2, almost 50% of our US buildings were operating with this technology and we expect to complete the US deployment by the end of October.\nQuickly touching on our outlook now that labor negotiations are behind us, we've updated our guidance for the full year primarily to reflect the volume impact from labor negotiations and the costs associated with a tentative agreement. Brian will share more detail in a moment. Let me close by talking about our future: customer first, people-led, innovation-driven under our Better and Bolder framework is a winning strategy. Strategy. We are winning in the best parts of the market and making our integrated network even more agile and efficient. Now for the people-led part of our strategy, our new contract establishes a platform for the future. Our company is stronger than ever and we will move even faster to execute our strategy and continue delivering industry-leading service for our customers.\nI'm excited about what the future holds and what UPSers will accomplish together. I truly believe our best days are ahead of us. With that, thank you for listening. Now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks, Carol, and good morning. Let me begin by echoing Carol's comment on how pleased we are with achieving a win-win-win labor agreement covering our more than 330,000 Teamsters employees. This contract provides UPS a significant measure of certainty around labor, gives us operational flexibility to increase productivity, and continue providing industry-leading service to our customers, and it will help us attract and retain the best employees in the industry. Now in my comments today, I'll cover four areas. I'll start with the macro followed by our Q2 results. Next, I'll cover cash and share owner returns, and lastly I'll provide some comments on the second half of the year. In the Q2, the overall macro conditions in the US were in line with our expectations.\nInternationally, conditions were a little worse than we expected due to lower growth in both real exports and industrial production. Moving to our financial results for the quarter, consolidated revenue was $22.1 billion, down 10.9% from last year. All three of our segments demonstrated agility and on a combined basis drove down total expense by $2.1 billion in the Q2. Year over year, this enabled us to deliver $2.9 billion in operating profit, which is the target we communicated to you last quarter and was a decrease of 18.4% compared to last year. Consolidated operating margin was 13.2%, a decline of 120 basis points compared to the same period last year. With all three segments achieving double-digit operating margins for the Q2, diluted earnings per share is $2.54, down 22.8% from the same period last year.\nNow let's look at our business segments in US Domestic. Our disciplined approach to revenue quality partially offset the decrease in volume as volume declined throughout the quarter. The team did an excellent job adjusting the network to match demand and drive out costs in real time, all while maintaining industry-leading service levels. We expected volume to decline in Q2, and it did, but we saw more volume diversion than anticipated as noise levels around our labor negotiations increased. We estimate the impact of volume diversion, combined with a slowdown in our sales pipeline pull-through, reduced volume in Q2 by approximately 1.2 million packages per day for the quarter. Total average daily volume was down 9.9%, with June down 12.2%. Moving to mix in the Q2, we saw lower volumes across all industry sectors, with the largest declines from retail and high tech.\nB2C average daily volume declined 11.5% compared to last year, and B2B average daily volume was down 7.7% in Q2. B2B represented 43.7% of our volume, which was an increase of 100 basis points from a year ago. Also in Q2, we continued to see customers shift volumes out of the air onto the ground. Total air average daily volume was down 16.5% year-over-year , and ground average daily volume declined 8.6%. In terms of customer mix in Q2, SMB average daily volumes declined less than volume from our enterprise customers. SMBs including.\nQ1 US domestic generated revenue of $14.4 billion, down 6.9%. Revenue per piece increased 3.3%, partially offsetting the decline in volume. The combination of strong base rates and improved customer mix increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 670 basis points. Changes in fuel prices decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 220 basis points. The remaining 120 basis point decline was due to multiple factors, including package characteristics and product mix. Turning to costs, the US domestic team took out $889 million of expense year-over-year , which is the largest year-over-year cost reduction in our history. How did we do it? We leveraged our technology and the agility of our integrated network. Let me walk you through some of the levers we pulled. We continued to execute our Total Service Plan and reduced labor hours by nearly 10%.\nTo maintain our high levels of productivity, we leveraged the power of our Network Planning Tools to optimize package flows and pull volume out of smaller non-automated buildings and flow it into our larger automated facilities. While total volume was down 9.9%, we reduced the volume in our non-automated buildings by 18%. This enabled us to close sites and reduce operational headcount by 7% compared to last year. We reduced feeder movements by continuing to manage cube utilization in our trailers and brought on more UPS feeder drivers to support our Fastest Ground Ever lane. Looking at air volumes, we pulled more activity into Worldport, our global air hub in Louisville. This enabled us to move more volume via our next day flight and reduce second day flights.\nAs a result, domestic block hours were lower by 6.5% versus last year, and we exited Q2 with block hours down more than 10%. And lastly, we reduced management headcount by over 2,500 positions year-over-year . All of these actions helped us reduce US domestic expense in the Q2. Specifically, compensation and benefits was down $205 million year-over-year despite 6.5% increase in average union wage rate. Purchased transportation declined $207 million, fuel expense was lower by $394 million, and there were multiple factors that drove the remaining $83 million reduction in expense. Our results are proof of our agility, and in Q2 we took out a record amount of costs and held the cost per piece growth rate to 3.7% while volume was down nearly 10%.\nThe US domestic segment delivered $1.7 billion in operating profit in line with our expectations and down 9.4% compared to Q2 of 2022. Operating margin was 11.7%, an increase of 180 basis points from Q1 of this year.\nMoving to our international segment, macro conditions remained sluggish in the Q2. In Europe, persistent high inflation and tight financial conditions weighed on the consumer, and in Asia, the slow recovery we experienced in Q1 stalled in the Q2. In the quarter, international total average daily volume was down 6.6% year-over-year. About 2/3 of the decline came from lower domestic average daily volume which was down 8.7%, driven primarily by decline in Europe. On the export side, average daily volume declined 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. Looking at Asia export average daily volume was down 10.1%. Export volume on the China to US lane was down 7% year-over-year which was an improvement fromQ1.\nIn Q2, international revenue was $4.4 billion, which was down 13% from last year due to the decline in volume and a 5.7% reduction in revenue per piece. The decline in revenue per piece was primarily driven by a 570 basis point decrease from fuel surcharge revenue. Additionally, a reduction in demand-related surcharge revenue contributed 240 basis points to the decline, and there was an 80 basis point decline in revenue per piece due to a stronger US dollar partially offsetting the decline. Multiple factors increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 320 basis points, including strong base rate, and favorable volume mix as export volume outperformed domestic volume. Moving to cost in Q2, total international cost was down $356 million, primarily driven by lower fuel expense.\nWe leveraged the agility of our integrated network to match capacity with demand and focused on controlling what we could control. These actions included flight reduction which drove international block hours down 9.4% compared to last year, which includes a 15.5% block hour reduction on Asia outbound transcontinental flights. We also reduced headcount in operations and overhead functions by a total of more than 1,700 positions and we did all of this while continuing to deliver excellent service to our customers. Operating profit in the international segment was $902 million, down $302 million year-over-year , which included a $123 million reduction in demand related surcharge revenue. Operating margin in Q2 was 20.4% in line with our expectations. Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions, our teams continue to navigate a challenging macro environment and executed our plans to reduce cost.\nIn Q2, revenue was $3.2 billion, down $990 million year-over-year . Looking at the key drivers, forwarding continued to be impacted by softer global demand, especially out of Asia, which drove market rates and volume lower. This resulted in a decline in revenue and operating profit. In response, we cut operating costs and are continuing to manage buy-sell spreads, logistics delivered revenue and operating profit growth, including gains in our health care business. In Q2, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $336 million and an operating margin of 10.4%.\nWalking through the rest of the income statement, we had $190 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $66 million, and our effective tax rate for Q2 was 23.5%. Now let's turn to cash and share owner returns. Year to date we generated $5.6 billion in cash from operations, and free cash flow was $3.8 billion including our annual pension contribution of $1.2 billion that we made in Q1. Also this year, in Q1 we issued $2.5 billion in long term debt. We've used $1.6 billion to pay off debt maturities in Q2 , and we plan to use $900 million to pay off debt in the second half of this year. In the first half of 2023, UPS paid $2.7 billion in dividend.\nWe also completed $1.5 billion in share buybacks at an average price of around $178 per share. Now I'll share a few comments about our outlook. As Carol mentioned, with the contract out for ratification, we have updated our consolidated revenue and adjusted operating margin guidance. For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated revenue of about $93 billion and consolidated operating margin of around 11.8%.\nNow let me provide some color to help you update your models for H2 of the year. The US Domestic segment is navigating a couple of unique factors in H2 of the year. First, in Q2 and into July, we experienced more volume diversion than we anticipated. Because of this, our volume ramp up for H2 of the year is starting from a lower base. We're already executing our initiatives to win back diverted volume and accelerate the pull through from our sales pipeline while remaining disciplined on revenue quality.\nAs a result of our efforts, by the end of the year we expect our average daily volume level to be about even with December of last year. Overall, for the second half of 2023, we expect US average daily volume to be down by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year . Second, looking at expense in the US Domestic segment, the union wage rate increases included in our new labor agreement for the first year are higher than we originally planned. We started to accrue for the terms of the tentative agreement on August 1 while the contract is out for ratification. Further, we will address wage compression that resulted from the new labor contract. These additional labor costs in the back half of the year will be partially offset by the network adjustments we made in the Q2.\nTurning to the international segment in the second half of the year, we expect the year-over-year volume growth rate to be similar to what we saw in Q2 and revenue per piece growth to be flattish compared to the same period last year. In Supply Chain Solutions, we expect second half revenue to be down by a high single-digit percent year-over-year , with full year revenue approaching $14 billion. Moving to capital allocation, our 2023 full year targets have not changed. We will continue to stay on strategy and invest in both efficiency and growth opportunities. Capital expenditures are still expected to be about $5.3 billion, which includes completing the deployment of the first phase Smart Package Smart Facility in the US, continuing to expand our healthcare logistics footprint globally, expanding DAP internationally, and investing in our Logistics as a Service platform.\nWe are still planning to pay out around $5.4 billion in dividends in 2023, subject to board approval, and for the full year we still plan to buy back around $3 billion of our shares. With negotiations behind us, we are moving our business forward for our people. We have a platform for the future that continues to reward our employees, which helps us to deliver industry-leading service to our customers and enables us to win back volume and drive revenue quality. We will control what we can control, which means continuing to manage cost as we scale up the network with volume. We are staying on strategy and investing through this cycle, which will enable us to grow in the most efficient, attractive parts of the market, make our integrated network even more efficient, and continue to reward our shareholders.\nThank you, operator. Please open the lines.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll conduct a question and answer session. Our first question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nSo Brian or Carol, I'd love to understand kind of at a high level what we should be expecting about the shape of inflation over the course of the contract. I know we're probably not going to get into too many of the details today. But I'd love to understand kind of from a CAGR perspective how you're set up for inflation over the life of this contract.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, maybe I'll just start with some observations about the contract and then, Brian, you can provide details on the shape of the curve. As we got into the negotiations, David, it became very clear to me that we were negotiating on behalf of a number of stakeholders. We were negotiating on behalf of our people, we were negotiating on behalf of our customer, we were negotiating on behalf of our country, we were negotiating on behalf of our shareholders, and we were negotiating on behalf of UPS. And as I look at the handshake agreement that we achieved, I think we have a win, win, win for all stakeholders. I'll make that real for you. First, in terms of our people, they will continue to be paid the highest wage and benefits in the industry. They'll have better work life balance.\nAnd the working conditions will also be improved as we'll be adding air conditioning to all package cars starting in January. For our customers, we avoided a work stoppage, and that would have been disruptive for them and for their customers. So I think that's a win for our country. As you know, we move 6% of US GDP every day, and there was no place for this volume to go. So we avoided a disruption to the economy with this handshake agreement. For our share owners, I would say we also have a win because as I look at the economic package over the five years, the compounded annual growth rate of this economic package is 3.3%. So I say that's a win. And for UPS, we retain the flexibility we need to take care of our customers.\nCustomers to provide seasonal help during the holidays, to add technology to drive productivity and efficiency. So I think it's a win, win, win. And maybe Brian, you can talk about the shape.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah, Carol. I'm going to host a call, Dave, and go a bit deeper on it, but it's sort of a barbell type effect. We've got a majority of the increase. Well, not majority, over 40% in year one and then years two, three, four quite reasonable from an inflation standpoint and then with another step up in year five. But I'll go into more details on that when we host a call following the ratification.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nAll right, thanks for that. Maybe just as a quick follow up, can you talk about what you need to do to win back some of the volume you might have lost to the contract uncertainty? I'm just wondering kind of how quickly you guys are expecting that to come back as we look into what's baked in the guidance.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, United Parcel Service Inc\n\nSo it's all hands on deck to win back the volume that was diverted as a result of the labor negotiations. The first thing we did is that we stood up a control tower. This is the same kind of control tower that we use during peak to ensure that we can onboard this volume coming back without disruption. So that is up and running, and I'm very pleased with what I'm seeing in that regard. We have of course mitigated all the risk that was still remaining because we didn't know the outcome of the contract. So those high risk customers are now shipping with us without any risk. From a marketing perspective, we're doing a number of things. The first thing we're doing is we're amplifying our service message because we do have the best service in the industry.\nWe are also amplifying our SurePost advantage because this is a very attractive product if you're shipping low-weight packages. We are expanding our speed campaign because we are faster than our largest competitor in many, many markets. So we are amplifying our speed campaign. We are also expanding our weekend pickup to four markets. We are expanding our Saturday delivery by 890 postal codes. And we are launching new offerings inside Deal Manager, which is a tool that we use to win new small- and medium-sized businesses. There is a lot of effort underway to bring back this business that we lost and to win new business. Now I will tell you it's not all going to happen at once.\nAnd so we understand that we're working with our customers to bring it in as quickly as we can, but also as smoothly as we can for them as they've diverted. Looking at our volume in July, I will say that it was still down year on year but not as much as the decline that we saw in June.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nAll right, thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Good morning. Maybe just a little bit Carol, your thoughts into the peak season here. Maybe outside of the diversion, what was underlying in your thoughts here? And I think Brian mentioned still expecting negative all the way through the end of December. So maybe just a little bit of thoughts on the backdrop and the differences between the contract and what's going on economically.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYeah, we'll still have a peak, even though we're winning back the volume that was diverted over time. We'll still have a peak. We are collaborating with the top 100 and customers that represent 87% of our peak surge. So we're already starting to work with them on their operating plans for peak. Peak will be 21 days this year, the same as it was last year. We expect to see surge in the 60% area this year. So it's still going to peak up. It's just from a different volume level, and we're well prepared to have another peak. For us, it's just another day with more volume.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks, operator. Hi everyone. Brian, can you help us, you know, on the guidance change? Just attribute that guidance change to volume diversion and then maybe the difference in terms of what you accrued on the wages, and I don't know if you provided this in your prepared remarks, but the monthly cadence of domestic volumes in June and July. And then lastly, Carol, we started the year at 12% margin expectations for domestic; we went down to 11%, now we're probably around 10%. Obviously we're in a completely different world and you have a new wage deal. Just provide your thoughts. Around 3.3% inflation doesn't seem like an enormous hurdle.\nHow do you think what's happened over the last seven months has changed kind of your view on what you think the return profile of this business is from an operating margin perspective of the domestic business, and when we can get back to like a positive trajectory in that? Thank you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nAmit, thanks for the question. So from a guide perspective we went from $97 billion to $93 billion in revenue. That's a $4 billion change. About $1 billion of that is from the softer volume Carol talked about in the Q2, the higher diversion, and about $3 billion is coming from the second half. As we think about volume exiting Q2 down 12%. You'll remember in March and April we were down 7%, but June exited at minus 12%. So if we take that minus 12% exit and you get to flat by the end of the year that glide over the balance of the year is about it's down mid single digit down about 6%.\nFrom a profit standpoint, we dropped about $1.4 billion in profit to 11 billion or 11.8% margin, and most of that is coming from the domestic side, about a billion dollars. That billion, Amit, is split fairly evenly between wages and then also the lower volume I just referenced. There was a $400 million piece related to some inconsistent recovery in the euro, inflation, and interest rates. Germany's in a recession and a bit of Asia. But the vast majority is really split half and half between wages and volume.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nOn the monthly cadence, we were down 12% in June and down double digit in July, but better than 12%.\nOn your question about margin, as we got into the negotiation with Teamsters, and this is true for any negotiation, there are some things that are very important, and one thing that was very important for Teamsters leadership was to front load some of the wage inflation. We agreed to do that. That does put a little pressure on the margin, as Brian pointed out, but that doesn't change the destination, it just changes the journey. We'll have a bit of pressure for the next year through August of next year, but then the inflation is very manageable. I see a path back to 12% or higher margins in the US because of all the investments that we're making to drive productivity. A good proof point of that is what we did in the Q2.\nSo let me give you an example of just one of our initiatives, which is Smart Package Smart Facility. We're now in about 50% of the buildings in the United States, and 50% of those buildings have missed load improvements from 1 in 400 to now 1 in 1000. So as the buildings mature, they get better and more productive. As we think about the next phase of Smart Package Smart Facility, we're moving from where the pre-loaders are scanning the package to where the car is going to scan the package. So think about the productivity that we will enjoy then, so it doesn't change the destination, just the journey. We plan to have an investor conference in the spring of 2024.\nWe haven't landed on the date yet, but during that investor conference, we will lay out three-year targets so you can understand the journey to get to a 12% or higher margin and.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, very good. Thank you very much.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nAllison Poliniak\n\nDirector, Wells Fargo\n\nCarol. I just want to see if you can expand a little bit on that productivity effort. Smart Hub, Smart Package, how we should think about that. I know a lot of the investment was going into this year. You're talking about 900 facilities in by the end of October. You know, does that productivity start to accelerate from here? And how should we think about that in terms of an offset to some other wage inflation going forward? Thanks.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYeah. So Smart Package Smart Facility is just one of the levers in our productivity toolkit. Our Network Planning Tools are powerful tools. They are powered by machine learning and AI. And if you think about it, we just really completed the rollout of Network Planning Tools in 2020. So every year we get better because the tools get better. And think about what the tools enabled us to do. In Q2 when we saw volume starting to slow down and actually divert, we were able through our tools to move volume away from unautomated hubs to automated hubs. And let me make that real for you. Last year of the volume that was sorted by our hubs in the United States, about 53% went through an automated hub. This year, 57% of the volume went through an automated hub. So the tools are making us more effective.\nThen we are introducing new technology inside of our buildings to make us more effective, like automated label application, automated bagging, and robotic small sort of induction. I could go on and on, kind of geek out on the tools. It's a complement of tools that will help offset some of the wage pressure that we will see over the next year.\n\nAllison Poliniak\n\nDirector, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you. That's helpful.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to see if this agreement, now it's behind you, out for ratification. Has that changed any of your thinking about the timing and magnitude of GRI or pricing in general? Maybe, Brian, you can give more detail on RPP trends and mix in the US and then Carol, I wanted to see you mentioned the SurePost Advantage. Just give some context around the USPS Ground Advantage product that just launched and if you see that as competitive threat now that it's been out there for a month or so, maybe some initial impressions of that service and what they're able to deliver and what it means for you. Thanks.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah, Brian, thanks for the question. So look, every year we evaluate the GRI to provide the right service at the right price for our customers. This year we had guided to roughly 500 basis points improvement in rate, and then we had expected about 200 basis points headwind in fuel to land at about 3%. So we're staying with that guide for this year, Brian. Coming up here in the fall, we'll take a look at next year. But the thing I would leave you with is we remain very disciplined on revenue management and will continue to deliver.\nValue for the service we provide.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nOn our SurePost product, it compares very favorably to the Post Office product. We're going to continue to invest in that product. We like it a lot because of the delivery density associated with that product.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Ravi Shanker, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nRavi Shanker\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Morning, everyone. Carol, can you give us a little more color on the 7 billion sales pipeline? Kind of, what kind of customers, what kind of end markets?\nI haven't heard you guys talk about a sales pipeline before too often. How is that building up or kind of expected to come through over time? And also, can you give us an update on your largest customer, please, and kind of any changes to that relationship, volumes there, over the course of the potential kind of union talks. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThe self pipeline is across all customer segments with a real focus in the commercial area, small- and medium-sized business, of course, health care, and enterprise; you name it, we're going after it. Our sales team are really excited about selling the value that we have to offer, which is just the best service in the industry. We've also identified about 50 customers that are target customers for our new pricing architecture which we call Architecture of Tomorrow. This new pricing architecture doesn't fit everybody, but it does fit somewhere based on their shipping needs. We could add pricing modifiers like day of week or cube or zip code plus four. So these pricing modifiers are very interesting to these targeted customers and it won't be for everybody but for some. So we're going to lean into that in a big way.\nAs it relates to our largest customer, we have a very good relationship with our largest customer and the business is operating as we would expect it to be. We're on a glide path but not a glide out.\n\nRavi Shanker\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on the 1.2 million packages per day and how do you think that comes back? I guess maybe the bigger question is, does all of it come back and maybe how long does it take to get there? Brian, you've given us some help in the past in sort of quarter-to-quarter margin dynamics as we think about getting towards that full year number. Is there anything you should be thinking about? Q3 vs Q4? I know volatile volumes will be a little bit better in the second part of the back half of the year, but just curious about how that cadence might look.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, the 1.2 million packages per day is about 1 million of diverted volume. In other words, volume that we had that diverted elsewhere and about 200,000 of sales that we couldn't pull through because of concerns about the outcome of the labor negotiation. As Brian commented, we think by the end of the year we will pull back everything that diverted and I think we're going to win that extra 200,000 packages as well. It doesn't happen overnight, of course; it's already starting to flow back in, but we think by the end of the year we'll win it all back.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nChris, just with respect to the phasing, we're really focused on the second half and the full-year guide. But I would say both top-line and profitability Q3 will be more challenged than Q4 due to the ADV growth rates, seasonality, and we've got some one-time costs in the Q3. So I would just think of Q4 being a bit stronger than Q3 and.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nYou might ask well where did that volume go? And so we don't have great intelligence there, but we do have some market share intelligence through a tool that we use from NielsenIQ. Pardon me. And what that would tell us, it's not perfect, but what it would tell us is that 1/3 went to the post office, 1/3 went to FedEx, and 1/3 went to the regionals. So that actually directs our activities as when we think about how to win that volume back.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nMorning. I was wondering if you could give a little more color. I think I have a good sense on the domestic margin. It looks like there's a small piece of your profitability guide that's supply chain and international. So can you maybe talk about, or unpack a little bit sort of the margin expectations for the full year on that, and if indeed the US margin should be at or around the 10% level, give or take. Thanks.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nFrom a margin perspective, Jordan, we'd expect international full year to be 19% to 20%. FCs should be at 10%, and as you think about the international business, the second half ADV we're expecting to be down around 6.5%. RPP should be flattish, and really it stems from some of the challenging macro situation. We've got weak real export growth, Germany is in a recession, and then I would say Europe and Asia ADV growth would bottom in Q3. Kate and the team are very focused on controlling what we control both on the air side and the headcount side to protect that. You saw she printed north of 20% margin in the Q2. SCS, I would expect full year revenue to approach $14 billion with a margin of about 10%.\nForwarding rates and volume is stabilizing but down year-over-year . The team does a good job of managing the buy-sell spreads as you saw. Obviously, expanding healthcare is a strategic priority for the company, and they're also executing the cost initiatives.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nI just wanted to ask a little bit about the labor contract economics. I know you said we'll have a call on this after ratification, but you noted a number of about 3.3% CAGR on the economic benefits, and just off the wage, you know, we're calculating a little higher than that. So could you do your best to break down the components that help us get to that 3.3%?\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nHey Jeff. So 3.3 is an all in number. So it includes wages and benefits. So the two net together. Rather than go into a lot of detail on this call, I'm going to host a call shortly after ratification, and I'll take you through all the details at that point.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWe can go line by line at that point.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nI can go very deep then.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nBut we want to respect the ratification process.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nAll right, well that's my one. Thank you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks, Jeff.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good morning. Wanted to see if you could help us to think about. Kind of volume versus price. It seems like both are important, but they're kind of related. Right. If you go for more price offset higher inflation, then it could be a headwind to what you do on volume. So how do you think about managing between those two? And then I guess that feeds into. You've given us a lot to work with for 2023, but I think there's probably a lack of visibility for 2024. Whether should earnings be up in 2024? Obviously we'd like to see that. But you got through August that headwind. So any broad commentary about how optimistic you might be on 2024 in terms of domestic margin or earnings overall. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWell, we run the business as a portfolio, so we want both. We want volume and we want. But price doesn't necessarily mean price increases. It means moving into segments that value our end-to-end network and have different products. So we run it as a portfolio. We want both. That's the easy answer to that question.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nAnd just on shaping the multi-year, Tom, as Carol mentioned, we'll come back in the spring and give you multi-year targets. Obviously, year one of the labor contract is the most expensive, expensive piece. That's in August to August. So H1 2024 would expect to be under some pressure, the back half less inflation. So we'll walk that for you in the early part of next year.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay, great. Thank you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks, Tom.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Bruce Chan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector, Stifel\n\nGreat. Thanks, operator. Appreciate the time here. Carol, the DAP rollout has been very successful. This year and I know it's early to start thinking about 2024, but as far as what the longer opportunity is, does growth start to slow for that channel now that you've kind of reached critical mass or do you still see quite a bit of opportunity there? And then Brian, just to follow up broadly on e-commerce demand trends, have we kind of turned the corner there or are we still seeing a bit of an air pocket in terms of spending? Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThanks for your comments about DAP. We're very pleased with that product and we see nothing but growth ahead. Global growth.\nWe are just scratching the surface when we think about DAP outside of the United States. And we continue to add new partners here in the United States, now up to 27 partners. One thing we're doing to continue to grow DAP is to make it easier to onboard the platforms. So we are introducing widgets, which are basically pre-programmed applications that a DAP partner can put into its website and avoid the user interface and API onboarding that can slow things down. The first widget that we introduced is a locator widget. So our DAP partner can put the locator widget into its website, and then you push a button and up pops the closest UPS Store to ship that package. So we're going to continue to make it easier to do business with as we continue to grow this important part of our business.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector, Stifel\n\nAnd then Brian, just on the e-commerce demand trends, any broad commentary there?\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYeah, we're looking at volume improving in the back end of the year. So from a macro standpoint, I think the trends are stable to improving in the US, obviously under some more pressure internationally.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nI mean, clearly what happened with e-commerce is it blew up during COVID. It blew up, and so now, you know, everything's kind of reverting back to where it was before COVID. We see that around the globe, which makes sense. And so this is a great place to think about growth from here on out.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector, Stifel\n\nGreat. Thanks for the time.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks Bruce.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Schneeberger\n\nManaging Director, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks very much, Brian. I believe you said you're expecting a bottoming in Europe, in Asia in Q3. Just want to get a sense of cadence of and your optimism that it will improve in Q4. Just what you're seeing in trajectory on both there and then also, if you could put into perspective just domestic cost per piece, how you see that trajectory on that metric specifically? Thanks.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nSo on the bottoming we had, we had thought we would have seen the bottom in Asia in Q2, which I would say it didn't recover. It stalled in Europe. We think the bottom will be more in Q3, but there could be an elongated period here. So we're not putting in a lot of recovery into the international business going forward on the CPP basis. We're still calling for, from a US basis, we would look from a full year standpoint to be about 1124, which is about a 1.4% change from the 1108 that we had previously.\n\nScott Schneeberger\n\nManaging Director, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Stephanie Moore of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nStephanie Moore\n\nSVP, Jefferies\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you. I want to touch a little bit on your kind of your automation efforts, part of your ongoing productivity tools. I think you said last year it was about 53% went through some form of an automated hub. This year at 57%, do you have kind of a line of sight on where that can go over time?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS",
    "content2": "We do. We're going to come back in the spring at our investor conference and give you our sense of what we're calling Network of the Future. It's a very exciting opportunity for us to really automate this business. The good thing is we don't have to integrate our network because we're integrated, but we can do a better job of automating. And so we'll come back and give you all that in the spring of next year.\n\nStephanie Moore\n\nSVP, Jefferies\n\nAll right, I'll leave it at that then. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nEric Morgan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning. This is Eric Morgan on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on SurePost. Maybe could you give us an update on how much you're redirecting in the network today, and maybe could fill us in if this was a topic of the labor negotiations and if you did need to start insourcing more kind of on an accelerated basis, what kind of, you know, potential cost implications or inefficiencies there could be and maybe some offsets there as well. Thank you.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nSure. So we were redirecting a little under 40% at the end of Q2. It was a point of the negotiations. We've agreed to redirect 50%. No problem at all with that. No concern about cost because the delivery, delivery density with SurePost is really, really good.\n\nEric Morgan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, thanks for letting me have a follow-up. Just a couple quick ones. Brian, I think you said the labor deal. Is $500 million headwind in the back half relative to what you accrued for estimate in the prior guidance? I wasn't sure if that was a gross number or there was some productivity against that. And then Carol, you know, I wanted to ask about M&A because it doesn't get enough attention, but I think you guys have done some interesting strategic acquisitions from, you know, Delivery Solutions. You also took a stake or board seat on CommerceHub. These are small, but I view kind of as important deals, kind of long term in view. Can you just talk about what they give you and is there more in the pipeline because you're generating oodles of cash flow and wondering if there's an opportunity to tack on more deals even on the health care vertical, which is such a big vertical for you guys?\nIf you can just expand on that. Thank you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nHey, the barbell shape of the contract, 500 is a gross number we had assumed originally about 500. So it's actually 2x what we thought.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nAnd on the acquisitions that we've made, we couldn't be happier because they are giving us enabling capabilities from Delivery Solutions, creating product from Bomi Group, which is creating cold chain logistics for us and parts of the world that we didn't have that. So I couldn't be happier, and I don't want to miss out any of the companies that we've acquired. So we're pleased with Roadie and Glad is providing for us as well. So they're enabling capabilities, and as we look ahead, expect us to continue to acquire enabling capabilities, particularly in those areas that we really want to own. Healthcare logistics would certainly be one of those technology investments that give us platforms to accelerate the digital experience for our customers. Absolutely. Will expect us to lean into that space, and we'll be giving you updates as we go.\n\nKen Cook\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, UPS\n\nStephen, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from the line of John Chappell of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good morning. Just want to tie together a couple things from before. As you think about regaining that 1 million packages that was diverted and you. Think about your pricing path going forward. Do you have to lead with price in the next six months to win the diverted traffic and then think about pricing from a new starting point in 2024? Or do you think it's strictly service, your relationships, and that package flow will come back to you without adjusting the way you think about the revenue management?\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nWe don't think we have to lead with price. Our customers did what they thought they had to do to protect their customers, but they're very happy with us. So it's about operating plans, making sure they come back to us without disruption to their business. That doesn't happen overnight. It's going to take a while, but we can bring that business back because of what we provide to them.\n\nJohn Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you, Carol.\n\nCarol Tomé\n\nCEO, UPS\n\nThank you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, UPS\n\nThanks.\n\nKen Cook\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, UPS\n\nI want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you soon. And that concludes our call."

My name is Stephen, and I will be your facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the floor over to our host, Mr. Ken Cook, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nKen Cook\n\nInvestor Relations Officer\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the UPS First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; Brian Newman, our CFO; and a few additional members of our executive leadership team.\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2022 Form 10-K and other reports we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. Unless stated otherwise, our discussion refers to adjusted results.\nFor the first quarter of 2023, GAAP results include after-tax transformation and other charges of $9 million or $0.01 per diluted share. A reconciliation to GAAP financial results is available on the UPS Investor Relations website along with the webcast of today's call.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. [Operator Instructions]\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Carol.\n\nCarol B. Tomé\n\nChief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Services, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ken, and good morning. Let me begin by thanking UPSers for once again delivering industry-leading service to our customers.\nService defines UPS. It is one of our values, and I'm proud of our team who continue to make it a key priority. Another company value is safety. UPS drivers are among the safest in the industry. And every year, we invest millions of dollars in safe driving education and training. Our Circle of Honor program recognizes drivers who have achieved 25 years or more of accident-free driving. This year, we inducted more than 1,200 UPS drivers into the Circle of Honor bringing the total to more than 10,400 around the globe. Congratulations to these drivers on their achievements.\nTurning to our results. 2023 is proving to be an interesting year. In the U.S., relative to our base plan, volume was higher than we expected in January, close to our plan in February and then moved significantly lower than our plan in March, as retail sales contracted, and we saw a shift in consumer spending. For example, food as a percentage of household budget reached 9% in the first quarter compared to 7% a couple of years ago. U.S. discretionary sales are lagging grocery and consumable sales, and disposable income is shifting away from goods to services.\nOutside of the U.S., export activity out of Asia remained weak, which negatively impacted revenue in both International and Supply Chain Solutions. In response, we focused on controlling what we could control. We remained disciplined on price. We increased penetration in the most attractive parts of the market. We manage the network with agility. We drove productivity, and we stayed on strategy.\nLooking at our first quarter financial results versus last year. Consolidated revenue was $22.9 billion, down 6%. Operating profit was $2.6 billion, a decrease of 22.8% and consolidated operating margin was 11.1%, a decline of 250 basis points while revenue fell short of our base plan due to a relentless focus on productivity, both operating profit and operating margin were in line with our base plan.\nMoving to our strategic update. Through our Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven strategy, we are investing to improve the customer experience and drive efficiency. Starting with Customer First, key investments here are driving growth in targeted customer segments like SMBs and health care. Looking at SMBs. We continue to invest in the international expansion of our digital access program, or DAP. We now have 16 countries producing DAP revenue. In the first quarter, total GAAP revenue was up 51.5% compared to last year, and we are on track to generate around $3 billion in GAAP revenue this year.\nDid you know that in the U.S. about 1 out of every 4 DAP packages enters our network through a UPS store with more than 5,100 locations in the U.S. UPS stores are strategic assets. In fact, 85% of the U.S. population is within 10 miles of a store, giving customers ultra-convenient entry points to the UPS network, whether they're an SMB, shipping an item they've sold online, or a customer returning an item they buy. Given the strategic importance of these stores, we are leaning into investments here to improve the customer experience.\nFor example, the stores are rolling out self-service kiosks that enable customers to bypass the counter when they have shipments and return, even return with no box or no label. These kiosks make it easier for customers to get in and get out of the store. We've rolled out nearly 200 kiosks so far, and we'll deploy 1,000 by the end of October this year. And we're not stopping there.\nAnother area of focus is improving the claims process, which used to be a hassle for both customers and franchisees. In March, the UPS store launched an online claims portal to all U.S. locations. That's designed specifically for the needs of the store shipper. With this portal, claims that used to take weeks for resolution are now resolved within an average of about 2 days. One final comment on SMBs. In the first quarter, SMBs, including platforms made up 29.6% of our total U.S. volume. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of increased SMB penetration, and it's the highest level we've seen in more than 7 years.\nTurning to health care. In the first quarter of 2023, we expanded our global footprint by opening nearly 1 million square feet of dedicated health care space, including our first facility in Germany. This facility provides customers a broad range of temperature-sensitive and handling solutions. Its location in the center of Germany connects our customer shipments, the fast-growing European health care market. The facility is also close to our European AirHub in Cologne, enabling customers to leverage the speed and reach of our global network.\nAs a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed the acquisition of Bomi Group. And to date, revenue and cost synergies are running ahead of target. Further, we are continuing to invest in the global expansion of UPS Premier, which is now available in 45 countries with 4 more to be added this year. Our goal is to become the #1 complex health care logistics provider in the world. To help us get there, we plan to open a total of 7 dedicated health care facilities this year. In the first quarter, revenue from our health care portfolio reached $2.4 billion, and we expect to generate over $10 billion in health care revenue in 2023.\nTurning to People Led. Let me discuss the progress of our negotiations with the Teamsters. Negotiations on a new contract that Teamsters are underway, and good progress has been made on many of our local supplemental agreement. Together, we've set up 5 subcommittees at the national bargaining table to take on key areas of the contract, which enables us to move faster. We are aligned on several key issues like solving the staffing needs for weekend delivery and ways to mitigate the summer heat in our package delivery vehicle. While we expect to hear a great deal of noise during the negotiation, I remain confident that a win-win-win contract is very achievable and that UPS and the Teamsters will reach agreement by the end of July.\nNow let's move to the last leg of our strategy, Innovation Driven. We have the best, most efficient global integrated network in the world, and we are getting even better. Today, we operate our network with more agility than ever before. And when it comes to productivity, we are relentless about creating a virtuous cycle of improvement in our network. For example, our total service plan, which addresses running a predictable on-time network has delivered continued productivity improvements since being introduced last year. Our massive and highly complex network naturally generates efficiency when volume increases. But when volume levels drop, historically, it's been harder to generate productivity improvement. With total service plan, we have driven productivity even with declining volume.\nIn the first quarter, U.S. volume declined by 5.4%, but hours declined even further, which resulted in improved productivity as measured by pieces per hour. As we've discussed last quarter, we've accelerated investment in our Smart Package Smart Facility RFID solutions, and plan to complete deployment in more than 900 buildings across the U.S. by the end of October. Throughout the process, we've continued to learn and improve which has enabled stronger results than we originally expected. In the facilities where we have this technology, we've got the frequency of [indiscernible] from around 1 in 400 packages to 1 in 1,000 packages, which reduces miles, handles and costs, and it improves both the customer and employee experience. Innovation Driven is also about combining digital capabilities with our integrated network to improve the customer experience and efficiency.\nOur upstream delivery density solution checks both boxes. This month, we are onboarding our second large national retailer, which gives us more opportunity to increase density as we can match volume in the UPS network with orders of participating customers. It's still early days of this initiative. As we learn, we continue to adjust the match rate algorithm, and we are happy with the results.\nLastly, our Innovation Driven initiatives are moving us towards our 2050 carbon neutrality goal. We are focused on the decarbonization of our global supply chain. In 2022, our Scope 1, 2 and 3 CO2 emissions declined by 6.9% from 2021. We've been investing in alternative fuel for more than 20 years and operate more than 15,600 alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles.\nRecently, we took delivery of 10 fully electric Class 8 semi trucks in California. These trucks are quiet, and they are the first zero-emission semis to run in our UPS fleets. Our 2022 sustainability report was published on April 12. This is our 21st annual sustainability report, and you can find it on about.ups.com.\nMoving to our outlook for 2023. Last quarter, we provided a range for our 2023 financial targets. As we've discussed, there has been a deceleration in U.S. retail sales growth and certain non-U.S. markets remain challenged. As a result, we now expect to be at the low end of our previously provided revenue and operating profit margin range. Brian will share more detail in a moment.\nI've led through difficult times before, and I've seen the power of making the right decisions and the pitfalls of making wrong decisions. In uncertain market conditions, it's easy to fall into the trap of managing the business for the short term. While we will control what we can control, we will also stay on strategy. Over the past 3 years, we have fundamentally improved nearly every aspect of our business, and we are just getting started. UPSers are the best in the industry. And because of them, I am convinced we will come out of this cycle faster, stronger and with a wider lead on our competition.\nWith that, thank you for listening. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian O. Newman\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover 4 areas, starting with the macro environment, then our first quarter results. Next, I'll cover cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll review our updated financial outlook for 2023. Okay. Let's start with the macro.\nIn the first quarter, the macro environment was challenging from both a commercial and consumer perspective. The growth rate for U.S. manufacturing production fell throughout the quarter and was down 0.9% in March year-over-year. On the consumer side of the U.S. economy, the growth rate on services spending is continuing to outpace the growth rate on goods spending. And within the goods bucket, consumers spent more on essential items like groceries, which tend to be purchased in store. These factors, plus a 5-point drop in consumer sentiment from February to March contributed to the reduction in our volume levels.\nOutside the U.S., in the first quarter, Asia exports remained weak, while Europe narrowly avoided a winter recession. In the face of all this, we responded with agility and remained focused on controlling what we could control to deliver great service for our customers and bottom line results for shareowners.\nIn the first quarter, consolidated revenue was $22.9 billion, down 6% from last year and slightly below our base plan expectations. Operating profit was $2.6 billion, a decrease of 22.8%. However, we achieved our base plan operating profit. Consolidated operating margin was 11.1%, a decline of 250 basis points compared to last year. For the first quarter, diluted earnings per share was $2.20, down 27.9% from the same period last year.\nNow let's look at our business segments. In U.S. Domestic, revenue quality initiatives nearly offset the decrease in volume. And as the decline in volume accelerated toward the end of the quarter, we responded quickly by adjusting the network to eliminate costs while maintaining our industry-leading service levels. In the first quarter, we expected average daily volume to decline between 3% and 4%. For the quarter, average daily volume was down 5.4% year-over-year, primarily because volume in March moved lower than we expected.\nLooking at mix in the first quarter, we saw lower volume across all industry sectors with the largest declines from retail and high tech. B2C average daily volume declined 5.5% compared to last year and B2B average daily volume declined 5.4%. A bright spot in B2B in the quarter was returns, which was up 6.8% year-over-year. In the first quarter, B2B represented 42.7% of our volume, which was unchanged from a year ago. Additionally, the shift in product mix from air to ground that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2022 continued in the first quarter as customers made cost trade-offs and took advantage of the speed improvements we made in our ground network and further leveraged our SurePost product.\nCompared to the first quarter of last year, total air average daily volume was down 16.7%, ground declined 3% and within ground, SurePost grew 1.8%.\nLooking at customer mix, SMB average daily volume declined significantly less than our enterprise customers in the first quarter. SMBs including platforms made up 29.6% of our total U.S. volume, an increase of 120 basis points year-over-year. For the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated revenue of $15 billion, down 0.9%. Revenue per piece increased 4.8%, nearly offsetting the decline in volume. The combination of base rates and customer mix increased the revenue per piece growth rate by 500 basis points, driven by strong keep rates from our general rate increase and increased SMB penetration. Fuel drove 200 basis points of the revenue per piece growth rate increase. Remaining factors reduced the revenue per piece growth rate by 220 basis points, driven by the combination of negative product mix with ground packages outpacing air growth and lighter package weights.\nTurning to cost. Total expense was relatively flat with an increase of 0.6% or $80 million in the first quarter. Higher union wage and benefit rates increased expense by over $300 million, primarily from a 6.1% increase in average union wage rates, driven by the annual pay increase for our Teamster employees that went into effect in August of 2022. The U.S. Domestic team did an excellent job pulling costs out of the network in response to lower volume. We managed hours down 5.6%, which was more than the decrease in average daily volume, and we reduced headcount throughout the quarter as volume growth rates decline. Together, these actions reduced expenses by more than $220 million, partially offsetting the increase in wage and benefit rates.\nAdditionally, we reduced purchase transportation by $100 million, primarily from utilizing UPS [ feeder ] drivers to support our fastest ground ever and from continued optimization efforts, which enabled us to reduce trailer loads per day by 7.5% compared to the same period last year. The remaining variance was driven by multiple factors, including maintenance and depreciation. The U.S. Domestic segment delivered $1.5 billion in operating profit, which was slightly above our base plan and down 12.7% compared to the first quarter of 2022, and operating margin was 9.9%.\nMoving to our International segment. We expected the macro environment to be bumpy and it was. Looking at Asia, export activity started off very weak due to the extended Lunar New Year holiday. It gradually recovered through the quarter, but at a slower pace than we anticipated. In Europe, the macro environment was a little better than we expected, which helped offset the weakness in Asia relative to our base plan.\nIn the first quarter, international total average daily volume came in as expected and was down 6.2% year-over-year. Domestic average daily volume was down 9.5%, which drove 3/4 of the total average daily volume decline. Total export average daily volume declined 2.8% on a year-over-year basis, driven by declines in retail and high tech market demand. Asia export average daily volume was down 8.9% and included a 20% year-over-year decline on the China to U.S. lane.\nThrough the first quarter, we remained agile and we flexed the network to match demand, reduced Asia block hours by more than the decline in Asia export volume and delivered excellent service to our customers.\nIn the first quarter, international revenue was $4.5 billion, down 6.8% from last year due to the decline in volume and a $161 million negative revenue impact from a stronger U.S. dollar. Revenue per piece was relatively flat year-over-year, but there were a number of moving parts, including a 370 basis point decline due to currency and a 180 basis point decline from demand-related surcharges. These were offset by an increase in the fuel surcharge of 230 basis points and an increase of 330 basis points due to the combination of a high GRI keep rate and a favorable product mix as export volume outperformed domestic volume.\nOperating profit in the International segment was $806 million, down $314 million from the same period last year, primarily due to the decline in exports out of Asia and included a $97 million reduction in demand-related surcharge revenue and a $51 million negative operating profit impact from currency. Operating margin in the first quarter was 17.7%.\nNow looking at Supply Chain Solutions. In the first quarter, revenue was $3.4 billion, down $983 million year-over-year. Looking at key drivers, in forwarding softer global demand, especially out of Asia drove down market rates and volume, resulting in lower revenue and operating profit. We are continuing to manage buy/sell spreads and have taken steps to reduce operating costs in this business. Logistics delivered revenue growth driven by gains in our health care logistics and clinical trials business and increased operating profit.\nIn the first quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated an operating profit of $258 million and an operating margin of 7.6%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $188 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $66 million, and our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 24.8%, which was less than we anticipated in our base plan due to lower tax impacts from our employee stock awards.\nNow let's turn to cash and shareowner returns. In the first quarter, we generated $2.4 billion in cash from operations. Free cash flow for the period was $1.8 billion, including our annual pension contributions of $1.2 billion that we made in the first quarter. Also in the first quarter, we issued $2.5 billion in long-term debt that we are using to pay off debt maturing in 2023. And in the first quarter, UPS distributed $1.3 billion in dividends and completed $751 million in share buybacks.\nMoving to our outlook for the full year 2023. In January, we provided a range for our 2023 financial targets due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment we saw at that time. Since then, the volume environment has deteriorated, especially in the U.S., driven by continued challenging macro conditions and changes in consumer behavior. As a result, we expect full year revenue and operating margin to be at the low end of the previously provided range.\nFor the full year 2023, we expect consolidated revenues of around $97 billion and consolidated operating margin of around 12.8% with about 56% of our operating profit coming in the second half of the year.\nIn U.S. Domestic, we expect full year volume to decline around 3% versus 2022 with revenue per piece growth nearly offsetting the decline in volume. And operating margin is expected to be around 11%. In International, we anticipate both volume and revenue to be down by around 4%, and we expect to generate an operating margin of around 20% and in Supply Chain Solutions, we expect full year revenue to be around $14.3 billion and operating margin is expected to be around 10%.\nWe have proven our ability to adapt in a dynamic environment. We have many levers to pull on the cost side, and we will continue to control what we can control by delivering industry-leading service and remaining disciplined on revenue quality. We will also continue investing in growth and efficiency initiatives like international DAP, health care and Smart Package Smart Facility, which will help us come out of this economic cycle faster and stronger.\nSpecifically, now that our volume is trending at the downside of our range, we are executing our plan to take out semi-variable and fixed costs, including in the U.S. air network, we are adjusting package flows to maximize utilization on our next-day flights, which enables us to reduce block hours in our 2-day operation. On the ground, we are pulling more volume into our large regional hubs further leveraging the automation in those buildings and enabling us to eliminate sorts in smaller buildings. Driving more consolidation on the ground could potentially allow us to reduce our overall building footprint in the U.S.\nInternationally, based on the volume levels over the last couple of quarters, we further reduced scheduled flights to reflect lower market demand while ensuring we maintain agility in the network to quickly add flights where needed if volume returns more strongly than we expect. Across our global business, we will continue to manage headcount with volume levels. And in terms of overhead, we see opportunities to further reduce costs by leveraging technology.\nNow let's turn to capital allocation. Our plans have not changed. We will continue to make long-term investments to support our strategy and capture growth coming out of this cycle. We still expect 2023 capital expenditures to be about $5.3 billion, including investments in automation, and we'll add 2.3 million square feet of health care logistics space to our global network this year. We'll also complete the deployment of the first phase of Smart Package Smart Facility in the U.S., expand DAP internationally, and continue building out our Logistics As A Service platform.\nWe are still planning to pay out around $5.4 billion in dividends in 2023, subject to Board approval. We still plan to buy back around $3 billion of our shares. And lastly, our effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be around 23.5%.\nIn closing, despite the challenging macro backdrop, we will continue to provide industry-leading service to our customers, and we will stay on strategy. We are investing to make our network even more efficient and to strengthen our customer value proposition to enable us to capture growth coming out of this cycle.\nThank you, and operator, please open the lines.",

My name is Stephen, and I will be your facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Ken Cook, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nKen Cook\n\nIR Officer, United Parcel Service, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the UPS third quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; Brian Newman, our CFO; and a few additional members of our executive leadership team.\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2021 Form 10-K, subsequently filed Form 10-Qs and other reports we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC.\nUnless stated otherwise, our discussion refers to adjusted results. For the third quarter of 2022, GAAP results include after-tax transformation and other charges of $27 million or $0.03 per diluted share. A reconciliation to GAAP financial results is available on the UPS Investor Relations website, along with the webcast of today's call.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Carol.\n\nCarol B. Tomé\n\nCEO & Director, United Parcel Service, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ken, and good morning. I'd like to begin by thanking all UPSers for their hard work and dedication to service. I'm proud of the unstoppable spirit of UPSers everywhere and how they leverage the agility of our global integrated network to deliver outstanding service for our customers and strong results for our shareowners.\nIn the third quarter, the global economy softened, especially outside the United States. International and freight forwarding volumes were challenged, but we quickly responded. We adjusted our network to match volume levels and continue to win in the most attractive parts of the market.\nFor the third quarter, consolidated revenue rose 4.2% from last year to $24.2 billion, and operating profit grew 6% to $3.1 billion. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 13%, a 20 basis point improvement from last year. This was our highest third quarter consolidated operating margin in 15 years.\nTurning to our strategic update. The execution of our Customer First, People-led, Innovation-Driven strategy has fundamentally improved nearly every aspect of our business, causing better revenue quality, higher operating margins and improved bottom line results. Building on the strong foundation created by our better not bigger approach, we are moving to the next phase of our strategic framework, better and bolder.\nWhat do we mean by better and bolder? First, the better part of our framework is not changing. We will continue to focus on growing value share, improving the customer experience and driving higher productivity from the assets we own. Bolder is about moving faster to grow in our targeted market segments. It's also about combining digital solutions with our global integrated network to create more value for our customers and new revenue opportunities for UPS.\nWe plan to combine the capabilities of our strong stand-alone digital services, including Roadie, Coyote, Delivery Solutions, UPS Capital and our partnership with CommerceHub, to create a powerful offering of logistics as a service. And when we combine logistics as a service with our integrated physical network, we believe we will be unstoppable. We will share more detail about better and bolder in the coming quarters, but let me give you 2 examples of what we are doing.\nOn our second quarter earnings call, I introduced our upstream delivery density solution. Here we are building a digital platform that goes upstream to look at orders, in other words packages, at the shopping cart level. We then match this new order with other orders that have the same delivery day commitment, which creates delivery density. We've gone live with one customer, and we're delighted with the results we've seen. In fact, we're currently onboarding several new customers to the platform.\nAnother example of better and bolder is our pending acquisition of Bomi Group, whose network of healthcare facilities in Europe and Latin America and expertise in cold chain will help accelerate growth in complex healthcare. Along with our recent expansion of UPS Premier in Europe, we are on track to generate at least $10 billion in healthcare revenue in 2023.\nNow let's look at the 3 legs of our strategy, starting with customer first. Customer first is about creating a frictionless customer experience targeted at the parts of the market where we want to grow, including SMBs, healthcare, international and certain large enterprise accounts. Given global economic softening, we are convinced that a relentless focus on customer first matters now more than ever before. And we believe our strategy is working because we've continued to gain share.\nFor example, we are leveraging our time in transit and visibility advantages in Europe to win. In fact, we grew Europe export volume in the third quarter. Another example is the growth we are seeing in our digital access program, or DAP. In the third quarter, we grew U.S. SMB average daily volume, including platforms, by 1.9%, and SMBs made up 28.3% of our total U.S. volume in the quarter, an increase of 90 basis points from last year.\nDAP continues to add partners and revenue. With more than 3 million merchants shipping with DAP in the first 9 months of this year, we generated over $1.6 billion in DAP revenue, and we expect to exceed our $2 billion DAP revenue target in 2022.\nMoving to the people-led part of our strategy, our people are our most valuable assets, and it's important to us that every UPSer views our company as a great place to work. We know that when we take care of our people, they will take care of our customers.\nRecently, UPS reached contract extension agreements with the Independent Pilots Association and our aircraft maintenance technicians. Both contracts continued to reward these UPSers with industry-leading pay and benefits and will help ensure the company's future success.\nAnd we are making other changes to improve our employee experience and satisfaction. For example, through what we call our operator experience program, we recently worked with our U.S. drivers to create individualized dispatch plans, giving them more choice over the hours they work.\nWe also automated tasks and reorganized our operations team to improve work-life balance for our operating supervisors. And for our management employees globally, we are evaluating our overall pay mix composition. While total compensation compares favorably with the market, we may have some opportunities to rework the pay mix to make our compensation even more attractive.\nNow to the last leg of our strategy, innovation-driven, this is about driving more productivity from the assets we own. Our integrated network is the best in the industry, but we are leveraging data and technology to make it even smarter, more automated and more efficient.\nIn the third quarter, our productivity improvements continued to deliver benefits. In the U.S., we optimized trailer loads by eliminating nearly 1,000 loads per day compared to the third quarter of last year, and we successfully managed hours in line with volume levels.\nWe also launched total service plan, which is about running a predictable on-time network. Execution is going as planned. And as of last week, our on-time feeder departures and arrivals improved 6.5% compared to last year, reducing idle time in the network.\nAdditionally, this month, we completed the initial rollout of our smart package, smart facility, which enables RFID label technology in 101 buildings in our network. Further, we opened our eighth regional hub in the United States. Located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, this 800,000 square foot automated hub provides significant processing horsepower to better serve the Northeast corridor and helps enable greater network flexibility across the U.S.\nThis hub is also home to UPS' largest natural gas fueling station within our network. This fueling station will remove 8 million gallons of diesel fuel per year. That's equivalent to removing more than 17,000 gasoline-powered passenger cars from the road.\nTurning to peak. For the last 4 holiday season, UPS has been the industry leader in on-time delivery performance, and we intend for that to continue. This outperformance doesn't happen by accident. We built our integrated network to flex with volume. And our investments in our people, automation, and technology enable greater agility. To prepare for peak, we made enhancements to all the areas of our business that delivered a great peak last year.\nLet me share a few details about our peak plans for this year, starting with volume. This year, we anticipate our volumes will peak later in December compared to last year, as we expect consumers will return to more pre-pandemic shopping behaviors.\nWhile we will continue to use technology to match daily capacity with customer demand, we're also optimizing air and ground volume to make room for new customers where we can add the most value. While we will have a peak, as Brian will detail, overall volume in the fourth quarter is expected to decline from last year due to contractual agreements.\nIn terms of labor, we'll bring on more than 100,000 seasonal hires this year. Related to hiring, we're ahead of where we were this time last year. One reason is because we've made the digital hiring process even faster and easier this year. We've also improved training for our new driver helpers, which shortens the amount of time from hired to dispatched. Newly hired driver helpers can complete training on their phones and begin work on day 1. Bottom line, we are ready to deliver another successful peak.\nLet me end by reaffirming our 2022 targets of consolidated revenue of around $102 billion, consolidated operating margin of about 13.7% and return on invested capital greater than 30%. In the face of a very dynamic macro environment, we are demonstrating more agility than ever before. We are focused on controlling what we can control.\nAnd under our better and bolder framework, we are combining digital capabilities with our global integrated network to continue winning in the most attractive parts of the market, driving operational excellence and delivering best-in-class service for our customers.\nSo thank you for listening, and now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, United Parcel Service, Inc.\n\nThanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover 4 areas, starting with the macro environment, then our third quarter results. Next, I'll cover cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook for the rest of the year.\nIn the third quarter, the macro environment remained dynamic. In the U.S., we continued to see crosscurrents driven by the strong job market and healthy consumer spending, despite higher inflation and interest rates.\nInternationally, the macro environment weakened more than we expected due to high inflation, volatile energy prices, lockdowns in Asia and the war in Eastern Europe. We responded quickly to the changing market conditions by leveraging the agility of our global integrated network to provide excellent service to our customers and deliver our bottom line commitments to shareowners.\nIn the third quarter, consolidated revenue increased 4.2% to $24.2 billion. Consolidated operating profit totaled $3.1 billion, 6% higher than last year. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 13%, which was 20 basis points above last year. For the third quarter, diluted earnings per share was $2.99, up 10.3% from the same period last year.\nNow let's look at our business segments. In U.S. Domestic, our revenue quality efforts and the execution of our planned cost initiatives drove third quarter results above our expectations. In the third quarter, average daily volume was down 1.5% versus the same time period last year, but the growth rate was an improvement over the first half of 2022, as new volume from the record number of wins we had in the second quarter came into the network.\nIn the third quarter, the gap between year-over-year B2C and B2B average daily volume growth rates narrowed, as we lapped more normalized consumer shopping behaviors. B2C average daily volume declined 2.2% driven by contractual agreements we reached with certain enterprise customers.\nB2B average daily volume was down 0.5% year-over-year due to declines in manufacturing volumes, which was partially offset by growth in retail B2B driven by returns volume. In the third quarter, B2B represented 42.8% of our volume, which was up slightly from the 42.4% in the same period last year.\nLooking at customer mix. The execution of our strategy is continuing to drive improvement. In the third quarter, we grew SMB average daily volume, including platforms, 1.9%, and SMBs made up 28.3% of our total U.S. Domestic volume in the quarter, an increase of 90 basis points from 1 year ago.\nFor the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated revenue of $15.4 billion, up 8.2%. Revenue per piece increased 9.8%, more than offsetting the decline in volume. Our revenue quality efforts continue to deliver results. In the third quarter, about 1/3 of the revenue per piece growth rate increase came from continued strength in base pricing. Another 1/3 of the revenue per piece growth rate increase came from changes in fuel price per gallon, and the final 1/3 came from the combination of mix and our fuel pricing actions.\nTurning to costs. Total expense grew 7%. Wages and benefits contributed about 310 basis points of the increase driven by the annual increase for our Teamster employees that went into effect in August. Fuel drove 220 basis points of the expense growth rate increase due primarily to the rise in price per gallon compared to last year. And the remaining variance was driven by multiple factors, including maintenance and depreciation.\nCost in U.S. Domestic came in as we expected due to our planned productivity initiatives, which drove our cost per piece growth rate to be lower in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter and partially offsetting wage and benefit increases. We are continuing to see the benefits of our cube utilization and other productivity efforts, including total service plan, which launched on July 11. I'll share more about our productivity initiatives in a moment.\nTo sum it up, revenue growth was above expense growth, which created positive operating leverage for the seventh consecutive quarter. The U.S. Domestic segment delivered $1.7 billion in operating profit, an increase of $272 million or 19.2% compared to the third quarter of 2021, and operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 11%.\nMoving to our International segment. The global macro environment continued to soften, but we remained agile and flexed our network in response to changing market conditions and delivered excellent service to our customers. At the beginning of the quarter, we expected the international average daily volume growth rate to improve compared to the first half of 2022, and it did. However, it did not improve as much as we anticipated due to continued macro softening. In the third quarter, international average daily volume was down 5.2%.\nTotal export average daily volume declined 0.6% on a year-over-year basis. China export volume declined due to lockdown and disruptions to manufacturing output. In response, we quickly adjusted the network and canceled 75 China and Hong Kong origin flights and rerouted 27 flights to other gateways in support of our customers.\nThese changes enabled us to move volume for our customers where it was available, maintain high levels of service and achieve a payload utilization of over 98% on our Asia outbound intercontinental flights in the third quarter.\nLooking at Europe. We continue to win on our speed and service advantages at strong revenue quality, despite softer market conditions. We grew transborder average daily volume 2.6%, and total Europe export average daily volume grew 0.6% in the third quarter.\nIn the third quarter, international revenue increased 1.7% to $4.8 billion, which included a negative currency impact of $335 million and a fuel benefit of $363 million. Revenue per piece increased 6.4%, which included the fuel and currency impacts I just covered and a 510 basis point increase from the combination of product mix and revenue quality actions we took.\nOperating profit in the International segment was $1 billion, which included an $82 million negative impact from currency. There was no year-over-year impact from fuel on international operating profit. Operating margin in the third quarter was 20.9%, which was down from the same period last year due to the delevering of our fixed costs and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.\nNow looking at Supply Chain Solutions. Our teams continue to navigate a dynamic macro environment in the third quarter and did an excellent job serving our customers and managing costs to deliver year-over-year operating margin expansion. In the third quarter, revenue was $4 billion, down $268 million year-over-year, which included a $92 million negative impact from currency.\nLooking at the key drivers. In freight forwarding, declines in volume and market rates reduced revenue and operating profit. However, the team was able to effectively manage buy/sell spreads and continued supporting our customers.\nWithin Forwarding, our truckload brokerage unit delivered strong operating profit growth driven by revenue quality initiatives, and Logistics delivered strong top and bottom line growth driven by our complex healthcare business from cold chain, clinical trials and medical device customers.\nIn the third quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $459 million and delivered a record third quarter operating margin of 11.5%, an increase of 100 basis points over last year.\nWalking through the rest of the income statement, we had $177 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $297 million, and our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 21%, which was better than we expected due primarily to discrete items.\nLet's turn to cash and shareholder returns. Year-to-date, we've generated $10.8 billion in cash from operations, and free cash flow was $8.5 billion. And so far this year, UPS has paid $3.8 billion in dividends and completed $2.2 billion in share buybacks.\nNow I'll make a few comments regarding our outlook. According to IHS, full year global GDP is expected to grow 2.8%, and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 1.7%. Both are lower than their forecast at the beginning of the year.\nWe are continuing to pay close attention to macro elements, including lockdowns in Asia, inflationary pressures, the health of the consumer and the geopolitical environment. Needless to say, the macroeconomic environment is much different now versus our expectations when we started the year. But by controlling what we can control, quickly adjusting the network to match changes in volume levels and delivering excellent service to our customers, we are still on track to deliver our full year financial targets.\nWe expect consolidated revenues to be around $102 billion. Consolidated operating margin is expected to be about 13.7%, and return on invested capital is anticipated to be above 30%.\nNow let me give a little color on the fourth quarter. Starting with U.S. Domestic, we anticipate fourth quarter 2022 revenue growth of around 4.5% driven by strong revenue quality, and we expect fourth quarter operating margin to expand year-over-year to around 12.4%.\nLooking at peak in the U.S., we expect peak volume to come in heavier later in the peak period, and we have one additional delivery day compared to last year, which gives us more flexibility.\nAs you update your models for U.S. Domestic, there are a few things to keep in mind. We anticipate the average daily volume growth rate will be lower in the fourth quarter of 2022 than in the third quarter due to contractual agreements we have reached with certain enterprise customers.\nSecond, we expect increases in wage and benefit rates will be higher than the same time period last year due to the annual increase our Teamster employees received in August.\nAnd third, we are continuing to execute our productivity initiatives to help offset wage and benefit rate increases.\nOur biggest productivity initiative is total service plan, which is performing as planned. Since the launch on July 11, we've improved our driver dispatch timeliness by 13%. This is about getting our drivers out of the building on time, which creates a more predictable environment for our employees and better service for our customers.\nAlso in regard to productivity in the third quarter, we brought on additional automation in the network prior to peak, including automated bagging, robotic small sort induction and autonomous irreg vehicles.\nAs a result of all these efforts, we expect the U.S. Domestic fourth quarter 2022 cost per piece growth rate to be lower than it was in the third quarter of 2022.\nMoving to international. We expect revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 to be relatively flat to the fourth quarter of last year. We anticipate our share growth and revenue quality initiatives will offset the weaker macroeconomic environment and negative currency impacts. And we expect international operating margin to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2022 to around 21.5% as we continue to respond to market changes with agility.\nIn Supply Chain Solutions, we expect revenue in the fourth quarter to be above $4 billion as we partially offset declines in the air and ocean freight forwarding revenue, with continued growth in logistics and our healthcare business.\nOperating margin for Supply Chain Solutions in the fourth quarter of 2022 is expected to be around 11.4%, as we continue to effectively manage the buy/sell spreads in a dynamic environment.\nTurning to capital allocation for the full year. In 2022, we expect free cash flow to be above $9 billion, including pension contributions to fund annual service costs. Capital expenditures are now expected to be about $5 billion, which is $500 million less than our original plan. The largest driver of the variance is the result of our decision to lease certain facilities, instead of purchasing them. This approach enables us to maintain higher levels of agility and further improve our overall capital structure.\nWe plan to pay out around $5.2 billion in dividends, subject to Board approval. We have repaid $2 billion in debt this year as planned, including $1 billion in October. We expect to complete at least $3 billion in share repurchases for the year. And lastly, we expect the tax rate for the full year to be around 22%.\nBefore I wrap up, last week, we announced our U.S. general rate increase. The 2023 increase will be 6.9%, reflecting the value of the services we offer and cost inflation in the market. The details have been posted to ups.com.\nExecuting our strategy under better not bigger has led to a greater agility across our business and stronger financial performance. Our move to better and bolder enables future growth in revenue and margin.\nBy combining the strength of our physical network with new digital capabilities, we will continue providing excellent service to our customers, win in the most attractive parts of the market, increase the efficiency of our operations and create value for our shareowners.\nThank you. And operator, please open the lines.",

My name is Steven, and I will be your facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Ken Cook, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nKen Cook\n\nIR Officer, United Parcel Service, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the UPS Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; and Brian Newman, our CFO.\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2021 Form 10-K, our first quarter 2022 Form 10-Q and other reports we file with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. Unless stated otherwise, our discussion refers to adjusted results.\nFor the second quarter of 2022, GAAP results include after-tax transformation and other charges of $31 million or $0.04 per diluted share. A reconciliation to GAAP financial results is available on the UPS Investor Relations website along with the webcast of today's call.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Carol.\n\nCarol B. Tomé\n\nCEO & Director, United Parcel Service, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ken, and good morning. Let me begin by recognizing our more than 500,000 UPSers around the world for their dedication, hard work and efforts. Our founder, Jim Casey, said, \"We do what we promise.\" And in the second quarter, our UPSers did just that. They not only met, they exceeded our promises to our customers, our shareowners and each other.\nIn the second quarter, the macro environment remained dynamic. We expected volume levels to decline from last year. They did, but more than we planned, given a number of factors that Brian will detail. Despite the decline in volume, we continue to win in the most attractive parts of the market with strong gains and revenue quality. Under our better, not bigger strategy, our actions are creating a more resilient UPS. We are delivering better service for our customers and stronger financial results for our shareowners.\nFor the second quarter, consolidated revenue rose 5.7% from last year to $24.8 billion and operating profit grew 9.3% to $3.6 billion. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 14.4%, a 40 basis point improvement from last year, and it was our highest quarterly consolidated operating margin in nearly 15 years. All business segments delivered operating profit growth. And I'd like to give a shout-out to our Supply Chain Solutions businesses, which delivered operating profit of $517 million, a record high performance.\nMoving to our strategic update. Our customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy is powering consistent improvement across our company. Starting with customer-first, which is about creating a frictionless customer experience, we are growing in the parts of the market where we want to grow, like SMBs, health care, B2B and certain large enterprise accounts.\nHow are we doing that? By providing outstanding service and focusing on the capabilities that matter the most to our customers. Let me share a few new highlights with you.\nStarting with our recent acquisition of Delivery Solutions. This is a carrier-agnostic digital platform that enables companies to easily optimize their deliveries across dozens of physical networks through a single connection. Carriers include routing and other same-day services, along with curbside pickup and small package shipping, further adding to UPS' array of digital commerce solutions for our customers.\nNext, we are continuing to win with SMBs by making it easier for them to ship with us. Our new digital pricing platform called Deal Manager, that we discussed last quarter simplifies and accelerates the pricing process for larger SMB customers and is performing better than we expected. Our win rate is 12 percentage points higher than we anticipated, which helped drive our U.S. SMB growth rate in the second quarter. Later this year, Deal Manager will be rolled out to our international small package business, starting with Canada and Germany.\nAdditionally, DAP, our digital access program, is continuing to grow in the U.S. and internationally. In the first 6 months of this year, DAP generated more than $1 billion in revenue putting this well on our way to achieving our $2 billion revenue target in 2022.\nAnd looking at SMBs, in the U.S., in the second quarter, we grew SMB average daily volume, including platforms by 3.3%, which was faster than the market. SMBs made up 29.2% of our total U.S. volume in the quarter, an increase of 200 basis points from 1 year ago.\nWhile our international volume levels were challenged in the second quarter, due to the ongoing war in Eastern Europe and COVID-19 lockdowns in Asia, that didn't stop us from investing in our business. We recently launched a new daily flight from our Cologne air hub that connects key manufacturing cities in Asia. This flight speeds up transit times across multiple intra-Asia tradelanes and provides greater connectivity to the UPS global network, including to the U.S. and Europe.\nAnd speaking of Europe, did you know that UPS has the fastest ground network in Europe? In fact, we are faster by at least 1 day on the ground in over 1/3 of the market, and we will continue to leverage our competitive advantage here to win on speed and service.\nOur international expansion didn't stop in the air. In the second quarter, we announced a new joint venture in India, which we call MOVIN. MOVIN offers a range of extensive, express and premium service coverage across India with a strong portfolio of B2B domestic services.\nMoving to health care. We've expanded UPS Premier, our advanced technology solution. UPS Premier gives complex health care shipments, a priority lane in our network with enhanced visibility and near-perfect service. So far this year, we've added 14 new countries to UPS Premier, bringing the total availability to 33 countries. And by the end of this year, we will add another 15 countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America. These efforts and more are keeping us on track to hit our $10 billion health care revenue target in 2023.\nMoving to people-led. I'm delighted that Bala Subramanian has joined the company as UPS' new Chief Digital and Technology Officer. He is tasked with supercharging digital transformation across every aspect of our business and will unleash even more innovation for our customers.\nWe are moving from digital literacy to digital fluency. And to help us get there, we are investing in our people and have created training to equip them with new skills. The entire executive leadership team, including me, has completed this digital fluency training. And we are moving quickly to train our next 2 levels of leadership, which brings me to innovation driven.\nThis is about the future of UPS and driving more productivity from the assets we own. The changes we've already made have significantly increased the agility of our network and are driving productivity improvements. In the second quarter in the United States, we were able to manage hours in line with volume leads, and we optimized our trailer loads by eliminating 1,600 loads per day compared to the same time frame last year. And we will continue to deploy additional technology prior to peak.\nTo give you a couple of examples, we are on track with our deployment of smart package smart facility to the first 100 buildings in our network. And prior to peak this year, we will bring 2 automated facilities online, including the first 2 phases of our new 800,000 square foot regional hub in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\nAdditionally, on July 11, we launched our total service plan across the U.S. network. Brian will share the details, but our total service plan approach creates a more predictable operating environment enabling us to take more cost out and make our industry-leading service even better.\nWe are also working on another big efficiency opportunity, and that's how to improve delivery density. We are approaching this differently by attacking density upstream and fulfillment. We recently completed 2 pilots, and we're really excited about the results. We are building a new digital platform that can scale, and we look forward to sharing more detail with you in the coming quarters.\nInnovation-driven will also help us reach carbon neutrality by 2050. On Thursday of this week, we will publish our set of annual sustainability report, which includes our 20th GRI Content Index. In these reports, we share some new technologies that we are using, like the eQuad electric-assist bikes we are piloting in New York and London. These eQuads are a great zero-emission last-mile solution for super-urban environment.\nBefore I turn it over to Brian, let me end by reaffirming our 2022 consolidated financial targets. In 2022, we expect to generate about $102 billion in revenue, consolidated operating margin of approximately 13.7%, and we expect return on invested capital to be greater than 30%.\nLastly, we are again increasing our targeted share repurchases for 2022, taking the target up to $3 billion for the year. In the face of a very dynamic macro environment, we remain agile and on strategy. We have multiple revenue and cost levers to pull, and we remain focused on controlling what we can control.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, United Parcel Service, Inc.\n\nThanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover 4 areas. Starting with the macro environment; then our second quarter results; next, I'll cover cash and shareowner returns; and lastly, I'll wrap up with our financial outlook for the second half of 2022.\nIn the second quarter, there were many cross-currents that contributed to a dynamic macro environment. In the U.S., even with high inflation and increasing interest rates, the job market and consumer spending remains strong with a growing share of wallet spent on services.\nInternationally, the environment continued to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns in Asia and geopolitical issues, both of which drove complexity in the market for customers. Despite these external factors, we remained agile and delivered strong second quarter results as we expected.\nIn the second quarter, consolidated revenue increased 5.7% to $24.8 billion. Consolidated operating profit totaled $3.6 billion, 9.3% higher than last year. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 14.4%, which was 40 basis points above last year and was our highest consolidated operating margin in nearly 15 years. For the second quarter, diluted earnings per share was $3.29, up 7.5% from the same period last year.\nNow let's look at our business segments. In U.S. Domestic, revenue quality initiatives more than offset the volume decline and drove strong second quarter results. Average daily volume in the U.S. was down 4% or 823,000 packages per day versus the second quarter of last year. More than half of the decrease was due to actions we took with a few of our largest customers, to optimize air and ground volume we bring into our network. And the majority of the volume reduction from these customers was residential. We expected to fill this gap with other enterprise volume, but macro conditions made that challenging.\nIn the second quarter, residential volume declined 8.2% and was partially offset by a 2.3% increase in B2B average daily volume. B2B represented 43% of our volume, which was up from 40% in the second quarter of 2021. We are continuing to win in the most attractive parts of the market due to our industry-leading service and enabling capabilities.\nIn the second quarter, SMB average daily volume, including platforms, grew 3.3% year-over-year. And SMBs made up 29.2% of our U.S. domestic volume, an increase of 200 basis points over last year, putting us well on our way to achieving our 2023 target of 30%. For the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated revenue of $15.5 billion, up 7.3%.\nRevenue per piece increased 11.9%, with double-digit increases across all products. Changes to price per gallon for fuel drove 400 basis points of the revenue per piece growth rate increase, and the remaining 790 basis points of revenue per piece improvement came from the actions we took, which included base rates, fuel pricing and mix improvements.\nTurning to costs. Total expense grew 6.9%, primarily driven by 2 factors: first, fuel drove 370 basis points of the expense growth rate increase due primarily to the rise in price per gallon compared to last year; and second, wages and benefits contributed about 200 basis points of the increase due to the rise in health, welfare and pension rates. The remaining variance was driven by multiple factors, including maintenance and depreciation.\nHad we managed our second quarter cost for the short term, they could have been better. But we made the decision to manage for the longer term. So we pulled on most cost levers, but not all of them. Knowing that we would need to hire for peak soon, we did not want to make a short-term decision that would negatively impact service later in the year.\nOur industry-leading service is driving revenue quality and is bringing new customers in the door. Helping to offset cost increases, we are continuing to see the benefits of our cube utilization and other productivity efforts. Our latest initiative is called Total Service Plan, which we launched earlier this month across the U.S. network. This is about running an on-time precision network every day.\nSpecifically, we've optimized our operating plans to minimize driver wait times and execute an on-time dispatch across our network. We are happy with the early results, including a marked improvement in on-time feeder departures, which reduces idle time across the network. Total Service Plan is a key initiative that will drive lower cost and provide greater predictability for our customers and our operators.\nTo wrap up U.S. Domestic, the segment delivered $1.9 billion in operating profit, an increase of $180 million or 10.7% compared to the second quarter of 2021. And operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 12%.\nMoving to our International segment. A softer macro environment, the war in Eastern Europe and lockdowns in China pressured volumes, but our team stayed agile in the air and on the ground as we adjusted the network to match our volume levels.\nTotal average daily volume was down 9.2% in the second quarter, reflecting more-than-normal shopping behaviors in parts of the world like Canada and Germany. In the second quarter of this year, international domestic average daily volume was down 13.4%, which represented more than 3/4 of the total decrease in international volume.\nTotal export average daily volume declined 4.4% due to a combination of factors, including high global inflation and COVID-19 lockdowns in Asia, which disrupted manufacturing output. As we did last quarter, we adjusted the network and we're able to keep our operations moving in Asia to serve our customers.\nIn the second quarter, international revenue increased 5.3% to $5.1 billion. Revenue per piece increased 14.8%, including a 610 basis point decline due to currency, which was more than offset by a 1,300 basis point benefit from fuel. The remaining revenue per piece growth rate increased 790 basis points was from base pricing, product mix and revenue quality actions that we took. Operating profit grew to $1.2 billion, including a $60 million negative impact from currency. Operating margin in the second quarter was 23.7%.\nNow looking at Supply Chain Solutions. Our team did a great job leaning into the dynamic macro conditions and responding to the needs of our customers. In the second quarter, revenue was $4.2 billion, up 0.7% despite the divestiture of UPS Freight, which accounted for $297 million of Supply Chain Solutions revenue in the second quarter of 2021.\nLooking at the key performance drivers. In Forwarding, our Ocean Freight product had strong revenue growth due to higher rates, and both Air and Ocean Freight forwarding generated strong operating profit growth by managing the buy sell spreads.\nWithin Forwarding, our truckload brokerage unit delivered excellent operating profit growth driven by revenue quality initiatives and customer mix. And our Healthcare business again delivered record top and bottom line results driven by complex customers in cold chain, clinical trials and labs.\nIn the second quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated record operating profit of $517 million and delivered a record operating margin of 12.2%, an increase of 250 basis points from last year.\nWalking through the rest of the income statement, we had $171 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $298 million, and our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 23%.\nNow let's turn to cash and shareholder returns. Year-to-date, we've generated $8.3 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow was $6.9 billion. And in the first half of 2022, UPS paid $2.6 billion in dividends and completed $1.2 billion in share buybacks, which brings us to our outlook for the second half of 2022.\nAccording to IHS, GDP expectations for the full year have again been lowered from previous forecasts. Global GDP is now expected to grow 2.9% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 1.4%. We are continuing to pay close attention to macro elements, including COVID-19, inflationary pressures, the health of the consumer and the geopolitical environment.\nThe execution of our strategy under our better, not bigger framework is enabling greater agility and resiliency against an uncertain macro environment. Despite this backdrop, we are reaffirming our consolidated financial targets for 2022, driven by our results in the first half of the year and the progress we are making on our strategic initiatives.\nFor the full year 2022, consolidated revenues are expected to be about $102 billion, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS Freight. Consolidated operating margin is expected to be approximately 13.7%, and return on invested capital is anticipated to be above 30%.\nLooking specifically at the second half of 2022, in U.S. Domestic, we anticipate back half 2022 revenue growth of around 5.5%, driven by strong revenue quality, and we expect second half operating margin to expand to about 11.6%, which is consistent with our full year guidance.\nAs you update your models for U.S. Domestic, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, we anticipate volume growth rates will improve slightly in the second half of the year compared to the first half, and we expect revenue per piece to continue to increase year-over-year, but at a slower rate than in the front half of the year.\nSecond, we expect an increase in compensation expense in the second half of the year. Our annual wage increase for our Teamster employees goes into effect in August and is $1 per hour, which is higher than last year. Additionally, our current contract includes a cost of living adjustment that will be significantly higher this year compared to last year, and we expect to continue to pay market rate adjustments in certain geographies around the country.\nAnd third, union benefit rates will also increase in August. Together with pension service costs, these union wage and benefit rate increases will add nearly $600 million to our costs in the second half of 2022 compared to the second half of 2021.\nThe investments we are making in our integrated network, like our new Harrisburg, Pennsylvania automated hub, smart package smart facility, additional labeling and bagging automation, plus our total service plan will help to offset the increase in wages and benefits in the back half of the year. And we expect our cost per piece growth rate will be lower than in the first half of the year as we continue to implement our productivity initiatives. The combination of our revenue and cost initiatives will enable us to grow revenue per piece faster than cost per piece and achieve our 11.6% full year operating margin target.\nMoving to the International segment. In the second half of the year, we anticipate volume growth rates will improve relative to the first half, driven by our speed and service advantages in Europe. We expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits. Additionally, we expect currency will remain a headwind in the second half of the year. Operating margin in the International segment is anticipated to be about 23%.\nIn Supply Chain Solutions, we expect revenue in the second half of 2022 of nearly $9 billion, driven by our logistics and health care businesses. We've already begun to see ocean forwarding rates moderate, and we expect that trend to continue further year-over-year. Operating margin in the Supply Chain Solutions segment is expected to be about 10%. On a consolidated basis, we anticipate operating margin will be around 13.6% in the back half of 2022, with the fourth quarter increasing about 20 basis points year-over-year. And lastly, we expect the tax rate to be around 23% for the remainder of the year.\nTurning to capital allocation. For the full year, in 2022, we still expect free cash flow to be around $9 billion, including our annual pension contributions. Capital expenditures are still planned to be about 5.4% of revenue or $5.5 billion. We plan to pay out around $5.2 billion in dividends, subject to Board approval. We plan to repay $2 billion in debt at maturity this year, including the $1 billion we've already paid in the first half of the year.\nLastly, in terms of share repurchases, we are, again, increasing the amount of cash we plan to allocate to share repurchases, taking the target up from $2 billion to $3 billion in 2022, further rewarding our shareowners. The execution of our strategy is enabling greater agility and has driven fundamental changes to nearly every aspect of our business.\nAs we discussed last quarter, there are multiple ways for us to deliver our targets, including offsetting softer volume through revenue quality and productivity. We have many levers to pull, and we are confident that we will deliver the targets we've laid out.\nThank you, and operator, please open the lines.",

My name is Stephen, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to our host, Mr. Ken Cook, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nKen Cook\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, United Parcel Service, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the UPS' First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; and Brian Newman, our CFO.\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2021 Form 10-K and other reports we file with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC.\nFor the first quarter of 2022, GAAP results include a net charge of $19 million or $0.02 per diluted share comprised of after-tax transformation and other charges of $43 million, offset by an after-tax gain of $24 million, resulting from the curtailment of benefits in the Canadian retirement plan. Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude pension adjustments and transformation and other charges.\nThe webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, is available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Carol.\n\nCarol B. Tomé\n\nCEO & Director, United Parcel Service, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ken, and good morning. This is my eighth earnings call at UPS. Since I joined the company, we faced a pandemic, social unrest, political unrest, the fallout from Brexit and now a war. Through it all, I continue to be so impressed by the resiliency of UPSers and their commitment to moving our role forward by delivering what matters. I want to thank our team for their hard work and efforts in serving the needs of our customers, each other and our communities during these most trying times.\nBefore I discuss our results, I'd like to address our situation in Ukraine. Our hearts are with the people of Ukraine, who are feeling the effects of this tragedy firsthand. We have suspended all commercial operations in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. Where we can, we are supporting humanitarian relief efforts and our focus is on the safety of our people.\nPutting the issues in Eastern Europe aside, as we discussed in February, we expected the macro environment to be dynamic, and it was. Our average daily volume fell short of our plan due to several external factors that Brian will detail. But we remain focused on controlling what we can control. And looking at the first quarter, we were pleased with our results. Consolidated revenue rose 6.4% from last year to $24.4 billion, and operating profit grew 12.1% from last year to $3.3 billion. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 13.6%, which was 70 basis points above last year. All of our business segments delivered operating profit growth.\nOf note, our Supply Chain Solutions businesses generated record operating profit of $481 million with a record operating margin of 11%, driven by strength in forwarding and healthcare. We continue to pivot toward opportunity. We've made tremendous progress over the last 2 years. We are leveraging the power of our data to become much more agile.\nUnder our better, not bigger framework, we are investing in the capabilities that matter the most to our customers, and we are winning in the parts of the market that value our end-to-end network, like SMBs, healthcare, B2B and large enterprise accounts.\nHow do we know we are winning? Because we've gained market share. Winning comes down to successfully executing our customer first, people-led innovation-driven strategy. Looking at customer first. This is about creating a frictionless customer experience. Here, we've made 2 significant enhancements to digitize the on-boarding experience, making it easier for SMBs to ship with us.\nThe first change I'll share is for our smallest customers. In the U.S., they can now go online at ups.com, answer just 3 questions and get a contract that includes pricing. This enables them to begin shipping in under 2 minutes, instead of our old process, where they had to wait an average of 10 days to get started.\nThe second enhancement is for larger SMBs. Here, we are leveraging best-in-class technology to enhance the experience for our customers and our salespeople. We've moved from a slow, manual pricing process to a new digital platform that we call Deal Manager. This platform, which will be fully deployed to all U.S. SMB salespeople by the end of this month, operationalizes our data and applies pricing science to present the customer with the right price the first time.\nFor our customers, this means they no longer need to submit cumbersome sample data just to get a quote. For our salespeople, they can close deals on the spot, making them more efficient and freeing them up to spend more time selling. And because this platform uses advanced analytics, the more we use it, the smarter it becomes. It's a key building block to our dynamic pricing.\nOur Digital Access Program, or DAP, is another important SMB growth driver. In the first quarter, we created more than 500,000 new DAP customer accounts. That's more than 3x the number of new accounts created in the first quarter of last year. What's more, near the end of the first quarter, we began shipping DAP packages that originated outside of the U.S. As of today, DAP is available in 27 countries around the world and we are continuing to add DAP partners, putting us well on our way to achieving our $2 billion DAP revenue target in 2022.\nThe enhancements we are making are resonating with SMB customers. In the first quarter, the U.S. SMB average daily volume growth rate, including platforms, outpaced the enterprise volume growth rate. In fact, in the first quarter, SMBs made up 28.4% of our total U.S. volume, up 140 basis points from 1 year ago.\nLooking at our International and Supply Chain Solutions segments, the flexibility of our network allowed us to continue delivering for our customers within a dynamic environment. In many ways, this was one of our more challenging quarters as our international small package business faced tough year-over-year comparisons and demand was negatively impacted by ongoing disruptions due to the pandemic. But at the same time, we scurried to keep up with heightened demand in our Forwarding and Healthcare businesses. No matter what came our way, we kept delivering with outstanding service levels.\nMoving to People Led. As previously announced, in the quarter, we realigned our executive leadership team. First, Nando Cesarone, who has been leading our U.S. operations since 2020 assumed additional responsibility for U.S. sales and parts of engineering. This change gets us even closer to the customer, helping us better go-to-market as 1 UPS and enabling our teams to move even faster to unlock value for our customers and our shareowners.\nSecond, Kate Gutmann assumed a new role, leading both the International and Supply Chain Solutions segments in addition to our Healthcare business. This allows us to better serve our global customers with our full range of services and provides opportunity for synergies in both revenue and cost.\nFinally, we have an external search underway for our new Chief Digital and Technology Officer. I'm delighted with the candidates that have surfaced for this role and hope to fill the position soon. Which brings us to innovation-driven. This is about driving higher returns from the capital we deploy. Here, we are continuing to leverage the technology investments we've made to power our global Smart Logistics Network.\nThroughout the quarter, we leveraged our network planning tools, automated facilities and other technologies to optimize the network and run it with greater agility. These efforts, coupled with a laser focus on revenue quality, contributed to a 90 basis point improvement in U.S. operating margin year-over-year.\nAs we've discussed, we've turned productivity into a virtuous cycle at UPS. We have started the rollout of our RFID technology that we call Smart Package, with the intent of completing 100 centers in 2022. This year, we will also begin the implementation of automated bagging, automated label application and robotic small store induction, all this to drive increased productivity.\nAs an innovation-driven company, we are marching down the path toward our goal of being carbon neutral by 2050. Here is one example. We have 2 data centers that drive our global integrated network. These data centers are now powered 100% by renewable energy sources.\nTo give you some context, the power used to run these 2 data centers is the equivalent of the electricity needed to run 5,000 homes for 1 year. As we look ahead, we think the macro environment will be very dynamic, but we see many positives inside our business. We continue to deliver high service levels. We are gaining market share. We are more agile today than when I on-boarded, and we are focused on controlling what we can control to achieve the financial targets we've laid out.\nBrian will share the details regarding our outlook, but let me end by reaffirming our 2022 consolidated financial goals. In 2022, we expect to generate about $102 billion in revenue, consolidated operating margin of approximately 13.7%. And we expect return on invested capital to be greater than 30%. We are confident in our outlook and our financial condition. As a result, we are increasing our share repurchases for 2022, taking the target up to $2 billion for the year.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, United Parcel Service, Inc.\n\nThanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover 4 areas. Starting with the macro environment, then our first quarter results. Next, I'll cover cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll provide an update on our financial outlook for 2022.\nAs Carol mentioned, external factors resulted in a challenging operating environment in the first quarter. Early in January, Omicron negatively impacted retail sales and pressured volumes. The impact of Omicron subsided in February and volume growth turned slightly positive. Then late in the quarter, the combination of record-high inflation, a surge in energy prices, COVID-19 lockdowns in Asia and geopolitical uncertainty resulted in our consolidated volume growth rates turning negative. Despite these external factors, we remain agile and delivered strong first quarter results by continuing to execute our strategy and quickly adjusting our network to match capacity with the needs of our customers.\nIn the first quarter, consolidated revenue increased 6.4% to $24.4 billion. Consolidated operating profit totaled $3.3 billion, 12.1% higher than last year. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 13.6%, which was 70 basis points above last year. For the first quarter, diluted earnings per share was $3.05, up 10.1% from the same period last year.\nNow let's look at our business segments. U.S. Domestic delivered strong first quarter results. Our success was driven by continued gains in revenue quality and by leveraging the agility of our network to control cost. We had planned for volume to be down slightly in the first quarter based on volume projections from a few of our largest customers. We expected to fill this gap with other enterprise volume, but market conditions did not support and our volume was lower than planned. Total average daily volume in the U.S. was down 3% or 611,000 packages per day versus the first quarter of last year, driven by a 7.4% decline in residential volume.\nLooking back to March 2021, stimulus checks arrived at many U.S. households and contributed to difficult year-over-year comps in the first quarter of this year. The decline in residential deliveries included a reduction in SurePost volume of about 312,000 packages per day. The decrease in residential volume was partially offset by a 3.6% increase in B2B average daily volume, with growth from both enterprise and SMB customers.\nIn the first quarter, B2B represented 43% of our volume, which was up from 40% in the first quarter of 2021. Even within the current environment, the execution of our strategy is continuing to drive improvement in customer mix. In the first quarter, SMB average daily volume, including platforms, was up 1.9% and SMBs made up 28.4% of U.S. domestic volume, an increase of 140 basis points over last year.\nFor the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $15.1 billion, up 8%, which included the benefit of one additional operating day. Revenue per piece increased 9.5%, more than offsetting the volume decline in the first quarter. Together, fuel surcharges and base rates drove 820 basis points of the revenue per piece improvement, with mix contributing the rest of the growth. Additionally, revenue per piece grew across all products and customer segments with ground revenue per piece up 8.4%.\nTurning to costs. Total expense grew 6.9%. Total payroll and benefits, which included market rate adjustments, drove 390 basis points of the increase, and fuel drove 230 basis points of the expense growth rate increase. The remaining expense growth rate increase was driven by multiple factors, including weekend expansion and depreciation.\nThe investments we've made in our automated facilities, coupled with our productivity improvement initiatives, enabled us to eliminate more than 1,300 trailer loads per day compared to the same period last year, which contributed to the positive operating leverage in the quarter. The U.S. Domestic segment delivered $1.7 billion in operating profit, an increase of $242 million or 16.5% compared to the first quarter of 2021. And operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 11.3%.\nLooking outside of the U.S., let me start by providing some information on our direct exposure to Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. Revenue from these 3 countries represented less than 1% of our consolidated revenue in 2021. While the direct financial impact is not material to our business, we are closely monitoring the broader impacts across the global economy.\nMoving to our International segment performance. By leveraging the agility of our global network and focusing on revenue quality, International executed well in a challenging global market, navigating through increases in global inflation, a war and COVID-19 disruptions.\nIn contrast to the U.S., we plan for international volume to grow in the first quarter, and it did not. Total average daily volume was down 256,000 packages per day or 6.7% in the first quarter. Part of the decline was due to tough comps from 1 year ago. When looking at performance on a 2-year stack basis, total international average daily volume was up 16.4%.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, international domestic average daily volume was down 10.1%, representing nearly 80% of the decrease in international volume. Total export average daily volume declined 2.9% due to a combination of factors, including COVID-19 lockdowns in Asia. In response, we adjusted the network and we're able to keep our operations moving in Asia and at the same time, shifted capacity where it was needed to serve our customers globally.\nFor example, average daily volume on the Europe to U.S. lane grew 10.7%. In the first quarter, international revenue increased 5.8% to $4.9 billion. Revenue per piece increased 10.5%, including a 710 basis point benefit from fuel and a 680 basis point benefit from revenue quality and mix, offset by a 340 basis point negative impact due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Operating profit was $1.1 billion, an increase of 2.7%. And operating margin was 23%, down 70 basis points year-over-year.\nNow looking at Supply Chain Solutions. In the first quarter, the segment delivered record operating profit in a dynamic environment. Revenue increased to $4.4 billion, up 2% despite the divestiture of UPS Freight, which accounted for $767 million of Supply Chain Solutions revenue in the first quarter of 2021.\nLooking at the key performance drivers. Forwarding revenue was up 25% and operating profit more than doubled by managing the buy-sell spreads, while global market demand continued to outpace supply. Our teams did an outstanding job helping our customers manage through this challenging market.\nWithin forwarding, our truckload brokerage unit delivered strong operating profit growth driven by revenue quality initiatives. And our healthcare business delivered record revenue and operating profit results in the first quarter, led by pharma, clinical trials and lab customers. In the first quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated an operating profit of $481 million and delivered a record operating margin of 11%, 180 basis points above last year.\nWalking through the rest of the income statement, we had $174 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $298 million. And lastly, our effective tax rate in the first quarter came in at 21.5%, flat to last year and lower than planned due to discrete items. For the full year in 2022, we expect our effective tax rate to be around 23%.\nNow let's turn to cash and shareowner returns. We are continuing to generate strong cash flow from our disciplined focus on capital allocation and bottom-line results. In the first quarter, we generated $4.5 billion in cash from operations. Free cash flow for the period was $3.9 billion, a 5.5% increase year-over-year.\nAnd in the first quarter, UPS distributed $1.3 billion in dividends and completed $260 million in share buybacks, which brings us to our outlook for the remainder of 2022. According to IHS, GDP expectations for the full year have been lowered from previous forecasts. Global GDP is now expected to grow 3.2% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 3%. And the macro environment is expected to be bumpy for the remainder of 2022.\nWe are continuing to pay close attention to macro elements, including COVID-19, upstream supply chain constraints, inventory and inflationary pressures and the geopolitical environment. Despite this backdrop, we are reaffirming our consolidated financial targets for 2022, driven by our results in the first quarter and the momentum we are seeing in the second quarter.\nConsolidated revenues are expected to be about $102 billion, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS Freight. Consolidated operating margin is expected to be approximately 13.7% and return on invested capital is anticipated to be above 30%.\nWe expect our path to achieve these financial targets will be different than we shared with you in February. We have proven our ability to adapt in a dynamic environment and we have many levers to pull that give us confidence in our ability to achieve our targets.\nIn U.S. Domestic, our revenue guidance is not changing. We anticipate revenue growth of around 5.5%, with revenue per piece growing faster than volume. In terms of volume, however, we anticipate volume growth rates will be lower than we originally expected. The volume growth rate in the first half of the year is expected to be negative and we expect it to improve in the second half of the year. Pricing is expected to remain firm and will continue to price based on the value we provide to our customers.\nLastly, in U.S. domestic, we expect operating margin to expand around 50 basis points for the full year in 2022. In international, our revenue guidance is unchanged. Revenue growth is anticipated to be approximately 7.7%, driven by revenue quality initiatives. We anticipate volume will be lower than originally planned. And given the value we offer our customers, we expect pricing to remain firm. Operating margin in the International segment is anticipated to be about 23.6%.\nIn Supply Chain Solutions, our revenue expectation is unchanged at around $17 billion, driven by our healthcare portfolio and forwarding. We expect ocean rates to moderate below 2021 peak levels. Operating margin is expected to be about 9.4%. As a reminder, we will lap the sale of UPS Freight at the end of April.\nTurning to capital allocation. For the full year in 2022, we still expect free cash flow to be around $9 billion, including our annual pension contributions. Capital expenditures are still expected to be about 5.4% of revenue or $5.5 billion, which includes 2 747-8 aircraft, 2 automated hubs, more than 3,700 alternative fuel vehicles and additional technology investments, all of which will enable greater efficiency in our integrated network and move us further down the path to achieving our 2050 carbon-neutral goal. And in 2022, we are planning to pay out around $5.2 billion in dividends, subject to Board approval.\nRegarding debt repayment. As of today, our plan is to repay $2 billion in debt at maturity this year. Lastly, in terms of capital allocation, we are doubling the amount of cash we plan to allocate to share repurchases to $2 billion in 2022, further rewarding our shareowners.\nWe are executing our strategy and we will remain agile as we continue to navigate the dynamic macro environment. We are laser-focused on improving revenue quality, reducing our cost to serve and disciplined capital allocation. And by controlling what we can control, we are confident in our outlook and our financial condition. Thank you.\nAnd operator, please open the lines.",

My name is Steven, and I will be your facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to our host, Mr. Scott Childress, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nScott Childress\n\nVP & IR Officer, United Parcel Service, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the UPS Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; and Brian Newman, our CFO.\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectation for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2020 Form 10-K, subsequently filed Form 10-Qs and other reports we file with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2021, GAAP results include a noncash after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $14 million and after-tax transformation and other charges of $45 million. The after-tax total for these items is $59 million, an impact to fourth quarter 2021 EPS of $0.07 per diluted share. The mark-to-market pension charge of $14 million represents losses recognized outside of a 10% corridor on company-sponsored pension and postretirement plans. Additional detail regarding year-end pension charges are included in the appendix of our fourth quarter 2021 earnings presentation that will be posted to the UPS Investor Relations website later today.\nUnless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude year-end pension charges and transformation and other charges. The webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, is available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Carol.\n\nCarol B. Tomé\n\nCEO & Director, United Parcel Service, Inc.\n\nThank you, Scott, and good morning. What an incredible year it's been at UPS. Let me begin by recognizing the efforts of our amazing UPSers, 534,000 strong around the world. Not only did our team once again provide industry-leading service during peak, but over the last year, we delivered 1.1 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses with 99.9% on-time service. I'm so very proud of our team and what we've accomplished. The external environment is challenging due to the ongoing impacts of the pandemic labor tightness, upstream supply chain jams and rising inflation. But inside our better, not bigger framework, we are maniacal about controlling what we can control.\nWe are laser-focused on improving revenue quality, reducing our cost to serve and allocating capital in a disciplined fashion. This is enabling us to move faster and to be more agile so that we capture the best opportunities in the market, enhance the customer experience and continuously improve our financial performance.\nLooking at the fourth quarter, our results exceeded our expectations driven by improved revenue quality across all 3 of our business segments and significant gains in productivity. Consolidated revenue rose 11.5% from last year to $27.8 billion, and operating profit grew 37.7% from last year to $4 billion. This is the highest quarterly operating profit in the company's history. And for the full year 2021, our business delivered record financial results. Consolidated revenue increased 15% to reach $97.3 billion, and operating profit totaled $13.1 billion, 50.8% higher than last year. We generated $10.9 billion in free cash flow, more than double the amount generated in the prior year, and diluted earnings per share were $12.13, an increase of 47.4%. In a moment, Brian will provide more detail about our financial results.\nAt our June Investor and Analyst Day, I said, intent is not a strategy and vision without action is just a dream. At UPS, we are acting on our customer-first people-led innovation-driven strategy as we transform nearly every aspect of our business.\nStarting with Customer First. As we've discussed, we are focused on growing in the parts of the market that value our end-to-end network, including B2B, health care, SMBs and large enterprise accounts. In 2021, our SMB average daily volume grew 18% and represented 26.8% of our total U.S. volume, putting us on track to achieve our 2023 target of more than 30%.\nOur Digital Access Program, or DAP, makes it easy for SMBs to access UPS services. And it's an important driver of our SMB growth. In 2020, I challenged the team to turn DAP into $1 billion business. In 2021, DAP generated $1.3 billion in revenue. Looking ahead, we expect DAP to reach more than $2 billion in 2022 as we add new partners and expand to additional countries.\nSMB opportunities outside of the U.S. are tremendous. And in the fourth quarter, our international SMB revenue growth rate was 18%. As we expand DAP, grow with SMBs across Europe and introduce new partnerships, we expect to gain overall SMB revenue share faster than the market growth.\nHealth care is another market we are focused on. And in 2021, our Healthcare portfolio reached more than $8 billion in revenue. Here, we serve complex customers with our global footprint of health care facilities and cold chain solutions. Our health care expertise and end-to-end solutions are unmatched in the industry, and we are well on our way to hitting our $10 billion revenue target for 2023.\nAnd amid the bottlenecks and uncertainty, our Supply Chain Solutions group is providing customer supply chain flexibility and resiliency through alternative routings and solutions. Demand for forwarding products continued to be strong in the fourth quarter. In fact, ocean shipments were up double digits and container rates remain elevated in the market.\nNow from an experience perspective, Customer First is about providing a frictionless end-to-end customer experience. We are attacking the biggest pain points first and over the last several months, have rolled out improvements to the digital experience in pickup, claims at ups.com. You may not know this, but we generate over $9 billion in gross revenue annually from transactions on our global website. We redesigned the U.S. site in 2021 and saw site visits grow 100-fold with an equally impressive growth in monthly page views, up from 10,000 in January to 600,000 in December. We've got more plans to improve the ups.com experience around the world. which should lead to higher revenue and better customer satisfaction. We know it will take time to move the needle on our Net Promoter Score, which stands at 30, but we set a target of 50 and have laid out a path to get there.\nMoving to the second element of our strategy, people-led. Here, we focus on the employee experience and making UPS a great place to work. We measure our performance by how likely an employee is to recommend others to work at UPS. When I became CEO in 2020, our likelihood to recommend metrics stood at 51% globally. And our goal is to surpass 80%. We've made great strides, gaining 10 percentage points to finish 2021 at 61%.\nAnd now to the last leg of our strategic platform, innovation-driven is at the heart of what we do. Our global smart logistics network, powered by technology developed by UPS engineers, enabled us to deliver another successful peak. It may have been our hardest peak ever. We had higher volume than we expected at the beginning of the quarter and lower volume at the end, but our sales, engineering and operating teams remained agile and pivoted with changes in global market conditions and the needs of our customers. We delivered excellent service levels, avoided chaos costs and improved efficiency in the network. In fact, productivity in our U.S. operations improved by 1.7% for the fourth quarter, as measured by pieces per hour. Progress on the innovation-driven element of our strategy is all about driving higher returns on invested capital. As Brian will detail, in 2021, we reversed a multiyear downward trend in this metric and delivered a return on invested capital of 30.8%, 910 basis points above 2020. We remain disciplined in our capital allocation priorities and commitments.\nIn regard to capital expenditures, we are increasing our investments back into the business to drive innovation and growth. We just started the first phase of what we're calling smart package smart facility, which, over time, will put RFID tax on all of our packages. This initiative will enhance customer experience while improving UPS productivity by eliminating millions of manual scans every day. Brian will share more detail on our CapEx plans during his remarks.\nIn June, we told you we were going to target a dividend payout ratio at year-end of 50% of adjusted earnings per share, and we're doing just that. Today, the UPS Board approved a 49% increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.02 per share to $1.52 per share. This represents the largest quarterly dividend increase in our company's history. Our strategy is building a solid foundation for our business and enabling agility. While we expect 2022 to be another challenging year, we've got momentum.\nSo let me end by sharing our 2022 financial goals. Building on the record results we delivered last year, we anticipate delivering our 2023 consolidated revenue and operating margin targets 1 year ahead of our plan. In 2022, consolidated revenues are expected to be about $102 billion. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 13.7%, and return on invested capital is anticipated to be above 30%. Brian will provide more details on our outlook.\nI'm excited about the many opportunities in front of us. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer, United Parcel Service, Inc.\n\nThanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover 3 areas, starting with our fourth quarter results, then I'll cover our full year 2021 results, including cash and shareholder returns. And lastly, I'll share our financial outlook for 2022.\nIn the fourth quarter, supply chain challenges and the emergence of the Omicron COVID-19 variant weighed on global economic growth. In fact, the U.S. December retail sales report came in lower than forecasted, and the inventory-to-sales ratio remained at historic lows. Despite these factors, our financial performance was better than we expected as the progress we've made executing our strategy continues to deliver strong results.\nConsolidated revenue increased 11.5% to $27.8 billion. Consolidated operating profit totaled $4 billion, 37.7% higher than last year. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 14.2%, which was 270 basis points above last year. For the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share was $3.59, up 35% from the same period last year, and full year EPS was $12.13 per diluted share, an increase of 47.4% year-over-year.\nNow let's look at our business segments. U.S. domestic delivered outstanding fourth quarter results. Our success was driven by gains in revenue quality and productivity as well as our ability to quickly adjust our network to match capacity with the needs of our customers while providing industry-leading service. Average daily volume increased by 39,000 packages per day or 0.2% year-over-year to a total of 25.2 million packages per day. This was below our expectations due to the soft retail environment in December.\nRegarding revenue quality, the impact of our better, not bigger approach is continuing to drive improvement in customer mix. In fact, SMB average daily volume, including platforms, grew 8.4%, outpacing the market. And in the fourth quarter, SMBs made up 25.8% of U.S. domestic volume, up 240 basis points versus last year.\nMix also shifted positively toward commercial volume as our B2B average daily volume continued to recover and was up 8.8%. B2B represented 36% of our volume compared to 33% in the fourth quarter of 2020. For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $17.7 billion, up 12.4%, driven by a 10.5% increase in revenue per piece. Fuel drove 380 basis points of the revenue per piece growth rate and demand-related surcharges drove 110 basis points of the growth rate increase. Revenue per piece grew across all products and customer segments with ground revenue per piece up 10%.\nTurning to costs. Total expense grew 8.1%. Fuel drove 230 basis points of the expense growth rate increase. Wages and benefits, which included market rate adjustments, drove 410 basis points of the increase, and the remaining increase in the expense growth rate was due to several factors, including higher depreciation, federal excise taxes and weakened expansion costs.\nProductivity improvements helped partially offset the increase in expense. For example, through our ongoing efforts to optimize our trailer loads, we eliminated over 1,000 loads per day compared to the same time period last year.\nTurning to the holiday season in the U.S. Our teams did an excellent job executing our plan and adjusting where appropriate. Early in the quarter, volume came in stronger than expected, and we quickly adjusted the network by leveraging our weekend operations package flow technology and automated facilities. Late in the quarter, volume levels were lower than we expected as Omicron and inventory challenges negatively impacted the enterprise retail sector. Again, our operators adjusted the network and, importantly, also pulled out cost. We decreased staffing levels and returned rental equipment early, which helped to lower the year-over-year operating expense growth rate.\nThe U.S. Domestic segment delivered $2.2 billion in operating profit, an increase of $786 million or 57% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. And operating margin expanded 340 basis points to 12.2%.\nMoving to International. The segment delivered excellent results by focusing on revenue quality and adjusting network capacity. Because of tough year-over-year comps and COVID-19 dynamics, we anticipated a fourth quarter decline in average daily volume, which was down 4.8%. On a more positive note, product mix was favorable with B2B average daily volume up 4.7% on a year-over-year basis. This partially offset a decline in BSC volume, which was down 18.4% compared to an increase of 104% during the same period last year.\nIn addition to tough year-over-year comps, total export average daily volume declined by 5.2% due to the decrease in volume between the U.K. and Europe arising from Brexit disruptions and from fewer flights coming out of Asia. In the fourth quarter, we operated 105 fewer flights than planned, primarily due to COVID-19. Despite these factors, for the fourth quarter, international revenue increased 13.1% to $5.4 billion. Revenue per piece increased 16.4%, including a 730 basis point benefit from fuel and a 340 basis point benefit from demand-related surcharges.\nThe International segment delivered record operating profit and fourth quarter operating margin. Operating profit was $1.3 billion, an increase of 14.7%, and operating margin was 24.7%.\nNow looking at Supply Chain Solutions. The business segment delivered record fourth quarter top and bottom line results as our team executed extremely well in a challenging environment. Revenue increased to $4.7 billion, up 6.7%, despite a $789 million reduction in revenue from the divestiture of UPS Freight.\nLooking at the key performance drivers. Forwarding revenue was up 37.9% and operating profit more than doubled as global market demand remained strong and capacity stayed tight. International airfreight kilos increased 3.3%, and in Ocean Freight, volume growth on the Transpacific Eastbound Lane, our largest trade lane, grew 7.8%, which was more than twice the market growth rate.\nWithin Forwarding, our truckload brokerage unit grew revenue and profit by double digits, driven by revenue quality initiatives and strong cost management. And our Healthcare portfolio delivered strong profits in the fourth quarter, led by pharma and medical device customers. In the fourth quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated strong operating profit of $456 million and delivered an operating margin of 9.7%.\nWalking through the rest of the income statement, we had $173 million of interest expense. Other pension income was $267 million. And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 22%.\nNow let me comment on our full year 2021 results. Starting at the consolidated level, revenue increased $12.7 billion to $97.3 billion. We reduced our cost to serve through a combination of nonoperating cost reductions, along with improved productivity. We grew operating profit by $4.4 billion, an increase of 50.8%, finishing the year at $13.1 billion. Operating margin was 13.5%, an increase of 320 basis points. And for context, this is the highest consolidated operating margin we've had in 14 years.\nWe increased our ROIC to 30.8%, an increase of 910 basis points. We generated $10.9 billion of free cash flow, an increase of 114% over 2020, and we strengthened the balance sheet by paying off $2.55 billion of long-term debt. And we reduced our pension liabilities by $7.8 billion, which improved our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 1.9 turns compared to 3.6 last year. And we returned over $3.9 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.\nNow for a few full year highlights for the segments. In U.S. domestic, operating profit was up 62.7%, an increase of $2.6 billion, to reach $6.7 billion for the full year, and we expanded operating margin to 11.1%, a year-over-year increase of 340 basis points. International grew operating profit by $1.2 billion, ending the year at a record $4.7 billion in profit, and operating margin was 24.2%, an increase of 200 basis points. And Supply Chain Solutions increased operating profit by $649 million, up 61.3%, and delivered operating margin of 9.8%, 280 basis points above 2020.\n2021 was an outstanding year for UPS, which brings us back to our outlook for 2022. Global GDP is expected to grow 4.2%. We are continuing to pay close attention to and manage through several external factors, including COVID-19, inflationary pressures, upstream supply chain constraints and labor shortages. As a result, we expect the environment to remain dynamic in 2022.\nMost importantly, within this backdrop, we will focus on controlling what we can control and continuing to advance our strategic initiatives. And as Carol stated, we expect to deliver our 2023 consolidated financial targets 1 year early.\nSo looking at 2022, on a consolidated basis, revenues are expected to be about $102 billion, which takes into account the divestiture of UPS Freight. Additionally, consolidated operating margin is expected to be approximately 13.7%. In U.S. domestic, we anticipate revenue growth of around 5.5% with revenue per piece growing faster than volume. We expect pricing in the industry to remain firm and will continue to price based on the value we provide to our customers. As a result, we anticipate domestic operating margin will expand around 50 basis points in 2022. Lastly, in the U.S., we expect to deliver an incremental revenue to profit conversion percentage in the low 20s for the full year.\nMoving to the International segment. We expect to continue growing faster than the market. Revenue growth is anticipated to be approximately 7.7% with volume growing slightly faster than revenue. More specifically, we expect to grow fastest in our transborder ground products. Additionally, we expect international demand-related surcharges to remain elevated in 2022. Pulling it all together, operating profit in the International segment is expected to increase around 5% and operating margin is anticipated to be around 23.6%.\nIn Supply Chain Solutions, we expect revenue to be around $17 billion, driven by continued strong growth in Healthcare and elevated demand in Forwarding. However, we expect ocean surcharge rates to moderate below 2021 peak levels. Therefore, we expect operating profit to be down from what we reported in 2021. Operating margin is expected to be about 9.4%. And for modeling purposes, below the line, we anticipate $1.2 billion in other pension income, partly offset by $665 million in interest expense. The full year net impact is expected to be around $570 million, which can be spread evenly across the quarters.\nNow let's turn to full year 2022 capital allocation. As we discussed at last year's Investor and Analyst Day, we've transitioned to a disciplined and programmatic approach to capital expenditures. In line with the CapEx range we shared then, we expect 2022 capital expenditures to be about 5.4% of revenue or $5.5 billion. These investments will continue to improve overall network efficiency and move us further down the path to achieving our 2050 carbon-neutral goals. About 60% of our capital spending plan will be allocated to growth projects and about 40% to maintenance. Let me give you a few project highlights.\nWe have 30 delivery centers and 2 automated hub projects planned to be delivered this year. Combined, these projects will enable us to drive greater efficiency by better balancing sort capacity with delivery capacity. We will purchase over 3,700 alternative fuel vehicles this year, including around 425 arrival electric delivery vehicles to be deployed in the U.S. and in Europe. We will take delivery of 2 new 747-8 aircraft in 2022, which adds international capacity and will make predelivery payments on the 19 Boeing 767 freighters that we announced in December. The 767s are planned to enter our fleet between 2023 and 2025. And lastly, across these projects and others, our annual capital expenditures will again include over $1 billion of investments that support our carbon-neutral goals.\nNow let's turn to our expectations for cash and the balance sheet. We expect free cash flow of around $9 billion, including our annual pension contributions, which are equal to our expected service costs. As Carol mentioned, the Board has approved a dividend per share of $1.52 for the first quarter, which represents a 49% increase in our dividend. We are planning to pay out around $5.2 billion in dividends in 2022, subject to Board approval. We expect to buy back at least $1 billion of our shares, and we'll evaluate additional opportunities as the year progresses. We expect diluted share count to be about 880 million shares throughout the year. Finally, our effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%.\nIn closing, the strategic and financial progress we've made in 2021 delivered consistent returns and created strong momentum as we entered 2022. We remain laser-focused on continuously improving our financial performance by enhancing revenue quality, reducing our cost to serve and staying disciplined on capital allocation.\nThank you, and operator, please open the lines.",

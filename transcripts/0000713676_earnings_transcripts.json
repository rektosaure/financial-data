[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Bryan Gill. Thank you, Bryan. You may begin.\n\nBryan K. Gill\n\nExecutive Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nWell, good morning, and welcome to today's conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. I am Bryan Gill, the Director of Investor Relations for PNC and participating on this call are PNC Chairman and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nToday's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of October 15, 2025, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam S. Demchak\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we had an excellent quarter, building on a great year so far. Our results for the third quarter reflect an impressive performance across the entire franchise. We reported net income of $1.8 billion or $4.35 per share. We grew customers, loans and deposits and continue to deepen relationships across our businesses and geographic footprint, with positive trends in our legacy and fast-growing expansion markets.\nOur NII growth trajectory continued as expected, coupled with very strong fee growth and well-controlled expenses. And as a result, we delivered record revenue and PPNR as well as another quarter of positive operating leverage. Credit quality continues to remain strong with a net charge-off ratio of only 22 basis points. While there are obvious potential downside risks to the U.S. economy, our customers remain on solid footing. From a consumer perspective, spending has been remarkably resilient across all segments and corporate clients are expressing cautious optimism about their business outlook. Ultimately, this is driving a sound economy.\nLooking at our business lines, we continue to execute on our strategic priorities. In Retail Banking, consumer DDAs grew 2% year-over-year, including 6% growth in the Southwest, driven by strength across our branch and digital channels. Customer activity in the quarter remained robust, with record Debit Card transactions and Credit Card spend as well as record levels of investment assets in PNC Wealth Management, our newly re-branded brokerage business. We continue to invest in future growth. By the end of the year, we will have opened more than 25 new branches, and importantly, we remain on track to complete our 200-plus branch builds by the end of 2029.\nIn C&I, we saw record noninterest income driven by broad-based performance across fee income categories and pipelines remain strong. Within our Asset Management business, we continue to see client growth and positive net flows from both legacy and expansion markets with the expansion markets growing at a faster pace.\nBefore I pass it over to Rob, I wanted to say how excited we are about the recent announcement to acquire FirstBank. Kevin Klassen and his team have built a premier bank in the Colorado region, with a focus on strong customer service and an enviable branch network. Upon closing, this deal will propel PNC to the #1 market share position in retail deposits in branches in Denver. It will also more than triple our branch footprint in Colorado while adding additional presence in Arizona. And finally, as always, I'd like to thank our employees for everything they do for our company.\nWith that, Rob will take you through the quarter. Rob?\n\nRobert Q. Reilly\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis.\nFor the linked quarter, loans of $326 billion grew $3 billion or 1%. Investment securities of $144 billion increased $3 billion or 2%, and our cash balance at the Federal Reserve was $34 billion, an increase of $3 billion. Deposit balances were up $9 billion or 2% and average $432 billion, and borrowings increased $1 billion to $66 billion. AOCI at September 30 improved $605 million or 13% compared with the prior quarter and was negative $4.1 billion. Our tangible book value of $107.84 per common share increased 4% linked quarter and 11% compared to the same period a year ago.\nWe remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 10.6% and an estimated CET1 ratio, inclusive of AOCI of 9.7% at quarter end. We continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility. During the quarter, we returned $1 billion of capital to shareholders, which included $679 million in common dividends and $331 million of share repurchases, and we expect fourth quarter share repurchases to continue to be in the range of $300 million and $400 million.\nSlide 5 shows our Loans in more detail. During the third quarter, we delivered solid loan growth. Balances averaged $326 billion, an increase of $3 billion or 1% compared to the second quarter. Average commercial loans increased $3.4 billion or 2%, driven by growth in the C&I portfolio, partially offset by a decline in commercial real estate loans of $1 billion. Growth in C&I was driven by strong new production, particularly in Corporate Banking and Business Credit. And during the third quarter, utilization remained slightly above 50%. Commercial real estate balances declined $1 billion or 3% as we continue to reduce certain exposures. Consumer loans were stable as growth in auto and credit card balances was offset by a decline in residential real estate loans. The total loan yield of 5.76% increased 6 basis points compared with the second quarter.\nSlide 6 details our investment securities and swap portfolios. During the third quarter, average investment securities increased approximately $3 billion or 2%, driven by purchasing activity late in the previous quarter. Our securities yield was 3.36%, an increase of 10 basis points. And as of September 30, our [ duration was ] 3.4 years. Regarding our swaps, active received fixed rate swaps totaled $45 billion on September 30 with a receive rate of 3.64%, and forward starting swaps were $9 billion with a receive rate of 4.11%. Importantly, our securities portfolio is well positioned for a steepening yield curve that will support substantial NII growth in 2026.\nSlide 7 covers our deposit balances in more detail. Average deposits increased $9 billion or 2% during the quarter, driven by particularly strong growth in commercial interest-bearing deposits, which were up 7%. Noninterest-bearing balances of $93 billion were stable and were 21% of total deposits. Total commercial deposits grew approximately $9 billion or 5% linked quarter. The growth was due in part to seasonality, but also reflective of both new and expanded client relationships. Our total rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 8 basis points to 2.2% in the third quarter, reflecting the outsized growth in interest-bearing deposits and the resulting change in our deposit mix, along with slightly higher consumer rates paid.\nGoing forward, we anticipate our rate paid on deposits will decline in the fourth quarter because of the full quarter impact of the September Fed rate cut and our expectation for additional cuts in October and December.\nTurning to Slide 8, we highlight our income statement trends. Comparing the third quarter to the second quarter, total revenue was a record $5.9 billion and was up $254 million or 4%, and noninterest expense of $3.5 billion increased $78 million or 2%, which allowed us to deliver more than 200 basis points of positive operating leverage and record PPNR of $2.5 billion. Provision was $167 million and declined $87 million compared to the second quarter. Our effective tax rate was 20.3%, and third quarter net income was $1.8 billion or $4.35 per diluted share. In the first 9 months of the year compared to the same time last year, we've demonstrated strong momentum across our franchise.\nTotal revenue increased $1 billion or 7%, driven by record net interest income and record fee income. Noninterest expense increased $213 million or 2% reflecting increased business activity as well as continued investments in technology and branches. And net income grew $638 million, resulting in diluted EPS growth of 17%.\nTurning to Slide 9. We detail our revenue trends. Third quarter revenue increased $254 million or 4% compared to the prior quarter. Net interest income of $3.6 billion increased $93 million or 3%. The growth reflected the continued benefit of fixed rate asset repricing, loan growth and 1 additional day in the quarter. And our net interest margin was 2.79%, a decline of 1 basis point, reflecting the outsized commercial deposit growth I previously mentioned. Importantly, our expectation is for NIM continue to grow going forward and we still expect to exceed 3% during 2026. Noninterest income of $2.3 billion increased $161 million or 8%. Inside of that, fee income increased $175 million or 9% linked quarter, reflecting broad-based growth across categories.\nLooking at the details. Asset management and Brokerage income increased $13 million or 3% driven by higher equity markets and included positive net flows. Capital Markets and Advisory revenue increased $111 million or 35%, driven by an increase in M&A advisory activity as well as higher underwriting and loan syndication revenue. Card and Cash Management revenue was stable as seasonally higher credit and debit card activity was offset by lower merchant services. Lending and deposit services revenue increased $18 million or 6% due to increased activity and client growth. Mortgage revenue increased $33 million or 26% reflecting elevated MSR hedging activity and higher residential mortgage production. And Other noninterest income of $198 million included negative Visa derivative fair value adjustments of $35 million, primarily related to Visa September announcement of a Litigation Escrow Funding.\nNotably, we continue to see strong momentum across our lines of business and throughout our markets, and year-to-date noninterest income of $6.3 billion grew $337 million or 6% compared to the same period last year.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our third quarter expenses were up $78 million or 2% linked quarter. The growth was largely in personnel costs, which increased $81 million or 4% and included higher variable compensation related to increased business activity. The Equipment expense increased $22 million or 6%, reflecting higher depreciation related to investments in technology and branches. Importantly, all other categories declined or remained stable. Year-to-date noninterest expense increased by $213 million or 2%, and as we previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $350 million in 2025 through our continuous improvement program, and we're on track to achieve that goal. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business in technology investments.\nOur credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Overall credit quality remains strong. Nonperforming loans of $2.1 billion were stable linked quarter. Total delinquencies of $1.2 billion declined $70 million or 5% compared with June 30, reflecting lower commercial and consumer delinquencies. Net loan charge-offs were $179 million, down $19 million and represents a net charge-off ratio of 22 basis points. Provision was $167 million, resulting in a slight release of loan reserves, primarily due to an improved outlook for our CRE portfolio, reflecting both lower loss rates and continued runoff.\nAt the end of the third quarter, our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.3 billion or 1.61% of total loans.\nIn summary, PNC reported a solid third quarter. Regarding our view of the overall economy, we're expecting real GDP growth to be below 2% in 2025 and unemployment to peak above 4.5% in mid-2026. We expect the Fed to cut rates 3 consecutive times with a 25 basis point decrease at the October, December and January meeting. Looking at the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to the third quarter of 2025, we expect average loans to be stable to up 1%. Net interest income to be up approximately 1.5%, fee income to be down approximately 3% due to elevated third quarter capital markets at MSR levels. Other noninterest income to be in the range of $150 million to $200 million. Taking the component pieces of revenue together, we expect total revenue to be stable to down 1%. We expect noninterest expense to be up between 1% and 2% and we expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be in the range of $200 million to $225 million.\nAnd with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

Welcome to The PNC Financial Services Group Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, it is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Bryan Gill, Executive Vice President and Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Gill, you may now begin.\n\nBryan K. Gill\n\nExecutive Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nWell, good morning. Welcome to today's conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. I am Bryan Gill, the Director of Investor Relations for PNC and participating on this call are PNC's Chairman and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nToday's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of July 16, 2025, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam S. Demchak\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we had a very strong second quarter, fueled by our continued focus on driving growth. We accelerated new customer acquisition, while deepening relationships with existing customers across our businesses. Loan growth increased even through an uncertain macro environment, and we delivered on what we said we would. Our approach to growing our businesses remains consistent. The disciplined way we go to market, bringing the best of PNC's people, products and services to customers across our expanded franchise has continued to produce results. .\nWe reported net income of $1.6 billion or $3.85 per diluted share. During the quarter, loans grew 2%, reflecting strong commercial loan growth fueled by the highest level of new production in 10 quarters. At the same time, we increased revenue 4% while holding noninterest expenses stable, which resulted in another quarter of positive operating leverage and 10% PPNR growth. By now you've seen our stress test results, we maintained our regulatory minimum stress capital buffer of 2.5% and our start to trough capital depletion of 80 basis points was the lowest in our peer group.\nAnd as announced on July 3, our Board increased our common dividend by $0.10 or 6% earlier this month. Rob is going to go through our performance in more detail. But first, I'd like to share some of our business highlights from the quarter. As I mentioned, we continue to see strong results from the execution of our national growth strategy. In C&IB, we saw strong growth in loans and commitments and our credit trends continue to be very good.\nLooking at fees, our capital markets and advisory trends remain solid and as expected, treasury management continues to produce strong results. In Retail Banking, we are accelerating customer growth. Our consumer checking accounts grew by 2% year-over-year, including 6% growth in the Southwest. We also saw record debit and credit card activity this quarter, and we remain on track with our $1.5 billion branch investment, which we plan to open more than 200 branches in our expansion markets.\nWithin our asset management business, we had positive net flows and new client acquisition increased 16% linked quarter. Inside of that, growth in our expansion markets accelerated as discretionary assets under management grew nearly 3x that of legacy markets, albeit off a small base.\nIn closing, we continue to demonstrate the strength of our national franchise and deliver on our objectives. We are poised to further capitalize on our growth potential, and I remain very optimistic about our future. And finally, I just want to take a minute to thank our talented employees for their efforts, which are vital to all of our success and growth. With that, Rob will take you through the quarter. Rob?\n\nRobert Q. Reilly\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. For the linked quarter, loans of $323 billion increased $6 billion or 2%. Investment securities of $142 billion were stable, and our cash balance at the Federal Reserve was $31 billion, a decrease of $3 billion. .\nDeposit balances increased $2 billion and averaged $423 billion, and our borrowings remained stable at $65 billion. At quarter end, AOCI was negative $4.7 billion, an improvement of $555 million or 11% compared with March 31. Our tangible book value increased to approximately $104 per common share, which was a 4% increase linked quarter and a 17% increase compared to the same period a year ago.\nWe remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 10.5% and an estimated CET1 ratio, inclusive of AOCI to be 9.4% at quarter end. We continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility. During the quarter, we returned approximately $1 billion of capital to shareholders, which included $640 million in common dividends and $335 million of share repurchases.\nAs Bill just mentioned, our Board recently approved a $0.10 increase to our quarterly cash dividend on common stock, raising the dividend to $1.70 per share and we expect repurchases in the third quarter to be between $300 million and $400 million. Our recent CCAR results underscore the strength of our balance sheet. And as previously announced, our current stress capital buffer remains at the regulatory minimum of 2.5%.\nSlide 5 shows our loans in more detail. During the second quarter, we delivered solid loan growth. Loan balances averaged $323 billion, an increase of $6 billion or 2% compared to the first quarter. The growth was driven by C&I, which increased $7 billion or 4% reflecting strong new production and higher utilization. Commercial real estate loans declined $1 billion or 4% as we continue to reduce certain exposures. And during the second quarter, our CRE office balances declined $500 million.\nConsumer loans were stable as growth in auto balances was offset by a decline in residential real estate loans. And our total loan yield of 5.7% was stable with the first quarter. Slide 6 details our investment securities and swap portfolios. Average investment securities remained stable at $142 billion. During the second quarter, our securities yield was 3.26%, an increase of 9 basis points. And as of June 30, our duration was estimated to be 3.4 years. Our period-end securities balances increased $5 billion or 3%, reflecting net purchases the majority of which were residential mortgage-backed securities with an average yield of 5.4%.\nRegarding our swaps, active receive fixed rate swaps totaled $40 billion on June 30, with a receive rate of 3.62%, which increased 13 basis points linked quarter. Forward-starting swaps were $16 billion with a receive rate of 4.07% and approximately 40% of these swaps will become active in 2025. Slide 7 covers our deposit balances in more detail. Average deposits increased $2 billion, driven by growth in CDs both brokered and direct with the balance of consumer and commercial deposits remaining stable during the quarter.\nNoninterest-bearing balances increased $1 billion and remained at 22% of total deposits. And our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits stayed essentially flat at 2.24%, up just 1 basis point.\nTurning to Slide 8. We highlight our income statement trends. Comparing the second quarter to the first quarter, total revenue was up $209 million or 4% and noninterest expense was stable, which allowed us to deliver 4% positive operating leverage and 10% growth in PPNR. Provision was $254 million, reflecting the impact of changes in macroeconomic scenarios, tariff considerations and portfolio activity, including loan growth.\nOur effective tax rate was 18.8% and second quarter net income was $1.6 billion or $3.85 per share. In the first half of the year compared to the same time last year, we've demonstrated strong momentum across our franchise. Total revenue increased $557 million or 5%, driven by higher net interest income and fee income growth. Noninterest expense increased $79 million or 1%, reflecting increased business activity, technology investments and higher marketing spend. And net income grew $321 million, resulting in EPS growth of 14%.\nTurning to Slide 9, we detail our revenue trends. Second quarter revenue of $5.7 billion increased $209 million or 4% linked quarter. Net interest income of $3.6 billion increased $79 million or 2%. The growth was driven by higher loan balances, the continued benefit of fixed rate asset repricing and 1 additional day in the quarter. And our net interest margin was 2.8%, an increase of 2 basis points. Noninterest income increased $130 million or 7%. Inside of that, fee income increased $55 million or 3% linked quarter to $1.9 billion.\nLooking at the details, Capital Markets and Advisory revenue increased $15 million, reflecting broad-based increase in capital markets activity, much of which occurred late in the quarter. Card and Cash Management revenue grew $45 million or 7%, driven by seasonally higher consumer spending and growth in treasury management.\nMortgage revenue decreased $6 million or 4%, primarily due to lower residential mortgage servicing activity and other noninterest income of $212 million increased $75 million, primarily reflecting Visa-related activity and other valuation adjustments.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our expenses remained well controlled and were stable linked quarter. Seasonally higher marketing spend and continued technology investments were more than offset by our disciplined expense management. And as we previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $350 million in 2025 through our continuous improvement program. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments, and we're on track to achieve our full year target.\nOur credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Overall, credit quality remained strong with improvements in nonperforming loans, delinquencies and charge-offs. Nonperforming loans of $2.1 billion were down $184 million or 8%, driven by declines in both C&I and commercial real estate nonperforming loans.\nTotal delinquencies of $1.3 billion declined $128 million or 9% compared with March 31, reflecting both lower consumer and commercial delinquencies. Net loan charge-offs were $198 million, down $7 million and represent a net charge-off ratio of 25 basis points. And our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.3 billion or 1.62% of total loans at the end of the second quarter, which included tariff considerations.\nIn summary, PNC reported a solid second quarter, and we're well positioned for the second half of 2025. Regarding our view of the overall economy, we're expecting continued economic growth in the second half of the year, resulting in real GDP growth of approximately 1.5% in 2025 and unemployment to increase to around 4.5% over the next 12 months. We expect the Fed to cut rates once in 2025, with a 25 basis point decrease in December.\nConsidering our reported first half operating results, third quarter expectations and current economic forecast, our full year 2025 guidance is as follows: For the full year 2025 compared to the full year 2024, we expect average loans to be up approximately 1% versus our prior guidance of stable. We expect full year net interest income to increase approximately 7%, up from our previous guidance of up 6% to 7%. We now expect noninterest income to be up approximately 4% to 5%, down slightly from our previous guidance of up 5%, primarily reflecting the continued level of heightened economic uncertainty.\nTaking the component pieces of revenue together, we continue to expect total revenue to be up approximately 6%. We continue to expect noninterest expenses to be up approximately 1%, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. For the third quarter of 2025 compared to the second quarter of 2025, we expect average loans to be up approximately 1%. Net interest income to be approximately up 3%. Fee income to be up between 3% and 4%. Other noninterest income to be in the range of $150 million to $200 million.\nTaking the component pieces of revenue together, we expect total revenue to be up between 2% and 3%. We expect noninterest expense to be up approximately 2%, and we expect third quarter net charge-offs to be in the range of $275 million to $300 million. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

Welcome to today's conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. I am Bryan Gill, the Director of Investor Relations for PNC and participating on this call are PNC's Chairman and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nToday's presentation contains forward-looking information.

Demchak\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, PNC had a strong first quarter of 2025 and but before we go into the results, I want to spend a second just on the current environment.\nObviously, there's been an increased level of volatility due to uncertainty regarding tariffs that has dominated the headlines over the past two weeks, [indiscernible] the markets and raising concerns of a potential recession. As you would expect, we continue to monitor and evaluate the situation, communicating with our clients to gauge their understanding of the potential impact on their businesses in daily lives. However, it's still very early, and the fluidity of the news coming out of Washington makes it difficult to narrow the range of potential outcomes for the broader economy at this point. Irrespective of that outcome, we have demonstrated time and again that we will perform well in periods of uncertainty. The foundation of our success has been built upon the strength of our balance sheet, client selection, our interest rate risk positioning our diversified business mix, leading technology and our people, and that has not changed. As always, we will continue to focus on the things we can control with an emphasis on providing superior products and services to meet the needs of our customers while executing on the organic growth opportunities in front of us. And we saw that play out this quarter as we grew customers and deepened relationships across our coast-to-coast franchise.\nWe delivered another quarter of strong results, generating net income of $1.5 billion or $3.51 per share. While loan growth remained challenging for the industry, we were pleased to see 3% growth in our spot C&I loans as well as strong new commitments during the quarter. As expected, total revenue this quarter was primarily impacted by lower day count and seasonality, but expenses were well controlled and our net interest margin expanded. Importantly, we remain on track to deliver positive operating leverage and achieve record NII for the year. Credit quality is strong, and we remain well reserved. Rob is going to cover that in some more detail in a few minutes. Finally, we continue to build our capital levels during the quarter, while also providing significant shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. In summary, we delivered strong results in the quarter, and we remain well positioned to deliver on our strategic priorities.\nBefore I turn it over to Rob for more detail on our financial results, I'd like to welcome Mark Wiedman who we appointed to the role of President last week. I'm thrilled Mark has joined us in this role. Mark brings deep experience in financial services that will complement the strength of our existing team. I have known Mark for 20 years, and we are fortunate that the timing was right for him to join our team. I'd also like to thank our employees for everything they do for our company and our customers.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to take you through the quarter.\n\nRobert Q. Reilly\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis. For the linked quarter, loans of $317 billion declined $2 billion or 1%. Notably, on a spot basis, loans increased $2 billion or 1% compared to December 31. Investment securities of $142 billion decreased by $2 billion, and our cash balance at the Federal Reserve was $34 billion, a decrease of $3 billion or 9%. Deposit balances declined $5 billion or 1% and average $421 billion. Borrowings of $65 billion were lower primarily due to a reduction in FHLB advances. And at quarter end, AOCI was negative $5.2 billion, an improvement of $1.3 billion or 20% compared with December 31.\nOur tangible book value increased to $100.40 per common share, which was a 5% increase linked quarter and a 17% increase compared to the same period a year ago. We remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 10.6% as of March 31. We estimate our CET1 ratio inclusive of AOCI to be 9.4% at quarter end. And during the first quarter, we returned approximately $800 million of capital to shareholders through both common dividends and share repurchases.\nSlide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Average loan balances of $317 billion declined $2 billion or 1% driven by lower commercial real estate and consumer loans. Importantly, on a period-end basis, total loans grew more than $2 billion or 1% as strong growth in C&I loans was partially offset by continued runoff in the CRE office portfolio and lower consumer balances. C&I loans were $181 billion on March 31, an increase of $5 billion or 3%, reflecting broad growth across loan categories. This represented the largest increase in C&I balances since the fourth quarter of 2022 and was driven by higher utilization rates and new loan production. Regarding utilization, we saw positive trends in the first quarter with increases in each consecutive month and ending the quarter at 50.3% or 80 basis points higher than year-end.\nSlide 5 details our investment securities and swap portfolios. Average investment securities decreased $2 billion to $142 billion as prepayments and maturities outpaced purchases. During the first quarter, our securities yield was stable at 3.17%. And as of March 31, approximately 20% of the portfolio was floating rate and our duration was estimated to be 3.4 years. Our active received fixed rate swaps totaled $39 billion on March 31, and the weighted average receive rate increased 27 basis points linked quarter to 3.49% and up from 2.2% this time last year. Our forward starting swaps now total $20 billion, including $9 billion that were added during the first quarter, which will roll on through 2026. With the addition of these swaps, we've reduced our interest rate sensitivity and further locked in a portion of our fixed rate asset repricing.\nSlide 6 covers our deposit balances in more detail. Average deposits decreased $5 billion or 1% to $421 billion. Consumer and commercial deposits followed seasonal trends Consumer deposits of $210 billion increased $4 billion or 2% and commercial deposits of $206 billion declined $5 billion or 2%. Lastly, we have a small amount of brokered CDs totaling $5 billion, which declined $3 billion as part of our funding plan. Our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits declined 20 basis points during the first quarter to 2.23% and our cumulative deposit beta through March was 51%.\nTurning to Slide 7. We highlight our income statement trends this quarter. First quarter net income was $1.5 billion or $3.51 per share. Compared to the same period a year ago, we've demonstrated strong momentum across our franchise. Total revenue increased $307 million or 6%, driven by higher net interest income and fee growth. Noninterest expense increased $53 million or 2%, reflecting increased business activity, technology investments and higher marketing spend. And net income grew $155 million, resulting in EPS growth of 13% year-over-year. Comparing the first quarter to the fourth quarter, Total revenue of $5.5 billion decreased $115 million or 2% in large part due to seasonality. Noninterest expense of $3.4 billion declined $119 million or 3%. Provision was $219 million, reflecting changes in macroeconomic factors and portfolio activity, and our effective tax rate was 18.8%.\nTurning to Slide 8, we detail our revenue trends. First quarter revenue of $5.5 billion declined $115 million or 2% linked quarter. Net interest income of $3.5 billion decreased $47 million or 1%. The decline was driven by two fewer days in the quarter, partially offset by the benefit of lower funding costs and fixed rate asset repricing. And our net interest margin was 2.78%, an increase of 3 basis points. Fee income of $1.8 billion decreased $30 million or 2% linked quarter.\nLooking at the details. Asset management and brokerage income increased $17 million or 5% driven by higher brokerage client activity and positive net flows. Capital Markets and advisory fees decreased $42 million or 12%, reflecting lower M&A advisory and trading revenue. Card and Cash Management was stable as higher treasury management revenue was offset by seasonally lower consumer spending. Lending and deposit services revenue decreased $14 million or 4% in part due to seasonality. Mortgage revenue increased $12 million or 10%, reflecting higher MSR hedging activity. And our other noninterest income of $137 million decreased $38 million and included $40 million of negative Visa derivative adjustments, primarily related to litigation escrow funding. As a reminder, PNC owns 1.8 million Visa Class B shares with an unrecognized gain of approximately $950 million as of March 31.\nTurning to Slide 9, we detail our noninterest expense trends. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense declined $119 million or 3% as a result of fourth quarter asset impairments as well as seasonality. We remain focused on expense management. And as we've previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $350 million in 2025 through our continuous improvement program. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments, and we're confident we will achieve our full year target.\nOur credit metrics are presented on Slide 10. Nonperforming loans of $2.3 billion were stable quarter-over-quarter with a small decrease in consumer. Total delinquencies of $1.4 billion were up $49 million or 4% compared with December 31, which included approximately $55 million of California wildfire forbearance activity. Net loan charge-offs were $205 million, down $45 million representing a net charge-off ratio of 26 basis points. The decline was largely driven by lower CRE office charge-offs related to the timing of resolution on certain office properties and we expect the level to vary quarter-to-quarter as we work through these loans. Importantly, our overall credit quality remains strong across our portfolio, and our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.2 billion or 1.64% of total loans at the end of the first quarter. This level of reserves includes an increase in the downside weightings of our CECL economic scenarios along with some considerations for tariffs.\nAs you know, the proposed tariffs on April 2 were more severe than anticipated. If these tariffs are implemented as proposed and remain in effect for an extended period, it's quite possible the probability of a recession will go up. We're actively assessing our portfolios and analyzing a wide range of factors, both positive and negative, that could impact our commercial and consumer exposures. However, we view the current environment is too fluid to reasonably change our estimates at this time.\nIn summary, PNC reported a solid first quarter, and we're well positioned for the remainder of 2025. Our full year guidance is unchanged. However, given the uncertainty of the proposed tariffs and the potential for disruption and client activity, our noninterest income could be pressured throughout the balance of the year and we'll obviously closely monitor this as these factors continue to develop. For the full year 2025 compared to the full year 2024, we expect average loans to be stable which equates to spot loan growth of 2% to 3%. We expect full year net interest income to be up 6% to 7%. We expect noninterest income to be up approximately 5%. Taking the component pieces of revenue together, we expect total revenue to be up approximately 6%. We expect noninterest expenses to be up approximately 1%, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. For the second quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2025, we expect average loans to be up approximately 1%. Net interest income to be up 1% to 2%, and fee income to be up 1% to 3%, other noninterest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million. Taking the component pieces of revenue together, we expect total revenue to be up 1% to 3%. We expect noninterest expense to be stable, and we expect second quarter net charge-offs to be approximately $300 million.\nAnd with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Bryan Gill, Executive Vice President and Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nBryan K. Gill\n\nExecutive Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nHello. Good morning, and welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. I am Bryan Gill, the Director of Investor Relations for PNC and participating on this call are PNC's Chairman and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nToday's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of January 16, 2025, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam S. Demchak\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we had a solid fourth quarter and a very strong year. For the full year 2024, we earned $6 billion or $13.74 per share. We executed well against our priorities and continue to gain momentum across our franchise. While loan demand remained soft throughout the year, our net interest income benefited meaningfully from fixed asset repricing, and we expect to see further tailwinds from repricing over the next couple of years. We grew fee income by 6% and we achieved record revenue.\nAt the same time, we maintained our expense discipline, allowing us to deliver positive operating leverage, which as an aside and you will recall, that looked pretty much out of reach at the start of 2024. Finally, we grew capital and increased our tangible book value per share by 12% compared to last year while returning $3 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.\nAnd Rob is going to walk through the financial results in more detail, but I wanted to take just a moment to reflect on the strength of PNC's positioning as we head into 2025. Our businesses are performing exceptionally well, and we continue to see positive momentum, particularly in our expansion markets. C&IB had record revenue in noninterest income in 2024 as new client growth continued at an accelerated rate. Our sales in our expansion markets grew 26% with over 60% of those sales being noncredit.\nIn retail banking, consumer DDA growth in 2024 was the highest it's been in 8 years, and we produced record brokerage revenue at PNC investments and the Asset Management Group delivered its strongest level of positive net flows in years. Going forward, we're investing in new products and an expanded footprint to further accelerate our momentum. We will soon be rolling out our new online banking platform. We are doubling our new branch builds to gain scale in some of the fastest-growing regions in the country. And on the corporate side, we recently announced our entry into the Salt Lake City market.\nAs Rob will highlight, our forward guidance solidly points to record NII in 2025 as well as strong fee income growth across our franchise. This, combined with our ongoing expense discipline, positions us to deliver meaningful positive operating leverage this year. While there are a lot of uncertainties regarding the outlook for the economy, interest rates, the regulatory environment, we believe that PNC's balance sheet is well positioned. We are adequately reserved for our credit risk, and our strong capital levels provide substantial flexibility as we enter 2025.\nBefore wrapping up, I'd like to spend just a moment to express our sympathies to those who have been impacted by the wildfires. PNC is, of course, committed to supporting our customers, our communities, and importantly, the more than 200 employees we have in the affected areas. I also want to thank our employees for everything they do for our company and our customers. We accomplished a significant amount in 2024, and we're entering 2025 with a lot of momentum. I've never been more excited about the opportunities in front of us to continue to grow our franchise and to deliver for our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to take you through the numbers. Rob?\n\nRobert Q. Reilly\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. For the linked quarter, loans of $319 billion were stable, investment securities increased by $2 billion, and our cash balances at the Federal Reserve were $38 billion, a decrease of $7 billion or 16%. Deposit balances grew $3 billion and averaged $425 billion. Borrowed funds decreased $9 billion or 12%, primarily due to the maturity of FHLB advances.\nAt quarter end, AOCI was negative $6.6 billion compared to negative $5.1 billion as of September 30, reflecting the impact of higher rates. Our tangible book value was $95.33 per common share, which was a slight decline linked quarter due to the decrease in AOCI but a 12% increase compared to the same period a year ago. We remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 10.5% as of December 31. And we estimate our revised standardized ratio, which includes AOCI, to be 9.2% at quarter end. We continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility. We returned approximately $900 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter through both common dividends and share repurchases.\nSlide 5 shows our loans in more detail. Average loan balances of $319 billion were stable compared to the third quarter. And the yield on total loans decreased 26 basis points to 5.87% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by lower short-term rates. Consumer loans averaged $100 billion and were essentially flat linked quarter as growth in auto was offset by a decline in residential real estate. Commercial loans of $219 billion were stable as growth in C&IB and leasing balances was offset by a $1 billion decline in commercial real estate loans. On a period-end basis, commercial loans declined roughly $5 billion, reflecting both lower CRE balances and utilization rates.\nSlide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Overall, we continue to be relatively neutral to changes in interest rates in 2025, and we continue to manage our fixed and floating rate assets to reduce interest rate sensitivity in future years. Average investment securities of $144 billion increased $2 billion as purchases more than offset runoff in maturities. During the quarter, we continued to add floating rate securities and our total portfolio is now 20% floating compared to 6% a year ago. The majority of our floating rate securities are designated as available for sale and as a result, comprise approximately 40% of our AFS portfolio.\nAlso, floating rate securities are a higher-yielding alternative to excess cash at the Federal Reserve. The yield on our securities portfolio increased 9 basis points to 3.17%, driven by higher rates on new purchases and the runoff of lower-yielding securities. And as of December 31, the duration of our securities portfolio was approximately 3.4 years. Our received fixed rate swaps pointed to the commercial loan book totaled $50 billion on December 31 comprised of $37 billion of active swaps and $13 billion of forward starting swaps. The weighted average received rate on the active swaps increased 14 basis points linked quarter to 3.22%.\nLooking forward, we expect considerable runoff in our short-term duration securities and swap portfolios, which will allow us to continue to reinvest into higher-yielding assets. Accordingly, AOCI will accrete back with maturities, resulting in continued growth to tangible book value. A full update on the expected maturities and AOCI burn-down is provided in the appendix.\nSlide 7 covers our deposit balances in more detail. Average deposits increased $3 billion or 1%, reflecting continued growth in interest-bearing commercial balances, partially offset by lower consumer brokered CD balances. Regarding mix, noninterest-bearing deposits were stable at $96 billion and remained at 23% of total average deposits. Our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits declined 29 basis points during the fourth quarter to 2.43%, reflecting pricing actions commensurate with the Fed rate cuts. Our cumulative deposit beta through December was 47%, and going forward, we expect our beta to be in the high 40% range during the anticipated rate-cutting cycle.\nTurning to Slide 8, we highlight our income statement trends and a few notable items this quarter. Fourth quarter net income was $1.6 billion or $3.77 per share. Comparing the fourth quarter to the third quarter, total revenue of $5.6 billion increased $135 million or 2%. Net interest income grew by $113 million or 3%, and our net interest margin was 2.75%, an increase of 11 basis points. Noninterest income of $2 billion increased 1%. Noninterest expense of $3.5 billion increased $179 million or 5%. The increase included noncore items netting to $79 million pretax or $62 million after tax, which I'll provide more detail on in a few moments.\nProvision was $156 million, reflecting improved macroeconomic factors and portfolio activity. And our effective tax rate was 14.6%, which included $60 million of income tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax matters.\nTurning to Slide 9, we highlight our revenue trends. On a full year basis, we generated record revenue of $21.6 billion as lower net interest income was more than offset by 6% growth in noninterest income. Looking at the linked quarter comparison, revenue increased $135 million, driven by higher net interest income. Net interest income of $3.5 billion increased $113 million or 3%, driven by lower funding costs and the continued benefit of fixed rate asset repricing. Fee income was $1.9 billion and decreased $84 million or 4% linked quarter.\nLooking at the detail, asset management and brokerage income declined $9 million or 2%, reflecting lower annuity sales, partially offset by the benefit of higher average equity markets. Capital markets and advisory fees decreased $23 million or 6%, reflecting elevated third quarter activity. Card and cash management fees were stable as higher treasury management revenue was offset by credit card origination incentives. Lending and deposit services revenue grew $10 million or 3% due to increased customer activity. Mortgage revenue declined $59 million linked quarter, primarily due to elevated RMSR hedge gains in the third quarter. And our other noninterest income increased $106 million, reflecting a less negative impact from Visa derivative activity.\nTurning to Slide 10. Full year noninterest expense decreased by $488 million or 3%. Core noninterest expense was down $152 million or 1% compared to 2023. As a result, we generated positive operating leverage on a reported basis as well as adjusted for noncore expenses. Fourth quarter noninterest expense of $3.5 billion increased $179 million or 5%. As I mentioned, the quarter included $79 million of noncore expenses, which reflected $97 million of asset impairments, partially offset by an $18 million reduction to the FDIC special assessment. The asset impairments included a number of items and were primarily related to various technology investments.\nCore noninterest expense increased $100 million or 3% linked quarter, largely due to seasonality and higher marketing spend. As you know, we had a 2024 goal of $450 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, which we exceeded. Looking forward to 2025, our annual CIP target is $350 million. And this program will continue to fund a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments.\nOur credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Nonperforming loans decreased $252 million or 10% linked quarter, driven by lower C&I and CRE NPLs. Total delinquencies of $1.4 billion were up $107 million or 8% compared with September 30. The increase was primarily driven by commercial loan delinquencies, the majority of which have already been or are in the process of being resolved. Net loan charge-offs were $250 million. The $36 million linked quarter decrease was driven by lower office CRE charge-offs and higher commercial recoveries. And our annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 31 basis points. Our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.2 billion or 1.64% of total loans on December 31, down 1 basis point from September 30.\nSlide 12 provides more detail on our CRE office portfolio. Our office CRE balances declined 7% or approximately $500 million linked quarter as we continue to manage our exposure down. Criticized loans and nonperforming balances also declined as paydowns and charge-offs outpaced new inflows during the quarter. Net loan charge-offs within the CRE office portfolio were $62 million, down from $95 million in the third quarter. Despite this decline, we continue to see stress in the office portfolio, given the challenges inherent in this book and the lack of demand for office properties. As a result, we expect additional charge-offs, the size of which will vary quarter-to-quarter, given the nature of the loans.\nOur reserves on the office portfolio increased to 13% as of December 31, up from 11% the prior quarter. The increases in reserves reflects the continued valuation adjustments across the portfolio. Accordingly, we believe we are adequately reserved. In summary, PNC reported a solid fourth quarter, which contributed to an overall successful 2024 and we're well positioned for 2025. Regarding our view of the overall economy, we're expecting continued economic growth over the course of 2025, resulting in approximately 2% real GDP growth and unemployment to remain slightly above 4% through year-end.\nWe expect the Fed to cut rates 2 times in 2025 with a 25 basis point decrease in March and another in June. Looking ahead, our outlook for full year 2025 compared to 2024 results is as follows. In regard to loan growth, while a lot of indications point to accelerated growth, we've not built that into our guidance. As a result, our guidance reflects spot loan growth of 2% to 3%, which equates to stable average full year loans. We expect total revenue to be up approximately 6%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be up 6% to 7% and noninterest income to be up approximately 5%. Noninterest expense to be up approximately 1%, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. Based on this guidance, we expect we will generate substantial positive operating leverage in 2025.\nOur outlook for the first quarter of 2025 compared to the fourth quarter of 2024 is as follows: we expect average loans to be down approximately 1%; net interest income to be down 2% to 3%, which includes the impact of 2 fewer days in the quarter; fee income to be stable; other noninterest income to be in the range of $150 million to $200 million, excluding Visa activity. Taking the component pieces of revenue together, we expect total revenue to be down 1% to 2%. We expect total noninterest expense to be down 2% to 3%, and we expect first quarter net charge-offs to be approximately $300 million. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Gill. Thank you, Bryan. You may begin.\n\nBryan K. Gill\n\nExecutive Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nWell, good morning, and welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. I am Bryan Gill, the Director of Investor Relations for PNC and participating on this call are PNC's Chairman and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of July 16, 2024, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam S. Demchak\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we had a strong second quarter, and we generated $1.5 billion in net income or $3.39 diluted earnings per share. Our results included a gain on a portion of our Visa Class B shares, which was substantially offset by other items in the quarter, including the securities repositioning. Rob is going to provide more details on that Visa gain financial results and outlook in a second, but I'll highlight a few items. .\nFirst off, net interest income has moved past its trough, and both NII and NIM grew in the quarter. And by the way, this would have occurred independent of the $10 million impact that we got from the securities repositioning. Importantly, we are on a growth trajectory towards expected record NII in 2025. We continue to add new customers and see strong business momentum across our franchise, particularly in the new and expansion markets. DDA growth accelerated in our branches, and we continue to add new corporate and commercial banking clients above historical rates.\nIn our retail business, we launched our first new credit card in several years, PNC Cash Unlimited, a highly competitive card that offers 2% back on all purchases. We plan to launch several new cards in the months and year ahead. Average deposits held relatively flat to the first quarter levels, a little bit ahead of our expectations and our expenses remained well controlled, and we generated positive operating leverage during the second quarter. Rob is going to touch on this in a minute, but we have increased our continuous improvement program target for 2024 as expense discipline remains a top priority.\nThe credit environment continues to play out as we have expected, including an increase in charge-offs within the CRE office portfolio where we remain adequately reserved. Outside of CRE office, credit quality remains relatively stable. Finally, we further strengthened our capital levels during the quarter. Our strong balance sheet allows us to continue supporting our customers and communities, investing in our business and people and delivering returns for shareholders.\nOur financial strength and stability are also reflected in the latest results from the Fed stress test in which we maintained our stress capital buffer at the regulatory minimum of 2.5%. And importantly, for the second year in a row, PNC has had the lowest start-to-trough capital depletion in our peer group, further demonstrating our best-in-class resiliency. With this in mind, our Board recently approved an increase in our quarterly stock dividend by $0.05.\nIn summary, we delivered strong results in the second quarter and are well positioned to drive further growth and expansion into 2025 and beyond. Before I turn it over to Rob, as always, I just want to thank our employees for everything they do for our company and our customers. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to take you through the quarter. Rob?\n\nRobert Q. Reilly\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average linked quarter basis. Loans of $320 billion were stable. Investment securities increased $6 billion or 4%, and our cash balances at the Federal Reserve were $41 billion, a decrease of $7 billion or 15%, primarily reflecting the deployment of cash into higher-yielding securities. Deposit balances averaged $417 billion, a decline of $3 billion or less than 1% due to a seasonal decline in corporate balances.\nBorrowed funds increased $2 billion or 2% and were 15% of total liabilities. At quarter end, AOCI was negative $7.4 billion and improved $600 million compared with March 31. Our tangible book value increased $89.12 per common share, a 4% increase linked quarter and a 15% increase compared to the same period a year ago. We remain well capitalized and our estimated CET1 ratio increased to 10.2% as of June 30.\nRegarding the Basel III end game, we expect the inclusion of AOCI in the final rule and our CET1 ratio with the impact of AOCI would be 8.7%. And while we recognize the likelihood of changes to certain other aspects of the Basel III endgame NPR, under the currently proposed capital rules, our estimated fully phased-in expanded risk-based CET1 ratio would be approximately 8.4%. We continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility. We returned roughly $700 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter, which included $600 million in common dividends and $100 million of share repurchases.\nAnd as Bill just mentioned, our Board recently approved a $0.05 increase to our quarterly cash dividend on common stock, raising the dividend to $1.60 per share. Our recent CCAR results underscore the strength of our balance sheet. And as previously announced, our current stress capital buffer remains at the regulatory minimum of 2.5% for the 4-quarter period beginning in October 2024.\nSlide 5 shows our loans in more detail. Compared to the first quarter, average loan balances were stable. Commercial loans were essentially flat as utilization remains well below both the pre-pandemic historical average of roughly 55% and the second quarter 2023 level of 52.5%. Importantly, we continue to grow customer relationships and C&IB loan commitments increased during the second quarter.\nAlthough the direction of the near-term economy remains uncertain, CapEx to sales levels and inventory growth rates remain below historical averages, both of which are typically leading indicators of eventual commercial loan growth. Average consumer loans declined approximately $600 million or less than 1%, driven by lower residential real estate and home equity loan balances. And the yield on total loans increased 4 basis points to 6.05% in the second quarter.\nSlide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $141 billion increased $6 billion or 4%, reflecting the deployment of excess liquidity into higher-yielding securities, primarily U.S. treasuries. The securities portfolio yield increased 22 basis points to 2.84% driven by higher rates on new purchases. As of June 30, the securities portfolio duration was 3.5 years. During the second quarter, our forward starting swaps increased to $18 billion. With the addition of these swaps, we've locked in a portion of our fixed rate asset repricing through 2025 at a level that is approximately 300 basis points higher than maturities.\nThe total weighted average received fixed rate of our swap portfolio, including the forward starters, increased 83 basis points to 3.13%, and the duration of the portfolio is 2.2 years. Slide 7 highlights the securities repositioning we executed during the second quarter. We sold securities with a book value of $4.3 billion, and a market value of $3.8 billion. We recognized a $497 million loss on the sale and reinvested the $3.8 billion of proceeds into securities with yields approximately 400 basis points higher than the securities sold.\nThe repositioning is expected to benefit our net interest income by $80 million in 2024 with roughly $10 million of that being realized in the second quarter. And the estimated earn-back period for this transaction is less than 4 years. Turning to Slide 8. We expect considerable runoff of low-yielding securities and swaps through the end of 2026, which will allow us to continue to reinvest into higher-yielding assets, providing a meaningful benefit to net interest income.\nAccumulated other comprehensive income improved to negative $7.4 billion on June 30 compared to negative $8 billion on March 31. The improvement was primarily due to the securities repositioning. AOCI will continue to accrete back as our securities and swaps mature, resulting in further growth to tangible book value.\nSlide 9 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits declined $3 billion or 1%, reflecting seasonally lower corporate balances. Regarding mix, consolidated noninterest-bearing deposits were 23% of total deposits in the second quarter, down less than 1 percentage point from the first quarter. Additionally, average noninterest-bearing deposits had the smallest dollar decline in the second quarter of 2024 since the Fed began raising rates in 2022, which gives us confidence that the noninterest-bearing portion of our deposits has largely stabilized.\nAnd our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased by only 1 basis point during the second quarter to 2.61%. We believe our rate paid on deposits is approaching its peak level, but we do expect some potential drift higher as interest rates remain elevated. Turning to the income statement. And as Bill mentioned, there were several significant items in the quarter, and I want to provide a bit more detail.\nTaken together, these significant items have a minimal impact to our earnings per share totaling to a net EPS benefit of $0.09. As we've previously disclosed, we participated in the Visa Exchange program, allowing us to monetize 50% of our Visa Class [ B1 ] shares and convert our remaining holdings to 1.8 million Visa Class B2 shares. Through the exchange, we recognized a $754 million pretax gain. In addition, we had significant items that occurred in the second quarter that largely offset the gain and they are as follows:\nFirst, as I mentioned earlier, we repositioned a portion of our securities portfolio and through the sale of certain low-yielding securities recognized a $497 million loss. Second, we recorded a negative $116 million Visa derivative fair value adjustment associated with Visa Class B2 shares, primarily related to the extension of anticipated litigation resolution. And lastly, we recognized $120 million PNC Foundation contribution expense. The foundation supports our communities and early childhood education.\nTurning to Slide 11. we highlight our income statement trends. Second quarter net income was $1.5 billion or $3.39 per share. Total revenue of $5.4 billion increased $266 million or 5% compared to the first quarter of 2024. Net interest income grew by $38 million or 1% in the second quarter. Notably, this is the first time NII has increased in 6 quarters, marking in the beginning of an expected upward trajectory.\nAnd our net interest margin was 2.6%, an increase of 3 basis points. Noninterest income increased $228 million or 12% and included $141 million of the significant items I previously detailed. Noninterest expense of $3.4 billion increased $23 million or 1% and included the $120 million foundation contribution expense. Notably, we generated positive operating leverage in both the linked quarter and year-over-year comparisons.\nProvision was $235 million in the second quarter, reflecting portfolio activity, and our effective tax rate was 18.8%. Turning to Slide 12. We highlight our revenue trends. Second quarter revenue was up $266 million or 5%, driven by higher noninterest income and net interest income. Net interest income of $3.3 billion increased $38 million or 1%, driven by higher yields on interest-earning assets.\nFee income was $1.8 billion and increased $31 million or 2% linked quarter. Looking at the detail. Asset management and brokerage noninterest income was stable linked quarter as the benefit of higher average equity markets was offset by lower annuity sales due to elevated first quarter activity. Capital Markets and advisory fees increased $13 million or 5%, driven by higher M&A advisory activity and loan syndications, partially offset by lower underwriting fees.\nCard and cash management increased $35 million or 5%, reflecting seasonally higher consumer transaction volumes and higher treasury management fees. Mortgage revenue declined $16 million or 11%, primarily due to lower residential mortgage activity. Other noninterest income of $332 million increased $197 million and included $141 million related to this quarter's significant items.\nTurning to Slide 13. Our noninterest expense of $3.4 billion was well controlled, increasing by only $23 million or 1%. Expenses for the second quarter included the $120 million contribution to the PNC Foundation, while the first quarter of 2024 included $130 million FDIC special assessment. Importantly, noninterest expense, excluding the foundation contribution declined $135 million or 4% compared with the second quarter of 2023.\nNotably, personnel declined as a result of the workforce reduction actions we took last year. As Bill mentioned, we remain diligent in our continuous improvement efforts. At the beginning of the year, we set a continuous improvement program goal of $425 million. Recently, we have identified initiatives that support increasing our CIP by an additional $25 million, raising our full year target to $450 million. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments.\nOur credit metrics are presented on Slide 14. Nonperforming loans increased $123 million or 5% linked quarter, primarily driven by an individual secured loan within our asset-based lending business. Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion were stable with March 31. Net loan charge-offs were $262 million in the second quarter and included $106 million of net charge-offs related to our CRE office portfolio. And our annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 33 basis points.\nOur allowance for credit losses totaled $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans on June 30, stable with March 31. Slide 15 provides more detail on our CRE office credit metrics. CRE office NPLs were stable in the second quarter as charge-offs and paydowns offset inflows to nonperforming loans. And the migration of criticized loans to nonperforming status is an expected outcome as we work to resolve the challenges inherent to this portfolio.\nAs expected, net loan charge-offs within the CRE office portfolio increased and totaled $106 million in the second quarter. Ultimately, we expect additional charge-offs on this portfolio, the size of which will vary quarter-to-quarter given the nature of the loans. As of June 30, our reserves on the office portfolio were 10.3% of total office loans and [ inside of that ], 15.5% on the multi-tenant portfolio. Accordingly, we believe we're adequately reserved. Importantly, we continue to manage our exposure down. And as a result, our balances declined 4% or approximately $300 million linked quarter.\nIn summary, PNC posted a solid second quarter 2024, and we're well positioned for the second half of the year. Regarding our view of the overall economy, we're expecting continued economic growth in the second half of the year, resulting in real GDP growth of approximately 2% in 2024 and unemployment to increase modestly to slightly above 4% by year-end. We expect the Fed to cut rates 2 times in 2024 with a 25 basis point decrease in September and another in December.\nLooking at the third quarter of 2024, compared to the second quarter of 2024, we expect average loans to be stable. Net interest income to be up 1% to 2%, fee income to be up 1% to 2%. Other noninterest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million, excluding Visa and securities activity. We expect core noninterest expense to be up 3% to 4%. We expect third quarter net charge-offs to be between $250 million and $300 million.\nRegarding our full year guidance, for ease of comparability to prior guidance, we exclude the first quarter FDIC special assessment as well as the second quarter Visa gain and other significant items. Considering our reported first half operating results, third quarter expectations and current economic forecasts, our full year 2024 guidance is as follows: For the full year 2024 compared to full year 2023, we expect average loans to be down less than 1%, which equates phenomenal loan growth in the second half of 2024.\nWe recognize the potential for greater loan growth and should that occur, it will be accretive to our full year average. Despite lower expected loan volumes, we expect full year NII to be at the better end of our previous expectations or down approximately 4%. We expect our securities repositioning and better-than-expected deposit dynamics to offset the impact of the lower-than-expected loan volume. We expect noninterest income to be up 3% to 5%, slightly lower than our previous guidance due to continued softness in mortgage activity. and, to a lesser extent, loan-related capital markets fees.\nAs a result, total revenue is expected to be down 1% to 2% and inside the range of our previous guidance. We now expect core noninterest expense to be down approximately 1% versus our previous guidance of stable, in part due to our increased CIP target, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18.5%. With that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Gill. Thank you, Bryan. You may begin.\n\nBryan K. Gill\n\nExecutive Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nWell, good morning, and welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. I am Bryan Gill, the Director of Investor Relations for PNC and participating on this call are PNC's Chairman and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nToday's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of April 16, 2024, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam S. Demchak\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we executed well and delivered solid financial results. We generated $1.3 billion in net income and adjusting for the FDIC special assessment, $3.36 per share. Rob will provide details on our results in a moment, but I'll start with a few thoughts. First, we continue to grow our business. .\nIn the first quarter, we added new customers across our segments and increased deposits on a spot basis. We're continuing to invest heavily in our franchise to drive growth and gain share, particularly in our retail banking technology platform, our payments businesses and our expansion markets. To that end, in the first quarter, we announced a multiyear investment of nearly $1 billion in our branch network to renovate more than 1,200 locations and open new branches in key locations, including Austin, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Miami and San Antonio.\nSecond, expenses were well managed during the quarter. As we've indicated, expense discipline remains a top priority, and we are on track to maintain stable core expenses in 2024. Third, credit quality remained stable during the quarter. The office portfolio remains an area of focus, but we are adequately reserved overall and particularly with respect to CRE. We believe our thoughtful approach to managing risk, customer selection and long-term relationship development will continue to serve us well. And fourth, we continue to build on our strong liquidity and capital position during the quarter, providing us with the financial strength and flexibility to help us support our clients, grow our businesses and capitalize on future opportunities.\nIn summary, we delivered solid results during the first quarter and positioned ourselves well for the balance of 2024 and beyond. Last month, we launched a brand campaign celebrating our [ boring ] approach to banking. Now obviously, we're using humor in the campaign to have a little fun and grab the public's attention. But inside of that humor is honestly about who we are, how we think about risk and how we run our company. In short, it is everything we do to be steady and predictable. Finally, I just want to thank our employees for everything they do for our customers, for each other and for all of our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to take you through the quarter. Rob?\n\nRobert Q. Reilly\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average linked-quarter basis. Loans of $321 billion decreased $4 billion or 1%. Investment securities declined $2 billion or 1%. And our cash balances at the Federal Reserve were $48 billion, an increase of $6 billion or 13%. On a spot basis, our cash at the Fed was $53 billion, up from $43 billion in the prior quarter, reflecting higher period-end deposits. Deposit balances averaged $420 billion, a decline of $4 billion or 1%, reflecting seasonally lower commercial deposits. However, on a spot basis, deposits were up $4 billion, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer deposits. .\nBorrowed funds increased $3 billion to $76 billion, primarily driven by parent company debt issuances early in the quarter. At quarter end, AOCI was a negative $8 billion compared to a negative $7.7 billion at December 31, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates. Our tangible book value increased to $85.70 per common share, an 11% increase compared to the same period a year ago. We remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 10.1% as of March 31.\nWhile we recognize the likelihood of potentially substantial changes to the Basel III endgame NPR, under the currently proposed capital rules, our estimated fully phased-in expanded risk-based CET1 ratio would be approximately 8.3% as of March 31, 2024. We continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility, share repurchases approximated $135 million or roughly 1 million shares. And when combined with $624 million of common dividends, we returned $759 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter.\nSlide 5 shows our loans in more detail. Compared to the fourth quarter, average loan balances decreased 1%, primarily driven by lower commercial loan balances. Commercial loans were $219 billion, a decrease of $3.4 billion, driven by lower utilization as well as soft loan demand. Within the corporate and Institutional bank, utilization rates have remained below 2023 year-end levels and have not increased in the first quarter as is historically typical.\nWe expect utilization to increase throughout the year. Notably, each percent of utilization within [ C&IB ] equates to $4 billion of loan growth. Consumer loans declined approximately $600 million, driven by lower credit card and home equity balances. And total loan yields increased 7 basis points to 6.01% in the first quarter. Slide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $135 billion decreased 1% as curtailed purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities.\nThe securities portfolio yield increased 3 basis points to 2.62% reflecting the runoff of lower-yielding securities. As of March 31, the securities portfolio duration was 4 years. Our received fixed swaps pointed to the commercial loan book totaled $37 billion on March 31. The weighted average received fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased 20 basis points to 2.3%, and the duration of the portfolio was 2 years. Through the end of 2024, 13% of our securities and swap portfolio is scheduled to mature, which will allow us to reinvest into higher-yielding assets, providing a meaningful benefit to net interest income in the second half of the year.\nAccumulated other comprehensive income was negative $8 billion at March 31, which will accrete back as our securities and swaps mature, resulting in continued tangible book value growth. Slide 7 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits decreased $4 billion to $420 billion during the quarter as growth in consumer deposits was more than offset by a seasonal decline in commercial deposits. Regarding mix, consolidated, noninterest-bearing deposits were 24% in the first quarter, down slightly from 25% in the fourth quarter.\nNotably, on a spot basis in the first quarter, noninterest-bearing deposits had the smallest dollar decline since the Fed began raising rates in 2022, which gives us confidence that the noninterest-bearing portion of our deposits has largely stabilized. Our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 2.6% during the first quarter, up from 2.48% in the prior quarter. And as of March 31, our cumulative deposit beta was 45% and consistent with our expectations.\nWe believe our deposit betas have approached their peak levels, although we do expect some potential drift higher through the period leading up to a Fed rate cut, which we currently expect to occur in July. In regard to the timing and amount of potential rate cuts, we recognize there's a lot of fluidity and uncertainty. However, our 2024 NII will largely be unaffected by any short-term interest rate movement or lack thereof. This is because our floating rate assets are aligned with our floating rate liabilities, including our high beta commercial interest-bearing deposits and our long-term debt, which is almost entirely swapped to floating rates.\nImportantly, going forward, we remain well positioned for the NII benefit of repricing low-yielding fixed rate securities and loans maturing during the latter half of 2024 and into 2025. Turning to the income statement on Slide 8. First quarter net income was $1.3 billion or $3.10 per share, which included a pretax noncore noninterest expense of $130 million or $103 million after tax related to the increased FDIC special assessment. Excluding noncore expenses, adjusted EPS was $3.36 per share. Total revenue of $5.1 billion decreased $216 million or 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Net interest income declined by $139 million or 4%. And our net interest margin was 2.57%, a decline of 9 basis points, resulting primarily from higher funding costs. Noninterest income decreased $77 million or 4%. And Noninterest expense of $3.3 billion declined $740 million or 18% and included $130 million FDIC special assessment. Importantly, Certainly, core noninterest expense was $3.2 billion and decreased $205 million or 6%.\nProvision was $155 million in the first quarter, reflecting portfolio activity and improved macroeconomic factors. And our effective tax rate was 18.8% Turning to Slide 9. We highlight our revenue trends. First quarter revenue was down $216 million or 4%, driven by lower net interest income and in part a seasonal decline in fee income. Net interest income of $3.3 billion declined $139 million or 4%, reflecting increased funding costs, lower loan balances and 1 less day in the quarter. Fee income was $1.7 billion and decreased $74 million or 4% linked quarter.\nLooking at the detail. Asset management and brokerage revenue was up $4 million or 1%, reflecting higher average equity markets. Capital markets and advisory fees declined $50 million or 16%, driven by lower M&A advisory activity, off elevated fourth quarter levels, partially offset by higher underwriting fees. Card and Cash Management decreased $17 million or 2% driven by seasonally lower consumer transaction volumes, partially offset by higher treasury management fees. Lending and deposit-related fees declined $9 million or 3%, reflecting the reduction of customer fees on certain checking products.\nResidential and commercial mortgage revenue declined $2 million or 1% and included lower residential mortgage activity. Other noninterest income of $135 million decreased $3 million or 2%, reflecting lower gains on sales. The first quarter also included a negative $7 million Visa fair value adjustment compared to a negative $100 million adjustment in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our core noninterest expense of $3.2 billion, decreased $205 million or 6% linked quarter, reflecting strong expense management. Importantly, compared to the first quarter of 2023, core noninterest expense declined $117 million or 4%, with a decline in every expense category. This broad-based result reflects the impact of expense actions taken in 2023. As we previously stated, we implemented expense management actions that will drive $750 million of cost savings in 2024. These actions include the $325 million workforce reduction effort last year, which was realized in our first quarter expense run rate and our $425 million 2024 continuous improvement program goal, which we're well on track to achieve.\nWe remain diligent in our expense management efforts, and these actions give us confidence that we'll keep our year-over-year expenses stable. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. While overall credit quality remains resilient, the pressure we anticipated within the commercial real estate office sector has continued. Nonperforming loans increased $200 million or 9% linked quarter, almost entirely driven by commercial real estate, which increased $188 million. And inside of that, approximately $150 million was related to the CRE office portfolio.\nTotal delinquencies of $1.3 billion decreased $109 million or 8% linked quarter, driven by lower consumer and commercial delinquency. Net loan charge-offs were $243 million in the first quarter, and our annualized net charge-off to average loans ratio was 30 basis points. Our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans on March 31, stable at December 31.\nSlide 12 provides more detail on our CRE office credit metrics. While NPLs have increased over the past few quarters, our criticized balances have remained relatively consistent. The migration of criticized loans to nonperforming status is an expected outcome as we work to resolve the occupancy and rate challenges inherent to this portfolio. In the first quarter, net loan charge-offs within the CRE office portfolio were $50 million, essentially in line with the previous quarter level.\nUltimately, we expect continued charge-offs on this portfolio. And accordingly, we believe we are adequately reserved. As of March 31, our reserves on the office portfolio were 9.7% of total office loans. And inside of that, 14.4% on the multi-tenant portfolio. Importantly, we continue to manage our exposure down. And as a result, our balances declined 3% or approximately $200 million linked quarter.\nIn summary, PNC reported a solid first quarter 2024, and we're well positioned for the remainder of the year. Regarding our view of the overall economy, we're expecting economic expansion in the second half of the year, resulting in real GDP growth of approximately 2% in 2024 and unemployment to increase modestly to 4% by year-end. We expect the Fed to cut rates 2x in 2024 with a 25 basis point decrease in July and another in November.\nLooking at the second quarter of 2024, compared to the first quarter of 2024, we expect average loans to be stable. Net interest income to be down approximately 1%. And as I mentioned previously, we expect NII and net interest margin to trough in the second quarter. Fee income to be up 1% to 2%, other noninterest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million, excluding Visa activity.\nTaking the component pieces of revenue together, we expect total revenue to be stable. We expect total core noninterest expense to be up 2% to 4%. We expect second quarter net charge-offs to be between $225 million and $275 million. As a reminder, P&C owns 3.5 million Visa Class B shares with an unrecognized gain of approximately $1.6 billion. Under the terms of Visa's current exchange program scheduled to close on or about May 3, Class B shareholders will have the opportunity to monetize 50% of their holdings. We've not included the impact of monetizing the Visa gain in our forecast.\nTurning to Slide 14. Our full year 2024 guidance is unchanged from our January earnings call. And as a reminder, for the full year 2024 compared to the full year 2023, we expect average loan growth of approximately 1%. Total revenue to be stable to down 2%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be down in the range of 4% to 5% and noninterest income to be up 4% to 6%. Core noninterest expense, which excludes the FDIC assessment is expected to be stable, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18.5%. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

I'm Brian Gill, the Director of Investor Relations for PNC and participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of January 16, 2024, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam S. Demchak\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. During the challenging and volatile operating environment for the banking industry, PNC performed well during 2023 and delivered a solid finish in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2023, adjusting for the fourth quarter impact of the FDIC special assessment, and expenses related to a staff reduction initiative that we completed in the fourth quarter, we earned $14.10 per diluted share compared to $13.85 per diluted share in 2022. Throughout the year and amidst all the disruption, we continue to grow our customer base and deepen relationships across our coast-to-coast franchise. Importantly, we generated record revenue and controlled core expenses, which allowed us to deliver a modest amount of positive adjusted operating leverage. .\nFor the fourth quarter, we reported $883 million in net income or $1.85 diluted per share and $3.16 per share on an adjusted basis. Rob is going to take you through the financials in a moment, but I'd like to highlight a few points. First, as we announced in early October, we closed on the acquisition of the capital commitment loans from Signature, which is immediately accretive to earnings. Secondly, as we expected, we saw meaningful growth from noninterest income during the fourth quarter, driven primarily by a rebound in capital markets and advisory fees. Third, we completed the actions to reduce our workforce, and we are positioned to realize $325 million of expense savings in 2024. This is in addition to our CIP savings target for 2024 that Rob will discuss in a few minutes.\nExpense discipline remains a top priority for us. And accordingly, we are targeting stable expenses for 2024, even as we continue to invest in key growth initiatives. Fourth, our credit quality remained strong during the quarter, reflecting our thoughtful approach to growing our balance sheet, while we continue to expect credit charge-offs to increase over time, particularly in the CRE office segment were adequately reserved. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we increased our capital position, saw solid improvement in our AOCI intangible book value and repurchased a modest amount of shares.\nIn summary, we run our company with a focus on delivering through the cycle performance and feel very good about our strategy, our capabilities and the strength of our balance sheet as we enter 2024. And we believe we are well positioned to drive growth and deliver shareholder value in the coming year and beyond. As always, I want to thank our employees for everything they do to meet the needs of our customers and make our success possible. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.\n\nRobert Q. Reilly\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis and compared to the third quarter. Loans were up 2% and average $325 billion which includes the acquired signature capital commitment loans. Investment securities declined $2 billion or 2%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve increased $4 billion to $42 billion and deposits increased $1.4 billion and average $424 billion. Borrowed funds increased $5 billion to $73 billion driven by higher FHLB borrowings and parent company senior debt issuances.\nAt year-end, PNC was fully compliant with the proposed holding company long-term debt requirements. And we expect to reach compliance with the bank level metrics through our normal course of funding well in advance of the phase-in period. AOCI improved $2.6 billion to negative $7.7 billion at quarter end, primarily reflecting the impact of favorable interest rate movements during the quarter. Accordingly, tangible book value increased to $85.08 per common share, up 9% linked quarter and 18% compared to the same period a year ago. We remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.9% as of December 31, which increased 10 basis points linked quarter. Our estimated fully phased-in expanded risk-based CET1 ratio based on the new proposed capital rules would be approximately 8.2% at year-end, which is well above our current requirement of 7%.\nWe continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility. During the quarter, we resumed modest share repurchase activity of approximately $100 million or roughly 0.5 million shares. And when combined with $600 million of common dividends, we returned a total of $700 million of capital to shareholders. Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Compared to the third quarter, average loan balances increased 2% driven by higher commercial loan balances and modest growth in consumer. Commercial loans were $223 billion, an increase of $5 billion driven by the acquisition of the Signature Capital commitment portfolio.\nExcluding the $8 billion full quarter average impact from the signature loan portfolio, commercial loans declined $3 billion or 1% and driven by lower utilization and soft loan demand. Consumer loans grew approximately $130 million, driven by higher residential mortgage balances, partially offset by lower home equity and credit card balances. And loan yields increased 19 basis points to 5.94% in the fourth quarter.\nSlide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits grew $1.4 billion to $424 billion during the quarter, as seasonal growth in commercial deposits was partially offset by a decline in consumer deposits. In regard to mix, consolidated noninterest-bearing deposits were 25% in the fourth quarter, down slightly from 26% in the third quarter and consistent with our expectations. We continue to expect a noninterest-bearing portion of our deposits to stabilize near current levels. Our current rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 2.48% during the fourth quarter, up from 2.26% in the prior quarter. As of December 31, our cumulative deposit beta was 44% and in line with our expectation for the quarter.\nAs we stated previously, we expect betas to drift modestly higher, while interest rates remain at current level. And our current forecast calls for the first rate cut to occur in mid-2024, at which point we believe the rate paid on deposits will begin to decline.\nSlide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $137 billion decreased 2% and as curtailed purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. The securities portfolio yield increased 2 basis points to 2.59%, reflecting the runoff of lower-yielding securities. As of December 31, the duration of the investment securities portfolio was 4.1 years. Our received fixed swaps point into the commercial loan book totaled $33 billion on December 31. The weighted average received fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased 3 basis points to 2.1% and the duration of the portfolio was 2.3 years.\nAOCI improved by $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower interest rates. Importantly, as lower rate securities and swaps roll off, we expect a continued meaningful improvement to tangible book value from AOCI accretion.\nTurning to the income statement on Slide 7. Fourth quarter net income was $883 million or $1.85 per share, which included pretax noncore expenses of $665 million or $525 million after tax, related to the FDIC special assessment and the workforce reduction charges incurred in the fourth quarter. Excluding noncore expenses, adjusted EPS was $3.16. Total revenue of $5.4 billion increased to $128 million or 2% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Net interest income declined modestly by $15 million. And our net interest margin was 2.66%, a decline of 5 basis points. Noninterest income increased $143 million or 8%. Noninterest expense of $4.1 billion increased $829 million or 26% and included $665 million of noncore expenses.\nCore noninterest expense was $3.4 billion and increased $164 million or 5%. Provision was $232 million in the fourth quarter and our effective tax rate was 16.3%. Full year 2023 revenue grew 2% compared to 2022. Core noninterest expense was well controlled and grew 1%. Importantly, our disciplined expense management and CIP savings allowed us to deliver modest positive operating leverage and PPNR growth of 2% on an adjusted basis.\nTurning to Slide 8. We highlight our revenue trends. Fourth quarter revenue was up $128 million or 2% compared with the third quarter driven by strong fee income as net interest income of $3.4 billion was down modestly. Fee income was $1.8 billion and increased $99 million or 6% linked quarter. Looking at the detail, capital markets and advisory fees rebounded as expected and increased $141 million or 84%, driven by higher M&A advisory fees. Asset Management and Brokerage revenue grew $12 million or 3%, reflecting favorable market conditions. And residential and commercial mortgage revenue declined $52 million or 26%, primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of net mortgage servicing rights.\nOther noninterest income of $138 million increased $44 million or 47% and included favorable valuation adjustments and gains on sales. The fourth quarter also included $100 million negative [indiscernible] fair value adjustment compared to a $51 million negative adjustment in the third quarter. As a reminder, at December 31, PNC owned 3.5 million Visa Class B shares with an unrecognized gain of approximately $1.5 billion.\nTurning to Slide 9. Our fourth quarter noninterest expense of $4.1 billion was up $829 million and included $665 million of noncore charges. Core noninterest expense of $3.4 billion increased $164 million or 5% linked quarter, reflecting higher business activity, seasonality and asset impairments. During the quarter, we incurred $42 million of impairment charges, which were large related to building write-offs. Notably, in 2023, we reduced our non-branch footprint by 2 million square feet or approximately 17%. For the full year, core noninterest expense of $13.3 billion increased $177 million or 1%. Expense growth was well controlled due in part to the $50 million midyear increase in our CIP goal to $450 million, which we exceeded. As a result, we generated 41 basis points of adjusted positive operating leverage for the full year.\nLooking forward to 2024, our annual CIP target is $425 million. This program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. And as of year-end, we completed actions related to the workforce reduction that will drive $325 million of cost savings in 2024. Taken together, we're implementing $750 million of expense management actions, all of which are reflected in our 2024 guidance that I will cover in a few minutes. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10. While overall credit quality remains strong across our portfolio, we did see a slight uptick in NPLs and delinquencies. Nonperforming loans increased $57 million or 3% linked quarter and included a $12 million increase in CRE.\nTotal delinquencies of $1.4 billion increased $97 million or 8% linked quarter. The increase included seasonally higher consumer delinquencies, the majority of which have already been resolved. Net loan charge-offs were $200 million in the fourth quarter and came in at the low end of our expectations. Our annualized net charge-off to average loans ratio was 24 basis points. And our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.5 billion or 1.7% of total loans on December 31, and stable with September 30. The CRE office portfolio is where we continue to see the most stress and fourth quarter net loan charge-offs were $56 million. We continue to expect future losses on this portfolio. However, we believe we've adequately reserved for those potential losses. As of December 31, our reserves on the office portfolio were 8.7% of total office loans and inside of that, 12.9% on the multi-tenant portfolio.\nImportantly, our overall CRE office portfolio declined 6% or approximately $550 million linked quarter, reflecting a higher level of payoffs. Criticized office loans were flat and nonperforming loans increased 2% linked quarter. Naturally, we'll continue to monitor and review our assumptions to ensure they reflect current market conditions and a full update of this portfolio is included in the appendix slides.\nIn summary, PNC reported a solid fourth quarter and full year 2023. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we're expecting a mild recession starting in mid-2024 with a contraction in real GDP of less than 1%. We expect the federal funds rate to remain unchanged between 5.25% and 5.5% through mid-2024, when we expect the Fed to begin to cut rates. We expect a reduction of 75 basis points in 2024 with a 25 basis point decrease in July, November and December. Looking ahead, our outlook for full year 2024 [indiscernible] compared to 2023 results is as follows: we expect spot loan growth of 3% to 4%, which equates to average loan growth of approximately 1%.\nTotal revenue to be stable to down 2%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be down in the range of 4% to 5% and and noninterest income to be up 4% to 6%. Core noninterest expenses to be stable, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18.5%. Our outlook for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 is as follows: we expect average loans to be stable, net interest income to be down 2% to 3%, and fee income to be down 6% to 8% due to seasonally lower first quarter client activity as well as elevated fourth quarter capital markets and advisory levels. Other noninterest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million, excluding Visa activity. Taking the component pieces of revenue together, we expect total revenue to be down 3% to 4%. We expect total core noninterest expense to be down 3% to 4%. We expect first quarter net charge-offs to be between $200 million and $250 million. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

Gill\n\nExecutive Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nWell, good morning, and welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. I am Bryan Gill, the Director of Investor Relations for PNC and participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of October 13, 2023, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam S. Demchak\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bryan. And good morning, everyone. As you can see on the slide, we delivered strong results in the third quarter, generating $1.6 billion in net income or $3.60 in diluted earnings per share. Rob is going to take you through the numbers in a moment, but I'd like to touch on a few highlights. First, in the challenging operating environment, we generated 3 points of positive operating leverage through disciplined expense management.\nOur credit quality remained strong during the quarter, reflecting our thoughtful approach to managing risk, customer selection and long-term relationship development, all of which have historically served us well in challenging economic cycles. Next, we strengthened our capital and liquidity positions even further during the quarter. While we continue to monitor discussions regarding regulatory changes in these areas based on our current estimates, we are well positioned to meet the proposed requirements without meaningful changes to how we operate.\nWe continue to execute on our key strategic priorities, including our expansion market efforts and upgrading our digital capabilities and we leveraged our strong balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities such as the signature bank loans that we recently acquired. Finally, we are focused on expense management, particularly in the current environment and have taken actions to maintain disciplined expense control. We increased our continuous improvement goal last quarter from $400 million to $450 million, and we are on track to achieve that goal in 2023. Looking ahead, we expect to have CIP savings within a similar range for 2024. And as a reminder, we used savings from this program to fund investments in key growth markets and technology.\nIn addition, earlier this month, we began executing on staff reductions, which will reduce our 2024 expenses by $325 million and will fall to the bottom line. All told, we are implementing more than $725 million of expense management actions that will have impact on 2024. While decisions involving personnel are never easy, we believe they will help us more effectively and efficiently deliver for our customers and our stakeholders, and we'll continue to be diligent in our expense management going forward. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.\n\nRobert Q. Reilly\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis and comparing to the second quarter. Loans were down 2% and averaged $320 billion. Investment securities declined $1 billion or 1%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve increased $7 billion to $38 billion. Deposits of $423 billion declined $3 billion or 1%. Borrowed funds increased $2 billion primarily due to senior debt issuances near the end of the second quarter.\nAt quarter end, AOCI was a negative $10.3 billion compared to a negative $9.5 billion at June 30, reflecting higher interest rates. However, tangible book value increased to $78.16 per common share as retained earnings growth exceeded the negative impact of AOCI. Common dividends in the quarter totaled approximately $600 million. And we remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.8% as of September 30, 2023, which increased 30 basis points linked quarter.\nSlide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Third quarter loans averaged $320 billion and increased $6.5 billion or 2% compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans.\nCompared to the second quarter, average loan balances declined 2% as growth in consumer was more than offset by a decline in commercial. Consumer loans grew approximately $500 million reflecting higher residential mortgage and credit card balances. Commercial loans averaged $218 billion, a decline of $5.5 billion, driven by lower utilization as well as paydowns outpacing new production.\nLoan yields increased 18 basis points to 5.75% in the third quarter, predominantly driven by the higher rate environment.\nSlide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits decreased $3 billion or 1% due to a decline in consumer deposits that was somewhat offset by a growth in commercial deposits. In regard to mix, consolidated noninterest-bearing deposits were 26% in the third quarter, down slightly from 27% from the second quarter and consistent with our expectations. And we still expect the noninterest-bearing portion of our deposits to stabilize in the mid-20% range.\nCommercial noninterest-bearing deposits represented 42% of total commercial deposits in the third quarter compared to 45% in the second quarter. And our consumer deposit noninterest-bearing mix remained stable at 10%. Our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 2.26% during the third quarter, up from 1.96% in the prior quarter. And as of September 30, our cumulative deposit beta was 41%, which was slightly better than our July expectation.\nSlide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $140 billion decreased $1 billion or 1% and as curtailed purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. The securities portfolio yield increased 5 basis points to 2.57%, reflecting new purchase yields of 5.5% and the runoff of lower-yielding securities. As of September 30, the duration of investment securities portfolio was 4.2 years.\nOur received fixed swaps point into the commercial loan book totaled $35 billion on September 30. The weighted average received fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased 34 basis points to 2.07% and the duration of the portfolio was 2.4 years as of September 30. Accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by approximately $800 million in the third quarter as a negative impact of higher rates more than offset paydowns and maturities during the quarter.\nImportantly, as lower rate securities and swaps roll off, we expect our securities yield to continue to increase, resulting in a meaningful improvement to tangible book value from AOCI accretion.\nTurning to the income statement on Slide 7. For the first 9 months of 2023, revenue grew 5% compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting higher interest rates and business growth. Noninterest expense grew 2% and was well controlled despite a higher FDIC assessment rate and inflationary pressures. As a result, we generated 3% positive operating leverage and PPNR grew 9%.\nFor the third quarter, net income was $1.6 billion or $3.60 per share. Total revenue of $5.2 billion decreased $60 million or 1% compared to the second quarter of 2023. Net interest income declined $92 million or 3%, and our net interest margin was 2.71%, a decline of 8 basis points. Noninterest income increased $32 million or 2% as higher fee income was partially offset by lower other noninterest income. Third quarter expenses decreased $127 million or 4% linked quarter. Provision was $129 million in the third quarter and our effective tax rate was 15.5%, which included a favorable impact of certain tax matters in the third quarter. For the full year, we now expect our tax rate to be approximately 16.5%.\nTurning to Slide 8. We highlight our revenue trends. Third quarter revenue was down $60 million or 1% compared with the second quarter. Net interest income of $3.4 billion decreased $92 million or 3% as higher yields on interest-earning assets were more than offset by increased funding costs. Fee income was $1.7 billion and increased $67 million or 4% linked quarter.\nThe primary driver of the increase in fee income was residential and commercial mortgage revenue, which was up $103 million, the majority of which were $97 million was related to an increase in the valuation of net mortgage servicing rights. Partially offsetting this, capital markets and advisory revenue decreased $45 million or 21%, driven by lower trading revenue. M&A advisory activity continued to remain softer in the third quarter despite robust pipelines.\nGoing forward, we do expect this activity to increase in the fourth quarter, which is included in our guidance that I will cover in a few minutes.\nOther noninterest income of $94 million declined $35 million linked quarter driven by lower private equity revenue and included negative Visa fair value adjustments totaling $51 million. As a reminder, at September 30, PNC owned 3.5 million Visa Class B shares with an unrecognized gain of approximately $1.3 billion.\nTurning to Slide 9. Our third quarter expenses were down $127 million or 4% linked quarter which in part reflected our increased CIP program. And we generated 3% positive operating leverage on both a year-to-date and a linked quarter basis.\nImportantly, every expense category remained stable or declined compared to the second quarter of 2023. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10 while overall credit quality remains strong across our portfolio, the pressures we anticipated within the commercial real estate office sector have begun to materialize.\nNonperforming loans increased $210 million or 11%, linked quarter. The increase was driven by multi-tenant office, CRE, which increased $373 million, but was partially offset by a decline of $163 million in non-CRE NPLs.\nIn regard to the CRE office portfolio, total criticized loans remained essentially flat quarter-over-quarter at 23%. The difference this quarter is the migration of certain multi-tenant office loans to NPL status which is an expected outcome as we work to resolve the occupancy and rate challenges inherent to this portfolio.\nUltimately, we expect future losses on this portfolio, and we believe we have reserved against those potential losses accordingly. As of September 30, our reserves on the office portfolio were 8.5% of total office loans and inside of that 12.5% on the multi-tenant portfolio.\nNaturally, we'll continue to monitor and review our assumptions, especially in the higher rate environment to ensure they reflect the real-time market conditions and a full update of the portfolio is included in the appendix slides. Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion increased $75 million or 6% linked quarter driven by higher consumer loan delinquencies. Net loan charge-offs of $121 million declined $73 million or 38% linked quarter. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 15 basis points in the third quarter.\nAnd our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans on September 30, essentially stable at June 30.\nTurning to Slide 11. From a capital perspective, we're well positioned with a CET1 ratio of 9.8% as of September 30. This slide illustrates the impact to our capital levels assuming the Basel III end game proposed rules were effective as of September 30. The inclusion of AOCI reduces our ratio by approximately 190 basis points. And the impact of all other proposed Basel III endgame components are estimated to have an additional negative 40 to 50 basis point impact to our CET1.\nTaken together, the current Basel III end-game proposal would increase our risk-weighted assets by approximately 3% to 4%. And our estimated fully phased-in expanded risk-based CET1 ratio would be approximately 7.4%, which is above our current requirement of 7%. In light of the fluidity of the capital proposals, our share repurchase activity remains on pause. We'll continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules and may resume share repurchases activity depending on market and economic conditions as well as other factors.\nIn regard to the long-term debt proposal, if the rule was effective at the end of the third quarter, our binding constraint would be the long-term debt to risk-weighted assets ratio at both the holding company and the bank level. We estimate our current shortfall at the holding company [indiscernible] bank to be approximately $1 billion and $8 billion, respectively. And we expect to reach compliance at both the consolidated and bank level through our current funding plan as well as the restructuring of existing intercompany debt.\nWe acknowledge and want to emphasize that proposals are still in their comment period and the final rules are subject to change. That being said, we're well positioned to comply with the proposals as drafted.\nSlide 12 provides more detail on the $16 billion portfolio of capital commitment facilities we acquired from Signature Bridge Bank earlier this month. PNC has been active in the capital commitment business for many years. We believe the acquisition will enhance our broader efforts in the private equity sponsor industry. Signature's origination strategy was similar to PNC's, which is focused on building relationships with large and established fund managers. As such, we expect to retain 75% of the portfolio.\nThis acquisition is financially attractive, given the purchase price of 99% of par and the high credit quality of the portfolio. Importantly, the transaction does not have a material impact to our capital ratios or tangible book value per share.\nSlide 13 details our focus on controlling expenses. As Bill mentioned, we remain diligent in our expense management efforts, particularly when considering the current revenue environment. Our continuous improvement program has been in place for over a decade. And through this program, we've utilized expense savings to fund our ongoing business growth and technology investments.\nOver the past 10 years, through CIP, we've identified and completed actions to reinvest $3.7 billion in our company. As you know, we have a 2023 CIP target of $450 million, and we're on track to meet that target. Looking to 2024, even though we've just begun our budgeting process, we do expect a 2024 annual CIP goal of similar magnitude to the 2023 program. Our CIP efforts over the years have allowed us to substantially invest in our company while still delivering low single-digit annual expense growth.\nHowever, the current environment poses meaningful pressures necessitating expense control measures beyond our annual CIP program. As a result, we took a hard look at our organizational structure and identified opportunities to operate more efficiently through staff reductions, which we began implementing earlier this month. This initiative will decrease the workforce by 4% and is expected to reduce 2024 expenses by approximately $325 million.\nOnetime costs associated with this plan are expected to be approximately $150 million and will be incurred during the fourth quarter of 2023. We believe these actions will position PNC for stronger efficiency going forward. As a result, even though our budgeting cycle isn't complete, we have an objective to keep core expenses stable in 2024, which, by definition, would exclude the fourth quarter onetime charges.\nIn summary, PNC reported a solid third quarter 2023. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we're expecting a mild recession starting in the first half of 2024, with a contraction in real GDP of less than 1%.\nWe expect the federal funds rate to remain unchanged in the near term between 5.25% and 5.5% through mid-2024 when we expect the Fed to begin cutting rates. Looking ahead, our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2023 is as follows: we expect average loans to be up approximately 3%, including the acquisition of the Signature Bank capital commitment facilities; net interest income to be down 1% to 2%; fee income to be up approximately 1% as increased capital markets activity is expected to more than offset the impact of the elevated MSR hedge gains during the third quarter.\nOther noninterest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity. We expect total core noninterest expense to be up 3% to 4%, which excludes charges related to the workforce reduction. Additionally, this guidance does not contemplate the pending FDIC special assessment, which could occur during the fourth quarter. And we expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be between $200 million and $250 million. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

Gill\n\nExecutive Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nWell, good morning, and welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group.

These statements speak only as of July 18, 2023, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam S. Demchak\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on the slide, we delivered solid results in the second quarter, generating exactly $1.5 billion in net income or $3.36 in diluted earnings per share. While the macro environment and the competitive dynamics playing out within the banking sector pressured our revenue during the quarter. Our results reflect the overall strength of our franchise and balance sheet. And importantly, through it all, we remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities.\nOur momentum across our markets remain strong, especially in the Southwest. We are growing households and commercial customers throughout our footprint. Rob will take you through the details of our second quarter results in a moment, but I'd like to call out a few highlights.\nFirst, we grew our capital during the quarter and feel very good about our positioning of our balance sheet in the current environment. In the next few weeks, we expect the Fed will announce changes to the Basel III capital framework. We believe our strong capital and liquidity levels as well as our earnings power provide the strength and flexibility to address upcoming regulatory changes. At the same time, we continue to support our customers, grow our business and deliver returns for our shareholders. And in line with our focus on shareholder returns, we recently increased our quarterly common stock dividend by $0.05.\nOur financial strength and stability are evidenced in the Fed's latest stress tests resulting in an improvement in our stressed capital buffer to the regulatory minimum level of 2.5% in October. Second, expense control is in focus. Rob will touch on this in a moment, but we have increased our continuous improvement program target for 2023 and are taking a hard look at opportunities for even further expense improvements across the franchise. Third, credit quality for the quarter remained strong, reflecting our diversified lending franchise and our focus on developing valuable sustainable businesses based on long-term customer relationships.\nAnd finally, I'd like to thank our employees for their efforts and contributions during the quarter. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.\n\nRobert Q. Reilly\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3, and we're presenting on an average basis and comparing to the first quarter. Loans were stable at $325 billion, investment securities declined $2 billion or 2%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve were $31 billion and decreased $3 billion. Deposits of $426 billion declined $10 billion or 2%. Borrowed funds increased $3 billion. As an aside, since 2021, we've been deliberate in issuing TLAC-compliant debt. So we're confident we'll meet the upcoming TLAC requirements through our normal course of funding.\nAt quarter end, AOCI was a negative $9.5 billion. Intangible book value was $77.8 per common share, an increase of 5% compared to the same period a year ago. We remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.5% as of June 30, 2023, which increased 30 basis points linked quarter. We have returned approximately $700 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter, which included $600 million of common dividends and approximately $100 million of share repurchases for 1.1 million shares.\nAnd as Bill just mentioned, our Board recently approved a $0.05 increase to our quarterly cash dividend on common stock raising the dividend to $1.55 per share.\nOur recent CCAR results underscore the strength of our balance sheet. And as previously announced, our current stress capital buffer of 2.9% will improve to a regulatory minimum of 2.5% for the 4-quarter period beginning in October 2023.\nDue to the expected issuance by the federal banking agencies of proposed rules to adjust the Basel III capital framework share repurchase activity in the third quarter is expected to remain modest. We will continue to monitor this and may adjust share repurchase activity as appropriate.\nSlide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Second quarter loans averaged $325 billion and increased $20 billion or 6% compared to the same period a year ago. This growth reflected strong loan demand during the back half of 2022, and our ability to capitalize on opportunities in our expanded franchise. Average loan balances were stable linked quarter as growth in consumer was offset by a decline in commercial with commercial balances reflecting generally weaker demand.\nConsumer loans grew $400 million compared to the first quarter, reflecting higher residential mortgage, credit card and auto balances. Commercial loans averaged $223 billion in the second quarter, a decline of $1 billion as limited new production was more than offset by paydowns. Loan yields increased 28 basis points to 5.57% in the second quarter, predominantly driven by the higher rate environment.\nSlide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Deposits declined 2% on both a spot and average basis linked quarter, reflecting the continuing pressure of quantitative tightening and increased spending activity as well as consumer tax payments. Deposits continue to move from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing accounts. As expected, the mix shift is being driven by commercial deposits.\nIn the second quarter, commercial noninterest-bearing deposits represented 45% of total commercial deposits compared to 47% in the first quarter. Our consumer deposit noninterest-bearing mix has been stable, remaining at 10%. On a consolidated basis, our level of noninterest-bearing deposits was 27% in the second quarter, down slightly from 28% in the first quarter, consistent with our expectations, and we still expect the noninterest-bearing portion of our deposits to stabilize in the mid-20% range.\nOur rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 1.96% during the second quarter, up from 1.66% in the prior quarter. And as of June 30, our cumulative deposit beta was 39%. Looking forward, we expect the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in July. We believe this will put additional pressure on betas, and as a result, we expect our third quarter and year-end cumulative betas to be 42% and 44%, respectively.\nSlide 6 details our investment securities and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $141 billion decreased $2.4 billion or 2%. This limited purchase activity during the quarter was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. The securities portfolio yield increased 3 basis points to 2.52%, reflecting the runoff of lower-yielding securities. And as of June 30, the duration of the investment securities portfolio was 4.2 years.\nOur received fixed swaps pointed to the commercial loan book totaled $40 billion at the end of the second quarter. The weighted average received fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased 25 basis points linked quarter to 1.73%. And the portfolio duration was 2.3 years as of June 30.\nDuring the second quarter, our accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by $400 million. Paydowns and maturities were in line with our expectations but were more than offset by the negative impact from higher-than-expected rates throughout the quarter.\nNotwithstanding this AOCI impact, our tangible book value increased 1% to $77.8 compared to March 31. Importantly, as lower rate securities and swaps roll off, we expect our securities yields to continue to increase, resulting in a meaningful improvement to tangible book value from AOCI accretion.\nTurning to the income statement on Slide 7. For the first half of 2023, revenue grew 11% compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting higher interest rates and overall business growth. Noninterest expense grew 4% and was well controlled despite a higher FDIC assessment rate and inflationary pressures. As a result, PPNR grew 24%. For the second quarter, net income was $1.5 billion or $3.36 per share. Total revenue of $5.3 billion decreased $310 million or 6% compared to the first quarter of 2023.\nNet interest income declined $75 million or 2%, and our net interest margin was 2.79%, a decline of 5 basis points. Noninterest income declined $235 million or 12%, driven by both lower fee income and other noninterest income, which included Visa fair value adjustments of a negative $83 million that I will discuss in a moment.\nSecond quarter expenses increased $51 million or 2% linked quarter. Provision was $146 million in the second quarter, reflecting portfolio activity and changes in macroeconomic variables. And our effective tax rate was 15.5%, which included the favorable impact of certain tax matters in the second quarter.\nTurning to Slide 8. We highlight our revenue trend. Second quarter revenue was down $310 million or 6% compared with the first quarter. Net interest income of $3.5 billion decreased $75 million or 2% as higher yields on interest-earning assets were more than offset by increased funding costs and lower loan and security balances. Fee income was $1.7 billion and decreased $106 million or 6% linked quarter. The primary driver of the decline in fee income was residential and commercial mortgage revenue, which was down $79 million. Inside of that $58 million was related to lower net valuation of mortgage servicing rights. Beyond that, capital markets and advisory revenue decreased $49 million or 19%, driven by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees and loan syndication revenue.\nGoing forward, we expect this activity to meaningfully increase in the second half of the year, which is included in our guidance that I will cover in a few minutes.\nPartially offsetting these declines was a $38 million or 6% increase in card and cash management fees, reflecting seasonally higher consumer transaction volumes and increased treasury management product revenue. Other noninterest income of $129 million declined 50% linked quarter, driven by lower private equity revenue and included negative Visa fair value adjustments related to litigation escrow funding and other valuation changes totaling $83 million.\nTurning to Slide 9. Our second quarter expenses were up $51 million or 2% linked quarter and remain well controlled. The growth was primarily due to a $35 million increase in marketing expense, reflecting seasonality. Personnel expense increased by $20 million or 1%, which included the full quarter impact of annual employee merit increases. Every other expense category remained stable or declined compared to the first quarter of 2023.\nAs Bill mentioned, we remain diligent in our expense management efforts, particularly when considering the current revenue environment. At the beginning of the year, we set a continuous improvement program goal of $400 million. Recently, we have identified initiatives that support increasing our CIP by an additional $50 million, raising our full year target to $450 million. Further, we'll continue to look for additional efficiencies during the remainder of 2023 and importantly, as we begin to plan for 2024.\nOur credit metrics are presented on Slide 10. Our credit quality remains strong and notably, the leading indicators for credit quality continue to perform well. Nonperforming loans were down $97 million or 5% and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. And total delinquencies of $1.2 billion decreased $114 million or 9% linked quarter. Net charge-offs of $194 million were stable linked quarter. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 24 basis points in the second quarter. And our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans on June 30, essentially stable with March 31.\nWhile overall credit quality remains strong across our portfolio, the office category within commercial real estate continues to be a key area of concern. As expected, we saw increases in charge-offs related to office during the quarter. However, the portfolio metrics remain largely similar to those presented in our comprehensive view last quarter. Naturally, we'll continue to monitor and review our assumptions to ensure they reflect real-time market conditions, and a full update is included in the appendix slides.\nIn summary, PNC reported a solid second quarter 2023. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we're expecting a mild recession starting in early 2024 with a contraction in real GDP of less than 1%. Our rate path assumption includes a 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate in July. Following that, we expect the Fed to pause rate actions until March 2024, when we expect the Fed to begin to cut rates.\nLooking ahead, our outlook for the third quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2023 is as follows: we expect average loans to decline approximately 1%; net interest income to be down 3% to 4%; noninterest income to be up 10% to 11%. Taking the component pieces, we expect total revenue to be up approximately 1%. We expect total noninterest expense to be stable, and we expect second quarter net charge-offs to be between $200 million and $250 million.\nConsidering our reported operating results for the first half of 2023 third quarter expectations and current economic forecasts for the full year 2023 compared to full year 2022. We expect spot loans to be relatively stable, which equates to average loan growth of 5% to 6%. Total revenue growth to be approximately 2% to 2.5%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be in the range of up 5% to 6%. This is a move to the lower end of our previous guidance largely driven by anticipated deposit costs moving a bit faster than we expected and slightly lower loan growth expectations. We expect noninterest income to decline 2% to 4%, which is down from our earlier expectations of stable. This change is resulting from softer than expected capital markets revenue in the second quarter and $127 million of Visa-related charges that have been incurred year-to-date. Expenses are expected to be up approximately 2%.\nCredit quality is trending better than expected, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

Gill\n\nExecutive Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nToday's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of April 14, 2023, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam S. Demchak\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you can see on the slide, our quarterly results were strong, and we reported $1.7 billion in net income or $3.98 per share. Inside of this, we grew deposits and loans, increased our capital and liquidity positions, generated positive operating leverage and maintained strong credit quality.\nFor the past month, we've seen market volatility across the broader industry. And while we take this situation seriously and are closely monitoring the environment, it's important to note that these events have taken place within a few banks with very unique business models. Inside of our company, we really haven't seen any meaningful impacts from the events of the past month. Our balance sheet remains strong and stable, and we are operating the company in the same way we were at the beginning of March.\nUltimately, over time, we expect the dynamics playing out in the banking system today to contribute to changes in the competitive landscape. And while it's still early innings, we believe that PNC will be a beneficiary from this process.\nThat said, in the near term, we're not immune to the competitive environment and the deposit dynamics that will ultimately impact our NII in the near term, and Rob is going to cover that in more detail in a second. We remain focused on growing relationships across our lines of business, and we continue to execute on key priorities, including the expansion in the BBVA legacy markets.\nRob will provide more details on our financial performance in a moment. However, for this particular call, he'll review our first quarter earnings in a slightly condensed manner to allow time to also cover key balance sheet focus points that have been top of mind for our investors in the last couple of weeks. And of course, following that, we'll be able to discuss your specific questions in the Q&A segment.\nFinally, I'd like to thank our 61,000 employees for helping deliver a strong quarter and everything they do to support our customers.\nNow with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.\n\nRobert Q. Reilly\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. Loans for the first quarter were $326 billion, an increase of $3.6 billion or 1% linked quarter. Investment securities were relatively stable at $143 billion. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve averaged $34 billion and increased $4 billion during the quarter.\nDeposits of $436 billion grew on both, a spot and average basis linked quarter. Average borrowed funds increased $4 billion, which reflected fourth quarter 2022 activity as well as senior note issuances in January of this year.\nAt quarter end, our tangible book value was $76.90 per common share, an increase of 7% linked quarter. And we remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.2% as of March 31, 2023. During the quarter, we returned $1 billion of capital to shareholders which included $600 million of common dividends and approximately $370 million of share repurchases or 2.4 million shares.\nDue to market conditions and increased economic uncertainty, we expect to reduce our share repurchase activity in the second quarter. And of course, we'll continue to monitor this and may adjust share repurchase activity as appropriate.\nSlide 5 shows our loans and deposits in more detail. During the first quarter, loan balances averaged $326 billion, an increase of $4 billion or 1%, largely reflecting the full quarter impact of growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. Deposits averaged $436 billion in the first quarter, increasing $1.3 billion.\nWe continue to see a mix shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing, and I will cover that in more detail in a few minutes. Our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits has increased to 1.66% during the first quarter from 1.07% in the fourth quarter of 2022. And as of March 31, our cumulative deposit beta was 35%.\nTurning to the income statement on Slide 6. As you can see, first quarter 2023 reported net income was $1.7 billion or $3.98 per share. Total revenues of $5.6 billion decreased to $160 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Net interest income decreased $99 million or 3% primarily driven by 2 fewer days in the quarter and higher funding costs, partially offset by higher yields on interest-earning assets.\nOur net interest margin of 2.84%, declined 8 basis points reflecting the increased funding costs, I just mentioned. Noninterest income also declined 3% or $61 million as growth in asset management and brokerage was more than offset by a general slowdown in capital markets activity as well as seasonally lower consumer transaction volumes.\nFirst quarter expenses declined $153 million or 4% linked quarter, even after accounting for the increase to the FDIC's deposit assessment rate which equated to $25 million. Provision was $235 million in the first quarter and included the impact of updated economic assumptions as well as changes in portfolio composition and quality. And our effective tax rate was 17.2%.\nTurning to Slide 7. We highlight our revenue and expense trends. As a result of our diversified revenue streams and expense management efforts, we generated positive operating leverage of 2% linked quarter and 15% compared to the same period a year ago. And as we previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $400 million in 2023 through our continuous improvement program, and we're confident we will achieve our full year target. And as you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business [ in ] technology investments.\nOur credit metrics are presented on Slide 8. Nonperforming loans remained stable at $2 billion and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion declined $164 million or 11% linked quarter. Notably, the delinquency rate of 41 basis points is our lowest level in over a decade.\nNet charge-offs were $195 million, a decrease of $29 million linked quarter. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 24 basis points in the first quarter. And our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans on March 31, essentially stable with year-end 2022.\nBefore I provide an update on our forward guidance, as Bill mentioned, we want to take a deeper dive into some of the key balance sheet items that are top of mind in the current environment related to deposits, securities and swaps, capital and liquidity, and the impact of potential regulatory changes, and finally, office exposure within our commercial portfolio.\nIn our view, we believe we're well positioned across all these key areas of focus.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our $437 billion deposit base is broken down between consumer and commercial categories to give you a view of the composition and granularity of the portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, our deposits were 53% consumer and 47% commercial. Inside of our $230 billion of consumer deposits, approximately 90% are FDIC insured. The portfolio is very granular with an average account balance of approximately $11,500 across nearly 20 million accounts throughout our coast-to-coast franchise.\nOur $207 billion of commercial deposits are 20% insured, but importantly, approximately 95% of the total balances are held in operating and relationship accounts. These include deposits held as compensating balances to pay for treasury management fees, escrow deposits at Midland loan services and broader relationship accounts, all of which tend to provide more stability than deposit-only accounts.\nImportantly, we have approximately 1.4 million commercial deposit accounts, representing a diverse set of industries and geographies.\nTurning to Slide 11. We highlight our mix of noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits. Our consumer deposits, noninterest-bearing mix has been stable, remaining at 10% compared to the same period a year ago. The commercial side is where we expected to see a continued shift from noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing deposits as rates have risen and that has played out, albeit at a somewhat faster pace than we had expected.\nThe commercial noninterest-bearing portion of total deposits was 45% as of March 31, down from 58% a year ago. Importantly, commercial noninterest-bearing deposits include the compensating balances and Midland escrow deposits, I mentioned previously, which provides support to this mix through time. On a consolidated basis, our level of noninterest-bearing deposits was 27% at the end of the first quarter of 2023, down from 33% a year ago. PNC has historically operated with a higher percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits relative to the banking industry due in part to the strength of our treasury management business and granular deposit base.\nAs a result, we expect our noninterest-bearing portion of deposits to continue to exceed industry averages, and approach the mid-20% range by year-end 2023. In addition to our mix shift, we have seen a faster increase in our deposit cost this year as the Federal Reserve has continued to raise short-term interest rates.\nSlide 12 shows our recent trends and our current expectations for deposit betas through the end of 2023. The increase in our current deposit beta expectations are largely driven by recent events that have increased the intensity and focus on rates paid and ultimately, has added incremental pricing pressure sooner than we previously expected.\nWe expect the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in May. This, coupled with heightened competition for deposits, has accelerated our expectations to the level and pace of beta increase. And we now expect to reach a terminal beta of 42% by year-end.\nSlide 13 details our investment securities and swap portfolios. Our securities balance averaged $143 billion in the first quarter and were relatively stable linked quarter. The yield on our securities portfolio increased 13 basis points to 2.49%, as we continue to replace runoff at higher reinvestment rates. Yields on new purchases during the quarter exceeded 4.75%.\nOur portfolio is high quality and positioned with a short duration of 4.3 years, meaningfully shorter than many of our peers. Approximately 2/3 of our securities are recorded as held to maturity, and 1/3 is available for sale. Average security balances represent approximately 28% of interest-earning assets.\nOur Received Fixed Swaps pointing to the loan book remained largely stable at $42 billion in notional value and 2.25-year duration. At the end of the first quarter, our accumulated other comprehensive loss improved by $1.1 billion or 10% to $9.1 billion, driven by the impact of lower interest rates during the quarter and normal accretion as the securities and swaps pulled apart.\nSlide 14 highlights the pace of expected security and swap maturities as well as the related AOCI runoff. By the end of 2024, we expect about 26% of our securities and swaps to roll off. This will drive increases in our securities and commercial loan yields as well as meaningful tangible book value improvement as we expect approximately 40% AOCI accretion by the end of year 2024.\nSlide 15 highlights our strong liquidity position. Our strong liquidity coverage ratios continued to improve in the first quarter and exceeded regulatory requirements throughout the quarter. Our cash balance is at the Federal Reserve totaled $34 billion, and we maintained substantial unused borrowing capacity and flexibility through other funding sources.\nPNC has a robust liquidity management process, which includes a required statutory daily liquidity coverage ratio assessment as well as a monthly net stable funding ratio calculation. In addition, we performed monthly internal liquidity stress testing that covers a range of time horizons as well as systemic and idiosyncratic stress scenarios. Our mix of borrowed funds to total liabilities has historically averaged approximately 17% and reached an unprecedented low level of 6% in 2021.\nOn March 31, our mix was 12%, and we expect to move closer to the historical average over time. In light of the current environment, we anticipate that we will be subject to a total loss absorbing capacity requirement in some form and at some point, with a reasonable phase-in period. Importantly, as our borrowed funds continue to return to a more normalized level, we would expect to be compliant through our current issuance plans under existing TLAC requirements.\nSlide 16 shows our solid capital position with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.2% at quarter end. As a Category 3 institution, we don't include AOCI in our CET1 ratio, but I understand why there is focus on this ratio with the inclusion of AOCI. As of March 31, 2023, our CET1 ratio, including AOCI, was estimated to be 7.5%, which remains above our 7.4% required level, taking into account our current stress capital buffer. However, we also believe it's important to take a look at the balance sheet positioning of the bank from a market value of equity perspective, similar to our understanding of Basel IRRBB rules.\nMarket value of equity doesn't truly get reflected on the balance sheet today due to generally accepted accounting principles, which results in a skewed approach valuating certain items primarily on the asset side. While AOCI takes into account the current valuation of the securities and certain portions of our swap portfolios, it does not account for the valuation of the deposit book which can be a meaningful offset in a rising interest rate environment.\nIn fact, looking at PNC's change in market value of equity over the past year, the increase in the market value of our deposits and the rapidly rising interest rate environment has significantly outpaced all unrealized losses on the asset side of the balance sheet, including securities and fixed rate loans.\nTotal market value of equity increased substantially in the rising rate environment, and further, our duration of equity is now essentially 0 and well positioned in the current environment. Importantly, our models use conservative assumptions regarding estimates for betas, mix, balances and deposit [indiscernible]. We also recognized early on that large inflows of deposits during the pandemic were driven by a combination of QE and fiscal stimulus, which were likely to be short-lived. Recall our Fed balances peaked in the first quarter of 2021 around $86 billion.\nAs a result, we modeled an economic value associated with those deposits at a fraction of the value of core deposits.\nTurning to Slide 17. I wanted to spend a few minutes talking about our commercial real estate portfolio. While credit quality is strong across the majority of our CRE book, office is a segment receiving a lot of attention in this environment due to the shift to remote work and higher interest rates. So we thought it would be worthwhile to highlight our exposure and our position with this portfolio.\nAt the end of the first quarter, we had $8.9 billion or 2.7% of our total loans in our office portfolio.\nTurning to Slide 18. You can see the composition of this portfolio, which is well diversified across geography, tenant type and property classification. Reserves against these loans, which we have built over several quarters, now totaled 7.1%, a level that we believe adequately covers expected losses. In regard to our underwriting approach, we adhere to conservative standards, focus on attractive markets and work with experienced, well-capitalized sponsors. The office portfolio was originated with an approximate loan to value of 55% to 60%, and a significant majority of those properties are defined as Class A.\nWe have a highly experienced team that is reviewing each asset in the portfolio to set appropriate action plans and test reserve adequacy. We don't solely rely on third-party appraisals, which will naturally be slow to adjust to the rapidly shifting market conditions. Rather, we are stress testing property performance to set realistic expectations. To appropriately sensitize our portfolio, we've significantly discounted net operating income levels and property values across the entire office book. Additionally, tenant retention, build-out costs and concession levels are all updated to accurately reflect market conditions.\nCredit quality in our office portfolio remains strong today with only 0.2% of loans delinquent, 3.5% nonperforming and a net charge-off rate of 47 basis points over the last 12 months. Along those lines, we continue to see solid performance within the single tenant, medical and government loans, which represent 40% of our total office portfolio. These have occupancy levels above 90% and [indiscernible] levels of 3% or less. Where we do see increasing stress and a rising level of criticized assets, is in our multi-tenant loans, which represents 58% of our office portfolio. Multi-tenant loans are currently running in the mid-70% occupancy range. [indiscernible] levels are greater than 30% and 60% of the portfolio is scheduled to mature by the end of 2024.\nIn the near term, this is our primary concern area as it relates to expected losses and by extension, comprises the largest portion of our office reserves. Multi-tenant reserves on a stand-alone basis are 9.4%. Obviously, we'll continue to monitor and review our assumptions to ensure they reflect real-time market conditions.\nFor each of the key areas of focus, I just discussed, we believe we are well positioned. And Slide 19 summarizes our balance sheet strength during this volatile time. Our deposits are up, our capital and liquidity positions are strong, and our overall credit quality is solid.\nIn summary, PNC reported a strong first quarter 2023. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we are expecting a recession starting in the second half of 2023, resulting in a 1% decline in real GDP. Our rate path assumption includes a 25-basis point increase in the Fed funds rate in May. Following that, we expect the Fed to pause rate actions until early 2024, when we expect a 25-basis point cut.\nLooking ahead, our outlook for full year 2023 compared to 2022 results is as follows. We expect spot loan growth of 1% to 3%, which equates to average loan growth of 5% to 7%. Total revenue growth to be up 4% to 5%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be up 6% to 8%.\nAt this point, visibility remains challenging, and our full year NII guidance assumes the continuation of the recent intensity on deposit pricing, which is being driven by recent events. We expect noninterest income to be stable, expenses to be up 2% to 3%, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18%.\nBased on this guidance, we expect we will generate positive operating leverage in 2023. Looking at the second quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2023, we expect average loans to be stable, net interest income to be down 2% to 4%, fee income to be stable to down 1%. Other noninterest income to be between $200 million and $250 million excluding net securities and Visa activity.\nTaking all the component pieces, we expect total revenue to decline approximately 3%. We expect total noninterest expense to be up 1% to 2%, and we expect second quarter net charge-offs to be between $200 million and $250 million. Further, given our strong credit metrics, our credit quality is trending better than our expectations. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

Gill\n\nEVP, Director of IR, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Welcome to today's conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nToday's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of January 18, 2023, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam S. Demchak\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. 2022 is a successful year for our company, and our strong performance during the year reflects the power of our Main Street bank model and our coast-to-coast franchise. For the full year, we reported $6.1 billion in net income or $13.85 per share. Inside of that, we grew loans and generated record revenue during a rapidly rising rate environment while at the same time, we controlled expenses, resulting in substantial positive operating leverage for the full year 2022.\nTurning to our results for the fourth quarter. We generated $1.5 billion of net income or $3.47 per share. Growth in both net interest income and fee income contributed to a 4% increase in revenue. Our expenses were up 6% this quarter, primarily due to increased compensation from elevated business activity, particularly in our advisory businesses. Rob is going to provide more detail on our fourth quarter expenses as well as our outlook in a few minutes.\nAverage loans grew 3% during the quarter, driven by growth in both commercial and consumer. For the full year, average loans were up 15%, and we continue to grow our loan book in a disciplined manner.\nAs we look ahead, we are operating our company with the expectation for a shallow recession in 2023. Accordingly, this outlook drove an increase in our loan loss provision in the quarter and a modest build in reserves under the CECL methodology. Importantly, as the credit environment continues to trend towards normalized levels, our overall credit quality metrics remain solid.\nI'd add that with charge-offs having been so low, it's not surprising to see volatility quarter-to-quarter and we saw this in the fourth quarter with an outsized loss on one commercial credit pushing us outside of our expected range. We continue to manage our liquidity levels to support growth. Our deposits remain relatively stable, and we've increased our wholesale borrowings to bolster liquidity.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total annual capital return to $6 billion. Our progress within the BBVA influenced markets continues to exceed our expectations, and we see powerful growth opportunities across our lines of business in these new markets. We continue to generate new customer relationships, and we have been thrilled with the quality of bankers we've been able to hire.\nIn summary, it was a solid fourth quarter as we further built on our post-acquisition momentum, delivered for our customers and communities across the country, generated strong financial results for our shareholders and put ourselves in a position of strength as we move into 2023.\nAs always, I want to thank our employees for everything they do to make our success possible. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to provide more details. Rob?\n\nRobert Q. Reilly\n\nCFO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone.\nOur balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis. Loans for the fourth quarter were $322 billion, an increase of $9 billion or 3% linked quarter. Investment securities grew $6 billion or 4%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve totaled $30 billion and declined $1.5 billion during the quarter. And our average deposit balances were down 1%, while period-end deposits remained essentially stable.\nAverage borrowed funds increased $15 billion as we proactively bolstered our liquidity with Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings late in the third quarter, and these are reflected in our fourth quarter average balances.\nOn a spot basis, we increased our total borrowed funds by approximately $4 billion compared to September 30. The period-end increase was driven by $2 billion of FHLB borrowings and $3 billion of senior debt, partially offset by lower subordinated debt.\nAt year-end, our tangible book value was $72.12 per common share, an increase of 3% linked quarter. And we remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.1% as of December 31, 2022.\nWe continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility. During the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders through approximately $600 million of common dividends and $600 million of share repurchases or 3.8 million shares.\nSlide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Compared to the same period a year ago, average loans have increased 11% or $33 billion, reflecting increased loan demand as well as our ability to capitalize on opportunities in our expanded coast-to-coast franchise.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we delivered solid loan growth. Loan balances averaged $322 billion, an increase of $9 billion or 3% compared to the third quarter reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans. On a spot basis, loans grew $11 billion or 3%.\nCommercial loans grew more than $9 billion at period end, driven by strong broad-based new production in both our corporate banking and asset-based lending businesses. Importantly, utilization rates within our C&IB portfolio remained stable linked quarter.\nConsumer loans increased $1 billion compared to September 30, driven by higher residential mortgage, home equity and credit card balances, partially offset by lower auto loans and loan yields of 4.75%, increased 77 basis points compared to the third quarter, driven by higher interest rates.\nSlide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Throughout 2022, deposit balances have declined modestly, amidst the competitive pricing environment and inflationary pressures. Fourth quarter deposits averaged $435 billion and were generally stable linked quarter.\nGiven the rising interest rate environment, we continue to see a shift in deposits from noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing. And as a result, at December 31, our deposit portfolio mix was 71% interest-bearing and 29% noninterest bearing.\nOverall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 1.07% during the fourth quarter. And as of December 31, our accumulated beta was 31%.\nSlide 6 details our securities portfolio. On an average basis, our fourth quarter securities of $143 billion grew $6 billion or 4%. The increase was largely driven by elevated purchase activity late in the third quarter, which included $3 billion of forward starting securities that settled in the fourth quarter.\nOn a spot basis, securities were $139 billion and increased $3 billion or 2% linked quarter. The yield on our securities portfolio increased 26 basis points to 2.36%, driven by higher reinvestment yields as well as lower premium amortization. And during the quarter, new purchase yields exceeded 4.75%.\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, our accumulated other comprehensive income improved to $10.2 billion reflecting the accretion of unrealized losses on securities and swaps. Importantly, we continue to estimate that approximately 5% of AOCI will accrete back per quarter going forward, without taking into account the impact of rate changes.\nTurning to the income statement on Slide 7. As you can see, fourth quarter 2022 reported net income was $1.5 billion, or $3.47 per share. Revenue was up $214 million or 4% compared with the third quarter. Expenses increased $194 million or 6%. Provision was $408 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of a weaker economic outlook as well as continued loan growth, which resulted in a $172 million reserve build. And our effective tax rate was 17.7%.\nTurning to Slide 8. We highlight our revenue trends. In 2022, total revenue was a record $21.1 billion and grew 10% or $2 billion compared to 2021. Within that, net interest income increased 22% due to both higher interest rates and strong loan growth.\nNoninterest income declined 5% as lower market-sensitive fees more than offset strong card and cash management growth.\nLooking more closely at the fourth quarter, total revenue was $5.8 billion, an increase of 4% or $214 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $3.7 billion, was up $209 million or 6%. The benefit of higher yields on interest-earning assets and increased loan balances was partially offset by higher funding costs. And as a result, net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 2.92%.\nFee income was $1.8 billion and increased $75 million or 4% linked quarter. Looking at the detail, asset management and brokerage fees decreased $12 million or 3% reflecting the impact of lower average equity markets. Capital Markets and Advisory revenue grew $37 million or 12%, driven by higher merger and acquisition advisory fees, partially offset by lower loan syndication activity. Lending and deposit services increased $9 million or 3%, primarily due to higher loan commitment fees, reflecting our strong new loan production.\nResidential and commercial mortgage revenue increased $41 million, driven by higher RMSR valuation adjustments, partially offset by lower commercial mortgage banking activities. Other noninterest income declined $70 million linked quarter, reflecting a negative fourth quarter Visa fair value adjustment compared to a positive valuation adjustment in the third quarter, resulting in a change of $54 million.\nTurning to Slide 9. Our fourth quarter expenses were up $194 million or 6% linked quarter. The growth was largely in personnel costs, which increased $138 million reflecting higher variable compensation related to increased business activity. Fourth quarter personnel costs also included market impacts on long-term incentive compensation plans as well as seasonally higher medical benefits.\nThe remaining balance of the increase in expenses linked quarter included higher marketing spend as well as impairments on various assets and investments. The majority of these impairments will lower our expenses going forward and are included in our expense guidance.\nAs you know, we had a 2022 goal of $300 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, and we exceeded that goal. Looking forward to 2023, we will be increasing our annual CIP goal to $400 million. This program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments.\nOur credit metrics are presented on Slide 10. Nonperforming loans of $2 billion, decreased $83 million or 4% compared to September 30 and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies of $1.5 billion, declined $136 million or 8% linked quarter. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $224 million, an increase of $105 million linked quarter, driven in part by one large commercial loan credit.\nOur annualized net charge-offs to average loans was 28 basis points in the fourth quarter. Provision for the fourth quarter was $408 million compared to $241 million in the third quarter. The increase reflected the impact of a weaker economic outlook as well as continued loan growth.\nDuring the fourth quarter, our allowance for credit losses increased $172 million, and our reserves now total $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans.\nIn summary, PNC reported a strong fourth quarter and full year 2022. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we're now expecting a mild recession in 2023 resulting in a 1% decline in real GDP. Our rate path assumption includes a 25 basis point increase in Fed funds in both February and March. Following that, we expect the Fed to pause rate actions until December 2023, when we expect a 25 basis point cut.\nLooking ahead, our outlook for full year 2023 compared to 2022 results is as follows: we expect spot loan growth of 2% to 4%, which equates to average loan growth of 6% to 8%. Total revenue growth to be 6% to 8%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be up in the range of 11% to 13% and noninterest income to be stable to up 1%.\nExpenses to be up between 2% and 4% and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18%.\nBased on this guidance, we expect we'll generate solid positive operating leverage in 2023.\nLooking at first quarter of 2023 compared to fourth quarter of 2022, we expect spot loans to be stable, which equates to average loan growth of 1% to 2%. Net interest income to be down 1% to 2%, reflecting 2 fewer days in the quarter. Fee income to be down 3% to 5% due to seasonally lower first quarter client activity. Other noninterest income to be between $200 million and $250 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity.\nWe expect total noninterest expense to be down 2% to 4%, and we expect first quarter net charge-offs to be approximately $200 million.\nAnd with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of October 14, 2022, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam S. Demchak\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen, we delivered another strong quarter, generating $1.6 billion of net income or $3.78 per share. The combination of continued growth in our commercial and consumer loan books and higher rates drove net interest income 14% higher and our net interest margin increased 32 basis points. By the way, that's the largest sequential increase in NIM in more than a decade.\nNoninterest income was also up modestly, reflecting strong private equity performance and a record quarter in loan syndications, partially offset by weaker M&A activity. We remained disciplined on the expense front, resulting in 7 percentage points of positive operating leverage. Our credit quality was largely unchanged in the quarter. While we have not seen any meaningful deterioration in credit quality taking place, our provision of $241 million reflects our slightly weaker economic expectations.\nOur capital levels remain solid, and we returned $1.7 billion of capital to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends. We continue to make good progress on our strategic priorities. Our new and acquired markets performed particularly well across all lines of business, and we see significant untapped opportunities across these markets. We also continue to invest in our payments capabilities to provide differentiated value.\nWe recently acquired Linga, enhancing our capabilities to better serve restaurant and retail clients, particularly in the small business space. And during the quarter, we made enhancements across our retail platform to drive customer convenience and retention. For example, we recently announced a partnership with Allpoint to give our customers surcharge-free access to 41,000 additional ATMs from coast to coast. With this partnership, PNC now offers customers surcharge-free access to more than 60,000 PNC and partner ATMs across the country.\nIn AMG we saw positive quarterly flows of $4 billion, driven by both the private bank and institutional asset management. We are recruiting top talent and remain focused on taking share in all of our markets.\nIn summary, in the third quarter, we executed well as a national Main Street bank, and we are in a position of strength as we look to the future. As always, I want to thank our employees for their hard work in the third quarter and for everything they do to deliver for our customers, communities and our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to provide more detail about our financial results.\n\nRobert Q. Reilly\n\nCFO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis. During the quarter, loan balances were $313 billion, an increase of $8 billion or 3%. Investment securities grew approximately $2 billion or 2%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve decreased $8 billion, and our deposit balances averaged $439 billion, a decline of $7 billion or 2%. However, spot deposits were down $2.6 billion or less than 1% as lower consumer deposits were partially offset by growth in commercial deposits.\nAt the end of the third quarter, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 72% and remains well below our pre-pandemic levels. Average borrowed funds increased $8.6 billion as we bolstered our liquidity through Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. During the quarter, we increased our borrowings with the home loan bank by $20 billion on a spot basis. We continue to be well-positioned with significant capital flexibility. During the quarter, we returned $1.7 billion of capital to shareholders through approximately $600 million of common dividends and $1.1 billion of share repurchases or 6.7 million shares.\nAnd as of September 30, 2022, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 9.3%.\nSlide 4 shows our loans in more detail. During the third quarter, we delivered solid loan growth across our expanded franchise. Loan balances averaged $313 billion, an increase of $8 billion or 3% compared to the second quarter, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans. On a spot basis, loans grew $4.6 billion or 1%.\nCommercial loans grew $3.1 billion as strong new production more than offset the syndication of the $5 billion of high-quality short-term loans that were expected to mature in the second half of the year. Consumer loans increased $1.5 billion driven by higher residential mortgage and home equity balances, partially offset by lower auto loans. And loan yields increased 69 basis points compared to the second quarter, driven by higher interest rates.\nSlide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Although average deposits declined $7 billion or 2% compared to the second quarter, spot deposits were $438 billion and declined less than 1% compared to June 30. Commercial deposits grew $1.7 billion or 1% on a spot basis, and consumer deposits declined $4.3 billion or 2%, reflecting inflationary pressures and seasonally higher spending.\nGiven the rising interest rate environment, we've begun to see a mix shift from noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing, particularly within our commercial deposits and expect this to continue over time. However, to date, our consolidated deposit portfolio mix has remained relatively stable with 2/3 interest-bearing and 1/3 noninterest bearing. Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 33 basis points linked quarter to 45 basis points. As of September 30, our cumulative beta was 22%, and we estimate it will increase to approximately 30% by year-end.\nSlide 6 details our securities portfolio. On an average basis, our securities grew $2 billion or 2% during the quarter, as we replaced maturities with higher-yielding securities. The yield on our securities portfolio increased 21 basis points to 2.1%, driven by higher reinvestment yields as well as lower premium amortization. And during the quarter, new purchase yields exceeded 4%. Throughout the course of the year, we've repositioned our securities portfolio. And as of September 30, we had 66% of our securities classified as held to maturity. While interest rates have continued to increase, this repositioning has reduced the rate of change in our AOCI.\nAt the end of the third quarter, our accumulated other comprehensive loss was $10.5 billion, and as you know, is not included in our regulatory capital. And importantly, we expect this amount to fully accrete back over the remaining lives of the securities and swaps. As of September 30, we estimate that approximately 5% of AOCI will accrete back per quarter going forward.\nTurning to the income statement on Slide 7. As you can see, third quarter 2022 reported net income was $1.6 billion or $3.78 per share. Revenue was up $433 million or 8% compared with the second quarter. Expenses increased $36 million or 1%, resulting in 7% positive operating leverage linked quarter. Provision was $241 million in the third quarter, reflecting a slightly weaker economic outlook, which impacted our macroeconomic scenarios and weightings, and our effective tax rate was 19.1%.\nTurning to Slide 8. We highlight our revenue trends. As you can see, total revenue for the third quarter was $5.5 billion, an increase of 8% or $433 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $3.5 billion was up $424 million or 14%. The benefit of higher yields on interest-earning assets and increased loan balances was partially offset by higher funding costs. And as a result, net interest margin increased 32 basis points to 2.82%.\nThird quarter noninterest income of $2.1 billion increased $9 million as lower fee income was offset by an increase in other noninterest income. The decline in fee revenue was driven by lower activity in our capital markets, mortgage and asset management businesses, which was somewhat offset by continued strong performance in our lending and deposit services as well as our card and cash management fees. Growth in other noninterest income reflected higher private equity revenue as well as a $13 million positive Visa derivative fair value adjustment in the third quarter compared to a negative adjustment of $16 million in the second quarter.\nTurning to Slide 9. Our third quarter expenses continue to be well managed and were up 1% linked quarter. The growth reflected increased personnel expense to support business growth as well as one additional day in the quarter. As we previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $300 million in 2022 through our continuous improvement program. We're now 9 months into the year, and we've completed actions related to capturing more than 80% of our annual goal. And as a result, we remain confident we will achieve our full year objectives. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments.\nOur credit metrics are presented on Slide 10. Nonperforming loans of $2.1 billion increased $22 million or 1% compared to June 30 and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies were $1.6 billion on September 30 at $115 million or 8% increase linked quarter. The increase was driven by elevated levels of administrative delinquencies, the majority of which have already been or are in the process of being resolved.\nNet charge-offs for loans and leases were $119 million, an increase of $36 million linked quarter, primarily driven by higher Commercial loan net charge-offs. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans continues to be historically low at 15 basis points.\nProvision for the third quarter was $241 million compared to $36 million in the second quarter. The increase reflected slightly weaker economic expectations, which impacted our macroeconomic scenarios and weightings. And during the third quarter, our allowance for credit losses remained essentially stable. Our reserves now totals $5.3 billion and continued to be 1.7% of total loans.\nIn summary, PNC reported a strong third quarter. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we expect moderate growth in the fourth quarter, resulting in 1.8% GDP growth for the full year 2022. We also expect the Fed to raise rates by an additional 125 basis points in the fourth quarter with a 75 basis point increase in November and a 50 basis point increase in December.\nLooking at the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2022, we expect average loan balances to increase approximately 1%. Net interest income to be up 6% to 8%, fee income to be stable to down 1%; other noninterest income to be between $200 million and $250 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity.\nTaking our guidance for all components of revenue into consideration, we expect total revenue to increase approximately 2%. We expect total noninterest expense to be stable to up 1%. Fourth quarter net charge-offs to be between $125 million and $175 million, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18.5%.\nAnd with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

Gill\n\nEVP, Director of IR, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam S. Demchak\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen, we had a strong second quarter, highlighted by 9% revenue growth and solid positive operating leverage resulting in PPNR growth of 23%. We maintained strong credit quality and fees rebounded from the first quarter, driven primarily by capital markets activity, including Harris Williams, and continued growth in card and cash management. Strong loan growth and rising rates helped us to increase both net interest income and net interest margin meaningfully. Loan growth was driven by C&I, where new production increased significantly and utilization returned to near pre-pandemic levels. Consumer loans also grew, driven by mortgage and home equity.\nHigher rates continued to adversely impact the unrealized value of our securities book. In response, we continue to reposition the portfolio during the quarter, resulting in 60% of our securities portfolio now being held and held to maturity. We returned $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends.\nLooking forward, there is uncertainty in the environment we're operating and including the impact of higher rates, supply chain disruptions and inflation. But regardless of the path ahead macroeconomically, we believe having a strong balance sheet, a solid mix of fee-based businesses, continued focus on expense management and differentiated strategies for organic growth will continue to provide the foundation for our success. And our focus is on executing the things we can control and not getting distracted by what is beyond our control.\nAlong those lines, we delivered well on our strategic priorities in the quarter, including the build-out of our new BBVA and expansion markets, modernizing our retail banking technology platform, bolstering our asset management offering and building differentiated and responsible capabilities for our retail and commercial customers in the payment space. As I've talked about recently at conferences, our performance in the BBVA markets has exceeded our own expectations.\nOn Slide 3, you can see the strong growth we've generated in these markets across customer segments. In corporate banking, we've seen sales increase 40% linked quarter and maintained a 50% noncredit mix of sales since conversion. We've seen similar growth within commercial banking, where sales in the BBVA USA markets are up 32% linked quarter and noncredit sales to total sales have been approximately 55% since conversion. In retail banking, we've experienced a notable increase in sales for both small businesses and consumers of 16% and 22%, respectively. And we continue to invest in AMG, and a big part of that is building a strong customer-focused team that can deliver our brand across our footprint.\nWe have built good momentum in our recruiting efforts over the past few quarters, hiring advisers across all areas of the business to help deliver for our clients. I'll close by thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication to our customers and communities.\nMoving forward, we believe that we're well positioned to continue to grow shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions.\n\nRobert Q. Reilly\n\nCFO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nWell, thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. During the quarter, loan balances averaged $305 billion, an increase of $14 billion or 5%. Investment securities grew approximately $1 billion or 1%. Our average cash balances at the Federal Reserve declined $23 billion. Deposit balances averaged $447 billion, a decline of $7 billion or 2%. Our tangible book value was $74.39 per common share as of June 30, a 7% decline linked quarter, entirely AOCI driven as a function of higher rates.\nAnd as of June 30, 2022, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 9.6%. Given our strong capital ratios, we continue to be well positioned with significant capital flexibility. During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders through $627 million of common dividends and $737 million of share repurchases for 4.3 million shares.\nOur recent CCAR results underscore the strength of our balance sheet and support our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. As you know, our Stress Capital Buffer for the fourth quarter period beginning in October 2022, is now 2.9%, and our applicable ratios are comfortably in excess of the regulatory minimums. Earlier this year, our Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase framework, which allows for up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 59% were still available for repurchase as of June 30. This allows for the continuation of our recent average share repurchase levels in dollars as well as the flexibility to increase those levels should conditions warrant.\nSlide 5 shows our loans in more detail. During the second quarter, we delivered solid loan growth across our expanded franchise, particularly when compared to 2021 growth rates. 2021, as you know, was characterized by low utilization levels, PPP loan forgiveness, and in PNC's case, a repositioning of certain acquisition-related portfolios. Loan balances averaged $305 billion, an increase of $14 billion or 5% compared to the first quarter, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans.\nCommercial loans, excluding PPP, grew $13 billion, driven by higher new production as well as utilization. Included in this growth was approximately $5 billion related to the high-quality short-term loans that are expected to mature during the second half of the year. Notably, in our C&IB segment, the utilization rate increased more than 120 basis points, and our overall commitments were 5% higher compared to the first quarter. PPP loan balances declined $1.2 billion, and at the end of the quarter were less than $1 billion. Consumer loans increased $2 billion as higher mortgage and home equity balances were partially offset by lower auto loans. And loan yields increased 10 basis points compared to the first quarter, driven by higher interest rates.\nSlide 6 highlights the composition of our deposit portfolio as well as the average balance changes linked quarter. We have a strong core deposit base, which is 2/3 interest-bearing and 1/3 noninterest-bearing. Within interest-bearing, 70% are consumer. And within noninterest-bearing, 50% are commercial compensating balances and represent stable operating deposits. At the end of the second quarter, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 71%, which remains well below our pre-pandemic historic average. On the right, you can see linked quarter change in deposits in more detail. Deposits averaged $447 billion in the second quarter, a decline of nearly $7 billion or 2% linked quarter. Commercial deposits declined $8 billion or 4%, primarily in noninterest-bearing deposits due to movement to higher-yielding investments and seasonality. Average consumer deposits increased seasonally by $2 billion or 1%.\nOverall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 8 basis points linked quarter to 12 basis points. Deposit betas have lagged early in the rate-rising cycle, but we expect our deposit betas to accelerate in the third quarter and throughout the remainder of the year given our increased rate forecast. And as a result, we now expect our betas to approach 30% by year-end, compared to our previous expectation of 22%.\nSlide 7 details our securities portfolio. On an average basis, our securities grew $800 million or 1% during the quarter, representing a slower pace of reinvestment in light of the rapidly rising interest rate environment. The yield on our securities portfolio increased 25 basis points to 1.89%, driven by higher reinvestment yields as well as lower premium amortization.\nOn a spot basis, our securities remained relatively stable during the second quarter as net purchases were largely offset by net unrealized losses on the portfolio. As Bill mentioned, in total, we now have 60% of our securities in held-to-maturity as of June 30, which will help mitigate future AOCI impacts from rising interest rates. Net pretax unrealized losses on the securities portfolio totaled $8.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. This includes $5.4 billion related to securities transferred to held-to-maturity, which will accrete back over the remaining lives of those securities.\nTurning to the income statement on Slide 8. As you can see, second quarter 2022 reported net income was $1.5 billion, or $3.39 per share, which included pretax integration costs of $14 million. Excluding integration costs, adjusted EPS was $3.42. Revenue was up $424 million or 9% compared with the first quarter. Expenses increased $72 million or 2%, resulting in 7% positive operating leverage linked quarter. Provision was $36 million, and our effective tax rate was 18.5%.\nNow let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Slide 9 details our revenue trends. Total revenue for the second quarter of $5.1 billion, increased 9% or $424 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $3.1 billion, was up $247 million or 9%. The benefit of higher yields on interest-earning assets and increased loan balances was partially offset by higher funding costs. And as a result, net interest margin increased 22 basis points to 2.5%. Second quarter fee income was $1.9 billion, an increase of $211 million or 13% linked quarter.\nLooking at the detail of each category. Asset management and brokerage fees decreased $12 million or 3%, reflecting lower average equity markets. Capital market-related fees rebounded as expected and increased to $157 million or 62%, driven by higher M&A advisory fees. Card and cash management revenue grew $51 million or 8%, driven by higher consumer spending activity and increased treasury management product revenue. Lending and deposit services increased $13 million or 5%, reflecting seasonally higher activity and included lower integration-related fee waivers. Residential and commercial mortgage noninterest income was essentially stable linked quarter, with higher revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities offset lower residential mortgage loan sales revenue.\nFinally, other noninterest income declined $34 million and included a $16 million Visa negative fair value adjustment related to litigation escrow funding and derivative valuation changes.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our second quarter expenses were up by $72 million or 2% linked quarter, driven by increased business activity, merit increases and higher marketing spend. These increases were partially offset by seasonally lower occupancy expense and lower other expense. We remain deliberate around our expense management. And as we've previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $300 million in 2022 through our continuous improvement program, and we're confident we'll achieve our full year target. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments.\nOur credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Overall, we saw broad improvements across all categories. Nonperforming loans of $2 billion, decreased $252 million or 11% compared to March 31, and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies were $1.5 billion on June 30, a $188 million decline linked quarter, reflecting lower consumer and commercial loan delinquencies, which included the resolution of acquisition-related administrative and operational delays.\nNet charge-offs for loans and leases were $83 million, a decrease of $54 million linked quarter, driven by lower consumer net charge-offs, primarily within the auto portfolio. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans continues to be historically low at 11 basis points. And during the second quarter, our allowance for credit losses remained essentially stable, and our reserves now total $5.1 billion or 1.7% of total loans.\nIn summary, PNC reported a solid second quarter, and we're well positioned for the second half of 2022 as we continue to realize the potential of our coast-to-coast franchise. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we expect the pace of economic growth to slow over the remainder of 2022, resulting in 2% average annual real GDP growth. We also expect the Fed to raise rates by an additional cumulative 175 basis points through the remainder of this year to a range of 3.25% to 3.5% by year-end.\nLooking at the third quarter of 2022, compared to the second quarter of 2022, we expect average loan balances to be up 1% to 2%. We expect net interest income to be up 10% to 12%. We expect noninterest income to be down 3% to 5%, which results in total revenue increasing 4% to 6%. We expect total noninterest expense to be stable to up 1%. And we expect third quarter net charge-offs to be between $125 million and $175 million. Considering our reported operating results for the first half of 2022, third quarter expectations, and current economic forecast for the full year 2022 compared to the full year 2021, we expect average loan growth of approximately 13% by an 8% loan growth on a spot basis. We expect total revenue growth to be 9% to 11%. Our revenue outlook for the full year is unchanged from the guidance we provided in April. However, relative to our expectations at that time, we now expect more net interest income from higher rates, offset by somewhat lower fees.\nWe expect expenses, excluding integration expense to be up 4% to 6%. And we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nToday's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of April 14, 2022, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam S. Demchak\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen, we had a solid start to the year as we grew loans and securities, controlled expenses and our credit quality reserves and capital levels remain very strong. As we previously disclosed, noninterest income was below our expectations for the quarter. And while we had expected fees to be down sequentially, reflecting typical first quarter seasonality, the decline actually exceeded normal interest rate volatility and probably, the Russian-Ukraine conflict adversely impacted certain of our capital markets businesses among other areas. As we look forward, we're clearly in an environment of uncertainty here. We're also in an environment with rising interest rates, which benefit banks with increased loan demand, which benefit banks. And in PNC's case, a business or a bank that never changed its credit box on credit terms got really easy business that has a very -- or a bank that is a very solid mix of fee-based businesses, and importantly, a bank that has substantially expanded its geographic presence. And I want to hit on that in a second just as it relates to our progress on BBVA.\nAnd I would tell you, I just -- I couldn't be more proud of what we've been able to accomplish over the last about 15 months in total now, but in particular, over the last couple of quarters. And we still have a lot of work to do, but to put it in perspective, our staffing is largely complete. And our calling effort, particularly versus the fourth quarter, has increased substantially, and our sales and pipelines are robust. Just to give you an idea of the activity behind this, in the legacy BBVA USA geographies, corporate commercial banking costs have doubled since the fourth quarter, and sales have increased almost 50%. And as we expected across CNIB, nearly half of these sales were actually noncredit related and the BBVA USA geographies. We switch to the retail side. We're obviously focused on building customer relationships. Just to give you an idea, our sales per branch were approximately 60% higher in March compared to what they were in December with improvements across mortgages, cards and referrals to PNC investments.\nIn our Asset Management group, we're making great progress and strategic investments to hire key people in business development and adviser roles, and importantly, our client opportunity pipelines are really strong. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to deploy our excess liquidity as you've seen with solid loan growth and securities purchases. Spot loans grew $6 billion in the quarter, driven by the commercial side, which saw a nice increase in utilization. In fact, if we exclude the impact of PPP loan forgiveness, spot commercial loans grew $7 billion. The fastest organic quarterly growth we've seen since the commercial defensive draws that we saw at the start of the pandemic. And by the way, we've seen that growth carry into the early part of April. We also remain active on the security side with net purchases of almost $6 billion during the quarter. From a balance sheet perspective, the securities were offset by unrealized losses due to rising interest rates, which Rob is going to discuss in a few minutes. This doesn't impact our regulatory capital or earnings, but during the quarter, we moved approximately $20 billion of our securities available for sale to help the maturity to limit future valuation changes due to interest rate movements. Importantly, we saw a solid rebound in the yield on our securities.\nOverall, we believe we are well positioned for the rising interest rate environment to deliver net interest income growth and NIM expansion throughout the year. And finally, during the quarter, we returned about $1.7 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchase dividends. And importantly, based on our performance and strong capital levels to the Board's confidence in our execution of our strategic priorities, we recently announced a substantial increase to our quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share to $1.50, or 20%.\nI just want to close by thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication to our customers and communities. Moving forward, as I said, we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow shareholder value as the economy normalizes stats move higher than we realized the full potential of the combined PNC and BBVA USA franchise.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions.\n\nRobert Q. Reilly\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis. During the quarter, loans increased by $2 billion or 1%. Investment securities grew $6 billion or 5%, and Federal Reserve cash balances declined $13 billion or 17%, reflecting higher securities and loan balances as well as lower borrowed funds. Deposit balances averaged $453 billion and were relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. Our tangible book value was $79.68 per common share as of March 31, a 15% decline linked quarter, which was entirely driven by mark-to-market adjustments in our securities and swap portfolios as a result of higher interest rates.\nAs a category 3 institution, we opted out of recognizing AOCI and regulatory capital, and as of March 31, 2022, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 9.9%. Given our strong capital ratios, we continue to be well positioned with significant capital flexibility. And as Bill just mentioned, our Board recently approved a $0.25 increase to our quarterly cash dividend on common stock, raising the dividend to $1.50 per share. Additionally, during the first quarter, we completed share repurchases of $1.2 billion or 6.4 million shares.\nSlide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Average loans increased $2 billion linked quarter, and on a spot basis, loans grew $6 billion, or 2%. PPP loan balances continued to decline and impacted first quarter growth by approximately $2 billion on both an average and spot basis. Looking at loan growth, excluding the impact of PPP loans, average loans increased $4 billion or 1%, driven by $5 billion of growth in commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by a $1 billion decline in commercial real estate balances and average consumer loans were stable linked quarter. On a spot basis, loans grew $8 billion. Commercial loans grew $7 billion, driven by higher utilization as well as new production within corporate banking and business credit businesses. Notably, in our C&IB segment, the utilization rate increased 85 basis points and our overall commitments were 2% higher compared to year-end 2021. And consumer loans increased $900 million as higher mortgage balances were partially offset by lower auto and credit card loans.\nMoving to Slide 5. Average deposits of $453 billion remained stable compared to the fourth quarter. On the right, you can see total deposits at period end were $450 billion, a decline of $7 billion or 2% linked quarter. All of the decline was on the commercial side where deposits were $10 billion lower, primarily driven by seasonal cash deployments. Partially offsetting the commercial decline, consumer deposits increased $3 billion, reflecting seasonally higher balances related to tax refund payments. Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits remained stable at 4 basis points, and importantly, we remain core funded with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 65% at the end of the first quarter.\nSlide 6 details the change in our average securities and federal reserve balances. We've maintained high levels of liquidity over the past year while opportunistically purchasing securities. This trend continued into the first quarter as we added primarily U.S. treasuries and agency RMBS. As a result, average security balances increased by 5% or $6 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, and now represent 27% of interest-earning assets.\nSlide 7 highlights the composition of our high-quality securities portfolio as well as the balance changes from year-end March 31. During the first quarter, we added to our portfolio with net purchases of approximately $6 billion. However, the increase in rates during the first quarter resulted in higher net unrealized losses of approximately $6 billion, and accordingly, our period-end balances remained relatively state. To moderate the impact of rising rates on security values and correspondingly AOCI, we transferred approximately $20 billion of securities from our available-for-sale portfolio and to help maturity at quarter end. Importantly, fluctuations in AOCI did not have an impact on our earnings. However, we are mindful of the AOC impact on tangible book value, and we'll continue to evaluate potential opportunities to further transit.\nTurning to the income statement on Slide 8. As you can see, first quarter 2022 reported EPS was $3.23, which included pre-tax integration costs of $31 million. Excluding integration costs, adjusted EPS was $3.29. During the first quarter, integration costs reduced revenue by $16 million and increased expenses by $15 million. First quarter revenue was down $435 million or 8% compared with the fourth quarter. Expenses declined $619 million or 16% linked quarter, and excluding the impact of integration expenses, noninterest expense declined 7%. The first quarter provision recapture was $208 million, primarily reflecting the impact of improved COVID-19-related economic conditions, and our effective tax rate was 17%. So in total, net income was $1.4 billion in the first quarter.\nNow let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Slide 9 details our revenue trends. Total revenue for the first quarter of $4.7 billion defined $430 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $2.8 billion was down $58 million, or 2%. Higher securities and loan balances as well as increased security yields were more than offset by a $74 million decline in PPP revenue due to loan forgiveness activity and the impact of 2 fewer days in the quarter. And net interest margin of 2.28% was up 1 basis point. As we recently announced and effective for the first quarter, we recategorized the presentation of our noninterest income and provided an update to the related guidance. Consistent with those revisions, first quarter fee income was $1.7 billion, a decline of $296 million or 15% linked quarter.\nLooking at the detail of each revenue category. Asset management and brokerage fees decreased $8 million or 2%, reflecting lower average equity markets. Capital markets-related fees declined $208 million or 45%, driven by lower M&A advisory fees mostly due to elevated fourth quarter transaction levels, but also some delayed transaction activity in the first quarter. Card and Cash Management revenue decreased $26 million or 4%, driven by seasonally lower consumer spending activity. Lending and deposit services was essentially stable linked quarter, declining only $4 million. Residential and commercial mortgage noninterest income was $50 million lower, primarily due to decreased commercial mortgage activity. And finally, other noninterest income declined $81 million, primarily due to lower private equity-related revenue and once again compared to elevated fourth quarter levels.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our first quarter expenses were down by $619 million or 16% (inaudible). Excluding the impact of integration expenses, noninterest expense declined $243 million or 7%. The majority of the decline was a lower personnel expense, primarily reflecting the lower incentive compensation. We remain deliberate around our expense management. At year-end 2021, we achieved our objective to reduce BBVA USA's annual operating expense run rate by $900 million. And as we previously stated, we have a goal to reduce costs by $300 million in 2022 through our continuous improvement program, and we're confident we'll achieve our full year target. As you know, this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business on technology investments.\nOur credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Nonperforming loans of $2.3 billion decreased $182 million or 7% compared to December 31, and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies were $1.7 billion on March 31, a $286 million decline from year-end, reflecting lower consumer and commercial loan delinquencies. The majority of these decreases resulted from our progress in resolving BBVA USA conversion-related, administrative and operational delays. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $137 million, an increase of $13 million linked quarter. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans continues to be historically low at 19 basis points. And during the first quarter, we reduced our allowance for credit losses by approximately $300 million, and our reserves now total $5.2 billion or 1.8% of total loans.\nIn summary, PNC reported a solid first quarter, and we're well positioned for the remainder of 2022 as we continue to realize the potential of our coast-to-coast franchise. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we expect strong growth over the course of 2022, resulting in 3.7% average GDP growth. We also expect the Fed to raise rates by an additional cumulative 175 basis points through the remainder of this year to a range of 2% to 2.25% by year-end, and all of this is consistent with the update in our recent 8-K filing. Looking at the second quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2022, we expect average loan balances to be up 2% to 3%, which includes a $1.3 billion decline in PPP loans. We expect net interest income to be up 10% to 12%. We expect noninterest income to be up 6% to 8%, which results in total revenue increasing 9% to 11%. We expect total noninterest expense to be up 3% to 5%, and we expect second quarter net charge-offs to be between $125 million and $175 million. Considering our reported first quarter operating results, second quarter expectations and current economic forecasts for the full year 2022 compared to the full year 2021, we expect average loan growth of approximately 10% and spot loan growth of 5%. We expect total revenue growth to be 9% to 11%. We expect expenses, excluding integration expense, to be at 4% to 6%. And we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.\nAnd with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nToday's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of January 18, 2022, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam S. Demchak\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen, we had a strong fourth quarter and full year for 2021. We successfully completed the conversion of BBVA USA early in the fourth quarter, and have been running hard as 1 bank since then. The transaction continues to meet or exceed our deal projections, and Rob will give you some of those details. I'm especially pleased by our ability to announce close and convert a transaction of this size inside of 11 months. Challenges notwithstanding, we had the talent, the technology and the strategy to accomplish this and to combine our organization in a way that will provide growth opportunities for years to come.\nThe acquisition positions us with a coast-to-coast presence and along with our continued organic growth strategies, including our recent expansion into Las Vegas, we now have a presence in all of the top 30 U.S. markets. We're excited about the opportunity this presents, and we are confident in our ability to generate growth by executing on our Main Street relationship-based model.\nThat said, we recognize that we have a lot of work to do in building out the new and expansion markets, which will be our primary focus in 2022. BBVA obviously impacted our results for the full year, and Rob will walk you through the details. Excluding BBVA, we generated record revenue, highlighted by strong noninterest income with broad-based contributions across our commercial and consumer businesses. We also maintained outstanding credit quality and a very strong capital position. While we continue to opportunistically deploy some of our excess cash into higher-yielding securities throughout the year, we remain well positioned with substantial excess liquidity to capitalize on a rising interest rate environment.\nOur reported results for the fourth quarter reflected the impact of almost $440 million of BBVA integration costs. Excluding these, we generated nearly $1.6 billion of net income and solid returns. Importantly, excluding the impact of PPP loan forgiveness, we saw decent underlying loan growth trends and some uptick in utilization rates, which is very encouraging, as Rob will discuss in more detail. Critical to our long-term success has been the quality and stability of our talent, and we pride ourselves as being an employer of choice, given the recent dynamics of the substantially increased competition for talent. In part due to the great resignation, we experienced greater wage pressure during the fourth quarter, and I expect that to persist into the coming year.\nNaturally, we'll look to offset these increases with our continuous improvement efforts, which include driving further automation and rethinking core processes. We continue to invest in technology to enhance our capabilities in an increasingly digital world. Customers are looking to their financial providers to offer innovative tools that help them manage their money in ways that are faster, smarter and more convenient, whether that be expanded use cases for Zelle where transaction volumes are up 50% or low cash flow. For example, by providing account transparency and control, low cash mode has substantially reduced customer overdraft fees and related complaints.\nI'll close by thanking our employees for their hard work and steadfast commitment to our customers and communities. Because of our employees, we had a remarkable year and are well positioned to serve all of our stakeholders in 2022 and beyond.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions.\n\nRobert Q. Reilly\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 5 and is presented on an average basis. Overall, year-over-year balance sheet growth was primarily driven by the acquisition of BBVA USA.\nLoans grew 18%, Investment securities increased 49% and deposits grew 26%.\nLooking at the linked quarter changes, loans for the fourth quarter were $289 billion, a decline of $2.4 billion or 1%. Excluding $4.7 billion of PPP forgiveness activity, loans grew $2.3 billion or 1%, and I'll cover the drivers in more detail over the next few slides.\nInvestment securities increased $7 billion or 6% as we maintained higher purchasing activity throughout much of the quarter. Accordingly, cash balances at the Federal Reserve declined by $5 billion. On the liability side, deposit balances declined $1.6 billion as higher commercial and consumer deposits were offset by runoff deposits related to the strategic repricing of certain BBVA USA portfolios during the third quarter, and that negatively impacted fourth quarter average balances.\nHowever, on a spot basis, total deposits as of December 31 increased $8 billion or 2%, reflecting the continued strong liquidity positions of our customers. At year-end, our tangible book value was $94.11 per common share, and our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 10.2%, which are both substantially above the pro forma levels we anticipated when we announced the deal.\nDuring the quarter, we returned approximately $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders via common dividends of $500 million and share repurchases of $600 million. Given our strong capital ratios, we continue to be well positioned with significant capital flexibility going forward.\nSlide 6 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. In the fourth quarter, loans declined $2.4 billion as growth in commercial and consumer loans was more than offset by a decline in PPP loans of $4.7 billion. Excluding the impact of PPP, commercial loans grew by $2.2 billion or 1%, driven by growth in corporate banking and asset-based lending. During the fourth quarter, we continue to see a slow and steady increase in utilization rates within our Corporate and Institutional Banking business, and along with that expanded pipelines.\nTaken together, these factors are driving our expectations for higher loan growth in 2022. Consumer loans increased modestly linked quarter as higher residential real estate balances were mostly offset by lower home equity and auto loans.\nFinally, as I mentioned, PPP loans continued to decline due to forgiveness activity. And as of December 31, $3.4 billion of PPP loans remained on our balance sheet. Average deposits of $453 billion declined by $1.6 billion linked quarter for the reasons I previously mentioned. Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits remained stable at 4 basis points. Slide 7 details the change in our average securities and federal reserve balances.\nAs rates increased at the end of the third quarter and throughout the fourth quarter, we continue to opportunistically add securities to our portfolio. primarily U.S. treasuries. As a result, securities balances averaged $128 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of $7.2 billion or 6% compared to the third quarter of 2021 and and now represent 26% of interest-earning assets. We continue to have substantial excess liquidity with Fed cash balances averaging $75 billion during the fourth quarter, which we believe positions us well for a rising rate environment. As you can see on Slide 8, fourth quarter 2021 reported EPS was $2.86 and which included pretax integration costs of $438 million. Excluding integration costs, adjusted EPS was $3.68.\nAs expected, during the fourth quarter, we incurred essentially half of our total anticipated deal integration costs, which reduced revenue by $47 million and increased expenses by $391 million. Since the announcement of the acquisition, we've now incurred approximately 95% of the total $980 million expected integration costs, including [$120] million of write-offs for capitalized items. Excluding the impact of integration costs, linked quarter revenue was down $31 million or 1%.\nExpenses increased $48 million or 1% and pretax pre-provision earnings declined $79 million or 4%. The fourth quarter provision recapture was $327 million, reflecting continued improvements in the economic environment. Net income, excluding pretax integration costs of $438 million, was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail.\nTurning to Slide 9. These charts illustrate our diversified business mix. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of $5.1 billion decreased $70 million linked quarter, reflecting lower noninterest income. Net interest income of $2.9 billion, was up slightly, primarily a result of higher securities balances. Net interest margin was stable at 2.27%.\nAs I mentioned, integration costs reduced noninterest income by $47 million, which included $19 million of lease exit costs, $17 million of treasury management fee waivers and $11 million of overdraft waivers.\nFourth quarter fee income, excluding integration costs, was $1.9 billion and declined $39 million or 2% linked quarter.\nLooking at the detail. Asset management fees increased $3 million or 1%, primarily related to higher average equity markets. Consumer services grew $12 million or 2% due to higher brokerage and credit card revenue. Corporate service fees increased $14 million or 2%, reflecting higher loan syndications activity as well as continued elevated corporate advisory activity. Residential mortgage noninterest income declined $46 million driven by lower RMSR valuation adjustments and loan sales revenue. Service charges on deposits decreased $22 million, primarily a result of converting BBVA USA customers to PNC's product and Oprah Draft pricing structure.\nOther noninterest income, excluding integration costs, was stable linked quarter as the impact of a $1 million positive Visa derivative fair value adjustment in the fourth quarter compared to a negative adjustment of $169 million in the third quarter was offset by lower private equity revenue.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our fourth quarter expenses were up by $204 million or 6% linked quarter. The growth was primarily driven by $156 million increase in integration expenses. Excluding the impact of integration expenses of $391 million, noninterest expense increased $48 million or 1%. The growth was largely within personnel costs driven by higher employee benefits expense, an increase in our minimum hourly rate of pay as well as elevated incentive compensation related to strong fee activity.\nWe had a 2021 goal of $300 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, and we successfully completed actions to achieve that goal. Looking forward to 2022, our annual CIP goal will once again be $300 million.\nImportantly, as of year-end 2021, we completed all of the actions that will drive $900 million of savings related to the BBVA USA acquisition, which we expect to be fully realized in 2022 and is reflected in our expense guidance that I will provide in a few minutes. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Nonperforming loans of $2.5 billion decreased $48 million or 2% compared to September 30 and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies of $2 billion on December 31, increased $516 million or 35%. Obviously, this was a large increase.\nHowever, it was primarily driven by BBDA USA conversion-related, administrative and operational delays, which we expect will largely be resolved within the first half of 2022. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $124 million, an increase of $43 million linked quarter. Commercial net charge-offs declined $5 million, offset by an increase of $48 million in consumer. Inside of the higher consumer net charge-offs, auto grew $28 million and other consumer increased $13 million, reflecting conversion-related impacts as well as seasonality. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans continues to be low and in the fourth quarter was 17 basis points.\nAnd during the fourth quarter, our allowance for credit losses declined $471 million, reflecting continued improvements in the economic environment. At quarter end, our reserves were $5.5 billion, representing 1.92% of loans. In summary, PNC reported a strong fourth quarter, which concluded a successful 2021, and we're well positioned for 2022 as we continue to realize the potential of our coast-to-coast franchise.\nIn regard to our view of the overall economy, we expect strong growth over the course of 2022, resulting in 3.5% GDP growth. We also expect 425 basis point increases in the Fed funds rate in 2022. Beginning in May, followed by additional increases in June, September and December. Looking ahead, our full year guidance for 2022 includes the impact of 12 months of BBVA USA results compared to only 7 months in 2021. Taking that into account our outlook for full year 2022 compared to 2021 results is as follows: we expect average loan growth of approximately 10% and 5% on a spot basis.\nWe expect total revenue growth to be 8% to 10%. We expect expenses, excluding integration expense to be up 4% to 6%. And to be clear here, this includes 5 additional months of BBVA USA operating expenses, which equates to a full year increase of approximately $500 million, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18%.\nBased on this guidance, we expect we will generate solid positive operating leverage in 2022. Looking ahead at the first quarter of 2022 compared to the recent fourth quarter 2021 results, we expect average loan balances, excluding PPP, to be up approximately 1% to 2%. We expect NII to be down approximately 1% to 2%, reflecting 2 fewer days in the quarter, and a decline of approximately $75 million in PPP-related interest income.\nWe expect fee income to be down 4% to 6% due to seasonally lower first quarter client activity as well as elevated fourth quarter fees in certain categories. We expect other noninterest income to be between $375 million and $425 million, excluding integration costs as well as net securities and these activities.\nTaking our guidance for all components of revenue into consideration, we expect total revenue to decline approximately 3% to 5%. We expect total noninterest expense excluding integration costs, to be down approximately 4% to 6%.\nAnd during the quarter, we expect to incur $30 million of integration expense. Finally, we expect first quarter net charge-offs to be between $100 million and $150 million.\nAnd with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

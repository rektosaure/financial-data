We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. In order to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone. If your question has been answered and you wish to move yourself from the queue, please press star one one again. One moment for our first question. Our first question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess I was hoping for some more color on your accelerated productivity initiatives and your efforts, you know, to ultimately right-size your asset footprint. My sense is your business, you know, is built for faster growth. And, you know, as we're seeing growth moderate, I guess you're understanding the need to shrink your asset base and, you know, an attempt to mitigate, you know, the impact that you might be seeing from some deleveraged moving forward. So first, could you quantify the productivity savings you're hoping to generate this year and how much above the typical $1 billion run rate it will be? And then second, could you frame for us how you're balancing your reduced asset footprint with ultimately ensuring your business will still be built for growth over the medium/long term?\nI guess along those lines, how should we think about your long-term algo and realistic category growth? Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nGood, Bonnie. A lot of questions there. Listen, let me talk first about how we're thinking about productivity in a multi-year horizon, and then maybe Jamie can give you a bit more sense of the numbers. Now, we're thinking about productivity. You asked about Frito-Lay, about thinking about PBNA as well or international business. Every one of those businesses have been optimizing their cost structure for multi-years. Now we've been investing in technology. We've been investing in AI. We've been investing in data. Those businesses now have opportunities to improve even more their productivity as a standalone business. When it comes to the North America market, we have one new layer of opportunity that is going to give us a lot of opportunities to improve our cost structure over the next three, four years, which is the North America integration.\nWe have two large businesses, almost $30 billion each, that have been operating almost, you know, a full value chain side by side. Now with the investment we've made in technology, with the new, you know, data that we have and systems, we can start looking at those businesses in a more integrated way to perform some of the value chain tasks in an integrated way. With that, we create both efficiency and cost reduction, but also growth opportunities for the business in a combined way. Think about rural areas in the country. Think about how we service small, small stores or away-from-home restaurants. Think about some of those opportunities, how we lower the cost to serve. At the same time, we can increase frequency. We can increase the time to sell. So those are standalone opportunities, combined opportunities as North America.\nAnd then the third layer is how we as a company have been investing for now multiple years in global capability centers around the world to service our businesses as one PepsiCo, with one technology, with one set of processes, with one set of information that is live, and that would also create a lot of value for our businesses going forward. So think about productivity not as a one-year event, but a multi-year opportunity for us to reduce our cost, invest in growth, and obviously the food business in North America that you were referring to is one of the obviously businesses where we're looking at improved cost structure in the coming months and the coming years. Now, Jamie, maybe you want to talk a bit more about the details of the costs.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Hi, Bonnie. So yeah, in the second half, we're expecting to deliver about 70% more productivity than we delivered in the first half. Now, that's across the entire enterprise. But given the size of Frito-Lay on the portfolio and the particular need to right-size the assets and some of the other fixed costs, you know, it skews more to Frito-Lay delivering that stepped-up productivity. What we're going after, I think we've mentioned in the past, we've closed two plants. You know, we do have excess manufacturing capacity given the volume performance over the past couple of years. We want to be careful not to, your point, take out so much that we don't have room to grow. So we're being very intentional about this. Within our other manufacturing plants, we've shuttered some lines, but we can bring those back into service when volume returns.\nWe're right-sizing the workforce. You know, over time, you can flex the workforce up and down depending on the volume growth. But, you know, beyond the fixed cost, addressing the fixed cost deleverage, we've got a lot of other initiatives in play. We've got the procurement savings. A lot of that is enabled by the investments we've made in the ERP system. We've got changes to our operating model where we're getting better leverage out of our management layer. We're going after everything, you know, travel and expense. We're looking at, you know, third-party contracts. So we're pushing on every cost lever that is available, and that's what's going to drive the incremental productivity in the second half.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Can you hear me?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Hi, Steve.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Great. Hey, Ramon. So if we stay on North America, but maybe pivot to the top line, both PFNA and PBNA, your prepared remarks run through a number of initiatives that you have underway to leverage the capabilities that you just talked about in response to Bonnie's question to drive improved momentum. And I guess my question is, if there's a way to distill those initiatives down to maybe the top one, two, or three things that you would say are the most critical, the most important to get right as we run through the back half of the year to drive improvement. And then I guess relatedly, what does success look like as we think about exiting the year in both those divisions? You know, where do you want to be?\nWhere does your outlook kind of assume that you will be in terms of the run rate exiting the year? Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Steve, hi. Listen, I'll give you a bit of a sense of what we're trying to do in the two businesses. We're obviously in the food business. Our number one priority has been trying to stabilize the category as leaders in the category. We're always looking at the health of the category. We're trying to make granular investments in value, make sure that consumers stay within our brands, better entry points, better value every day. And that has been successful. Also, obviously, we're trying to improve our competitiveness within the different subsegments of the category. So we're happy at the progress in many of the subsegments of the food business.\nIf you think about the performance of Cheetos in the extruded segment, if you think about the performance of Doritos in tortilla chips, if you think about our permissible portfolio becoming much more relevant in our overall mix, it's over $2 billion with brands like SunChips, brands like PopCorners, brands like Siete now, and the relaunch of Simply, which has been done now over the summer. We're getting very, very good positive results. There's still work to do in potato chips. We're very encouraged by the latest, you know, last two periods' performance in unflavored tortilla chips with Tostitos on the right. So first priority, make sure the category is stabilized. Second, improve performance in each one of those subsegments. Success in some, more success coming. As you saw in the prepared remarks, we're relaunching Lay's. It's our biggest brand.\nWe're trying to elevate the real food perception of Lay's. If you think about the simplest and more natural snack, it's a potato chip. It's a potato. It's oil. And it's a little bit of salt, the most simpler, no artificials as we go into the end of the year. And also, we're relaunching Tostitos because we think we can also elevate the food credentials of the brands. And that's what we're going to be doing in Q4 and Q1. So that's foods. Now, one element that maybe is not captured in Circana so much, but it's been the focus of the business for many, many quarters now a year is our Away-from-Home business. We've been putting a lot of emphasis on Away-from-Home. That's giving us a lot of incremental locations to the category.\nOur products and our focus is giving us very good returns, both in foods and in beverages. When it comes to beverages, the focus has been in improving colas. Colas is a good success for us. We've been focusing on the no-sugar colas. We've been focusing on Food and Pepsi. We've been focusing on the taste challenge. Those three elements have driven, you know, share positive share performance for Pepsi, which is something we feel very good about, not only in the US, but globally. Now, the other big focus for us has been sports, make sure that Gatorade recovers share in sports. That's, you know, first half of the year we're gaining share. Then adding some new platforms to the functional hydration with Propel being a great success if you think about the last few years and how that brand continues to develop.\nNow, what would be success for us? Success would be sequential improvement of our top line, sequential improvement of our share of market performance with a goal to be back at the low end of our algorithm in top line over the next few quarters. That would be success. That's where we're really having a sense of urgency as an organization. And all the businesses are improving all the operational metrics, are very focused on delivering that over the next few quarters. That's our goal. And we will try to be there over the next few quarters.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nFilipo Falorni\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone. Ramon, I wanted to go back to one of your comments on the Away-from-Home, which is a bright spot, definitely in the results. Can you give us a sense of how big is Away-from-Home, both for the beverage side and the food side? And you called out in the PBNA, it was up high single digits in the quarter. Should we expect that to continue in the balance of the year? And maybe also a little bit longer term, what's the opportunity longer term for your Away-from-Home business? Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Listen, Away-from-Home for us is a way, obviously, as consumers move their consumption patterns to more calories away from home, it is obviously an opportunity for us to create more occasions, accelerate growth in our categories, and growth in our brands. So it's been a focus for us for quite some time. It's been more of a physical availability effort. Now we're adding layers of innovation, some other solutions that in terms of mini meals and some ready-to-eat solutions that we'll talk to you in the future. But that will be beyond physical availability. That's what we're trying to do. Now, it is very sizable. It is a bigger part of the business in beverages than it is in foods. And it is margin accretive for both businesses. You know, it's a higher margin business for both beverages and snacks in, you know, in Away-from-Home than it is in retail.\nSo growth opportunity, very incremental, a focus area, and margin accretive. So, you know, you will see us talking about it more in the future. You will see us putting more resources against that channel. And also, as I said, having more innovation beyond what is the physical availability of our products in those channels.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nGood morning, Dara.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nSo, Jamie, I just wanted to maybe extend Bonnie's productivity question a bit to full year earnings. Can you just help us understand your visibility and the assumptions behind the acceleration in the back half of the year relative to the first half? It's a pretty large magnitude. Obviously, currency is a big swing factor. That helps. But I imagine a lot of that is eaten up by tariffs. So just trying to understand your level of confidence there, what the key drivers are. Is it mainly productivity, or are there other factors there? And then also just longer term, Ramon or Jamie, as you think about investing behind the business, I'm not hearing a ton about reinvestment on this call. So just can you talk about the decision to sort of drop that to the bottom line versus reinvest behind the business?\nObviously, some nice growth internationally, opportunity to continue to invest there. You're looking to drive better trends in North America, still below long-term goals from a top-line standpoint. So just curious how reinvesting behind the business fits into your plans and the ability to accelerate organic sales growth as we look out beyond this year?\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nSo, Dara, I'll start on the confidence level with productivity. I'd put that at high. When you look at the phasing of this, as we got into 2025, I would say it became increasingly clear that the external environment was going to be pretty challenging. So, you know, end of Q1 into the beginning of Q2, we doubled down on identifying incremental initiatives to drive the ramp-up in productivity, which will start to accrue. You know, the incremental productivity really accrues in the second half of the year. So we've got all the actions identified, some we've already executed on. So a very high degree of confidence there. On tariffs, we've factored that. Obviously, you know, it's a bit volatile, but we feel good about mitigating actions that we've already taken. We have some other mitigants that we have under consideration. So we've factored that into the back half.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. When it comes to reinvestment, there are a few areas that we're obviously first is technology. And we've been investing in technology for a long time. We'll continue to take a lot of our productivity, put it back into technology as we, obviously, that gives us additional intelligence and additional efficiency. So that's one area. We're investing a lot in value. We're doing that, although very surgically. And I think we're getting better at understanding the return on the investment in value. Right now, our biggest investments have been in entry points, have been in everyday low price across most of the, you know, the key categories. And then we're investing, as I was saying, in Away-from-Home. We're investing in building new capabilities so that we can drive physical availability outside of our retail channels and also innovation that will drive.\nNow, our A&M levels have been pretty high over the last five years. We've been putting a lot of A&M against the business or incremental A&M. We keep those levels going forward. I think the brands are, you know, sharpening their plans. We have better productivity as well in the A&M media space. So we feel we have enough resources there to defend the core and also build some incremental platforms for growth. So those are the big areas where we're thinking about reinvestment. I think we've been driving the company for the long term, you know, since I started. And that continues to be the way. We're looking at the business, you know, good levels of productivity to find good levels of investment in the business going long term.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. I wanted to talk a little bit about portfolio transformation. You've been pretty active on the permissibility side of things. And you spoke about the Simply Restage. I can tell you I've seen a ton of more incremental merchandising in display for the Simply lines in store. Yeah, a lot. And I was just curious, I guess, first specifically how that's going. Because I know that on Simply, something that you've spoken about in the past is that the impediment was not having the products or making them available. It was, frankly, consumer engagement and interest in them. So I'm curious on what kind of uptake you're seeing on that front. And then also in the release, you'd mentioned some upcoming innovation for Frito-Lay around fiber, protein, and other things and ingredient profile.\nI was just curious if you've done anything in terms of consumer testing. Because when I think about the brand equities, I would think an open question is whether or not some of your brands have the right to play, if you will, in a space like protein, in a space like fiber, and just how you're thinking through kind of the risk of diluting brand equity by stretching them too far. Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. That's a good question. So the permissible portfolio in foods, and obviously no sugar in beverages, and some functional platforms in beverages have been a focus of the company for now quite some time. Permissible snacks, which is where your question was going, has been; it's over a $2 billion business already. We're by far the largest permissible snacking company in the US with multiple platforms. So SunChips, a very successful platform based around multigrain. We have PopCorners, more focus on baked, never fried. You know, we have multiple now. We have Siete, obviously, as a new member of the family. And then Simply trying to address the no artificials and just natural in the big brands. Those platforms continue to grow. And I'm very happy that you're saying you're seeing more physical availability of Simply. That was the bottleneck for consumption.\nIt was not really consumer appetite for the product, but more availability of the product and the right affordability, the right price points that drive the trial. I think we've worked on both availability and affordability. That will drive trial. We're seeing increased trial in Simply. And those are great products that, you know, a lot of consumers that were kind of sitting on the fence of some of our large brands, Doritos, Cheetos, Lay's, and Ruffles, are now opting to come into the brand. So good feelings. And that will continue to be a focus of our A&M, of our sales force, as you saw, and our customer plans. Now, going into the future, a couple of big innovation ideas. One is the relaunch of Lay's and relaunch of Tostitos.\nThose are two huge platforms that we want to elevate the real food credentials of the two brands. These are very, you know, these are anchor on potatoes, anchor on corn, very traditional, you know, cooking methods on both, very simple ingredients, great food for our consumers. We will relaunch them. We'll put a lot of, you know, resources against. We'll eliminate artificial from those two big brands. And that will happen Q4 and Q1 and then into next year. Yes, we're also in our remarks, we're talking about some innovation in more functional spaces with our food business. Yes, protein in some brands like PopCorners, some brands like the Quaker snacks, and eventually in some of our larger brands. And to your question, we've been very surprised, positively surprised, how consumers are seeing our brands expanding into those more functional spaces with credibility. So we'll push hard.\nThe big push to protein, though, is going to be on our beverage business, where we have some big launches coming up in Q4 and Q1. We will be participating in the liquid protein space with, I think, superior propositions that have no artificials, that are great tasting, and that I think will give us the, you know, the return on what is clearly a consumer trend that is scaling up in the US. And it's part of the repertoire of our consumers. So those are the areas. We will obviously talk more in the coming quarters. It's a little bit early. And we, obviously, for confidential reasons, competitive reasons, we don't want to disclose too much at this point.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.\n\nMichael Lavery\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you. Good morning. Just maybe shifting gears a little bit to international, it's done quite nicely. And just maybe you gave some color in the prepared remarks, obviously, but hoping you could maybe call out a couple of the key drivers, just some of what's really driving, you know, working there. And then maybe if there's any watch-outs for the second half or even opportunities for further acceleration, you can flag and just unpack that a little bit for us.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. I mean, yeah, international has been a success story for us. It's been a focus of the company. Obviously, we're very developed in the US. International is a big opportunity for growth, a lot of consumers, and a lot of opportunities for per caps and frequency build in most of the markets, developed and developing. We continue to invest in international, both foods and snacks, foods and beverages. Both categories are doing well. Mid-single digit growth, that's where we're trying to continue, balance of the year. That's what's in our guidance and our long term, how we think about the business long term. So yeah, in terms of specific markets, I would say we're very pleased with LATAM. We're very pleased with some parts of Europe where we see, you know, strength. We're pleased with some parts of the Middle East. China, a little bit weaker.\nAs you think about the Chinese consumer post-Chinese New Year, a little bit softer. India continued to be a, you know, double-digit growth. So, you know, overall, I would say our business, you know, strong competitiveness. We continue to invest in category growth, which at the end is the long-term driver of the business. And the important thing for us is this was a business that had the profitability was below PepsiCo average in the past. Now it is accreted to PepsiCo. So it is a very good investment opportunity for us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Reserch Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Ramon, I wanted to go back to your response to Steve's question on just what success looks like. I think you mentioned potentially returning to the organic growth at kind of the low end of the algorithm. Can you maybe just give us a sense in terms of your level of confidence or visibility into getting to that today where we sit today versus maybe where we've been, you know, over the last kind of 12 months? You know, it sounds like you're more confident today versus where we've been. I'm not sure if that's a fair statement or not. If so, what kind of drives that improved confidence? Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. The confidence comes from we see sustained international growth, and we see a sequential improvement of our North America business. When you put that together, yes, we should go back to the low end of our long-term algorithm. Whether this is three Q3, Q4, I don't know. I don't have a magic ball. But clearly, the business is working on this. We're becoming much more competitive in multiple subsegments of the category. And we'll continue to be very granular on our investments, continue to increase our productivity so we can reinvest back in value and portfolio innovation. And the Away-from-Home business, which, as I said, is giving us a lot of great returns. And we'll continue to do that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. So Ramon, you spoke about permissible offerings. And I know how much effort the company has been putting into these offerings for a very long time. But you're getting to $2 billion out of like close to $27 to 30 billion in sales in North America for convenience foods. And assuming that includes also Siete, your acquisitions, why do you think, I mean, just as a step back, that, you know, why do you think the consumer, as the consumer is searching for healthy snacks, this share of healthy snacks for you did not improve that much relative to what I think the consumer desire is? So perhaps, you know, in this high single digit percentage of total, how do you can, how can you kind of improve that as you go forward?\nAnd do you think that it's more of a form situation where you obviously have a massive market share, which, I mean, benefits you and obviously kudos to that effort in chips? And then the consumer is more looking for different forms. And perhaps, you know, the right to win is in forms like shakes or nuts or fruits or protein bars that you may not have. And if that's the case, why not leaning towards more of that and perhaps for acquisitions? So I just want to take a step back and think about strategically.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Yeah, Andrea, it's a good question. I think when you think about permissibility in our category, I would include, I mean, some of the levers we have, obviously, is innovation and portfolio, as you were referring to. So a lot of the multiple choices that we're giving consumers. And we'll give that platform or those platforms much more visibility and affordability because those were drivers that maybe we were not emphasizing enough in the past. Now, clearly, there is. But think about the other lever of permissibility in our category is portion control. I think portion control will be critical going forward. And our brands will be in consumer lives more and more, but in smaller portions.\nIf you think about the efforts that we've been putting for many, many years now in building a multi-pack business, a variety pack business, a single-serve business, right now, over 60% of our volume in the US food business is in smaller formats. That will continue to grow. I think it's a great way for our brands to participate in what is a very healthy diet and improve the permissibility of our category in general. So think about permissibility probably in broader sense. Obviously, there is, it is an ingredient element. It is a cooking method element. It is a format and, you know, number of calories per serving. So there's a lot of levers that we're playing because I think the number of occasions will continue to grow for our category. We want to participate in those occasions as, you know, on-the-go lifestyles will continue to develop.\nThat is the long-term opportunity for our categories: participate on-the-go lifestyles with permissible solutions, affordable solutions that are in consumers' lives in multiple occasions. That's what we're trying to do. I'm very optimistic about the growth opportunities of our food business. I'm also extremely, obviously, optimistic about the growth opportunities in our beverage business, where clearly permissibility with the no-sugar offerings and the functionality of the category, both with hydration, with energy, with, you know, protein, is already more developed than it is in the food business.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Galbo\n\nDirector, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, Ramon and Jamie. Thanks for the question. Ramon, you know, just going back through your comments on kind of sequential improvement expected in the food business, you know, over the rest of the year and maybe even in the next year, just maybe wanted to put that into context of Q3 in particular as you kind of lapse some of the promotional efforts from last year. The volume compare is a bit more difficult. So is it possible that we see maybe a step back in that volume trend before it reaccelerates or kind of how we should think about it there again over the course of the year? Thanks very much.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nPeter, I will not go into the details. My question was, PepsiCo will get to the low end of its long-term top-line algorithm in the next few quarters as a combination of international business continuing to perform at a very high level and sequential improvement in our North America business.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nKaumil Gajrawala\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Ramon, that was quite the tease on the big launch in protein. Does anything you could add? I'm sure we'd all be interested. You know, is it an existing brand, new brand, you know, any context? And then on, you know, when I look at your comments in the opening remarks, many of the comments started with a focus on value as being responsible for this improvement in inflections. Can you maybe just talk about sort of the journey in offering more value where you feel you are? Is there more work to do, or are things reset into a place that you like? Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Listen, with regards to the protein, I think protein is clearly a subsegment in our food and beverages categories that is growing fast. Consumers are adopting protein solutions in the diets at a pace that was not, you know, the case a few months back, a few years back. So we, as we always do, we follow the consumer, and we're trying to offer consumer solutions, not small solutions, but solutions with our big brands because that's the beauty of our company. And we can provide democratized solutions at large scale. That's what we're trying to do. You will hear more in the due time. And it's not, you know, it's not too long from now. It's a few months from now that we'll obviously make more detailed announcements of our new platforms.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nAnd on affordability, for sure. And I mean affordability. You said value. So value has a number of dimensions, one of which is affordability, but it's also availability. It's variety. And, you know, we pull on all of those levers. And we expect to continue to innovate and change in response to how the consumers are defining value in the marketplace. And we're able to do that. Our analytics are getting much sharper as we've invested a lot in data and IT. So yeah, we'll continue to use value as a lever. And affordability, we're addressing with a lot more precision, so by channel, by pack size, by time of the month.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Ottenstein\n\nSenior Managing Director and Partner, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Just a couple of follow-up questions, if I may. Revisiting the international business, beverages did much better than food. Can you talk maybe a little bit about the drivers of why the beverages did so well? You mentioned Sting. You know, I think for the first time that I can remember, you know, I know it's an energy drink that's big in Southeast Asia. I think you got it from the Rockstar transaction. So a little bit about your international strategy on the beverage side. And then a follow-up on the, you know, the comments about North America and that integration. Is the integration that you're working on to such an extent that it would preclude any future consideration of refranchising, or would that be an option in the future, even with the integration? Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. A couple of things. So Sting is a brand that we created in, actually originated in Vietnam and now is available in multiple markets in developing and emerging markets. And it's part of our Formula One now sponsorship. And it's a brand that we think, I mean, we know it has opportunities in many markets across our portfolio of markets. Now, beverages has been a successful story for us. We've been gaining share in multiple markets. And basically, we have three big platforms that we're focusing on. One is No Sugar Colas, No Sugar CSDs, but Colas in particular. And No Sugar Pepsi has been an amazing success in many, many markets, in, you know, in many markets around the world. We're leaders in Colas because of Pepsi, No Sugar. Second platform is energy. And Sting plays a big role in that portfolio, but not only.\nWe have other brands that are very successful in multiple markets. Third platform is hydration. In hydration, Gatorade plays an important role. Gatorade can grow meaningfully around the world. We're tweaking the American propositions to better fit the, you know, the profile of international consumers in many markets. So those are the, we're also, I think our bottlers are improving their performance. They're investing in their technologies and in their execution. You know, there's a good, a very good partnership between us and our bottlers. That obviously is resulting in better performance. We don't see any reason why this would not continue in the coming years. We have now a very dedicated organization, international beverages franchise, that is a great way of connecting end-to-end the whole world and making sure that we focus on the right platforms.\nWe leverage platforms like Champions League, like Formula One, and others to create growth, you know, for long-term for us.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nThe other point I'd make is on the international foods business. In a number of D&E markets, we have what I'll call some basic food products. They tend to be very heavy but low value per pound. They also tend to be pretty volatile. If you look at just our savory snacks within international and exclude those basic foods, the growth rate would be about four points higher.\nYeah. When it comes to North America, what I said earlier, this is a big opportunity for us to, and it's not available to many other companies, to synergize two large operating businesses that are sitting side by side, servicing the same geographies, the same customers, and the same consumers. And that is, for us, is a huge idea to optimize how we do most of the tasks in our value chain, how we do this at low cost and a better performance. So this will be our priority and where we will focus our efforts for the next three, four years to capture value and come out of this as a lower-cost business and better-performing business.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nChris Carey\n\nEquity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about PBNA. Well, actually, and just in the context of the global beverage business. You know, the president made some comments last night about ingredient changes or ingredient evolution in one of your competitors. And it got me thinking in a way is, you know, how flexible, you know, is the system to responding to, you know, ingredient changes? And I'm really asking this in the context of the prepared remarks, you know, talked about, you know, removing artificial flavors from a number of ingredients from a number of food offerings.\nYou know, it really got me thinking about, you know, the beverage side and where you see this portfolio today and that kind of evolution toward healthier, you know, and cleaner ingredients and kind of how you see your North America versus international businesses, you know, on that journey of, you know, X percent today. But we think, you know, we can be, you know, at X percent, you know, in the coming years in whether our North America international business. So it's really about the evolution of, you know, cleaner ingredients within your beverage portfolio and how flexible the system is to respond to those, you know, changing requirements. Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nListen, same journey that we have in foods we're following in beverages. This is a consumer-centric strategy. We're following the consumer. If the consumer is telling us that they prefer products that have sugar and they prefer products that have natural ingredients, we will give the consumer products that have sugar and have natural ingredients. So this is a journey of following the consumer, trying to be a little bit maybe one step ahead of the consumer, but not too many steps. And it applies to both beverages and foods. In particular, we have a journey and a technical roadmap to eliminate artificial colors and artificial flavors from our beverages the same as we do for our food business. And we'll be able to execute as the regulations evolve or consumer preferences evolve.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our last question comes from Kevin Grundy with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\n\nKevin Grundy\n\nManaging Director, BNP Paribas\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Ramon, I wanted to come back to North America beverages and energy drinks. It's an area we haven't spent a ton of time on, but it was certainly an area when you took over, you kind of drew a line in the sand, I think, if you'd agree with that characterization, say you wanted to see PepsiCo play in a more substantial way. I think Rockstar has probably proven to be a little bit more difficult to turn, Kickstart, sort of same deal with Mountain Dew and sort of difficulty gaining traction.\nSo I'd like to get your updated thoughts on sort of overall satisfaction with the energy drink strategy, kind of how you see the role of Celsius, potentially Alani Nu, not asking you to make any comments, of course, that you can't, but just looking out over the next three to five years, what would you share with investors? What would you share with the market? What would success in energy drinks look like from a PepsiCo perspective? Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Listen, we continue to see energy as a large and growing category in our beverage business. And consumers are adopting those beverages in their lifestyle. And I think that will continue. The way we're participating is multiple, right? We're participating in ownership of some businesses like Celsius. And we're also, you know, creating value by distributing, you know, some of those brands in the marketplace. And that makes our business stronger with our customers, but also, obviously, we create value from our infrastructure and our assets. So that's the way we're participating. On top of that, we have a JV with Starbucks that is very successful and that will continue to provide energy solutions, energy plus solutions, not only energy in the coming years.\nThat's another way how PepsiCo extracts value both from the ownership of the JV and also, obviously, the distribution of those beverages in the marketplace. As the consumer evolves and there might be different spaces that get created, how maybe sports drinks and energy get combined in the future, we'll be able to create as well solutions with some of our platforms that satisfy those needs for consumers. I think it's both from an innovation point of view, from an ownership of, in the case of the JV with Starbucks, or participating in the ownership of Celsius. Then, obviously, leveraging our vast distribution infrastructure for both away from home and for small format, basically, where these drinks get a lot of consumption and where a lot of value gets created, we will continue to participate.\nSo think about our long-term value creation in energy, which I think is a long-term growth part of the category, you know, in that way. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for a good call. Thank you for joining us today. As we were saying during the call, we're very pleased with our performance in Q2. Also, we have the right tools and we're taking the right steps to deliver on the year and create a very stronger PepsiCo for the long term. We see a lot of opportunities for growth across our categories and we're making the right investments to deliver on those opportunities. Thank you again and have a great summer.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. So that concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

Your lines have been placed on listen only until it's your turn to ask a question. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\n\nRavi Pamnani\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, PepsiCo\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans, updated 2025 guidance, and outlook. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, 24 April 2025, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to our Q1 2025 Earnings Release and Q1 2025 Form 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements.\nJoining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta, and PepsiCo's Executive Vice President and CFO, Jamie Caulfield. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. With that, I will turn it back over to the operator for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. In order to ask a question or make a comment, please press star followed by one one on your touch-tone phone at any time. We'll pause for a moment while we compile our Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nOperator\n\nMorning.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. I have a question on Frito-Lay. Last quarter, you emphasized your step-up investments with a particular focus on improved price pack architecture and then also an emphasis on the sizable away-from-home opportunity. So, Ramon, I'd be curious to hear how some of those investments are paying off and then if you're making any changes to your strategy, especially given the pressured consumer environment. For instance, do you now see a need to increase your investments to ultimately return Frito-Lay back to growth? Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nThank you, Bonnie. I think we're executing the playbook that we talked about late last year or early this year. The playbook has multiple legs. One is, as you said, granular, good return on invested value investments. The second is portfolio transformation. The third is operational excellence in a broader way, execution, and cost. We're executing the three pillars with a sense of urgency at Frito-Lay. We're starting to see the returns on some of the value and new price points investments that we're making. It's still early in the rollout of the strategy, but if you think about our dual-size strategy in single-serve, so below $2, above $2, where we have executed that strategy, we're seeing a meaningful improvement in units, especially when we attach the kind of below $2 to meal deals. That is especially in convenience stores.\nWe're also seeing when you take multi-pack, and multi-pack has been a big growth segment of the business for the last few years. We're seeing the 10-count assortment. We've increased that assortment as an entry, a much lower price point for consumers. That's also delivering good returns. So we're optimistic that as we execute the playbook, the full playbook, including take-home eventually later in the year, that that's going to keep consumers in the category and it's going to increase the frequency of consumption of those consumers, which at the end is what we're trying to do with new price pack. At the same time, we're working hard at portfolio transformation, and that is a key pillar, offering consumers more options, where consumers want to go. And basically, here is more permissibility, more functionality in our snacks.\nAnd we're also working on improving the operational excellence of Frito-Lay, both in terms of right-sizing the cost, improving the field rates, and improving the granular execution in go-to-market. Frito-Lay went through an SAP implementation. It just finished. And like any big system implementation, there has been some learnings for the organization. I think in the coming months that will be behind us, and it will clearly have an impact on improved service levels and better visibility to execution. So that is the full playbook. And we will keep investing and we'll keep making sure that that business continues to grow for the long term. And that's the perspective we're putting on the business all the time.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Good morning. I was hoping that you could maybe just decompose in a bit more detail just the drivers of the reduced full-year earnings outlook. With organic growth not really changing in the aggregate, the implication is that the vast majority of that, if not all of that, is related to tariffs. If that's right, just kind of the pockets of tariff friction that you're encountering and plans long-term to offset it, assuming they stick around. But then also, if there's other things in there, if there are incremental investments, just sort of the relative bridge between prior full-year outlook and today. Thank you.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nHey, Steve. It's Jamie. The rationale behind the guidance adjustment that we announced today is really driven by three things. In a number of ways, they're a little bit related to one another. The first is tariffs. That is new news since we gave our initial guidance at the beginning of the year. We've factored in what we know about tariffs today, and we factored in mitigation plans, which we continue to work. Some of those we'll be able to execute more quickly. Some of those will take more time to execute. The second is just the heightened macro and consumer uncertainty. I'm sure you saw the consumer confidence index. That's really nosedived. Relative to where we were three months ago, we probably aren't feeling as good about the consumer now as we were a few months ago.\nAnd then third, and this is also related to the consumer picture, is Frito-Lay's subdued performance. And we've got clear plans to continue to turn the business around, but that'll take a little while too. Now, on the top-line guidance, you saw Q1 versus our low single-digit guide for the year. We put up 1% as we called out in the prepared remarks because our international quarter is only two months for the Q1. If we included the third month in the Q1, we would have grown too. So we're solidly in the band of top-line guidance that we gave back at the beginning of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.\n\n[Company Representative] (PepsiCo)\n\nCompany Representative, PepsiCo\n\nIt has great momentum. I mentioned it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the expectation for the international business going forward. Clearly, solid 5% growth in the quarter. You mentioned also including the March, your total company would have been 2% organic. So you're expecting an acceleration from here. Any color you could provide will be great. Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYes. Good morning, Filippo. Listen, the international business continues to be the kind of the largest growth engine for the company. We continue to invest in that business, as you well said. It started the year at a good pace. If you take March, even faster. We see the international business continuing those trends during the balance of the year. There are markets that we're seeing a bit of a slowdown in the consumer, namely China. China is a market where we've seen the consumer hurting a little bit. We're seeing Mexico, in a way, impacted by what happens in the US. I think those two markets will continue to be connected in consumer sentiment and probably consumer disposable income as well. We're seeing Europe navigating quite well. The first signs that we have in Europe are positive. We're seeing India in a good place.\nWe're seeing Brazil in a good place. So overall, the portfolio of markets where we have the highest percentage of business are in a positive place. And we see the international business continuing to contribute to our growth at a, that mid-single digit. Some markets, obviously, high single digits in the balance of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. So just wanted to follow up on Bonnie's question. The magnitude and durability of the volume weakness in Frito in North America continues to disappoint. So it was helpful to hear about all the fixes you're putting in place here today, as well as at CAGNI. Just wanted to get your perspective on if at some point you think we might need a more substantial level of reinvestment behind FLNA to turn around trends in that business, some type of more dramatic step-up in investment. And maybe you can split that into just potentially the need to reinvest more on pricing in this consumer environment or investing more behind the business, whether it's frontline spend or marketing, and just how you think about that balance in this consumer environment and if you might need more aggressive plans at some point to turn around trends there. Thanks.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nHey, Dara, Jamie. Look, the way we're managing through this is we want to make sure we protect the long-term health of the franchise. We've talked about providing value to the consumer, so we're doing that. But we're not going to do it in a way that we damage the long-term health and profitability of the business. We are driving greater levels of productivity to provide the investment that we're making in the business. And that's not only in revenue management tactics, but it's also in stepping up our execution capability. And the other part, on productivity, is we are looking at how do we, as you saw in the Q1, quite a bit of fixed cost deleverage. So we're going after costs with even more intentionality.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. I think the three pillars that we talked, they are equally important. So the value investment is relevant, and it impacts our core brands. I think putting more intelligence behind the investment, making sure that we get the best return, that for every occasion and for every channel, we have the right package versus destroying value by over-investing in value. I think that is an intelligent reinvestment of value is an important one. Now, it is as critically important for us to make sure that we participate in all the subsegments of the market where the consumers are going. The consumers love existing spaces, but they're also driving consumption in other spaces where we need to participate very intentionally. That's what we're doing. There are some moves we're making organically. We obviously have visibility to next year's innovation plan. They're very strong.\nAnd we're also making some acquisitions, as you saw, between Sabra and Siete. We have now two platforms to drive additional participation in new segments. And the third pillar is not something that is small. The operational excellence of the business is improving. We now have better data. We have better systems. We have talent stability. COVID was a disruption for the organization. We have better leaders in place. And we've gone through a system implementation that has been, in a way, a little bit complex, as you imagine a business of that size, that it's also behind us. So you should think about a multiple-vector execution that will drive the performance of the business. Value being important and good return on investment in value, it's how we're thinking about our investments in that part of the business.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to go back, sorry, to Frito-Lay North America. As you look at the price tiers, are you seeing more declines in the higher price points or in bigger packs? So in other words, on a comparable basis, and Ramon, you spoke over the past, I would say, few quarters, even about reaching your multi-pack, reaching 5 billion against 1 billion business before. Is that the 4% decline that we saw, I think, in the 10-Q, correct me if I'm wrong, just on Frito-Lay North America, in declining volumes? On average, are you seeing a much deeper decline in those large packs where consumers may be thinking, maybe feeling more pressure because of the cash outlay? And conversely, you're seeing less or smaller declines in the small packs?\nI mean, I'm trying to gauge where on a mixed neutral basis, are you seeing those movements and how you're reacting to those? Or in other words, are you tapped off that multi-pack at some point, and both of them are declining at similar bases, and how to protect that?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Dara, revenue management really is becoming more complex as consumers are feeling more challenged with their disposable income. That obviously is different for different levels of income across the American consumer. Now, what we're seeing is that consumers are giving a lot of value to absolute dollars now. So clearly, entry price points and absolute outlay of money per unit is a very important, relevant metric. So we're putting more emphasis on those entry price points and making sure that we're not asking for a large amount of money for participating in our brands. That is something. That's why smaller single-serve, smaller multi-packs, those are all tools for us to keep the consumers in the brand and make sure that the frequency is there as well. There are different behaviors beginning of the month versus end of the month.\nSo, maybe beginning of the month, consumers are looking for more kind of price per kilos or more quantities at a good value. End of the month, maybe absolute price per unit. And again, very complex how that works per occasion and per cohort. So those are where, I think, the intelligence, the data, the tools that we have now in the hands of our people can help us get the best return on the investment. Now, there is a channel that is convenience stores that is impacted. There's less traffic in the channel. And our participation in that channel is very relevant, both in beverages and snacks. So how do we help our partners in the convenience store business to have traffic but also have higher incidence is a very important part of our operating plan. And that's why I was referring to meal deals.\nI was referring to some specific offers that we're having in that channel because that is an important part of our business, and it's impacting our single-serve performance.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could talk a little bit around how the business can deal with some of the new legislation around ingredients and colors. And sort of, I know you've got lots of technology and lots of technology in different markets around the world. But if the outlook currently builds in some of the incremental costs you'll need to be absorbing to manage through this. And also, do you have any perspective on SNAP? I know there's just a lot out there. But anything you can offer on sensitivity to business or exposure to business with regard to SNAP? Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nThat's great. Two good questions. And very, very relevant. We've been leading the transformation of the industry now for a long time on sodium reduction, sugar reduction, and better fats. And we already have a portfolio. When we talk about the US and the food business, 60+% of our business today doesn't have any artificial colors. So we're well undergoing that transition. And for example, brands like Lay's will be out of artificial colors by the end of this year, the same with Tostitos, so some of our big brands. So we're well underway. Ideally, obviously, we stand by the science and where products are very safe, and there's nothing to worry about this. But we understand that there's going to be probably a consumer demand for more natural ingredients, and we're going to be accelerating that transition.\nIdeally, we can do this in a very pragmatic, orchestrated way as an industry and not create unnecessary panic or chaos. But we'll lead that transition. And in the next couple of years, we'll have migrated all the portfolio into natural colors or at least provide the consumer with natural color options. And obviously, every consumer will have the opportunity to choose what they prefer. So that's the journey we're undergoing. In terms of SNAP, again, there's a lot of conversation in different states, and we're seeing that some of our categories could be exposed to some restrictions. I think this will have a very limited impact in the business as we are calculating today. And we'll need to see how the eventual legislation gets implemented. It's still a lot of unknowns on how this is going to be happening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with B of A. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. So Ramon, maybe just to step back, the last few years, some of the messaging, I think, if I've heard it correctly from you, has been, as you're looking at the business over the next few years, right, more of the growth sourced from international, and you've done a lot, right? The company has done a lot to build and begin to scale more international, more countries contributing growth. So I know some of this has maybe been forced by the external environment. But when we look at the top line in Q2, if we had three full months of international, it just seems like from a revenue perspective, your international contribution kind of puts you in a position to maintain the longer-term growth objectives, even with what would be, I guess, a natural slowing of Frito in North America.\nSo one, is that kind of the right way to think about this? And then second, if that's true, are we scaled enough to be able to drive profit growth alongside revenue growth if it's a more international-heavy revenue model, I guess, over the next few years? So I guess what I'm basically asking is, are we at a point now where international can really contribute more if Frito is going to kind of naturally slow to a more modest growth over time?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nI think, I mean, this is a great question, Bryan, and it's probably for a long conversation. I think international will continue to be a growth and profit key driver for the company for the long term. If you look at the population inside or outside of the company or outside of the US and how developed our per capita are internationally versus in the US, you could see right away that that is the growth. Fortunately, we're now at a stage in the growth development of the company where that business is accredited to the company. So two elements: high growth, high right to succeed in those markets, in the majority of those markets, both in beverages and in snacks and foods, and accredited business. That part, and we'll continue to invest. We're investing in capacity. We're investing in talent. We're investing in go-to-market.\nWe're investing in portfolio and the brands. That will continue. Now, what I disagree with you is in the fact that the US business cannot grow at a faster speed than it is growing today. I think the US business, both beverages and foods, will continue to grow at a very good rate in the US. When you think about the overall opportunity, both from the better execution to evolving the portfolio to moving into new channels like away from home, we have tremendous opportunities to take our brands into new spaces, leverage the capability of our business.\nAnd now that we have an operating model that will be more integrated in the US, that will give us more resources, will be less duplicated in some areas, and synergize in other areas where we can drive growth in new service models, direct-to-consumer, direct-to-B2B, whatever we choose to play. So, I think the US, we see it as a growth driver. We see it as a source of funding for the rest of the world, but also a growth opportunity for the company way above where we are today. I think we are today in a parenthesis given by all the consumer dynamics and some other dynamics that are happening in the US. But that will go through. We'll have a more relevant portfolio. We'll be in the relevant channels. We'll have the right price points, and the consumer will be in a better place eventually in the US.\nSo we see the two components of growth. Obviously, international, we will grab that opportunity with the right investments, the right talent, the right brand strategies, and challenge strategies. But the US is a great opportunity for us, and we think we have the right to win, and we have the fundamentals of brands and market presence to capture that opportunity as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Lavery\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you. Good morning. I just wanted to unpack the guidance change a little bit further. You touched on the three pieces: the tariffs, the macro uncertainty, and the Frito-Lay North America weakness. But the second and third have a top-line component, and you've held the revenue outlook constant. Is it just because the impact is modest enough to be in the wiggle room of low single digits, or is it an offset from international? I guess, how do we think about the top-line piece that's wrapped into that? And then just on the tariff piece, is your outlook based on current estimates? And I guess just simply, would we be right to assume that if, for example, the 90-day pause gets extended or if there's any changes there, it could certainly drive some upside if you get a little relief out of that?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nOkay. So I think there were two questions in there. The first, Michael, yeah, the momentum in international is one of the key underpinnings of the guidance that we reiterated on the top line. And as I mentioned, you look at the Q1, sort of normalize it for the accounting calendar thing, and we're right in the middle of that low single-digit guidance. On tariffs, we're not going to get too much into piecemeal analysis. We based our guidance on what we observe today. We've run various scenarios of what could happen. And I think based on what we know today, that's what we factored into the guidance.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nKaumil Gajrawala\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, guys. It's Bring Your Kid to Work Day at Jefferies. So if you don't mind, my daughter Milena's going to ask the question.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nAwesome.\n\n[Company Representative] (Jefferies)\n\nCompany Representative, Jefferies\n\nWhat do you think about the launch of GLP-1 oral medications coming to market next year?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nThat was entirely her own. Yeah, it's good. It's good. I think it's relevant. And again, I would, Kaumil, and I don't know your daughter's name, but obviously, we've been transforming the portfolio, and we'll continue to give the consumer offerings that help them in any sort of dietary preferences that they have. So whether they're in a GLP-1 situation or they're not, we will keep providing them. What we're seeing with GLP-1 consumers is, again, they're driving more consumption on protein space, on fiber, and on hydration. I think we're well-positioned for both fiber and hydration solutions, and we will increase the availability of products in those two areas. I think we're a bit less well-positioned in protein, and we're innovating. Our teams are working on innovation for, again, protein both in the beverage and the food business. You will see some late this year, early next year.\nAnd that's the space that I think we can capture more incremental value. Now, the other thing we're seeing in GLP-1 consumers is that they're keeping our brands in their repertoire, probably in a smaller portion. So they're going for, and that's the way they're actually eating across most of their choices. They're eating less quantity. So our offerings in small portions, and whether it's in multi-pack or some other options that we provide, keeps our brands in their repertoire, and it's still relevant. So again, portfolio transformation, portion control, and the right offerings for those consumers will make sure that our brands stay relevant to those consumers. And I don't know whether the current participation, I think, is about an 8, 7, 8%, and there's obviously still a lot of trial and error from consumers in that space.\nBut I think it's going to be relevant in the future and something that every food company is thinking about, and we're obviously thinking about it and reacting.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst] (Evercore)\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nYeah. Hi. This is Greg on for Robert. We have two questions on the PBNA business. I guess first, if you could talk about kind of the rationale behind the acquisition of Poppi and what you're planning to do with the brand. And then second of all, if you could talk about the drivers for PBNA margins, kind of how you're thinking about that segment and the setup and kind of any new thoughts on where you see the margin goal being over the medium term. Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. We're feeling good about our beverage business in North America. We made choices a few years ago. We're executing those choices, and I think we're executing quite well. I need to thank the team for their focus and their good execution of the playbook. Now, one of the key pillars was improving the margin of the business. You can see this in the multi-year trend that we keep improving. Q1 was a good step in the right direction. I think there's opportunities still to become a better operating business and keep driving better excellence out of everything of our value chain from making, moving, and selling. So good progress there. We're also very optimistic about our brands. If you think about our soft drink business or CSD business, Pepsi is growing faster than in the last few years.\nPepsi actually is starting to gain share of carbonated soft drinks. It's been the focus on zero sugar. It's been the focus on Pepsi, food, and all the activation of the brand in that space that is giving us very good results. We're also happy with Gatorade. Gatorade is also a business that is starting to regain share in the sports drink category. If you add to that Propel and the functional hydration, that space, clearly, we're leaders, and we keep driving better performance. Now, our powders and tablets, our enhancer business is also gaining share. That is, again, a multi-pronged strategy that is starting to deliver for us. We feel good about it. There are areas where we need to keep improving, right? If you think about Mountain Dew, we've been working on it for a while.\nThere's a big relaunch of the brand in a few weeks. We feel optimistic as well about Baja Blast being a good addition to the portfolio that will drive structural demand for the brand. We're feeling good about both the operating metrics improvement. We're feeling good about some of the brands. We're feeling good about some of the inorganic moves that we're making. Again, this is all subject to regulatory approval. When things are approved, then I think we can talk more about Poppi and how we're planning to integrate that into the business.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, Alfredo. Good morning, everyone. Ramon, I wanted to follow up on your commentary there around beverages and just the commentary around the portfolio. But can you maybe just give us an update on energy drinks? I think it's one of the few categories that has seen some sequential improvement year to date from a category perspective. Celsius has seen some improved performance as well. And then just when you think about your partnership with Celsius, they obviously have brought on a new brand and a lot of news. So can you just talk about your willingness to kind of bring that brand on through your distribution network? Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. We feel good about energy, and we feel good about the strategy and the partnerships that we have in this space. We're having conversations with Celsius, obviously, after they acquired new brands. And still, I would say early discussions about how we can find ways to participate or not in this new acquisition. It's still too early to make any kind of public comment on this.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\n\nChris Carey\n\nEquity Analyst and Head of Consumer Staples Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone. I did want to follow up on a question around PBNA, specifically on the Pepsi brand. It gained market share in the quarter, as highlighted in the prepared remarks, which is certainly encouraging. Do you think that this is the start of something that can be a bit more durable? What are your expectations for the brand from here? And then if we take a step back, it's a little bit like Bryan's question, but more toward North America and specifically on beverages. Your peers have delivered pretty dynamic results in their North American beverage business in recent years. Certainly, you've been active in the environment as well. But has your thought process on this business changed over time?\nI will tell you my personal view is that it feels like there's a lot of focus on margins from the investment community and less so from growth. Certainly, that wouldn't be your starting point with your pillars of profitable growth. But maybe just as you canvass this North America beverage environment over the past few years, has that evolved your thinking on what this business is capable of going through the medium term? Thanks so much.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. It's a very good question. I would refer back to my previous answer. We're feeling very good about the progress that we're making. These large businesses is about clear focus, clear trade-offs, clear areas of where you want to improve the business. Over time, you execute. We're feeling good about both the operational excellence. So the margin improvement is not only a margin improvement. It's an operational excellence. It's an operating improvement metrics across make, move, and sell. That's where the business is focused. So it is a long-term improvement in capabilities, in infrastructure, in data, and technology, and all that is being rolled out to make the business more capable, more granular, and more intelligent. Now, on the brands as well, obviously, we have been investing regularly and consistently in our brands with focus on Pepsi and Gatorade.\nAnd those two brands are starting to gain share. We feel good about the positioning. We feel good about the advertising. We feel good about the portfolio. If you think about Pepsi Zero, it's a great addition to the portfolio, and it's performing very well. If you think about Gatorade, rapid hydration is a big consumer space that we're participating with Gatorlyte. Gatorade Zero as well has been a good addition to the portfolio, a very large-scale part of the business now. And we're investing in powders and tablets because we see the consumer moving there. We're now going to have new infrastructure, new assets that help us increase our offerings and probably add more functionality to that part of the portfolio. I think there are still opportunities on the brand. Some of them will be organic.\nSome of that would be inorganically or through partnerships, as you mentioned, with Celsius and the energy space, with Starbucks and the coffee space. And we have also, I think, a pretty good development of the tea category ahead of us with our partnership with Unilever. So again, through a partnership, organic or inorganic, I think the portfolio, we have very good strategic intentions of where we want to take the portfolio, where the consumer is going. And we feel good about the progress we're making. This is not going to be an overnight. We knew that. This is going to be a year-after-year progress. But the way the business is performing, the way we're building the talent, the way we're building step by step, the capabilities of the business make us feel very good about this business long-term.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\n\nKevin Grundy\n\nManaging Director, BNP Paribas\n\nGreat. Thanks. Morning, everyone. Question for Ramon just on the decision to recast your segment results, but really from a strategic perspective. So as you're aware, it's not uncommon for such moves to be a precursor to more impactful strategic considerations from companies' boards, particularly when a stock's been under pressure. So I wouldn't expect you to front-run anything, of course, on a call like this today, but perhaps provide context, one, for the decision to recast your segment results, and then, two, what you believe investors may underappreciate about the story of PepsiCo that perhaps becomes more evident with the company's new financial segment reporting. So thank you for that.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Kevin, I think we have a new, as we think about maximizing the growth of the company in the future, we think there is an opportunity to both provide more focus in some parts of the business, either beverage or foods or operating model, COBO or FOBO, in our international business. So that has been the majority of the recast. And so it provides a separation of the FOBO business, international, versus the operating units where we control from the manufacturing all the way to the selling. And so this is a very simple way for our international business, which is very scaled today, to have a bit more focus on the value we provide to our partners in the FOBO business and the operating infrastructure around our company-owned businesses and how we apply technology and how we provide services to our operating units.\nSo it's more on the, \"Let's make sure that we're well positioned for the long-term growth of our international business and nothing else.\" Now, on the North America business, Quaker has been part of the food business now for a couple of years. So we're just recognizing something that is the way we're thinking about the business and running the business. And then the beverage business continues to be separate. Now, what we're adding in North America, it's a North America integration opportunity, both from running the business more efficiently in the short term, but most importantly, about how we can grow the business in a different way in the future, especially as we look at common infrastructure for some of our supply chain or some of our go-to-market models for particular channels where we can, I think the scale could give more value than the separation.\nAnd that's how you should be thinking about why we've made some of these changes. The North American one is not on the reporting. It's more on the operating. The international one is the reporting and the operating both.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThanks. COMO's daughter took my first question, but fortunately, I have a backup here. So last year, you characterized potato chips and other kind of unflavored chip products as being more commoditized. And that was where you wanted to be more forward on your promotional activity. And there's not much talk about that this year. So Ramon, I wanted to know, do you feel like, in terms of your value actions, you need to be more active on that part of the portfolio, or do you feel like you've got it where you need to be?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. I think the, I mean, the strategic intent remains the same. In areas where we have less consumer differentiation, we need to probably be a bit more intentional in our revenue management initiatives. In areas where we are more differentiated, we can probably be also more intentional, but in the other direction, right, in terms of capturing more value from consumers where our products provide more uniqueness, and obviously consumers will give us more recognition for that value. So nothing has changed. We're not talking the details because obviously we're not going so much into that space. But in the work the teams are doing, we understand where we provide value, and value is in the product, is in the brand, is in the experience, is in multiple elements of value.\nAnd then obviously where we have less differentiation or we provide less value, we need to have we can afford less gap versus competitors in terms of pricing. So I mean, the principle, the strategic principles of our pricing versus our value remain the same. Actually, I think we've gotten better at understanding really our value and the drivers of value and how then our pricing needs to reflect those elements in particular occasions or particular brands. So I think the organization has become more nuanced, more granular, more intelligent in what is a critical element of our profitability and our growth.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our last question comes from Charlie Higgs with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.\n\nCharlie Higgs\n\nDirector, Rothschild\n\nHi. Ramon and Jamie, hope you're both well. I just wanted to dig into the organic sales growth guidance, please, because I think you're now including high-inflation economies in that. Can I just confirm? What you're building in for the rest of the year as a contribution from these high-inflation economies? Thank you.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nSo yeah, I'll confirm that we do include it. And frankly, that was to put us on a comparable basis with many of our close-in peers. It's not going to be a significant part of the revenue generation for the year, and it wasn't a significant contributor in Q1.\n\nRavi Pamnani\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, Charlie, it's Ravi. It's immaterial, and there's no impact on earnings either, just to make sure we clarify that. Benefit or impact, nothing.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nGreat. Okay. I think this is the last question, and we close the call right now. Thank you very much for your participation. And obviously, thank you very much, especially for the trust you have in ourselves and in PepsiCo for your investment. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWell, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

Your lines have been placed on listen-only till it's your turn to ask a question. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\n\nRavi Pamnani\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, PepsiCo\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans, guidance, and outlook. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, 4 February 2025, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to our fourth quarter 2024 earnings release and 2024 Form 10-K available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures, and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements.\nJoining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta, and PepsiCo's Executive Vice President and CFO, Jamie Caulfield. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. In order to ask a question or make a comment, please press star followed by one-one on your touch-tone phone at any time. We'll pause for a moment while we compile our Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays; your line is open.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to talk about Frito, a significant reinvestment in the business that really started over the summer, but we really saw it presumably step up in the fourth quarter, funded by the one-time gain you had. But volumes decelerated sequentially. So just curious if you can talk a little bit more about spending and reinvestment in the fourth quarter in particular, how much you would describe as kind of tactical versus laying strategic groundwork for next year. Because right now, just optically and super simplistically, the ROI on reinvestment doesn't feel great with volumes kind of taking a step in the wrong direction. Thanks.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nGood morning, Lauren. It's Jamie. Yeah, look, we're working hard to get the momentum back into the Frito business and, just as importantly, back into the salty and savory category. So that's working for us, working for our customers. We're going to continue to invest. What enables us to invest is we're generating productivity. To your point, we did have some help from non-operating gains in the fourth quarter. The investments are intended to improve the performance in the fourth quarter, but more importantly, to get us off to a good start going into 2025.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, Lauren, and hi there, Ramon. A couple of contexts and how we feel about it. We're encouraged by the category. If you look at MULO+, the Circana data, the category is starting to grow again in the last periods of the year, including Q1. That was the number one objective that we had: get the category back into growth, both in volume and hopefully starting to take some, see some pricing, price mix, positive price mix. I think we are there. So consumers are back into the category. I wouldn't say a large number, but delivering growth. So that's very positive. From here, we can build on the learnings that we had during the year and what are the best ROI, as you were saying, ROI investments in value for the category.\nBut most importantly, we understand the bigger trends where we can innovate, where we can bring to the category new spaces that will drive additional locations into the category. Moreover, for our own business, the big opportunity we're also addressing is the away-from-home opportunity, which is a blue space, a blue ocean of opportunities for us. And as consumers are being less at home and more away from home, within that's another area of opportunity. So, I would say, category growth back to good levels. We're starting to see some pricing in the category. The consumer programs and the commercial programs for next year look very strong, addressing innovation spaces that have been unmet at this point, I would say. And then obviously for us, away from home is a big opportunity in our food business.\nWe have more of our business in beverages away from home, but for foods is an underdeveloped opportunity. So that's how we're thinking about investments that we put back into the business in Q4. As you said, we reinvested most of the one-time gains in building the infrastructure to capture those opportunities in 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. I actually had a question on your guidance for this year. Your EPS guidance assumes some leverage, but not nearly as much as you've reported in prior years. So just kind of wanted to understand the drivers of this. I assume your productivity savings will remain robust. So should we assume that the level of investments in your businesses are going to ramp a fair amount this year? And if so, could you maybe give us a little bit more of a sense of the types of investments? For instance, Ramon, are you considering more price investments at Frito? And then also you guided an EPS range versus your typical percentage increase. So is the idea there that you would ultimately like to have more flexibility this year to maybe push more aggressively on investment levels if needed? Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, I would say, and Jamie will add to this, the way we're thinking about the year is continuing with the systematic productivity, multi-year programs that we talked to you about, so automation, digitalization, global capability centers, simplifying the company, deduplicating. So there's a lot of, and we feel very strong about that. We are reinvesting into price partitions that we're not participating for Frito. You think about, there's sub-$1, sub-$2. There's multiple price partitions where we're not participating. We're rethinking or we're redoing our price pack architecture on single-serve, on multi-packs, and multi-serve to make sure that we attract consumers in, depending on their disposable income during the month, they will be able to access our products across the multiple parts of the portfolio. And then to your point, we're being cautious. The reality is that the world looks better from the unemployment point of view.\nThere's very low unemployment around the world. There is better inflation in most of the markets. However, the world is very volatile, if you think from the geopolitical point of view, or some of the potential decisions that governments might take going forward. So we think it's prudent for us to give a guidance that reflects all that. And obviously, we can invest in the business and continue to invest for the long term as we always manage the business, but also give us flexibility to react to potential circumstances that might come our way in the coming months, especially, I would say, the first half of the year. I don't know, Jamie, also in terms of Forex and.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nBonnie, I'll add. We have about a 3.4x set. Obviously, the dollar's strengthened recently. Peso is the biggest piece of that 4x guide. And then below the line, we're expecting higher net interest expense. Part of that is, as we've rolled over debt, we've issued at slightly higher rates and then higher debt balances with the acquisitions of CFA and the 50% of Sabra that we did not previously own. On top of that, pension expense is going to be up a bit. So where we typically have maybe a little bit of leverage from below the line items, it'll be a bit of a headwind. So you should expect the sector operating profit to grow in excess of what we're guiding on EPS.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nKaumil Gajrawala\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, everybody. Good morning. A couple of questions, I guess, on the restructuring and sort of realignments. I guess the first thing is, I don't know if it was 10 years ago, but there were a lot of conversations around splitting beverage and snack as two different businesses. I just wonder if these restructurings are maybe a prelude to something bigger down the road, or maybe what's your appetite for that? In the midst of a restructuring like this, does that also mean that any other M&A is off the table after these two recent deals? Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nOkay, Kaumil. I mean, the reasons for the restructure are multiple, but I'll summarize. The international growth opportunity is very large for us, and we want to have focus between what is a franchise beverage opportunity and what is mainly a food operating unit opportunity. So we're separating those to make sure that we have category focus, but most importantly, we have a consumer and franchise-facing organization and a consumer and operating-facing organization internationally capturing what is a very large growth opportunity. Now, in the US, we have been investing in systems, and we've been investing in data. We've been investing in infrastructure. Now we're ready to capture the benefit of some of those investments in better short-term cost running the business. There's duplications in how we service the two organizations. So that's an opportunity.\nWe want to continue to have very focused category teams that understand the consumer, innovate, manage the category separately. But also we see an opportunity to build the future together in a different way. So if you think about infrastructure, if you think about technology investment, if you think about a lot of the big decisions that we have to make for the future of the business, we have an opportunity to do that in a much more harmonized way in the US. So those are the three big ideas that I think for the next chapter of the business and our accelerated growth ambitions and margin expansion is the best way to run the organization.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nMorning, Dara.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nSo just looking at Q4 results for you guys across the CPG industry, clearly a pretty muted top-line growth environment in North America. You touched on Frito-Lay North America already. But I'd just love to get a bit more granular on how you're specifically managing the business differently in 2025 relative to the back half of last year on both the Frito-Lay and beverage side of the business and areas you're emphasizing more such as innovation, etc., and just sort of the tweaks in strategy in light of that sustained environment. And also just can you give us a quick update on performance in Mexico in Q4, somewhat tied into the same vein of a subdued consumer environment? So any update there would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nThank you, Dara. So let me start. The international business remains by far our largest growth opportunity, and we've been investing consistently over the last 10 years. We'll continue to invest to continue to nurture this big opportunity for us to develop our caps and continue to build scale business with high margins. To give you a sense, today, our international business is already almost a $40 billion business attributed to PepsiCo. So we build the scale, we build the leverage, and that business continues to grow at a very good pace. Now, in North America, we're encouraged by what we're seeing. We're encouraged by, in the beverage business, a continuous improvement of our margin. And that was something that we put as a key objective a few years ago. We see our line of sight to a mid-teens margin in our beverage business.\nThat continues to be an aspiration. Now, I think we have an opportunity to do better on the top line in beverages, and that is the focus for this year: continue to expand the margin, but drive acceleration on the top line behind better price pack, a much more focused innovation against zero, against functional hydration, against some of the more categories where we are leaders, like teas, and coffees. We continue to improve our operational excellence in beverages. So that's the beverage journey, beverage ambition. Again, productivity at the center. I think the teams have been doing a great job in improving operational efficiency across buying, across making, across moving, and everything else. So that's the journey on beverages. In snacks, after five years of very fast growth and gaining almost 200 basis points of share, 2024 has been a slowdown.\nOur number one priority this year has been stabilizing the category, making sure that consumers come back to the category with good ROI investments. I think we can say that we see that happening. We're seeing the category starting to grow again on volume in the last three months and a little bit of pricing in the category. Frito has a very strong program for 2025, much better price point execution and portions, as I said earlier in the call, much better innovation.\nWe're moving more of our A&M dollars towards what we call positive choices or permissible offerings for the consumer: a new line of no artificials under Simply, which will have all our brands, more effort on baked, more effort on lightly salted, more efforts on parts of the portfolio where we see consumers moving, a lot of effort on portion control, a lot of effort on single-serve, on multi-packs, and a lot of efforts on availability of our small portions. And then, as I said earlier, away from home continues to be an investment area for Frito, something that was in our strategy. Now we're dialing up the opportunity to have our products available away from home, but not only in the form of a conventional bag of our snacks, but also more elevated experiences in form of ready-to-eat almost solutions or mini-meal solutions.\nThat's why the acquisitions of CFA and SOBRA feed our strategy as they give us not only better-for-you snacks, but also the option to participate in meals and mini-meals in a much more intentional way. So those are the kind of the broad strategies. We'll talk more at CAGNY and how we're thinking about all these for the coming years.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from, sorry, Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nHey, thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Ramon. I'd like to pick up on the comments from the previous question related to Frito-Lay and, I guess, the focus on some of the more positive choices. And I guess as we step back, right, and we've all been trying to understand both the Frito-Lay share and the category, how much of it is just simply price got ahead of the consumer's wallet? How much of this is now a change in preference, right, is healthier, a more important objective from here? And then I guess the last is just where Frito-Lay kind of fits in mini-meals because meals have become more expensive. And is there a migration to, I don't know, a dollar menu relative to a bag of Lay's and a Pepsi? So against those three things, which one is the most important?\nSpecifically, is there something that you're hearing from consumers that is causing a refocus on the more positive choices?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. It's a great question. It's actually the most strategic question. I think when we talk to consumers, value is the number one decision maker, and it's the reason why the category is slowed down in the last 12 months. So we think that addressing value, giving the consumers choices at different price points, different solutions throughout the month, the consumers will be making choices as they're trying to maximize their disposable income. So I think that continues to be the number one focus. And I think we have a much stronger pricing, sizing, and promotional activities that address that with high ROI and maximizing the value of the category. I think there's more awareness from consumers to the food and the drinks that they consume. I think there is a—this has been a multi-year evolution of the consumer in the US, globally, obviously, as well.\nAnd obviously, some parts of the world are more advanced, especially European consumers. But we think there has been more conversations on social and more, we've seen some behaviors as well. So that is maybe an acceleration in the US market that we are very well positioned to capture. You think about portion control, probably the number one solution for consumers to stay in our categories is small portions of our favorites, ideally improved favorites with lower sodium, lower fat, and no artificial. So portion control of our favorites is a big strategy. There's also consumers that are looking for more functionality, and they're looking for protein in their snacks. They're looking for whole grain in their snacks. They're looking for other benefits. And we're also well positioned.\nIf you think about SunChips and how SunChips is innovating with whole grain and now legumes, you think about Stacy's with whole grain. If you think about Quaker with protein snacks, if you think about popping, baking, and better air frying, lower fat frying options that we're putting on in front of consumers, those are all tools in our portfolio enabled by very capable R&D that we will continue to expand. And the truth is that our partners have been great partners in expanding space for us in stores and giving us the tools to maximize consumer impact. So that will be big in 2025, and we're pivoting a lot of our A&M into those spaces. The third pillar is mini-meals. And this is not only a value-driven decision, but it's a sequence.\nIt's been also a multi-year evolution of a category where more occasions or more calories are being eaten in small meals versus large meals. I think that is something that will continue as consumers' lifestyle evolves that way. So there, we're participating with all our brands. We're trying to create solutions for consumers in those moments of the day where they're looking for a 200-calorie, 300-calorie solution that takes them over for the next few hours into their next job or whatever they're trying to accomplish. So those are multi-strategies. Now, the same applies to beverages. Beverages' price points are critical. I think, obviously, offering portions that drive that are critical. Better-for-you, so zero and more functional beverages. And we have both in Gatorade and Propel and in the whole zero portfolio. And then also elevated experiences away from home. And we have Pepsi Drips.\nThat is an elevated experience and multiple other solutions that we have on our away-from-home business. So it is a three-pronged strategy. It is across food and beverages. And we feel good about our ability to continue to give consumers what they need as the preferences evolve, obviously, during the coming years.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone. I want to talk about your low single-digit organic sales guidance for 2025. Can you comment on how much is the international contribution versus the North America expectations? And specifically, in North America, you called out the performance to improve gradually as the year progresses. Can you give us some sense of when you expect North America to improve and kind of what are the key drivers of that improvement in 2025? Thank you.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nHi, Filippo. It's Jamie. Yeah. So as we mentioned in the prepared comments, we expect North America's performance to improve gradually as we work through the year. Our guidance of low single digits is in the same neighborhood as our exit rate. Clearly, at this point in the year, with a lot of global uncertainty, I think we've set the top-line guidance to be prudent. And the cause of all the acceleration or the cause of the acceleration in North America is a lot of what Ramon's been sharing previously on the call. So innovation, getting into new spaces, getting into leaning more heavily into away from home. And to be clear, international has been performing very well, and we expect international to continue to be quite resilient and a major contributor to our results in 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well. So Ramon, you mentioned in response to Lauren's question that you're kind of encouraged by some of the trends that you're seeing in salty more recently. And I know throughout this call, you kind of touched on a lot of the things that the company is doing to improve performance around affordability, innovation, etc. But just over the past year, category growth has been choppy, and we've seen kind of these periods of growth kind of ultimately reverse. So I just would be curious, as you look at it today, is there something that you're seeing that's different that gives you greater confidence that the category is on much better footing today as you move into the balance of 2025? Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. And I think listen, I don't think we can read 2024 in isolation of the previous three years. Otherwise, I think we're missing some of the major impacts on consumer, both lifestyle, move from home into away from home, and disposable income challenges with inflation. So we look at 2024 in the context of the last four years, and we say, \"Okay, Frito-Lay and the category has grown above our long-term expectations.\" So Frito-Lay grew 8% in the last four years. That's a pretty good compound rate for a company of that scale and that development. So that's positive. And Frito-Lay has, I think, gained almost 200 basis points of share of market. So that is the contextual reality to understand 2024 as a normalization year, inflation going back to normal levels, both on the cost of inputs and the consumer side, and the overall trends in the category.\nNow, yes, we're encouraged by the fact that we're seeing more occasions coming into the category in the last three quarters of the year. That is encouraging because we see consumers coming back to consume our products, consume the products that are being offered by the category. Now, there is a higher level of consumption in the value segments of the category, but it's also more occasions coming in the premium segments of the category, which also helps us to understand the way to address that opportunity, both with good offerings on the value side, but also innovation, and good consumer solutions that consumers are willing to pay more on the premium side. That's why what I said, we're encouraged.\nI think our commercial plans address the opportunities both at both ends of the category, and also trying to be very cautious and always having ROI at the center of our decisions, not only for PepsiCo, but for the full category, which we think we are guardians of this category for the long term. And that's why we're making some of the decisions we're making.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. So I don't want to beat a dead horse, but I just wanted to delve a little further into the topic of Frito-Lay investment, specifically the topic of pricing and value. Because I appreciate the comments you made so far, Ramon, but I guess I'm trying to put a little finer point on it because it's the one area where I guess you could argue you haven't really yet made clear and considered investments, just evidenced by the fact that pricing in Frito-Lay is still positive this quarter despite tactical initiatives you discussed coming into the quarter. So the comments you've made today, Ramon, signal a change on that front, such that pricing in Frito-Lay could potentially start to run negative as we start 2025. I certainly understand the risks and sensitivities of walking back pricing.\nBut on the flip side, I guess the question would be, how do you think how would you think about the risks of not investing more in price to re-energize volume, just given that it's been, I guess, 18 months or so where we've seen category volumes and volumes in your portfolio extend their declines and fall short of expectations? So just I think I'm hearing a little bit more certain in this, but I just want to validate.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nNo, I wouldn't assume that we're going to have negative pricing. I don't think that's our strategy. What I'm saying is we're going to have much more surgical offerings to consumers, especially around price partitions, which I think we can do pricing sizing in a way that we give consumers optionality without diluting the pricing of our business or the category. For example, if you think about the multi-bag business, we will be offering lower counts. We'll be offering eight counts, and we'll be offering 15 counts, 18 counts, and 20 counts. We'll be offering the consumer multiple choices so that the consumer can begin of the month, they might go for an 18-count, and end of the month, they might take a six-count, eight-count, depending on their budget availability. That's one strategy. The same with the single-serve. We've always had the two-for-$1 option for limited channels.\nNow we're going to have a sub-$2 option that we didn't have. We'll have multiple portions for different occasions. And obviously, this is the DSD system that allows us to have distribution of the different price packs for the occasions that matter for that particular customer or point of sale throughout the year. So those are capabilities that we have in place. Now we would have the offerings. We'll have the executions, and we'll have the partnership with our customers to try to continue to drive value for the consumer, for our partners, and for ourselves. I don't think we will have negative pricing. We'll have a much more surgical price pack strategy and execution strategy that we think will drive growth for the category, given where the consumer is in their disposable income evolution after the high inflation years that we just crossed.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Lavery\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you. Good morning. Just want to come back to Frito, maybe not as much the pricing piece, but some of the other spending. At the end of Lauren's question, you were saying you reinvested most of the one-time gains in infrastructure. And just want to maybe understand a little bit better what that is. I mean, I think the optics she pointed out are a little funny, but if we understand that better, I think that's helpful. And just a little bit related, you said that the percentage of sales for advertising and marketing went up in 2024. Can you maybe touch on what your expectations are for 2025 for that?\nI'll start with the A&M. I'd expect our A&M to be pretty consistent as a percent of sales in 2025.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nInvestments and how we reinvested them.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. And I think going back to the investments, I think we continue to think about long-term portfolio evolution. So continue to invest more on the future platforms that we're trying to create, whether it's portion control platforms, whether it's permissible platforms, whether it's away-from-home platforms. All of those require investments upfront. Especially away-from-home requires some investments to be able to capture new channels and new opportunities. The same with some of the new platforms that we have to invest to get it off the ground. That's why my comment on Q4 investing on those platforms. But again, we're trying to run the business for the long term, trying to establish good options for the consumer in all the different price partitions, move the portfolio to where we think are the new pockets of demand.\nAgain, lower fat products, lower sodium products, better ingredients, not legumes and rice and some other ingredients, giving consumers higher protein, all the different functionalities that consumers are looking for as they enjoy tasting snacks. And then again, the away-from-home opportunity being much bigger, both with mini meals and some ready-to-eat solutions that our brands can participate. We're seeing high demand, and that will require investments to be able to capture for the long term.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Drew Levine with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nDrew Levine\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, can you hear me?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYes. Hi, Drew.\n\nDrew Levine\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey. Hey there. Thanks for taking the question. So I think this is the first quarter in a while where energy wasn't specifically mentioned in the prepared remarks. So wondering, any change in view of the category or PepsiCo's platform in the category? And I know the company has previously said you feel good about the service levels and execution, but maybe any color on what the company has planned from a planning or execution perspective to drive growth in that part of the portfolio, or if there's anything that the partnership could be doing differently or better from your perspective. Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Thank you. We think we continue to see energy as a fundamental part of our beverage growth strategy in the US. There's a demand for energy throughout the day, and I think we have a portfolio that offers that both with our brands and some of the brands that we distribute. And we're servicing our consumers and our customers with, I think, full end-to-end solutions. There's no mention because there's nothing special to mention.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nHey, guys. This is Greg on for Robert. I was just wondering if you could please talk a bit about the PB&A pricing strategy for 2025, and then a bit more about higher thinking of promo in that segment. And then as a quick other follow-up, maybe just touch on the incrementality of Baja Blast and just how you guys are thinking about the Mountain Dew franchise. Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nGreat. So listen, Baja Blast is a big part of our strategy to make Mountain Dew a bigger contributor to our growth in beverages. It's a large franchise. It's almost $1 billion already between our away-from-home and our retail business, or in the neighborhood of $1 billion. We see it is incremental in driving penetration for Mountain Dew, especially with Gen Zs, and especially in parts of the country where our core Mountain Dew is less developed. So we see a very good incrementality for us, and we will continue to invest in Baja Blast. It's one of our bets for the year. It's continuing the development of Baja Blast. We'll have it for Super Bowl, and there's a whole program throughout the year to continue to develop this platform. I think it's sustainable, it's incremental, it brings new consumers into the franchise. So that's regarding Baja Blast.\nRegarding the pricing strategy, I think there's very disciplined category pricing, both through price pack and through a channel mix. We'll continue to work on that direction to create value for our partners and for our consumers, giving them the best choices in price packs and promotional offers that create category value and category profitability for our partners and ourselves.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nEquity Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Thank you for the question. I was curious when you went through the list of factors impacting the slowdown in salty snacks. There's no mention of increased GLP usage. And there's a pretty detailed study by Numerator Cornell showing that salty snacks was a category that was probably most impacted by GLP usage. Would you agree with that assessment, or do you think it overstates the impact? And then secondly, protein drinks is probably the fastest-growing segment of the drinks market. Would you have any desire to go become more aggressive in that category given all the growth around it? Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. That's great. Yeah. Listen, on the protein beverages, for sure, we're trying to participate in that with a sense of urgency. We're trying to participate in general in the functionality evolution of the beverage category, both from the functional hydration point of view and there with Gatorade and Propel. And we see the opportunity to continue to create more value, both in terms of hydration by hydration plus protein as well in that space. But yes, in terms of protein, both through Muscle Milk and some other innovations, we're looking at participating in that category, which, as you were saying, it is growing faster than total LRB. So for sure, that is an opportunity that we're.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nEquity Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nSalty snacks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nNow, on salty, listen, I think we continue to study GLP-1, obviously, with a lot of detail. And at this point, we see that because of the lower levels of adoption and people coming in and out of the treatment, we see very little impact in our business and in our category at this point. However, as I said earlier, I think there is a higher level of awareness in general of American consumers towards health and wellness. And this is driven by potentially all the conversations around obesity drugs, but also other conversations that are happening around the space on health and wellness. So I think, yes, there is a health and wellness higher level of awareness by consumers, and that's driving some behaviors that we're addressing through the strategies that I talked earlier, the most important being portion control.\nI think portion control is a highly strategic strategy that we've been implementing for many years, but also long-term evolution of our portfolio with lower sodium, lower fat, lower sugar, positive ingredients, plant-based protein, and whole grains. All those are kind of strategic adjustments and evolution of our portfolio that we've been making for many years. We're accelerating to be able to offer consumers all different options for the multiple occasions that they interact with our category. So again, we haven't seen a direct impact of GLP, but we're seeing more conversation in social media about health and wellness in general. And obviously, that's impacting consumption of foods and consumption of beverages. And we're very well positioned with our broad portfolio to cater to all these new realities. And this is not new. This is something that we've been working on for many, many years.\nThis is a sequential evolution of the consumer that both through innovation and through M&A, we've been addressing. I think we have a very broad portfolio. If you think about the acquisitions of Siete or of Sabra, they're in that context, and they give us both the opportunity to innovate, but also to enter new spaces like meals where we needed more platforms to take advantage of them.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Just to add, I think the protein opportunity is beyond protein beverages. So if you look at the Quaker today, we've got a number of offerings that are high protein in the breakfast occasion, and I think there's a lot more opportunity to expand that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nChris Carey\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Thank you. So number one, just on Europe, this has been a segment that has actually seen kind of successfully driven an improvement of volume, just even as pricing has normalized. What's specific about what's going on in Europe that has allowed you to see that positive balance of delivery over the course of this year? And do you think this performance is sustainable going into next year? And then just connected, I think there was some view that international profit strength could fund some of the investments in North America. Would you continue to have that view given what we're seeing in the currency environment? So just the concept of international still being able to give you that profit lift so as to fund some of the things that you want to do in North America. So thanks for those two.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Great. So international continues to be our largest value creation opportunity, both in the top line and margin expansion. If you look at the margin expansion of international in the last couple of years, it's very remarkable. And I wouldn't say that international will fund the US, but as we manage the company in its totality, obviously, international now is a great source of top line, is a great source of profit, and it gives us flexibility to be much more flexible, I guess, in how we allocate resources and grow the overall business. With regards to Europe, it's just a, I would say, consistent strategy by our teams.\nI think the teams have done a great job in being very balanced in simplifying the business, extracting unnecessary costs from the P&L, and reinvesting those in growth in platforms that have been very good for us long-term: zero sugar beverages, lower sodium and lower fat snacks, and executing better in terms of availability, affordability, and entering new spaces like away from home. So they've been executing very well this strategy of the business, starting, I would say, from a very intentional reduction of cost to reinvest in top line. And in a difficult context like the European markets with large retailers, they've done a great job. And yes, within that, this is sustainable. Within this, we'll continue in this year and coming years.\nYeah, the opportunities to grow per caps in Europe are still very large, and we have very good teams in the markets and very good strategies to deploy our capabilities against the market.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our last question comes from Kevin Grundy with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\n\nKevin Grundy\n\nManaging Director, BNP Paribas\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Ramon, I wanted to take a step back here and give you the opportunity to perhaps level set on the company's longer-term organic sales guidance of 4% to 6%. So not asking you to be redundant in any way, but pulling together a lot of themes on the call. It seems like you see issues in the snacks business as more transitory or cyclical as opposed to secular. You sound confident on the strength of the business outside the US, but perhaps maybe cautiously optimistic. You have the right plan in place to return snacks to growth. Time will tell. But as we sit here today, can you maybe comment on your level of confidence? These are indeed transitory issues facing the business, and that 4% to 6% is still the right growth rate for your current portfolio on an intermediate-term basis.\nThank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nThank you. Great question. I think, obviously, we see our long-term growth of the business in those levels, 4% to 6%, and we're obviously going to try to go for the upper end of the long-term guidance. Again, very high growth in International. We're very confident that our North America business will accelerate this year. We're very confident in our plans and our long-term. We see opportunities, especially away from home, as billions of occasions on a daily basis that we need to go and capture with much more intentional products and consumer-facing go-to-market. So those are big opportunities. We remain very committed, and we also remain very committed to translate that growth into a high single-digit EPS.\nIf you look at our last five years, we've been delivering above our long-term guidance, both in top line and bottom line, and we don't see any reason why we should not continue to deliver at those high levels if you take the next five years in context. Thank you very much. This has been a good conversation, and I really appreciate your questions. Thank you for staying invested in our business. We look forward to the meeting in CAGNY and also hope that you guys enjoy our products during this weekend Super Bowl game. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWell, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day. Good morning and welcome to PepsiCo's fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings question and answer session. Your lines have been placed on listen only until it is your turn to ask the question. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\n\nRavi Pamnani\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, PepsiCo\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans, guidance, and outlook. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, 4 February 2025, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to our fourth quarter 2024 earnings release and 2024 Form 10-K available on PepsiCo.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements.\nJoining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta, and PepsiCo's Executive Vice President and CFO, Jamie Caulfield. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. In order to ask a question or make a comment, please press star followed by one-to-one on your touch-tone phone at any time. We'll pause for a moment while we compile our Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays; your line is open.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to talk about Frito, a significant reinvestment in the business that really started over the summer, but we really saw it presumably step up in Q4, funded by the one-time gain you had. But volumes decelerated sequentially. So just curious if you can talk a little bit more about spending and reinvestment in Q4 in particular, how much you would describe as kind of tactical versus laying strategic groundwork for next year. Because right now, just optically and super simplistically, the ROI on reinvestment doesn't feel great with volumes kind of taking a step in the wrong direction. Thanks.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nHey, good morning, Lauren. It's Jamie. Yeah, look, we're working hard to get the momentum back into the Frito business and, just as importantly, back into the salty and savory category. So that's working for us, working for our customers. So we're going to continue to invest. And what enables us to invest is we're generating productivity. To your point, we did have some help from non-operating gains in the fourth quarter. And the investments are intended to improve the performance in the fourth quarter, but more importantly, to get us off to a good start going into 2025.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, Lauren, and hi there, Ramon. A couple of contexts and how we feel about it. We're encouraged by the category. If you look at MULO+, the Circana data, the category is starting to grow again in the last periods of the year, including Q1.\nThat was the number one objective that we had: get the category back into growth, both in volume and hopefully starting to take some, see some pricing, price mix, positive price mix. I think we are there. Consumers are back into the category. I wouldn't say a large number, but delivering growth. That's very positive. From here, we can build on the learnings that we had during the year and what are the best ROI, as you were saying, ROI investments in value for the category. But most importantly, we understand the bigger trends where we can innovate, where we can bring to the category new spaces that will drive additional locations into the category. Moreover, for our own business, the big opportunity we're also addressing is the away-from-home opportunity, which is a blue space, a blue ocean of opportunities for us.\nAnd as consumers are being less at home and more away from home, within that's another area of opportunity. I would say category growth back to good levels. We're starting to see some pricing in the category. The consumer programs and the commercial programs for next year look very strong, addressing innovation spaces that have been unmet at this point, I would say. Then, obviously, for us, away from home is a big opportunity in our food business. We have more of our business in beverages away from home, but for foods is an underdeveloped opportunity. That's how we're thinking about investments that we put back into the business in Q4. As you said, we reinvested most of the one-time gains in building the infrastructure to capture those opportunities in 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. I actually had a question on your guidance for this year. Your EPS guidance assumes some leverage, but not nearly as much as you've reported in prior years. So just kind of wanted to understand the drivers of this. I assume your productivity savings will remain robust. So should we assume that the level of investments in your businesses are going to ramp a fair amount this year? And if so, could you maybe give us a little bit more of a sense of the types of investments? For instance, Ramon, are you considering more price investments at Frito? And then also, you guided an EPS range versus your typical percentage increase. So is the idea there that you would ultimately like to have more flexibility this year to maybe push more aggressively on investment levels if needed? Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, I would say, and Jamie will add to this. The way we're thinking about the year is continuing with the systematic productivity, multi-year programs that we've talked to you about, so automation, digitalization, Global Capability Centers, simplifying the company, deduplicating. So there's a lot of, and we feel very strong about that. We are reinvesting into price partitions that we're not participating for Frito. You think about, there's sub $1, sub $2. There's multiple price partitions where we're not participating. We're rethinking or we're redoing our price pack architecture on single-serve, on multi-packs, and multi-serve to make sure that we attract consumers depending on their disposable income during the month. They will be able to access our product across the multiple parts of the portfolio. And then, to your point, we're being cautious. The realities.",

Your lines have been placed on listen only until it is your turn to ask a question. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\n\nRavi Pamnani\n\nSVP and Investor Relations, PepsiCo\n\nThank you. Operator. Good morning everyone. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans and updated 2024 guidance. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, 11 July 2024, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures which exclude certain items from reported results.\nPlease refer to our Q2 2024 Earnings Release and Q2 2024 Form 10-Q available on PepsiCo.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta and PepsiCo's Executive Vice President and CFO Jamie Caulfield. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question, and with that I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nIn order to ask a question or make a comment, please press star followed by one-one on your touch-tone phone at any time. We will pause for a moment while we compile our Q&A roster.\nOur first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nMorning Dara.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nI just wanted to focus on the implied organic sales growth guidance in.\nThe back half of the year.\nMid single digits to get to the approximate 4% guidance. You've obviously had a great longer term track record, Ramon, under your tenure. But in this softer US consumer environment, we've seen low single digit growth in.\nThe last couple of quarters.\nSo what gives you confidence at the corporate level you can get back there? And specifically, I wanted to dial down into Frito-Lay North America, which is presumably a piece of that, obviously a pretty soft volume result. In Q2, you had taken some initial actions, so you know, help us understand the incremental actions from here. What gives you confidence you get a volume payback and a top line payback from that, and how sort of Frito-Lay North America fits.\nInto that top line recovery also.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nThat's great, Dara. So I think it's an important area to focus when we're saying at least four. We were talking more about around five in our minds. Now we're talking around four. So that's the pivot we're making. There is an adjustment, and it's related to specifically.\nThe consumer in the US, and we can talk a little bit more now. Why do we feel good about our guidance, and it cannot be disconnected from our earnings performance? Because you know, I think the work we've been doing on our productivity, our cost reduction gives us the optionality to reinvest back in H2 in a way that we feel much more comfortable about the performance. So a couple of, I would say, elements that give us confidence now. One is Quaker. Quaker. You know, you're all familiar with the situation.\nWe're recovering the supply chain. By Q4, you know, we'll be in almost 100% supply, and obviously the business at that point will be growing materially because we're just refilling the shelves and the pipeline. So that should be out of, out of the picture, and it will be a positive impact for us.\nThe second is mathematical, but it's lapping, and we think obviously the lappings are much better in second half, and that gives us confidence that we can get back to a mid single digit type of growth in the second half. The third element is international. International is an area we've been investing for the last few years materially, and is delivering for us. So first half of the year, 7%. Within that, you know, we will continue that same level of growth in the second half of the year. You know, pluses and minuses around the world. But you know, the portfolio is diverse enough, scale enough, profitable enough around multiple parts of the world that we believe that we can deliver.\nNow in the US there is clearly a consumer that is more challenged and is a consumer that is telling us that in particular parts of the part of our portfolio they want more value to stay with our brands. That is not for all the consumers. It's some consumers. That is not for all the portfolio. It's some parts of the portfolio, and we have been working different tactics to give the consumer what they want, and we see that it's working. That's why we feel comfortable about, given the oxygen that we have in the P&L, that we'll be able to deploy in a very targeted way, thinking long term about the category, making sure that has increased, has good ROI.\nThey will be able to turn around, especially what you were referring to the food business to, positive volume and with that, a higher level of net revenue. So that's how we're thinking about the second half. Again, we have green shoots with some of the activities we've been executing, and July 4th has been very strong for us, and we feel good about the business now. The North America beverage business is also to be highlighted. It's a business that we said over time we want to stay with, deliver profitable growth, make sure we compete well in the category, but at the same time improve our margins. We think we're executing the playbook well.\nActually, we've been accelerating the profitable growth delivery of the business, and it should continue in the second half. We're investing in advertising and marketing, even more in the platforms that are growing.\nThat's what, overall, you put it all together. We feel good about the second half of the year and the momentum that will start 2025 with that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I actually had a question on PBNA. Ramon, I know you just touched on it a bit, but I'd be curious to hear if you're satisfied with some of the progress you might be making to reinvigorate the business, and maybe what green shoots you are seeing within PBNA. And then I guess I'm hoping for some color on the initiatives you highlighted in terms of the disciplined commercial investments.\nShould we assume this will also mean a potential step up in promos for PBNA? And do you maybe see a need for some brand repositioning? Are there structural opportunities, essentially, what will be the drivers to re-accelerate growth at PBNA?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nThanks. Yeah, that's good. Bonnie. I'll give you a couple of data points that I think are relevant. Gatorade, for example, has been gaining share.\nThis year, year to date. Meaningful. It's accelerating. That's a core part of our portfolio and a very profitable part of our portfolio. So that's one data point. We've been investing in Gatorade, not so much on, as you were saying, promos and discount, but more on innovation, execution, and branding. And that's paying back. The same with Propel. So all that functional hydration space, I think it's a focus for us. It's always been a focus, but now I think that part of the portfolio is working well. I think some of the G-to-DSD challenges that we had last year are behind us. I don't think we're all the way to perfection there, but much better service levels.\nIn this early part of the summer, which obviously that's when the category peaks and where we have to be ready for perfection. So that part is clear. If you think about the other brand we've been talking for some time.\nMountain Dew is on growth. Now it's back to growth. I think we made this strategic decision to have multiple flavors driving the brand and made Baja a structural part of the portfolio versus just an LTO that's driving consumers into the brand, incremental consumers, and again, better levels of execution. So just some examples. All the Zero part of the portfolio is booming, right? If you think about consumer trends, clearly we know where they're going. We know that internationally, and we know that's going to eventually happen here in the US, so Zero not only on colas, not only on soft drinks, but also on Gatorade, on teas, on coffees. We're seeing that consumers are going.\nAnd then the last part is our foodservice business is becoming stronger, and we're being better at the where the profitability is, which is on the fragmented restaurant, local restaurant, and where consumers.\nHave a lot of interaction every day. That part of the portfolio we've been investing, we're getting additional distribution. We know we're becoming a better execution company in that particular channel and we're feeling good about that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks so much, Ramon. I wanted to go back to Frito, if I may, because you commented on some consumers and being more value to stay with our brands. But one thing we've been doing a lot in trying to parse through the data that's available to us, and it looks like it's the category. The salty snack category as a whole is really pressured. It's not just your brands, I know given your share, they're sort of one in the same. But it looks like there's a broader category issue.\nAgain, some of the data we've looked at; it feels like the category is not proving terribly responsive to promotion or so. I just was hoping you could comment on that, if that is or isn't consistent with what you're seeing, and how what you're going to be doing will be different. Because again, what we've seen so far, it doesn't look like there's a lot of response, and it feels like the category is proving more discretionary. So just love your thoughts on that. Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, I think.\nWe feel that the issue is an issue of value, not an issue of anything else. And.\nWe have a lot of data obviously. Now how do you address that value gap versus what consumers want to do? I think.\nIs where the know-how will come, and the sweet spot for us is not to promote but is to promote to who needs it in their products that need it versus a blanket approach to promotion. So that's where we're investing a lot of time. I think we're much more capable from the insights and diagnostic point of view, and also from our ability to execute more granularly all these interventions, be it digital, be it with particular channels or customers. To give you an example, we feel that the unsalted part of our portfolio.\nRight. If you think about potato chips or tortilla chips, that needs some value reset and value intervention for some consumers. When we think about flavor potato chips or other parts of our portfolio.\nNo, I mean consumers are staying in the category, are staying in our brands, and they're buying with pretty high frequency as in the past. There are other parts of the portfolio that are growing, growing very fast. Especially the permissible part of what we call permissible portfolio, Positive Choices. This is a. You think about brands like SunChips, PopCorners, Smartfood, or the Simply range Off The Eaten Path. Those brands are growing, and there it's not about value there, I think it's more about.\nAnd the way we're going to approach it is more marketing, investment, awareness, execution, and availability. So.\nThere's different tools that we'll be using to drive the category growth. To your point on, is it the categories of PepsiCo brands? I think given our massive.\nParticipation in the category through many multiple brands. I think it's our responsibility to manage this category for the long term, providing value to consumers in different ways, and continue to have.\nThe savory snacks category growing above food structurally as we have done in the past. Now there is nothing in terms of consumer long term trends that tells us that that's not possible. I think it's small adjustments in value, in execution, and in investment in new innovation areas that will drive it. And we feel very strong about our ability to do that not in the long term, but actually in the short term in Q3 and Q4. And that's why our guidance reflects a little bit that inflection because we're already testing and executing some of these levers and we see the returns it has in volume and net revenue.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Bryan Spillane with BofA. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks operator. Good morning, Ramon.\nGood morning Jamie.\nJust wanted to circle back on Frito, and I guess stepping back, you're able to sort of reset the margins and fund it with just drilling deeper into some of the reservoirs of productivity other.\nPlaces in the organization.\nI guess just if you could comment on two things related to that. One.\nGiven that you're tapping more productivity this year, how does that affect next year? Does that affect maybe not having as much productivity to flow through or is that reservoir very deep? And then the second is, as we're thinking about Frito margins stepping back in the back half of the year, should we be thinking about that now as the new base to maybe grow off of gradually or is that a major step down and then you'd expect Frito to have another maybe step change up in the future?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. So Bryan, let me tell you, I think we've talked about this in the past. We're managing total PepsiCo operating margin, and as you've seen, we keep improving the margin. This quarter was almost 100 basis points of operating margin improvement, and it's been consistent for the last few years. We feel good about our productivity pipeline. It's not tactical, it's super strategic, and it's multiyear, and it's based on automation, it's based on digitalization, simplification of the company, standardization, different service models to the business.\nSo there is a whole portfolio of productivity ideas that are multiyear in nature. And we don't think that we will slow down our productivity in the coming years. Now as you think about our overall margin, International has continue to grow its margin.\nPBNA is being very vocal from our side that we want to have that business going, moving into mid-teens, and we're delivered on that. We've always said that the big value of Frito for us is not so much whether it's a 26 or 26.5 or 27.5; that is very relevant. I would say it's always tremendously accretive for us long term. But and the biggest value creation for Frito is to make sure that it grows at a 4 or 5% level. And that is going to be our, continues to be our, strategic focus.\nHow do we get Frito to continue to grow above the category, make the category very healthy in terms of growth, keep bringing consumers, locations, and new opportunities for channel expansion to Frito? And that will continue to be our focus. We'll keep investing until we get it right.\nWe feel good about getting it right rather soon. That's the way we'll keep managing the overall profitability of the company and Frito, PBNA, and International in particular with different sub-strategies. Obviously that trickles down to every market around the world when you talk about international. We have a very good playbook for every country and every line of business in every country, expectations on profitability, and roadmaps to deliver that kind of growth.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nKaumil Gajrawala\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHi. Good morning, everybody.\nDo you believe that the prices at Frito are too high given the increases over recent years?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nKaumil.\nI think I kind of touched on the point earlier, but.\nSome parts of the portfolio need value adjustments, some parts of the portfolio don't. Some parts of the portfolio need to be for particular consumers. We need some new entry price points and probably some new promotional, you know, kind of mechanics that don't expect for the consumer to invest so much cash in a purchase of snacking. So there's adjustments that we have to make to for certain consumers. Some parts of the portfolio. I don't think the overall portfolio.\nNeeds a reset. I think this is going to be about granularity. It's going to be about.\nGood execution of that granularity. That's what I think we're well prepared to do throughout the full value chain. Yes, there is some value to be given back to consumers after three or four years of a lot of inflation. Our cost allows us to do that wherever we choose to do. That will be one of the interventions that we'll be making.\nIn the second half, but not the only one. I mean, there's going to be investments in marketing. There's going to be investments in better execution that overall will drive the business growth to where we think it will be structural in the coming years.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. So I was hoping to get some color on Latin America. Organic revenue was the weakest we've seen in some time here. And I think in the prepared remarks, Brazil and Mexico seemed solid. So just curious, kind of what drove the weakness in the quarter. And then, Ramon, just as we look ahead, you mentioned you still expect strong growth from International in the back half of the year. How does Latin America fit into that equation? Would you anticipate improvement or should we expect more muted performance to continue?\nThanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nNo, I think. Again, I would look at LATAM and all the international business in like six months rather than a three months and three months. There's a lot of moving pieces between Q1, Q2, Chinese New Year.\nIn particular, the LATAM situation in our case.\nIs related to Mexico and Mexico because of the elections. There have been some changes in disposable income given to the families by the government that created some, I would say, some abnormalities in the way those funds were distributed, and that's impacted demand in Mexico in the last. What we're seeing in the last three weeks in Mexico that as those funds have been given back to consumers again, that the demand has come back to our category. So, you know, we don't foresee any issue in LATAM. LATAM again, I mean, value continues to be a factor as it's always been. In LATAM we'll see plus and minuses between the different countries.\nBut as a region, LATAM continues to be a high performing region for us where we keep developing the categories and we keep expanding our margins and building scale businesses not only in Mexico and Brazil, but across multiple markets.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nDirector Equity Research, Citi\n\nHey, good morning everyone. So just staying on international business, Ramon, you sounded pretty confident on the growth in international. Maybe you can talk more about like what regions do you see the greater growth potential in that business? And going back to the question on guidance on top line for the second half, is the improvement in organic sales mainly driven by an improvement in North America or an acceleration in international? If you can give some color there will be helpful.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, Filippo.\nYou should assume that most of the incremental acceleration of the business comes from mostly North America. Right. And the two factors I mentioned, Quaker will get back to growth. You know, the laps get better for North America. And then some of the interventions we're making both in value and in additional A&M should drive additional volume. Those are the three factors. Internationally, we're assuming that, you know, the rate of growth for H1 will continue in H2. And again, we're seeing parts of the portfolio.\nAccelerating, parts of the portfolio kind of stabilizing, some of them being a little bit softer. But overall the portfolio at this point is broad enough, we have enough scale across multiple markets that we're kind of hedged geographically. So that's what we're assuming and what we're seeing that the per caps growth of the category will continue. We continue to invest meaningfully incremental funds to both execution and brand development and we, you know, we don't see any reason why now of course there could be big geopolitical reasons why, you know, we change our mind later in the year.\nBut with the information we have today about geopolitics and stability of countries, that's our best guess today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen.\nYour line is open.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi.\nThanks.\nA couple questions.\nOne is, I was hoping you'd give.\nA little more color on the energy drinks category. Growth has slowed dramatically in the US, and just wanted to get your perspective.\nAsk, like, do you think that?\nConsumers there are making a value decision as well? There's a lot of premium-priced drinks. Do you see any evidence of trading down to maybe higher caffeine carbonated drinks?\nThanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nListen.\nI think fundamentally the energy category continues to provide.\nLong-term good prospects for our industry. I think it's a consumer need that will continue to be there, and whether we're able to satisfy that through multiple options that will continue to grow.\nThere's always small ups and downs of subcategories within LRB that you could argue.\nIs it because of channel dynamics? Is it because it's very hot and people are moving to other parts of the portfolio? Like, we're seeing, for example, in our case, in the recent six weeks, a massive growth in our hydration portfolio because obviously it's been very hot in the US. So I guess there is some cannibalization between energy and hydration for some consumers, and they prefer to do that. So I wouldn't overread into the short term of the category. I would try to think about this as a, the consumer needs energy. If we're able to provide energy.\nIn a consumer-friendly way, including price, probably as you mentioned. But I would say functionality, clean labels. I mean, like a lot of the things that I think the category has been working on. There should be a good runway for that segment of the category. And it's been value-creating for a lot of us that participate in it, including the retailer partners and the brand owners.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Ramon, Jamie, my question is on the bridge to the mid single digits organic sales growth in the second half, assuming international. Ramon, you just mentioned goes the same kind of mid single digits into the second half. And of course, understanding the easy comps for Quaker, it still implies a good inflection into Frito and PBNA. How do you think we should be thinking about the progress and perhaps related to that from a channel perspective, the away from home.\nFor you, growing from what it seems to be like a distribution. What is the like for like in sales basically by channel? If you would think about Away From Home and at home,\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nAndrea, it's Jamie.\nOn the acceleration in the back half. As Ramon mentioned, that's going to come.\nMostly from North America for reasons we cited.\nWe're making the investment primarily focused on North America. We've got the easier laps and Quaker. So that gives us a lot of confidence on channels.\nLook, away from home has been a.\nFocus area for us. We put investment behind that and it's outgrowing the balance of our portfolio. We'd expect that to continue.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\n\nChirs Carey\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi, good morning everyone. Ramon, I know you mentioned International could be looked at on a six-month cadence. I was wondering, however, if you could comment on some specific regions just in Europe. Why, to your mind, have trends been so resilient? I don't think it's just your portfolio. I think the region in general has been more resilient for longer than many expected. Then in Asia, I think you were clear last quarter that there was some timing benefit. Clearly we saw that normalized this quarter. What's the right run rate for this division? Do you have any comment on the progress in China? Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, so listen, again we're looking at international as a portfolio of geographies and markets, and we see the portfolio kind of when it's not growing so much here. So at the end, historically we've learned that the portfolio is quite diversified, and that gives us the opportunity to, you know, to talk about an international business as a total. Obviously we run the business locally now. When you go down to different parts of the world, Europe is very, is resilient and is resilient in, you know, our business has been performing very well both on top line and share, and very importantly in margin improvement.\nAnd that has, you know, has been a focus of the management team for quite some time. We're getting a lot of traction. That's also giving the business the opportunity to reinvest, which also obviously drives the top line.\nI think Europe in our case is in a very positive cycle which we expect to continue in the coming years. Now I talked about Latin America, so I will not mention much. We continue to see a lot of growth in many parts of our AMESA region. In particular, India is a big growth space for us and it's an investment area for sure. The opportunity is massive. If you think you take a decade perspective and we're putting infrastructure on the ground and we're putting a lot of, you know, investing in the brands, make sure that we build the scale to capture what is going to be, I think a high demand market for many, many years.\nThen when it comes to Asia, we're seeing a, you know, a very cautious consumer. In China, the consumer is clearly.\nSaving more than spending. That has an implication for many categories. Our category is a low ticket item. We continue to see good performance of our categories, and we're gaining share. It's quite an advantage business what we have in China, especially on the food sides. We continue to invest in different regions of the country. We continue to get more penetration, additional distribution. That has been a big driver. Additional penetration, additional consumers coming to our brands, coming to the habit of snacking.\nThat has been very positive. In spite of a cautious consumer, we have levers to continue to grow the business. Some of that physical availability, some of that is share of market and better penetration of our brands. I think we have advantage products there.\nWe have a very strong R&D center in China that develops East for East products, and that is giving us an advantage versus other companies. So that's how we're seeing the different parts of the world. And again, we'll continue to invest. For us, this is a business that if you think about our international business, it's almost $40 billion already, right? So it's been growing very fast over time. It's almost $40 billion. It's accretive to PepsiCo. It's higher margin than the average of PepsiCo, and it's clearly the largest growth opportunity for our company if you think about the next decade.\nAnd that's where we put in so much focus, so much investment. We believe that we, you know, both on the beverage side and on the food side, we have many years of growth.\nIn that particular part of the business.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Line is open.\n\nRobert Ottenstein\n\nSenior Managing Director and Partner, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat, thank you very much.\nI want to look at a more structural, strategic type question.\nThat is to get your thoughts around the Carlsberg Britvic transaction.\nMaybe talk a little bit. Why?\nPerhaps it made more sense for Carlsberg.\nTo buy Britvic rather than you.\nYou know, given the fact that you generally own your bottlers in the US.\nWhy not Britvic? Does that have any implications in terms?\nOf how you're thinking about the US bottlers?\nDoes the fact that, you know, maybe combining beer and CSDs makes more?\nSales outside of the US. Obviously for regulatory reasons.\nHow should we think about that component? Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, I wouldn't extrapolate too much. This is a decision by Carlsberg to make an investment in the UK business. It makes a lot of sense for Carlsberg for multiple reasons. And we partner with Carlsberg in other geographies. We are very happy with the partnership. We trust them as a, you know, as a partner to grow our business. And of course we supported the transaction. So yeah, I wouldn't over extrapolate it. Let's make it a UK decision by Carlsberg. And we decided to endorse the transaction because we have a great relationship with Carlsberg and we trust them.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Carlos Laboy with HSBC. Your line is open.\n\nCarlos Laboy\n\nManaging Director, HSBC\n\nYes.\nGood morning everyone. Ramon, in keeping with the last two comments you've made in the Britvic deal, can you discuss the international franchise doctrine of PepsiCo? In other words, how are you thinking in terms of clarity of what each side is supposed to do and allowed to keep? Right. I'm trying to get a sense of how you're compelling independent bottlers to, in these great growth territories that you see, to step up investments for the purpose of accelerated system revenue growth and bottling returns.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, Carlos, we're very pleased with the relationship we have with most of the bottlers and this strategic alignment. Actually, our international beverage business has been one of the growth engines of the company for the last few years. So you know, we keep innovating and building great products that.\nHave consumer appeal. And specifically, we've been very successful with our non-sugar business internationally. Our non-sugar Pepsi has been a great driver of growth for many years. Gatorade is also another great platform that we are moving around. So you know, the last, is growing 10% historically, and we will continue to invest in other opportunities to scale up some of our bottlers. Of course, there's always opportunities to improve the infrastructure, and we're working on that for the long term. But I think this is a part of our business that is going well. It's a part of our business that we are prepared to invest even more. The bottlers know we obviously are very aligned strategically in which markets and which platforms we're going to put our focus and our investments.\nI think, as I said, it's part of our international story that I was referring to earlier. There's a food story, and there's a beverage story, and there's a combination of the two story in some markets that we're playing long term. Hopefully I'm answering your question. I don't know if you had some other kind of implications there.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC. Your line is open.\n\nNik Modi\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nYeah, thank you. Good morning everyone. Ramon, I was hoping you can just kind of share some perspective around overall food volume?\nRight.\nBecause a lot of questions have been asked about where's the volume going? It's not just salty snacks that's been under pressure pretty much across the board in terms of volumes. And so I was just curious on your thoughts. I mean, I don't think it's GLP-1. I know that's what some might suggest, but I'd love your views on kind of where you think the volume is actually migrating.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah.\nNick, I don't know about, you know, all the categories. I know that for many categories the multiple year inflation that we had to take because our input cost went up has created some perception and some reality in a lot of households that food is expensive, and consumers are making choices, and they can make choices to cook versus buy finished goods or finished products, or they can make a lot of decisions around how they spend their money and how do they feed themselves every day with the lowest budget.\nI think that's the fundamental question to address for the food companies now that our costs are kind of normalizing our input cost and we've all been going at productivity. In our case, this has been a very, very strategic focus for us.\nNow how do we deploy those resources against what are the best levers to reignite growth? And again, it will not be a blanket approach, it will be a segmented approach. In our case it will be very rational. It will based on data. I think we have a lot of data and we have great segmentation and I think we can execute with again with precision so that we don't destroy value, but we create value for the category as we increase the net revenue of the category. So that's how we're thinking about it. I don't think GLP-1 at this point has material impact in our category for sure. And we have a lot of panels and we have a lot of conversations with consumers.\nIt's not impacting us at this point. It's an economic value relationship for our categories, and we will address them in the second half of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur last question comes from.\nOne moment.\nComes from Kevin Grundy with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\n\nKevin Grundy\n\nManaging Director, BNP Paribas\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning. Everyone covered a lot of ground.\nNot to beat a dead horse.\nBut just to drill down a couple areas. Ramon, if we could on the demand weakness in snack. So you mentioned some parts of the portfolio, but not all consumers. I apologize if I miss this. What are you seeing beyond the low income consumer? A lot of focus on where's the consumer and depends on which management call you're listening to or what industry, frankly, what are you seeing specifically with the middle and high end consumer? Is the weakness also being seen among that cohort as well?\nAnd then I think an important question as well. Is there anything you're seeing in your market research? I know you're staying close to the consumer. That gives you any pause with the longer term outlook for the Frito business, which has been so strong for so long.\nIs there anything there that kind of gives you pause or do you view this to be entirely transitory? So thanks for that.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, thanks, Kevin. Listen, I think.\nThis need for value or more value consciousness I think is impacting every household in the US. So it is different levels of income. I think it's impacting everybody. And we're seeing behaviors in different income levels. I would aggregate all that. The consumer is much more price conscious, is looking for more value across.\nSo maybe you see the higher income consumers that, you know, they're not going to expensive restaurants, they're adjusting their behavior to more affordable restaurants or they stay at home and then, you know, they create their own entertainment moments or fun moments at home. So you see different behaviors happening everywhere. I think.\nThe connecting line would be the consumer is more cautious, the consumer is more choiceful, but the consumer is willing to spend in areas where they see value. We see it in our category. Right. The more the parts of the category that I was referring to, but also for other parts of the category, they're asking for more value and they're willing to start to compromise in some of their decisions. That's the problem to address.\nI would stay there. I think once we address that situation.\nWe'll be back in growth and we feel pretty good about the tools and the resources we have and the actions that we're taking. And we're quite encouraged by recent performance of the business. Okay, so I think this is the last question. So thank you everyone for joining us today and your thoughtful questions and also obviously for the confidence that you've placed in us with your investments. And we hope everybody has a great summer and that you buy a lot of PepsiCo products. So thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen.\nThat concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.\nSa.\nSam.\nSa.\nIt.\nGood morning and welcome to PepsiCo's 2024 Q2 Earnings question and answer session. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until it is your turn to ask a question. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\n\nRavi Pamnani\n\nSVP and Investor Relations, PepsiCo\n\nThank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans and updated 2024 guidance. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, 11 July 2024, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures which exclude certain items from reported results.\nPlease refer to our Q2 2024 Earnings Release and Q2 2024 Form 10-Q available on PepsiCo.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta and PepsiCo's Executive Vice President and CFO Jamie Caulfield. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question, and with that I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. In order to ask a question or make a comment, please press star followed by one-one on your touch-tone phone at any time. We will pause for a moment while we compile our Q&A roster.\nOur first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nGood morning Dara.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nI just wanted to focus on the implied organic sales growth guidance in.\nThe back half of the year.\nMid single digits to get to the approximate 4% guidance. You've obviously had a great longer term track record, Ramon. Under your tenure. But in this softer US consumer environment, we've seen low single digit growth and.\nThe last couple of quarters.\nSo, what gives you confidence at the corporate level you can get back there? And, specifically, I wanted to dial down into Frito-Lay North America, which is presumably a piece of that, obviously a pretty soft volume result. In Q2, you had taken some initial actions. So, you know, help us understand the incremental actions from here. What gives you confidence you get a volume payback and a top line payback from that? And how sort of Frito-Lay North America fits into that implied top line recovery also.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nThat's great, Dara. So I think it's an important area to focus when we're saying at least four. We were talking more about around five in our minds. Now we're talking around four. So that's the pivot we're making. There is an adjustment and it's related to specifically.\nThe consumer in the US, and we can talk a little bit more now. Why do we feel good about our guidance, and it cannot be disconnected from our earnings performance? Because I think the work we've been doing on our productivity and our cost reduction gives us the optionality to reinvest back in H2 in a way that we feel much more comfortable about the performance. So a couple of, I would say, elements that give us confidence now.\nOne is Quaker, Quaker, you know, you're all familiar with the situation. We're recovering the supply chain by Q4, you know, we'll be in almost 100% supply. And obviously the business at that point will be growing materially because we're just refilling the shelves on the pipeline. So that should be out of, out of the picture, and it will be a positive impact for us.\nThe second is mathematical, but it's lapping, and we think obviously the lapses are much better in the second half. That gives us confidence that we can get back to a mid-single-digit type of growth in the second half. The third element is international. International is an area we've been investing for the last few years materially, and is delivering for us. So, first half of the year, 7%, we think that we will continue that same level of growth in the second half of the year. Pluses and minuses around the world. But the portfolio is diverse enough, scale enough, profitable enough around multiple parts of the world that we believe that we can deliver.\nNow, in the US, there is clearly a consumer that is more challenged and is a consumer that is telling us that, in particular parts of our portfolio, they want more value to stay with our brands. That is not for all the consumers. It's some consumers. That is not for all the portfolio. It's some parts of the portfolio. And we have been working different tactics to give the consumer what they want. And we see that it's working. That's why we feel comfortable about, given the oxygen that we have in the P&L, that we'll be able to deploy in a very targeted way, thinking long-term about the category, making sure that it has good ROI.\nThey will be able to turn around, especially what you were referring to the food business, positive volume and, with that, a higher level of net revenue.\nSo that's how we're thinking about the second half. Again, we have green shoots with some of the activities we've been executing, and July 4 has been very strong for us, and we feel good about the business now. The North America beverage business is also to be highlighted. It's a business that we said over time we want to stay with, you know, deliver profitable growth, make sure we compete well in the category, but at the same time improve our margins. You know, we think we're executing the playbook well.\nActually, we've been accelerating the profitable growth, you know, delivery of the business, and it should continue in the second half. We're investing in advertising and marketing even more in the platforms that are growing.\nThat's what, overall, you put it all together. We feel good about the second half of the year and the momentum that will start 2025 with that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thank you. Good morning everyone. I actually had a question on PBNA. Ramon, I know you just touched on it a bit, but I'd be curious to hear if you're satisfied with some of the progress you might be making to reinvigorate the business and maybe what green shoots you are seeing within PBNA. And then I guess I'm hoping for some color on the initiatives you highlighted in terms of the disciplined commercial investments. Should we assume this will also mean a potential step up in promos for PBNA? And do you maybe see a need for some brand repositioning? Are there structural opportunities, essentially what will be the drivers to reaccelerate growth at PBNA?\nThanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, that's good, Bonnie. I'll give you a couple of data points that I think are relevant. Gatorade, for example, has been gaining share.\nThis year to date. Meaningful. It's accelerating. That's a core part of our portfolio and a very profitable part of our portfolio. So that's one data point we've been investing in Gatorade, not so much on, as you were saying, promos and discount, but more on innovation, execution, and branding. And that's paying back. The same with Propel. So all that functional hydration space, I think it's a focus for us. It's always been a focus, but now I think that part of the portfolio is working well. I think some of the G-to-DSD challenges that we had last year are behind us. I don't think we're all the way to perfection there, but much better service levels.\nIn this early part of the summer, which obviously that's when the category peaks and where we have to be ready for perfection. So that part is clear. If you think about the other brand we've been talking for some time.\nMountain Dew is on growth. Now it's back to growth. I think we made this strategic decision to have multiple flavors driving the brand and made Baja a structural part of the portfolio versus just an LTO that's driving consumers into the brand, incremental consumers, and again, better levels of execution. So just some examples. All the Zero part of the portfolio is booming, right? If you think about consumer trends, clearly we know where they're going. We know that internationally, and we know that's going to eventually happen here in the US, so Zero not only on colas, not only on soft drinks, but also on Gatorade, on teas, and on coffees; we're seeing that consumers are going to.\nAnd then the last part is our foodservice business is becoming stronger and we're being better at where the profitability is, which is on the fragmented restaurant, local restaurant, and where consumers.\nHave a lot of interaction every day. That part of the portfolio we've been investing, we're getting additional distribution. We know we're becoming a better execution company in that particular channel and we're feeling good about that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\nGreat. Thanks so much, Ramon. I wanted to go back to Frito-Lay, if I may, because you commented on some consumers and being more value to stay with our brands. But one thing we've been doing a lot in trying to parse through the data that's available to us, and it looks like it's the category, the salty snack category as a whole, is really pressured. It's not just your brands. I know given your share, they're sort of one and the same, but it looks like there's a broader category issue.\nAgain, some of the data we've looked at, it feels like the category is not proving terribly responsive to promotion. So I just was hoping you could comment on that, if that is or isn't consistent with what you're seeing, and how what you're going to be doing will be different. Because again, what we've seen so far, it doesn't look like there's a lot of response, and it feels like the category is proving more discretionary. So just love your thoughts on that.\nThanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo",
    "content2": "Yeah, I think.\nWe feel that the issue is an issue of value, not an issue of anything else. And.\nWe have a lot of data, obviously, now. How do you address that value gap versus what consumers want to do? I think.\nIs where the know-how will come, and the sweet spot for us is not to promote but is to promote to who needs it in their products that need it versus a blanket approach to promotion. So that's where we're investing a lot of time. I think we're much more capable from the insights and diagnostic point of view and also from our ability to execute more granularly all these interventions, be it digital, be it with particular channels or customers.\nTo give you an example, we feel that the unsalted part of our portfolio, right. If you think about potato chips or tortilla chips, that needs some value reset and value intervention for some consumers. When we think about flavored potato chips or other parts of our portfolio.\nNo, I mean consumers are staying in the category, are staying in our brands, and they're buying with pretty high frequency as in the past. There are other parts of the portfolio that are growing, growing very fast. Especially the permissible part of what we call permissible portfolio, Positive Choices. You think about brands like SunChips, PopCorners, Smartfood, or the Simply range Off The Eaten Path. Those brands are growing, and there it's not about value there, I think it's more about. And the way we're going to approach it is more marketing, investment, awareness, execution, and availability. So there's different, there's different tools that we'll be using.\nTo drive the category growth. To your point on, is it the category, is it PepsiCo brands? I think given our massive.\nParticipation in the category through many multiple brands, I think it's our responsibility to manage this category for the long term, providing value to consumers in different ways, and continue to have.\nThe savory snacks category growing above food structurally, as we have done in the past. Now there is nothing in terms of consumer long-term trends that tells us that that's not possible. I think it's small adjustments in value, in execution, and in investment in new innovation areas that will drive it. And we feel very strong about our ability to do that not in the long-term, but actually in the short term in Q3 and Q4. And that's why our guidance reflects a little bit that inflection. Because we're already testing and executing some of these levers and we see the returns it has in volume and net revenue.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Bryan Spillane with BofA. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, Ramon.\nGood morning, Jamie.\nJust wanted to circle back on Frito, and I guess, stepping back, you're able to sort of reset the margins and fund it with just drilling deeper into some of the reservoirs of productivity other.\nPlaces in the organization.\nI guess just if you can comment on two things related to that. One.\nGiven that you're tapping more productivity this year, does it? How does that affect next year? Does that affect maybe not having as much productivity to flow through or is that reservoir very deep? And then the second is, as we're thinking about Frito margins stepping back in the back half of the year, should we be thinking about that now as the new base to maybe grow off of gradually or is that a major step down and then you'd expect Frito to have another maybe step change up in the future?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. So Bryan, let me tell you, I think we've talked about this in the past. We're managing total PepsiCo operating margin, and as you've seen, we keep improving the margin. This quarter was almost 100 basis points of operating margin improvement. And it's been consistent for the last few years. We feel good about our productivity pipeline. It's not tactical, it's super strategic, and it's multiyear, and it's based on automation, it's based on digitalization, simplification of the company, standardization, different service models to the business. So there is a whole portfolio of productivity ideas that are multiyear in nature.\nAnd we don't think that we will slow down our productivity in the coming years. Now, as you think about our overall margin, International has continued to grow its margin. PBNA has been very vocal from our side that we want to have that business going, moving into mid teens.\nWe've delivered on that. We've always said that the big value of Frito for us is not so much whether it's a 26 or 26.5 or 27.5; that is very relevant. I would say it's always tremendously accretive for us long term. And the biggest value creation for Frito is to make sure that it grows at a 4% or 5% level. And that is going to be and continues to be our strategic focus. How do we get Frito to continue to grow above the category, make the category very healthy in terms of growth, keep bringing consumers, locations, and channel new opportunities for channel expansion to Frito?\nAnd that will continue to be our focus. We'll keep investing until we get it right. We feel good about getting it right rather soon.\nThat's the way we'll keep managing the overall profitability of the company, Frito-Lay, PBNA, and International in particular with different sub-strategies. Obviously that trickles down to every market around the world when you talk about international. But we have very good playbook for every country and every line of business in every country, expectations on profitability, and roadmaps to deliver that kind of growth.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nKaumil Gajrawala\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHi. Good morning, everybody.\nDo you believe that the prices at Frito are too high given the increases over recent years?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nKaumil.\nI think I kind of touched on the point earlier, but.\nSome parts of the portfolio need value adjustments. Some parts of the portfolio don't. Some parts of the portfolio need to be for particular consumers. We need some new entry price points and probably some new promotional, you know, kind of mechanics that don't expect for the consumer to invest so much cash in a purchase of salty. So there's adjustments that we have to make to for certain consumers. Some parts of the portfolio, I don't think the overall portfolio.\nNeeds a reset. I think this is going to be about granularity. Is going to be about good execution of that granularity. That's what I think we're well prepared to do throughout the full value chain. Yes, there is some value to be given back to consumers after three or four years of a lot of inflation. Our cost allows us to do that whatever we choose to do. That will be one of the interventions that we'll be making.\nIn the second half, but not the only one. I mean, there's going to be investments in marketing, there's going to be investments in better execution that overall will drive the business growth to where we think it will be structural in the coming years.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. So I was hoping to get some color on Latin America. Organic revenue was the weakest we've seen in some time here, and I think in the prepared remarks Brazil and Mexico seemed solid. So just curious, kind of what drove the weakness in the quarter. And then, Ramon, just as we look ahead, you mentioned you still expect strong growth from international in the back half of the year. How does Latin America fit into that equation? Would you anticipate improvement or should we expect more muted performance to continue?\nThanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nNo, I think again I would look at LATAM and all the international business in like six months rather than a three months and three months. There's a lot of moving pieces between Q1, Q2, Chinese New Year.\nIn particular, the LATAM situation in our case.\nIs.\nRelated to Mexico and Mexico because of the elections, there have been some changes in disposable income given to the families by the government that created some, I would say, some abnormalities in the way those funds were distributed. That's impacted demand in Mexico in the last. What we're seeing in the last three weeks in Mexico that as those funds have been given back to consumers again, that the demand has come back to our category. So we don't foresee any issue in LATAM. LATAM again, I mean, value continues to be a factor as it's always been in LATAM. We'll see pluses and minuses between the different countries.\nBut as a region, LATAM continues to be a high performing region for us where we keep developing the categories and we keep expanding our margins and building scale businesses not only in Mexico and Brazil, but across multiple markets.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Your line is open.\nHey, good morning everyone. So just staying on international business. Ramon, you sound pretty confident on the growth in international. Maybe you can talk more about like what regions do you see the greater growth potential in that business? And going back to the question on guidance on top for the second half, is the improvement in organic sales mainly driven by an improvement in North America or an acceleration in international? If you can give some color there, it will be helpful.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Filippo. Hi.\nYou should assume that most of the incremental acceleration of the business comes from mostly North America. Right? And the two factors I mentioned, Quaker will get back to growth. You know, the Lay's get better for North America, and then some of the interventions we're making both in value and in additional A&M should drive additional volume. Those are the three factors. Internationally, we're assuming that the rate of growth for the first half will continue in the second half. And again, we're seeing parts of the portfolio.\nAccelerating, parts of the portfolio kind of stabilizing, some of them being a little bit softer. But overall the portfolio at this point is broad enough, we have enough scale across multiple markets that we're kind of hedged geographically. So that's what we're assuming and what we're seeing that you know, the per caps growth of the category will continue. We continue to invest meaningfully incremental funds to both execution and brand development.\nAnd we, you know, we don't see any reason why not. Of course it could be big geopolitical reasons why, you know, we change our mind later in the year. But with information we have today about geopolitics and, and the stability of countries, that's our best guess today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen.\nYour line is open.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Thanks.\nA couple questions.\nOne is I was hoping you'd give a little more color on the energy drinks category. Growth has slowed dramatically in the US, and just wanted to get your perspective and ask like, do you think that.\nConsumers there are making a value decision as well? There's a lot of premium-priced drinks there. Do you see any evidence of trading down to maybe higher-caffeine carbonated drinks?\nThanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nListen.\nI think fundamentally the energy category continues to provide.\nLong-term good prospects for our industry. I think it's a consumer need that will continue to be there, and whether we're able to satisfy that through multiple options that will continue to grow.\nThere's always small ups and downs of subcategories within LRB that you could argue.\nIs it because of channel dynamics? Is it because it's very hot and people are moving to other parts of the portfolio? Like, we're seeing, for example, in our case, in the recent six weeks, a massive growth in our hydration portfolio because obviously it's been very hot in the US. So I guess there is some cannibalization between energy and hydration for some consumers, and they prefer to do that. So I wouldn't overread into the short-term category. I would try to think about this as, the consumer needs energy. If we're able to provide energy in a, you know, in a consumer-friendly way, including price, probably as you mentioned. But I would say functionality, clean labels. I mean, like, a lot of the things that I think the category has been working on. There should be a good runway for that segment of the category.\nIt's been value creating for a lot of us that participate in it, including the retailer partners and the brand owners.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\nGood morning everyone. Ramon, Jamie, my question is on the bridge to the mid single digit organic sales growth in the second half, assuming international. Ramon just mentioned growth the same kind of mid single digits into the second half. And of course understanding the easy comps for Quaker, it still implies a good inflection into Frito and PBNA. How do you think we should be thinking about the progress and perhaps related to that from a channel perspective, the away from home.\nFor you, growing from what it seems to be like a distribution. What is the like for like in sales? Basically by channel. If you would think about Away From Home and at home.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nAndrea, it's Jamie. Yeah. On the acceleration in the back half.\nAs Ramon mentioned, that's going to come.\nMostly from North America for reasons we cited.\nWe're making the investment primarily focused North America. We've got the easier laps and Quaker. So that gives us a lot of confidence on channels. Look, away from home has been a.\nFocus area for us.\nWe put investment behind that and it's outgrowing the balance of our portfolio. So we'd expect that to continue.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\n\nChirs Carey\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi, good morning everyone. Ramon, I know you mentioned international to be looked at on six-month cadence. I was wondering however, if you could comment on some specific regions just in Europe. Why to your mind have trends been so resilient? I don't think it's just your portfolio. I think the region in general has been more resilient for longer than many expected. And then in Asia, I think you were clear last quarter that there was some timing benefit. Clearly we saw that normalize this quarter. What's the right run rate for this division? And do you have any comments on the progress in China? Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, so listen, again, we're looking at International as a portfolio of geographies and markets, and we see the portfolio kind of when it's not growing so much here. So at the end, historically, we've learned that the portfolio is quite diversified, and that gives us the opportunity to talk about an international business as a total. Obviously, we run the business locally now. When you go down to different parts of the world, Europe is resilient and is resilient.\nOur business has been performing very well both on top line and share, and very importantly in margin improvement. That has been a focus of the management team for quite some time. We're getting a lot of traction. That's also giving the business the opportunity to reinvest, which also obviously drives the top line. I think Europe in our case is in a very positive cycle, which we expect to continue in the coming years. Now I talked about Latin America, so I will not mention much. We continue to see a lot of growth in many parts of our Americas region. In particular, India is a big growth space for us, and it's an investment area for sure. The opportunity is massive.\nIf you think, you know, you take a decade perspective and we're putting infrastructure on the ground and we're putting a lot of, you know, investing in the brands, make sure that we build the scale to capture what is going to be a, I think, a high demand market for many, many years.\nThen, when it comes to Asia, we're seeing, you know, a very cautious consumer. In China, the consumer is clearly.\nYou know, saving, saving more than spending. That has an implication for many categories. Our category is a low-ticket item, so we continue to see great, good performance of our categories, and we're gaining share. It's quite an advantaged business what we have in China, especially on the food side, and we continue to invest in different regions of the country. We continue to get more penetration, additional distribution. That has been a big driver. So, additional penetration, additional consumers coming to our brands, coming to the habit of snacking, and that has been very positive.\nSo, in spite of a cautious consumer, we have levers to continue to grow the business. Some of that physical availability, some of that is share of market, and better penetration of our brands. I think we have advantaged products there.\nWe have a very strong R&D center in China that develops East for East products, and that is giving us an advantage versus other companies. So that's how we're seeing the different parts of the world. Again we'll continue to invest. For us this is a business that if you think about our international business, it's almost $40 billion already, right? So it's been growing very fast over time. It's almost $40 billion. It's accretive to PepsiCo, it's higher margin than the average of PepsiCo, and it's clearly the largest growth opportunity for our company if you think about the next decade.\nThat's why we're putting so much focus, so much investment. Investment. We believe that we, you know, both on the beverage side and on the food side, we have many years of growth.\nIn that particular part of the business.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Line is open.\n\nRobert Ottenstein\n\nSenior Managing Director and Partner, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat, thank you very much.\nI want to look at a more structural, strategic type question.\nThat is to get your thoughts around the Carlsberg Britvic transaction.\nMaybe talk a little.\nBut why perhaps it made more sense.\nFor Carlsberg to buy Britvic rather than you.\nGiven the fact that you generally own your bottlers in the US, why not? Why not Britvic? Does that have any implications in terms.\nOf how you're thinking about the US bottlers?\nDoes the fact that maybe combining.\nBeer and CSDs makes more sense outside of the US. Obviously, for regulatory reasons.\nHow should we think about that component?\nThank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, I wouldn't extrapolate too much. This is a decision by Carlsberg to make an investment in the UK business. It makes a lot of sense for Carlsberg for multiple reasons. We partner with Carlsberg in other geographies. We are very happy with the partnership. We trust them as a, you know, as a partner to grow our business. You know, of course we, you know, we supported the transaction. So yeah, I wouldn't over extrapolate it. Let's make it a UK decision by Carlsberg. We decided to endorse the transaction because we have a great relationship with Carlsberg and with.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Carlos Laboy with HSBC. Your line is open.\n\nCarlos Laboy\n\nManaging Director, HSBC\n\nYes.\nGood morning everyone. Ramon, in keeping with the last two comments you've made in the Britvic deal, can you discuss the international franchise doctrine of PepsiCo? In other words, how are you thinking in terms of clarity of what each side is supposed to do and allowed to keep? Right. I'm trying to get a sense of how you're compelling independent bottlers in these great growth territories that you see to step up investments for the purpose of accelerated system revenue growth and bottling returns.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, Carlos, listen, we're very pleased with the relationship we have with most of the bottlers and this strategic alignment. Actually our international beverage business has been one of the growth engines of the company for the last few years. So you know, we keep innovating and building great products that, you know, have consumer appeal. And specifically we've been very successful with our non sugar business internationally. Our non sugar Pepsi has been a great driver of growth for many years.\nGatorade is also another great platform that we are moving around. So, you know, the last is growing 10% historically and we will continue to invest. Now are there opportunities to scale up some of our bottlers? Of course, there's always opportunities to improve the infrastructure and we're working on that for the long term.\nBut I think this is a part of our business that is going well. It's a part of our business that we are prepared to invest even more. The bottlers know we obviously are very aligned strategically in which markets and which platforms we're going to put our focus and our investments. And I think, as I said, it's part of our international story that I was referring to earlier. There's a food story, and there's a beverage story, and there's a combination of the two story in some markets that we're playing long term.\nSo hopefully I'm answering your question. I don't know if you had some other kind of implications there.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC. Your line is open.\n\nNik Modi\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nYeah, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Ramon, I was hoping you can just kind of share some perspective around overall food volume. Right. Because a lot of questions have been asked about where's the volume going. It's not just salty snacks that's been under pressure pretty much across the board in terms of volumes. And so I was just curious on your thoughts. I mean, I don't think it's GLP-1. I know that's what some might suggest, but I'd love your views on kind of where you think the volume's actually migrating.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah.\nNick, I don't know about all the categories. I know that for many categories, the multiple year inflation that we had to take because our input cost went up has created some perception and some reality in a lot of households that food is expensive, and consumers are making choices, and they can make choices to cook versus buy finished goods or finished products, or they can make a lot of decisions around how they spend their money and how do they feed themselves every day with the lowest budget.\nAnd I think that's the fundamental question to address for the food companies now that our costs are kind of normalizing, our input cost, and we've all been going at productivity. In our case, this has been a very, very strategic focus for us. Now how do we deploy those resources against what are the best levers to reignite growth?\nAnd again, it will not be a blanket approach, it will be a segmented approach. In our case, it will be very rational. It will be based on data. I think we have a lot of data, and we have great segmentation, and I think we can execute again with precision so that we don't destroy value, but we create value for the category as we increase the net revenue of the category. So that's how we're thinking about it. I don't think GLP-1 at this point has material impact in our category for sure.\nAnd we have a lot of panels, and we have a lot of conversations with consumers. It's not impacting us at this point. It's an economic value relationship for our categories, and we will address them in the second half of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur last question comes from.\nOne moment.\nComes from Kevin Grundy with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\n\nKevin Grundy\n\nManaging Director, BNP Paribas\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Covered a lot of ground. And not to beat a dead horse, but just to drill down a couple areas. Ramon, if we could. On the demand weakness in snack. So you mentioned some parts of the portfolio, but not all consumers. I apologize if I miss this. What are you seeing beyond the low-income consumer? It's a lot of focus on where's the consumer, and it depends on which management call you're listening to or what industry, frankly.\nWhat are you seeing specifically with the middle- and high-end consumer? Is the weakness also being seen among that cohort as well? And then I think an important question as well: is there anything you're seeing in your market research? I know you're staying close to the consumer.\nThat gives you any pause with the longer-term outlook for the Frito business, which has been so strong for so long. Is there anything there that kind of gives you pause or you view this to be entirely transitory? So thanks for that.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, thanks, Kevin. Listen, I think.\nThis need for value or more value consciousness, I think, is impacting every household in the US. So it is different levels of income. I think it's impacting everybody. And we're seeing behaviors in different income levels. I would aggregate all that. The consumer is much more price conscious, is looking for more value across. So maybe you see the higher income consumers that, you know, they're not going to expensive restaurants, they're adjusting their behavior to more affordable restaurant or they stay at home and then, you know, they create their own entertainment moments or food fun moments at home. So you see different behaviors happening everywhere. I think.\nThe connecting line would be the consumer is more cautious, the consumer is more choiceful, but the consumer is willing to spend in areas where they see value. We see it in our category, right. The more the parts of the category that I was referring to but also for other parts of the category, they're asking for more value and they're willing to start to compromise in some of their decisions. That's the problem to address.\nI would stay there, and I think once we address that situation.\nWe'll be back in growth, and we feel pretty good about the tools and the resources we have and the actions that we're taking, and we're quite encouraged by recent performance of the business. Okay, so I think this is the last question. Thank you everyone for joining us today, and your thoughtful questions, and also obviously for the confidence that you've placed in us with your investments. We hope everybody has a great summer and that you buy a lot of PepsiCo products. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen.\nThat concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day."

Your lines have been placed on listen only until it is your turn to ask a question. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\n\nRavi Pamnani\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, PepsiCo\n\nThank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans and 2024 guidance. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, 23 April 2024, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to our Q1 2024 Earnings Release and Q1 2024 Form 10-Q available on PepsiCo.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements.\nJoining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta, and PepsiCo's Executive Vice President and CFO, Jamie Caulfield. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question, and with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. In order to ask a question or make a comment, please press star followed by one one on your touch-tone phone. One moment for our first question. Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nResearch Analysts of Beverage, Household & Personal Care Products, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, guys. Good morning.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nMorning, Dara.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nResearch Analysts of Beverage, Household & Personal Care Products, Morgan Stanley\n\nSo really strong international profit results for the Q3 in a row here. Can you just take a step back, Ramon, and maybe give us some perspective on that international performance over the last few quarters? And A, just looking forward short-term, how confident are you in the sustainability of that and the balance of the year? But B, also just long-term, as you think about international development over the last few quarters, give us some perspective looking out over the next few years, both from a top-line perspective and then the margin flow through. Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nGreat. Thank you, Dara. And yeah, we're very pleased with the performance of international businesses in Q1, but also in the last few quarters, as you mentioned. And this has been an area of investment for us now for a few years, both in snacks and in beverages, and trying to build scale businesses in most of the markets where there's scale in terms of population and profitable growth. So I feel very good about our ability to continue to outperform our categories in international and to keep our categories growing, both food and beverages, in the future. Our innovation is strong. Our ability to understand local rituals and local food and beverage occasions is better than ever. We are adapting our portfolio to that. Our ability to attract the best talent in the markets where we participate and build really capable teams is better than ever.\nWe've been investing in capacity. Right now, we're in the process of opening factories in Vietnam, in China, in India, and in Mexico, and we just opened one in Poland. So we keep expanding our manufacturing and our go-to-market capabilities in those markets. So we feel good, and I think that was going to continue to be a big source of growth for us. As we mentioned in CAGNY, I think our international business is already $36 billion, and it's growing at a very high single-digit level and with very good profitability. So it is part of the future growth story for PepsiCo, for sure.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I had a question on Frito-Lay OP margins, which we're a little soft in the quarter. So hoping you could talk through some of the key puts and takes on your margins in the quarter and then moving forward. And then is it realistic to assume Frito-Lay's OP margins will expand in 2024? And I'm thinking about that in the context of commodity cost pressures easing a bit, or how do we think about your level of reinvestment as these cost savings maybe are in an effort to drive faster top-line growth? And then ultimately, curious to hear if Frito-Lay margins can ultimately return to the low 30% range, and if so, by when? How do we think about that? Thank you.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nHey, Bonnie. It's Jamie. How are you? Yeah, on Frito, when you look at the Q1 profit, the thing to keep in mind is last year we're lapping 24% growth in the Q1 of last year. I think we had 180 basis points of margin improvement last year. And we don't want to push the P&L that hard. The growth last year, growth this year, part of that has to do with investment timing, the flow of productivity. But I think you'll see margin improvement over time at Frito, but this is a business that has very healthy margins already, and we want to make sure that we're investing back in the business to sustain growth.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, Bonnie, I think on top of what Jamie said, for the long-term, the key goal for Frito in the US is to continue to grow the salty savory category at a very high rate and continue to get occasions from other parts of macro snacks into the savory and from meals into savory, and continue to gain share of that category as it has been doing, including Q1. So that's the ultimate goal because if you think about the high margin that we have in that business and the impact it would have in the overall PepsiCo margins, that's the role that Frito-Lay has in the portfolio.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with B of A. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nThanks, Operator. Good morning, everybody. Ramon, I guess a question on PBNA and specifically on Gatorade and Mountain Dew. The volumes are still weak. Gatorade noticeably weak in the quarter. And so can you just talk about, one, how much in the quarter might have been affected by the weather? And then second, I guess, as we're thinking about volume recovery for the whole, for the enterprise at PBNA, just what's on tap for both Mountain Dew and Gatorade to stabilize the volume trend?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nThat's good, Bryan. Actually, we feel good about those two brands. Those two brands actually gained share in Q1, so Mountain Dew and Gatorade in their own category. So that's a meaningful performance, good performance, I would say. Now, Gatorade, as you mentioned, a little bit of weather impact. So we're not concerned about Gatorade this year. As the weather improves, I think we have the right investments, the right commercial programs. Our G2DSD was impactful to us last year operationally. I think we've learned a lot on how to deal with a very high seasonality product and category and give the better service to our customers and maintain the product in stock and available. So we feel good about we have the platform to take Gatorade to higher market share in a faster-growing category.\nNow, with regards to Dew, the launch of Baja Blast has been very good to the brand. We launched it as a permanent additional flavor to the portfolio early in the year. It's been obviously successful. We knew it was a successful LTO, and therefore it's a successful permanent product. And it's been bringing incremental consumers to the brand and help us gain share now. Obviously, we will keep investing in the portfolio and the brand, and we have strong programs for the summer. Hopefully, that will deliver as we expect, and we'll continue to build Mountain Dew in the category. So feeling good about those two brands.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. In the prepared remarks, I noticed in the discussion of PBNA and plans to improve profitability there, there were two new bullets. The first two talking about de-emphasizing certain product and package combinations, and the second around revenue management and increasingly precise consumer value proposition. So I was curious if you could just, I know there's new management for that business as well. So would love to get a little bit more color maybe around those two points. I thought would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Lauren, I think, I don't know. Maybe we have put a bit more detail, but the intentionality was always there. I mentioned last time on the last couple of calls that we're making choices in PBNA in terms of making sure that we deliver profitable growth and will continue to make those choices, emphasizing the parts of the portfolio where there is a better return on the investments for us and eliminating those parts of the portfolio where the margins are not that attractive, and they're going to get probably not that better over time. So we've been referring to categories like pack water or some of the less profitable take-home formats where we will be making choices. We feel good about both the productivity at PBNA and the margin expansion at PBNA.\nWe feel that that will continue based on the ideas that we have and the organizational focus that the team has been putting under the new management, but also the old management in PBNA. There's much more focus on becoming a better operating machine in the supply chain, sales, and expanding the margin. So we feel good about PBNA margin expansion and profitable growth delivery this year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nHead of North America Beverage, Household and Personal Care Research, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Good morning. Thank you. So, Ramon, if you can please comment on the overall consumption, and in particular for snacks, and how consumer behavior evolved in the context of your comments about normalization. And then a clarification for Jamie on the margin outlook. On the prepared remarks, you mentioned a more benign commodities environment, but that has recently changed, in particular for oil, and looking at DSD, hoping to get some clarification on the diesel impact. Or, is this going to be more further down and perhaps not even impacting 2024? Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. So listen, Andrea, hi. I would say the consumer globally, we think it's very resilient, and we see it, as you saw, from our international business performance. It's basically supported by two facts: very low unemployment, or quite low unemployment globally, and wages growing at a good pace in the majority of the countries where we participate. So those two things make us feel quite good about the consumer. Now, when you double-click, there are probably two areas that probably surface. One is Chinese consumers. I think Chinese consumers are being very cautious, and we're seeing the savings rate really going very high in China. Our category is still resilient in China, but especially we're delivering growth through share of market gains in China. So that's a good performance by the team, but an area of watch-out for us.\nThe other double-click is in the, I would say, the lower-income consumer in the US. The lower-income consumer in the US is stretched, is making a lot of, strategizing a lot to make their budgets get to the end of the month. And that's a consumer that is choosing what to buy, where to buy, and making a lot of choices. That's a consumer that we're emphasizing in our commercial programs. I think we're learning how best to keep that consumer in our categories at the frequency that we want that consumer. And we are pivoting our commercial plans, our innovation, giving that consumer the right innovation, the right value in different parts of the month through different channels, digital and physical, making sure that the ROIs on the investments are the best ROIs.\nSo those two are the consumers that I would say we're paying more attention in terms of specific commercial programs. But I would say the consumer is very resilient everywhere else. And our teams, I think, are pivoting to maintain our brands top of mind, in their baskets, at the frequency that we want, and continue to gain market share. So it applies to beverages and to snacks. Your question was more on snacks, but I think it applies to both categories. So now, Jamie, on. Yeah. And Andrea, on commodities, really no change in the outlook. A couple of points I just want to emphasize. One is the diversity of the inputs in the basket. So no single commodity accounts for more than 10% of the total. So that diversification kind of smooths things out.\nThe other point I'd make is we do tend to forward buy and hedge so that we've got good visibility for the year, that helps us with planning the business overall. And so, outlook Q2 through Q4: still relatively benign inflation, and not a lot of volatility in the rate of inflation quarter to quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping to get an update on the Celsius agreement and kind of just your broader energy drink strategy at this point. In the release, you spoke positively about the partnership, but I think there were some changes to the incentive structure a few weeks back. Maybe first, just any thoughts on how the brand is performing as part of your energy drink portfolio. Then just anything you can share in terms of what changed with the agreement, but maybe specifically, how does it really help Pepsi? Maybe what benefit does it provide for Celsius, if anything? Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Thank you, Peter. I will not talk too much about the agreement other than saying that it's a good alignment of the long-term interests of both companies, and it's great for PepsiCo shareholders. The partnership with Celsius is strong, and it's helping us to gain scale in our go-to markets, specifically in some channels where we need volume to justify some of the economics of the call. So that role continues. We're pleased with the partnership. Energy is a fast-growing category, profitable. That is great for our portfolio. So that's what I would say. We remain pleased with the partnership, and we'll continue to build the partnership going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. So I wanted to go back to Frito-Lay, but on the top-line trends. Clearly, you guys were cycling the toughest comp of the year in Frito-Lay. You mentioned you expect some sequential improvements. So maybe you could talk about the volume trajectory, particularly for the business. And Ramon, you spoke in the past about the cycling of this shift towards smaller pack sizes. So maybe you can give us an update on that. And also, any potential impact from cycling the reduction in SNAP benefits from last year. Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. I would say the Frito-Lay continues to outperform the category. And as I said earlier, the big opportunity for Frito-Lay is to continue to create occasions for our savory category, bringing them from broader macro snacks or snacks and meals overlap. How do we bring more category stores, more occasions towards snacking? So those are the two big strategic objectives of Frito-Lay. And all our innovation, pricing, channel mix, and everything else is against that large objective and do it faster than others so that we continue to gain shares. So as we look at the business performance, as you said, this is the toughest lap. I think last year we grew 16% in Q1, and that lap is still high in Q2, but then it gets much better in H2.\nSo we should expect a gradual sequential improvement of our volume for Frito-Lay, especially in the second half of the year. And we'll continue to be the guardians of the savory category, make sure it's valued properly, and it generates growth for our customers ahead of what food generates for our customers. And we continue to capture a disproportionate share of that very fast-growing and profitable business.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nKaumil Gajrawala\n\nManaging Director of Beverage, Household Products and HALO Strategy, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. You mentioned multiple times on gaining share within the category. Could you just give us some in multiple regions, can you just give us some context on what the categories are growing or at least maybe what they're expected to grow as you think about the next year or so?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. I mean, what I said is that our goal is always for our categories to grow faster than overall food and beverages. I think that makes us a very attractive partner with our retail partners, and we deliver growth for them. And our categories are profitable, so it's a good combination of growth and profitability for our customers. So that's what we're trying to do. I think our categories will continue to grow faster than food and beverages in the majority of the countries around the world, given the trends on urbanization and the secular trends that we've been talking about, both for convenient foods and beverages. So we feel good about that. And our commercial programs, innovation, and investments are in to deliver that for our partners. Obviously, there are countries around the world where we do better, others where we do less well.\nOur goal is to keep emphasizing the ones where we do better and improve the ones that we don't do so well. That's how we're managing the company.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nConsumer Staples Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Thanks for the question. The 4% price mix benefit in Frito-Lay North America is pretty impressive in a food industry where there's just not a lot of pricing left. And I imagine a lot of it is from price pack architecture or maybe even consumers shifting to different pack sizes. Can you help delineate a little bit more which of those is driving it more than the other or if it's about the same? And how do you expect it to evolve for the rest of the year? Do you expect it to be pretty constant?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Hey, Robert. It's Jamie. And its majority is price, but there's an element of mix in there. I'd put it at probably 2/3 price and 1/3 mix. And yeah, as I commented earlier on our inflationary trends, we expect them to be fairly moderate for the balance of the year, fairly smooth for the balance of the year. So I wouldn't expect a lot of volatility in that volume-revenue relationship.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Ottenstein\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Two kind of follow-ups, if I may. Can you please talk about the spring shelf sets? Is it pretty much done? And how do you feel good about what you're seeing both on the Frito-Lay side and on the beverage side? And I understand on the beverage side, you're discontinuing some SKUs. So are you gaining shelf space where you want to? And then just a follow-up to an earlier question on Celsius, maybe if you could give us an idea of how your energy drink strategy overall is evolving and what's going on with Rockstar, Starbucks, Mountain Dew in terms of the overall energy drink strategy. Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Listen, I'll step back a little bit. I would say our customer negotiations have been good and completed all over the world, and especially Europe took a bit longer, but very positive impact to our overall, I would say, European business. Other parts of the world are less impacted by this type of negotiation. So we feel good, including the US. To your specific question on space gains, I think it's going to be a good reset time for us across snacks and beverages. It's not completed yet. It's in its way. Normally, I would say probably another six weeks or so. We're feeling good about where we've seen already resets, the performance improvement in the business. So that's good. Well done by the commercial teams.\nSo yeah, we feel good overall, and that's why we are reaffirming our guidance to grow at least over 4% in our net revenue for this year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nChris Carey\n\nEquity Analyst and Head of Consumer Staples Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, everyone. So one question on APAC division. Ramon, I think you were a bit more cautious or balanced on the Chinese consumer and yet double-digit growth in the quarter in China. I just wonder how APAC came in relative to your own expectations and whether there's any timing dynamic here or whether you see these results as perhaps a bit more durable going forward. And if I could just sneak in from the at-home versus away-from-home consumption globally, as you see some of the weaker trends from the lower-income consumer, are you seeing any acceleration in that shift, which might be helping your business on a global basis as well? Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nTwo things. Thanks. Good questions. I think the APAC performance is a little bit impacted by the timing of Chinese New Year. So there is a bit of benefit in our Q1 numbers versus Q2. It was a bit earlier this year. But the reality is that the APAC region is improving, I would say, outside of China. China is still, as I mentioned earlier, I think the consumer is cautious, and the consumer is saving a lot. And it might not impact so much the low-price, let's say, products as ours. It might probably impact some other categories a bit harder than ours. The truth is that in China, as I said earlier, our team is not only this year, but already consistently for the last four or five years been gaining share and creating a very capable and profitable business in China, we're very proud of.\nNow, to your other question on away from home, in-home, we're seeing mobility, obviously, going back to pre-pandemic times. I think we all forgot COVID anymore. We're seeing, obviously, that impact in the consumption of food between home and away from home, especially in the US, I would say, is probably the country that is having more impact. So yes, away from home is growing faster than in-home for us. We're pivoting resources to away from home, both in our food business and our beverage business. We're trying to capture as much as possible that consumption that is moving to away from home.\nInternationally as well, I would say that is a huge white space for growth for our business, both in trying to improve the availability of our current products and also creating new solutions that are more targeting meals and meal replacement as consumers buy more food away from home. I think our brands belong in some of those occasions. As I mentioned at CAGNY, we're building both innovation and business models that can help us capture this meal occasion away from home with some of our large brands like Lay's, Doritos, Tostitos, some of our well-known global brands.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, Ramon. Maybe it ties to the pressures you mentioned earlier on the lower-income consumers in the US or maybe even your comments just now on at-home versus away from home. If I think back over the last six-plus months, we've seen arguably unexpected slowing across many categories, but really in many immediate consumption categories where I think it was most unexpected across savory snacks, sweet snacks, and arguably a number of beverage categories as well. Do you agree with that kind of unexpected slowing comment? And if so, how do you see the drivers? How do you stack up the drivers? Where do you think we are in that cycle? And how does that factor into your expectations on momentum recovery across your North American beverages, sorry, North American businesses? I think the easing comps are obvious.\nI'm just curious about sort of your expectations on demand itself sequentially improving.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nThat's great. Now, this is a great question. I think we need to step back and look at the bigger numbers. Obviously, there was huge inflation in our categories driven by input inflation over the last couple of years and operating cost inflation. Now, what makes us feel optimistic is a couple of data. Number one, I think wages are growing above inflation. And we see that not only in the US, but across the world. And we see our consumer package food inflation below, I would say, total CPI. So those two numbers make us feel comfortable that consumers will start coming back to our categories at the frequency and with the same level of or higher frequency than in the past. So those are two big numbers.\nObviously, each one of us with our commercial programs, our innovation, our challenge strategies is trying to accelerate that pivot back. But we feel good about the price-volume mix that we see in our business. That's how we think that we will continue to sequentially improve over the balance of the year into further years. Our North Star remains the same is make sure that, as I said earlier, we have innovation, consumer progress, and channel programs that continue to drive savory snacks ahead of macro snacks, ahead of food. The same with LRB, ahead of overall liquid consumption and ahead of food and beverages. So that drives value for our business, and that drives value for our customers. That's how we think about driving the company long-term.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.\n\nBrett Cooper\n\nManaging Partner, Consumer Edge Research\n\nThank you. Good morning. Question on the international business. On these calls over the years, PepsiCo has spoken about managing international profit delivery to provide affordability to consumers and support recruitment. And if we look at margins in the international business versus pre-COVID levels, so can you help us understand beyond the headline financial results that we can see, I guess, evidence of what you look at to ensure you're providing proper levels of affordability for category development to support the very long term for that business? Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. We're always very conscious of the relative value of our products versus other potential substitute products in the categories that we participate. So if you think about snacks, the big opportunity is to transform unpackaged snacks into packaged snacks or other micro snacks into savory snacks. We always look at that value ratio in every market, in every geography for different types of consumers. Now, the same with beverages, right? Moving from non-commercial beverages to commercial beverages, that is always the opportunity for us as an industry. We look at that very carefully. Now, why are our margins expanding internationally? Because as we gain scale, and obviously, our fixed cost leverage is much better.\nAnd that's how we're getting to more profitable businesses in international markets, especially the large markets, as we keep affordability at the center of our strategy because that's long-term, including other things that we do, obviously, with availability and with innovation. We make our categories continue to grow at a very fast pace. But as you mentioned, affordability and relative value of our category is a key KPI that we measure all the time in every market because it's the key source of continuous growth for our categories.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.\n\nGerald Pascarelli\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Wedbush\n\nThat's great. Thanks very much. Question on Europe. Another really strong quarter here, like the seventh consecutive quarter at double-digit revenue growth. Looks like it accelerated on an underlying two-year basis. So maybe if you could provide some color on the driver markets, ones that maybe came in better than your expectations, and then how you would compare how developed markets in Europe are performing relative to what we're seeing in the US. Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Thank you. And good observation. I think our team in Europe is doing fantastic work. It started with strong productivity, simplifying the business and driving cost control, eliminating duplication, and then reinvesting that money back into our brands, becoming more competitive, and also driving our availability and driving our brand preference. And that is a flywheel that is working for us across both developing and developed markets in Europe. Obviously, developing markets a bit more. So if you think about kind of Eastern Europe markets are growing a little bit faster than Western Europe markets. Western Europe markets have been impacted a little bit in this Q1 by some of the negotiations. And that's not atypical in Europe. But I think we have a good flywheel in Europe.\nEurope will be expanding its portfolio along the lines of what the US has been doing, which will give us additional consumers and additional penetration in households across developed and developing markets. So we feel good about the flywheel in Europe. But at the center of that is a very strong productivity, cost discipline, and reinvestment strategy that is, in a way, what we're trying to do across the full company, elevating our productivity and driving their investments both into affordability, availability, and a better brand equity, and then reinvesting back into our future digitalization and sustainability at the center of that reinvestment. So it's a flywheel that we're trying to do for all the world. Clearly, Europe is doing a good job at implementing it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. So that's concluded the question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Ramon Laguarta for any closing remarks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning and for the confidence that you've placed in us and in our stock. We hope that you all stay healthy and safe. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, so that's concluded today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.\n\nRavi Pamnani\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, PepsiCo\n\nThank you, gentlemen. Appreciate your help.\n\nOperator\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nRavi Pamnani\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, PepsiCo\n\nThanks, Kevin. See you in the next one.",

Your lines have been placed on listen only until it's your turn to ask a question. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\n\nRavi Pamnani\n\nVP of Investor Relations, PepsiCo\n\nThank you. Operator, good morning everyone. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans, guidance, and outlook. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks, and uncertainties, and only reflect our view as of today, 9th February 2024, and we are under no obligation to update when discussing our results.\nWe refer to non-GAAP measures which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings release and 2023 Form 10-K, available on pepsico.com, for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements.\nAs a reminder, our reported fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 financial results included one extra reporting week for our North America businesses. Our reported fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 financial results in North America reflect the impacts associated with one less reporting week versus when compared to the prior year. Joining me today are PepsiCo's chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta, and PepsiCo's executive vice president and CFO Jamie Caulfield. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question with that operator. I'll turn it over for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. In order to ask a question or make a comment, please press star followed by one one on your touchtone phone. We'll pause for a moment while we compile our Q&A roster.\nOur first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning everybody. Jamie, I'm not sure who's more surprised we're seeing each other again, me or you. But welcome back.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nIt's great to talk to you again, Bryan.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nI have a question, I guess, just we've fielded a few questions today about the organic sales growth guidance for the year, and maybe if you can help dimensionalize.\nNot just the reduction, but how much is recall things that are external, how much are things that are under your control, and maybe you can think about.\nAs we think the balance of that. Just how much of improvement are you expecting? Maybe in North America versus International? Just trying to understand the moving parts of how we get to the organic sales guide for the year.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nGreat. Good morning, Bryan. This is Ramon. Let me step back for a minute and talk about the last few years and then how next year fits into that. So the last few years we've seen a double-digit growth top line in the business consistently. So I think it's an 11% CAGR and a 14%.\nOr double-digit EPS growth consistently as well. So three very good years. Now we see a normalization of the categories, a normalization of the cost, normalization of inflation in 2024. So we see everything trending back to our long-term algorithm. Now.\nWe guided to the upper end of both the top line and bottom line at the, you know, the previous earnings call. We maintain the top line at the upper end for the EPS and we move back to at least four for the top line. There's a few factors that you know, I think are material. One is the Quaker recall. We had a food safety incident in our Quaker supply chain in the US which has impacted us in November, December, and it will continue to impact us I think for at least the first half of the year until we recover our supply chain to normality.\nWe're also seeing some geopolitical events around the world that are impacting some of our markets which might potentially continue in the first half of next year.\nThe third element is we're seeing a bit of a slowdown in the US, both the food category and the beverage category in the Q4.\nPart of that is slowdown due to pricing and disposable income situation. Part of that is also pivoting between in-home consumption and away-from-home consumption that we're seeing in our business in the US. We think that that might continue in next year. So that's why we're lowering the, you know, our guidance. We feel good about the consumer in 2024 in the US. We feel good in the sense of very low unemployment. We feel good about the fact that we think wages will go higher than inflation next year, and we hope that by the summer interest rates will go down and that will create another source of oxygen for disposable income in households.\nSo we feel good about the consumer in the US, but if you think about those three elements, we decided to have at least four as the guidance for the top line.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning. Just kind of continuing on that thread, perhaps focusing more on Frito. So, retail channel data hasn't looked great. You know, the reported volume decline, you know, sort of bigger than what we've seen in some time for this business. But when I look on a multi-year stack, you know, things look kind of steadier sequentially when I look at the second half. So just curious how much of it maybe these near-term results on Frito and looking into the beginning of the year is more multi-year comps.\nIs it the consumer backdrop, the impact of pricing? But just thinking a little bit about your expectations for plans, I guess, for driving greater unit versus volume growth in 2024. What are you thinking about those two pieces?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nGreat, Lauren, I think it's a great question.\nJust to summarize, we're seeing the Frito business going back to profitable volume growth in 2024. So.\nThat's how we're thinking about the business. If you think about the slowdown in Q4 and you link it to the elements that I was referring to, there is a unit versus volume dynamic in the Frito business that is quite relevant. As you see consumption moving from in home to away from home.\nThe portion size is meaningfully different. So we're seeing growth in convenience stores. We're seeing growth in away from home, you know, like two to three times the retail growth. But obviously has an implication on volume. As we look at 2024, we have a very strong commercial plan for Frito. We have, you know, our core brands very well invested. You saw that in 2023. We increased our A&M meaningfully.\nWe're planning to do that as well in 2024. So Lay's has a big increase in A&M. Doritos has a big increase in A&M. All our permissible portfolio, which, if you think about a combination of SunChips, PopCorners, the whole Simply line, Smartfood, that part of the portfolio is growing almost three times the average of Frito.\nSo we're putting a lot of emphasis on that particular part of the portfolio. Make sure that it is well executed in the store. Now that supply chain is back to 100%, we're going to push that part of the portfolio even more aggressively. So we think that Frito.\nWill have a continuation of the share of market gains that it's been having for the last couple of years. We expect the category will rebound as well. Part of that, because of what we'll do with our brands, which obviously have a lot of weight in the overall category, but also the fact that we think consumers will continue to feel better throughout the year, and that will recover the Frito-Lay top line with a more balanced profitable volume growth and pricing versus what we've seen this year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.\nThe next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right. Thank you so much. I guess I had a question on PBNA profitability. I believe you still have a goal to reach the mid-teen operating margin levels, but so far we really haven't seen much progress. So, Ramon, I guess hoping you could touch on your plans to achieve this and then maybe whether you're considering making bigger structural changes to your business as possible refranchising of your bottling network.\nI know you've mentioned in the past that you do see some advantages with broadly owning your network, but just curious to hear if your thoughts on this have changed, and I guess if not, what other initiatives do you plan to implement to improve profitability at PBNA. Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, so yeah, listen, I would say.\nWe don't contemplate at this point any of the structural changes to our business. We continue to think that operating.\nThe business has advantages for us in terms of speed of execution and some other elements, that as we see where the business is growing in e-commerce, away from home, and some other channels of the future including direct to consumer, within that that's going to create an advantage for us. Now we've been making progress at a good pace in our margin improvement. If you think about the last three years, the net revenue for PBNA has grown over $5 billion, and the operating profit has grown $1 billion.\nCore operating margin has expanded more than 150 basis points. So we see the last few years a good improvement in the PBNA business. We think this will continue in the coming years, actually 2024, as a first step we are optimizing the portfolio. We're eliminating parts of the portfolio that were less profitable.\nWe've referred to bottled water, we've referred to some multi serve parts of the portfolio that were not that profitable. We continue to optimize our efficiency of our supply chain. We're digitalizing our supply chain. We continue to extract.\nEliminate waste from that. We continue to work on global business services that reduces the SG&A. We're also optimizing A&M, trying to get to higher ROI on A&M and our trade investment. So we continue to think that optimizing all those elements in the different parts of the P&L will continue to drive a sustainable margin improvement while we remain very competitive in the marketplace. And that's the balance that we're trying to strike with this business. So far we feel good. The business grew with the rest of the category. If you take everything that is in our system, it grew in line with the category, and we increased the operating margin.\nSo that's how we're thinking at this point about the PBNA business and with a long-term perspective obviously in how we will achieve those two elements of growing with the category and increasing the margins.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nKaumil Gajrawala\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey everybody. Good morning. Welcome back, Jamie. Well, I suppose you've gone nowhere but welcome back to dealing with us, I guess.\nCan you maybe talk a bit more about International, particularly, you know, margins are ticking up above the average now. It's scaling quite nicely. But also, if there's anything we need to be aware of as it relates to hyperinflation, Argentina, anything like that.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nNo, listen, I'll start and maybe Jamie can add to this.\nThe international opportunity continues to be probably the most.\nRemarkable and exciting opportunity that we have as a company. As you're saying, our international business is very scaled now. It's almost $40 billion between beverages and snacks. So that's. You compare it to some of the consumer goods companies. It's much bigger than many of the consumer goods companies globally. So clearly a big opportunity, and we have just scratched the surface when you think about the per capita consumption that we have in many markets and the opportunity we have ahead of us. So yes, your point is right.\nAs we scale it, some of those business are becoming more profitable, and obviously you start the virtuous circle of scale, reinvestment, margin expansion, and get into a much more profitable and advantaged businesses across many markets. So this year is not going to be a different one. So 2024.\nWe continue to think that international will grow faster than the US business. We're seeing good momentum as we start the year in many of our international businesses. Our position is of investment in those markets. So we're going aggressively with productivity and reinvestment for growth. Reinvestment in the brands, reinvestments in systems, in capabilities that continue to drive the per caps and our share of market position. So you should think about our international business as a big opportunity for PepsiCo. And with regards to the Argentina situation.\nWe've already taken that hyperinflation accounting and you shouldn't expect any material impact on organic sales growth.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, guys and Jamie. Great to hear your voice again.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nCFO and EVP, PepsiCo\n\nHey Darren.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nSo I wanted to drill down a bit more on Bonnie's question, but looking at PBNA top line more than profit, there's clearly been some market share struggles and pieces of the portfolio there: sports drinks, CSDs, etc. I guess, can you just talk a little bit more about strategy changes from a top line standpoint, how you sort of manage the business by product category, and your thoughts around share trends as we look going forward. Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nHi there. Good listen, we feel good about the overall portfolio of PBNA. You know we manage the business as a full LRB business, not as a CSD or any particular subcategory. We're looking at the full portfolio and how.\nIt's always everywhere for consumers from the morning to the night in all the multiple locations. We continue to believe that we have an advantaged portfolio. If you think about our positions in sports and hydration, our positions in coffee, tea. Now the portfolio we have in energy and our CSD position as well. So we continue to manage as a full LRB. Now.\nIf you think about our priorities for the year.\nRelaunch of Pepsi brand with a new image with focus on Zero. Zero has been growing very fast and continues to be a value proposition for us.\nWe're putting a lot of additional investment in Mountain Dew and we're launching Baja Blast as a permanent SKU. Baja Blast has been a success as an LTO, a limited time offer, for many years. Now we're launching it. We're using the Super Bowl as a platform this weekend to launch Baja Blast. We continue to build a position in lemon-lime with Starry. Starry. It's been a good, good first year. I think. We're over indexing with Gen Z. We see the brand getting some good repeat. You will see also an investment around Super Bowl and continue during the year. So that's our CSD portfolio. We feel very good about Gatorade. Gatorade is. We're moving from historically.\nA liquid for high performing.\nAthletes to an ecosystem of solutions in hydration and fuel for every type of active person, and we're seeing a lot of traction. It's not only Gatorade per se, but it's Gatorlyte, is G Fit, it's Propel, it's Muscle Milk all under one umbrella, and it's not only liquid solutions, these powders, these tablets, these equipment, personalized equipment, bottles, and others. Now we're launching around the Super Bowl Gatorade iD, which is also an ecosystem of loyalty, and I would say personalization for our consumers that will bring even more attention to the brand and more loyalty with younger consumers. On energy, we're very happy with our portfolio.\nObviously the Starbucks coffee energy on one side, Rockstar and obviously our collaboration with Celsius, which has been a great success and it provides scale to our go to market and kind of a point of entry as well with some of our customers. And then our tea business continues to do very well with Pure Leaf and our Starbucks collaboration now moving more into.\nBeyond coffee, I would say more refreshers and some other innovation that Starbucks is developing for their cafes. We bring it to ready to drink. I think we have a beautiful portfolio. We continue to grow in retail and we're putting a lot of focus in away from home as we're seeing that the away from home channel is getting much more traffic as people go back to normal mobility. That will be a focus for us going forward this year. We think we'll continue to grow above the market and continue to gain share in what is a very profitable and high growth channel.\nThis is how we're thinking about the business there. Hopefully it gives you a good sense of the intentionality, how we're thinking about the broad portfolio and our willingness to compete with innovation, with brand investment, and with great execution.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. Ramon, I just wanted to ask a follow up based on your response to both Bryan and Lauren's question on the organic growth. I may have misheard or could be misinterpreting this, but you touched on some of the things that you are doing internally that will drive the improved performance. I think you also mentioned some sort of assumption around maybe the US consumer would feel better. I mean, if that doesn't happen, would that put the organic revenue guidance at risk, or would it improve backdrop be more of a source of upside versus the greater than 4%? Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nThe current assumption is what I said. We think that the consumer will continue to improve in its confidence and its disposable income throughout the year. And that's the ongoing assumption. We have a very strong productivity program in the company which gives us the fuel for reinvestment and gives us also a lot of flexibility to manage a potential, different consumer reality. But at this point we think this is the ongoing assumptions. We will invest in our brands, we will invest in our innovation. And now that supply chain is in a very good place compared to what it was a couple of years ago, even last year.\nWe can rely on the tools that we're very good at, which is brand building, innovation, execution, distribution increases, strong commercial programs with our partners. And that's where we think will drive the growth of our top line too.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nI'd add, just to remind you, 40% of our business is now international. So you know, US is significant, but we've got a big business outside the US.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush. Your line is open.\n\nGerald Pascarelli\n\nAnalyst, Wedbush\n\nGreat, thanks very much, Ramon. I have a question on energy drinks. Can you just speak about your plans to maybe drive performance in Rockstar this year? It's kind of been a relative underperformer in energy drinks for some time, and now Bang coming back into the market which could potentially result in some incremental disruption. So maybe just some color on how you're thinking about driving an improvement in Rockstar, and then maybe broader thoughts on the competitive dynamics within energy drinks this year. Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, I mean it's a great question. The energy category continues to grow as you see above the LRB category. It continues to expand into new consumers and new consumer locations.\nWhich obviously creates growth for everyone that participates in the category. So we participate, as always said, with multiple vectors. We're proud of our Starbucks partnership and some of the products we offer, double shots, triple shots. We're proud of the Rockstar brand. Rockstar has been growing with the category more or less. There are some parts of the country where it's well distributed and well preferred. Other parts of the country where we're trying to get consumer penetration and consumer adoption.\nThe areas where we've been successful with Rockstar, which will double down, are the Zero and the Recover parts of the portfolio. Both of them, if you think, is energy with functionality and where we think our R and D can create advantage. So we're pushing those two platforms, Rockstar Zero and Rockstar Recover, and that will continue to be the focus of the brand.\nWe've also been focusing on Hispanic consumer, and that also we've seen an increase in the penetration of the brand with Hispanic population. With Hispanic consumers will continue to drive.\nThat commercial activity. But we see this as a portfolio of solutions, including Celsius and how the combined portfolio creates a very good point of execution for us multi brand. It gives us an entry into convenience stores and some other points of sale away from home. We'll continue to drive the portfolio as the unit of execution.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nMaybe I can say the other thing we're doing with Rockstar, which we don't talk a lot about, but it's an important part of our growth, is we're launching Rockstar internationally in many markets around the world, from Asia to Europe to parts of Latin America. We're having good success again as a portfolio of solutions that complements our Sting brand that we have in Asia or some other brands that we have in Europe as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Thank you for the question. In your prepared remarks, you said that you expect less commodity inflation, but some agricultural inputs might be higher. Can you be more specific? And I was hoping you could focus a little on Frito because you know, there's a very big potato crop this past year. Vegetable oil costs are coming down. Do you see any relief on the horizon for Frito in that regard?\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nCFO and EVP, PepsiCo\n\nHey, Rob, it's Jamie. Yeah. As a practice, we comment on the basket of inputs. We don't comment on specific commodity movement. But you're absolutely correct that we do expect commodity inflation to moderate from what we had in 2023.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning to you all, and great having you back. Jamie, on the investor-safety mode. I have one question, and then a clarification first for Ramon. I was hoping to see if you can elaborate a little bit more on how you're going to be lapping and if you have a read on the lap, the mix drags, and the shift from away-from-home to at-home.\nWhere your market share is not probably as strong in snacks as you have in at-home channels. Given your strong gross margin delivery, in your experience in negotiating with large box retailers, especially in Europe, are retailers asking you to invest back in promo rollbacks given your gross margin delivery and productivity gains, in particular, in North America and Europe? My clarification for Jamie is, in terms of like your organic sales growth and EPS cadence for the year, anything we should be considering on your guide as far as cadence? Thank you.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. So on the Organic Sales Growth, first of all, Andrea, it's great to hear your voice again and look forward to.\nInteracting as we go forward.\nOrganic sales growth cadence, I'd say back half stronger than the first half. As we talked about before, we've got the impact of the Quaker recall is going to be front half loaded. The latter get easier as we get into the back half of the year. And then some of these consumer pressures that have existed with.\nElimination of stimulus benefits, resumption of student loan payments. We'll lap those as we get into the year.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, listen, with regards to the customer.\nI think we're all trying to build win-win plans in the sense that we grow the business and we create profit growth for both our customers and ourselves. We normally have always the consumer at the center. So it will be a combination of how we generate growth through, as I said, innovation, and we have a few big innovations and brand relaunches. This year we'll put a lot of investment there together with our customers.\nWe'll continue to try to expand our SKUs with the customers, and there will be investments there, and there will be some investments in trying to give more value to consumers in a very holistic way right through price, through promotions, through consumer events that eventually will drive preference for our brands. But that's the way we're thinking about creating this joint business planning with our large customers that create growth for the category, growth for our customers, and growth for us.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nWith regards to away from home. Sorry, I forgot Andrea. The away from home, we see it as an and not as an or, so we see as an opportunity for us to continue to be in consumers' lives always everywhere. And as consumers pivot away from home, we'll try to be there for them. It's been an area of investment for us both in distribution and specific solutions for away from home for quite some time. And we're seeing our businesses in the large markets growing above the market in away from home. So clearly this will be an opportunity for us for many years to come.\nAnd I think we're getting better at mixology, we're getting better at more food experiences, Walking Tacos, Doritos Loaded. We're testing food trucks, we're testing many things that will make our brands available to consumers.\nBeyond what is a packaged bag or a can or a bottle. Now I think consumers are expecting from us away from home a much more holistic experience. And that's what we're working on.\nAnd I think we're making good progress.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Ottenstein\n\nSenior Managing Director and Partner, Evercore\n\nGreat, thank you very much. A little bit more of a detailed question on PBNA, and just want to talk about Gatorade and Celsius. So in terms of Gatorade, could you just remind us in terms of the timing of the move to DSD and how that impacted your income statement? And then in terms of Celsius.\nObviously the brand has done phenomenally well. It's getting pretty big now. Can you talk about how Celsius impacts the income statement in the US and then how your relationship with the company has evolved? You talked about taking Rockstar internationally. Celsius is doing some, you know, going international now. Are you part of that plan as well? Thank you.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nCFO and EVP, PepsiCo\n\nYes. So on Gatorade, we're 90% through on the transition. Obviously, that move is positive to the financial results overall.\nThat's what we did, is to enhance.\nPerformance and we're happy with the margins we have on that business. On Celsius, the way that works is we're sharing the system revenue with Celsius.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, listen, we're happy with the collaboration with Celsius and that continues to be a part of our growth strategy.\nYou know, there is an opportunity for us to collaborate in the international expansion as well.\nAt this point, it's not, I would say, a scaled opportunity. It's a market-by-market opportunity and very particular market. So, yeah, we're contemplating that as an option. And we're in conversations with Celsius how we can leverage the Pepsi ecosystem for a bigger expansion.\nNothing short term, I would say, at this point.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nChris Carey\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning, everyone. I just wanted to ask about SG&A over the past four years. We've talked about this before in this forum, but with the annual disclosures now out, I thought it would be a good time to revisit the topic.\nSpecifically, Ramon, can you help contextualize the increase that we've seen in SG&A over the past four years, specifically in distribution cost? I'm really curious about maybe how much of this is underlying inflation as opposed to discretionary investments that PepsiCo is making and not really looking for a specific number per se. I realize that's probably difficult, but distribution's up 40% over the past four years and I'm just wondering.\nHow much of this is within your control? Maybe some of the capabilities that you've been able to build over this timeframe and maybe get a sense of.\nHow this line item should be trending going forward. So, thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. So as you point out, selling distribution is the biggest part of that. The A part is less so. And it's going to be a reflection. What you see is one, you've got market mix or sector mix components in there. We've driven a lot of productivity in our OpEx, but at the same time we're investing in OpEx to drive distribution and growth in the business.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nOne other thing, Chris, that you should be mindful of is, you know, we do have a big direct store delivery business. So we've had inflation in various things like labor and so forth, and that's what's gone up. A&M has gone up as well, which is also kind of all part of that SG&A bucket. We've made numerous capability investments in there as well. So it's all of the above. I wouldn't hone in just on the distribution costs, which I know you focus on from the 10-K. There's a lot of buckets that go in that are far deeper that we can't get into for competitive reasons.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nHey, good morning everyone. So Ramon and Jamie, you both mentioned the organic sales growth guidance is going to be more second half, and I know you don't provide breakdown and guidance on volumes, but given the importance of volume trends, can you give us a sense of how you see volumes evolving? Is there a possibility in your guidance where you see positive volumes in the second half of the year, and then on the pricing front, maybe you can give us a sense of what are you assuming in terms of pricing? I assume in the US or developed markets it's limited, and there's more pricing in emerging market, but any color on pricing will be also helpful. Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, I think you should be thinking about.\nWe want to grow units next year. We will see profitable volume growth next year, and you'll see a more balanced.\nBetween pricing and volume that you have seen in the previous year where obviously we had to, you know, we had to cover a huge commodity increase and OpEx increase. As commodities kind of normalize and OpEx inflation normalizes, that lever will be less necessary outside of what has been a normal pricing levels of our category in the 2% to 3%. So you should be thinking about profitable volume growth and more of a normalized pricing compared to what it was in the 18-19 timeframes.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.\nOur next question comes from Callum Elliott with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi, good morning. I wanted to build upon Chris's question, please, and ask you about the A&M buckets and the spending behind your brands. I think that the case shows advertising up around 10% year on year, and that's around a 20 basis points increase as a percentage of sales. We're still quite a long way below pre-pandemic levels as a percentage of sales, and comfortably below the average of the last several years. I guess the question is, are your brands getting enough support, and do we need to see upwards pressure on advertising spend as a percentage of sales over the coming years? Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nThat's great.\nGood point.\nObviously, in absolute terms, we have much more A&M. I think we have increased. Last year was $500 million, and if you think about a longer time frame, meaningful, over a billion dollars increase in absolute A&M. That's absolute dollars that go against our business.\nWe're thinking about continuing that trend, continuing to support both our large brands across multiple markets, and then smaller brands where we take the portfolio into the future. That should be a composition of A&M. When you look at the last few years, you should bear in mind we stopped advertising in Russia, which was a meaningful market for us. That is reflected in our, you know, absolute numbers or relative numbers, so you should contemplate that.\nIf you think about where and how we're going to create demand in the future, you should be thinking about A&M continuing to increase. Obviously, we'll look at ways to optimize A&M, and we have very strong measures on ROI and best ways to invest in our brands.\nYou should be thinking about as a company that continues to build brands, continues to innovate, continue to create value through.\nInvestment in consumer. Obviously, we also create a lot of demand through our push model. To some of the questions that was asked before, we should be thinking about our selling and distribution cost not only as a cost, but also as a way for us to execute very granularly across millions and millions of point-of-sale around the world, where we reach the final point-of-sale and we create.\nI would say visibility for our brands, and impulse for our brands, which are relevant if you think about the categories where we compete.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur last question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOh great. Good morning, and thanks everybody. Jamie, add me to the list of people excited to work with you again.\nHey, actually this question may be for you. It probably is for you on these calls. For the last several years we've been talking about on and off, just sort of the cash flow profile of the business and the capital investments that have been made in the business, and the path eventually back towards a higher level of free cash flow conversion. I guess acknowledging that you've been there in the room the whole time, I guess. Now, as you assume the role of CFO, do you see any opportunities to speed that process of cash flow generation and a return to higher levels of free cash flow conversion?\nFrom where we've been trending, or is it more steady state? If you could just give us a little perspective on how you're seeing those, that cash flow profile of the business evolving from here, that'd be great. Thank you.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nCFO and EVP, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, clearly cash flow continues to be a priority. I'd focus on CapEx and, you know, we've been very intentional about the levels of capital we've invested in the business. Part of that was to catch up on capacity. We're currently in the midst of big investments in IT and digitalization.\nOver time, I think you'll see the level of CapEx as a percent of sales begin to trend down, and that'll help with the cash flow conversion.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nThank you everybody. I'm glad everybody's happy that Jamie's back, and I see a lot of bonding. Great. Obviously, thank you for the confidence that you've placed in our investment. We look forward to seeing many of you at CAGNY in a couple of weeks and having a longer conversation there. Thank you very much,\n\nOperator\n\nladies and gentlemen.\nThat concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful, wonderful day.\n\nJamie Caulfield\n\nEVP and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nThank you, gentlemen. Appreciate your help.\n\nOperator\n\nYou're welcome.\nSa.\nSam sa.\nSa.\nSa.\nSa.\nSa.\nSa.\nSam.\nSa.",

Your lines have been placed on listen only until it's your turn to ask a question. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\n\nRavi Pamnani\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, PepsiCo\n\nThank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans, guidance, and outlook. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, 10 October 2023, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to our Q3 2023 earnings release and Q3 2023 form 10-Q available on PepsiCo.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements.\nJoining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta, and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question, and with that, I will turn it over to the Operator for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Once again, in order to ask a question or make a comment, please press star followed by 11 on your touch-tone phone. We'll pause for a moment while we compile our Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone (crosstalks).\nSo my question is just around volume. There's been a lot of focus on that topic, not just for Pepsi, but just, I think, more broadly. So I know in the prepared remarks, there's a little bit of, there's some commentary about a shift to small packs. But maybe, Ramon, if you could touch on what was happening specifically volumetrically for PBNA in the quarter, and then kind of relative to what your outlook was for volumes coming out of Q2, just how that might have evolved as the quarter progressed.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, good morning, Bryan. Let me step back beyond PBNA to the broader company. We're seeing sequential volume improvement if you take the last few quarters. So globally, we're improving our volume. But more philosophically, how we're thinking about how we're managing the company, there's two big variables that we're trying to optimize. One is consumer interaction with our brands, and the proxy we're using for that is units or specific purchasing acts. And then the other one is obviously margin for the overall business. And those are the two variables that we're maximizing. In both cases, units are growing much faster than volume, And we're seeing, we're seeing that, you mentioned consumers moving to smaller packs. We're also, in a way, facilitating that through our pricing and mix strategy.\nAnd then we're obviously optimizing margins. That, as you saw, it was a good improvement in our margin across the company and the particular businesses that you referred to. So that's how we're thinking about volume and margin. When it comes to PBNA, we've been a bit more aggressive than in the other businesses with regards to volume optimization, and we've made some decisions, especially around take-home water, that we were able to prune some promotions that were not profitable for the business, and that has almost two and a half points of volume impact. So that's how we're managing volume. It's clearly an important variable for us, but for efficiency in the plants and some others, but unit transaction and consumer interaction with the brands are the metric that we're trying to maximize as we're making these trade-offs between volume, net revenue, and margin expansion.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. Carrying on Bryan's question, but taking it a little bit further out into 2024, and it was great to get kind of some preliminary perspective on next year so early. But I was also curious how you're thinking about that balance between volume and price mix as we go into next year because price mix has continued to outperform. And so just kind of thinking about that more forward look as well. Thanks.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, Lauren, we'll give you more details, obviously, in February when it comes to the actual composition of some of our key metrics that, what I would, I would tell you at this point, as we've obviously seen all the commercial plans from the different markets and our innovation plans, our productivity plans, and our cost trends, that there will be still a higher inflation in, you know, in our business, and therefore, there will be higher price mix versus not the last couple of years, but if you think about the historical price mix that we had in the past, I think 2024 will have a bit more elevated price mix in the equation than in the previous years.\nYeah. So right. To add a finer point to Ramon's comments, Lauren, if you think of pre-pandemic inflation being kind of in that 2% to 3% range, inflation's going to be a little elevated relative to that, and our pricing will be roughly in line with inflation. So that should at least give you a rough sense as to how things might shake out.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Reearch Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Good morning. So going back to your comments about volumes in PBNA, was that specific to the quarter, or should we still see about this 2.5% headwind to volumes included and potentially into the first half of 2024? And if you can also comment on the volumes in Latin America, how should, we should be thinking towards the end of the year and potentially into 2024? Thank you.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, Andrea. So with regards to PBNA, we continue to optimize the portfolio. So we should be probably thinking about a couple more quarters where we will continue to see volume decisions that, again, we're trying to maximize units and transactions, and we're trying to continue to optimize the margin of the business. And you saw that this quarter and the balance of the year, we feel very good about the margin expansion in PBNA. Now, when it comes to LATAM, it's mostly our snack business, what you see there in our numbers. And we've been making, again, decisions around affordability, making sure that our brands continue to be within affordable price points to consumers that we know that their disposable income is limited, and they make decisions a lot based on price points. So we've been reducing size, portion size of our products, making sure that we're still very affordable.\nThat has an impact on the actual volume. But again, the transactions are much healthier, and that's a metric that we use to assess the health of the business with regards to consumer along with brand equity, and some other metrics that we use, obviously, to understand full consumer picture. So, we'll continue to make optimizations, Andrea, as we, as we need to absorb inflation and make sure that our brands remain a choice for consumers that are clearly more limited in their disposable income.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Could you just discuss the motivation behind the decision to provide guidance for 2024 a bit earlier than is typical? What do you think your level of visibility is at this point versus a typical year? And as you look out, maybe what are some of the areas that give you confidence, and what might be some of the areas where there's more uncertainty, particularly given the volatile consumer environment here? Thanks.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Hi, Dara. I can answer that one. I think, in general, as we build the plans, we're focused on a couple of things. Number one is, obviously, the level of commodity inflation, and we buy forward about nine months. So that's roughly in line with the past. Number two is the balance of the PepsiCo cost structure. And as we've talked about the last couple of quarters, we've put even higher focus than we've had in the past on driving productivity and driving out unnecessary costs using the tools that we've discussed: the investments in digitalization, the investments in global business services, the investments in driving out overlaps within the organization. Because that work has been going on for a longer period of time, I think that gave us earlier line of sight into what we would expect our cost outcome to be for next year.\nAnd then number three, we're in a good spot in many of the developed markets in terms of our commercial plans. We do joint business planning with our customers, and we're probably in line to maybe even a little ahead of where we've been historically with all of that. So given the information was available to us a little bit earlier, and given there were undoubtedly questions in the investment community on what 2024 looked like, given the evolving pricing and inflationary environment, we thought it was prudent to at least give some indication of what guidance would look like in 2024. So that's what drove the decision.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nExecuive Director, UBS\n\nThanks, Operator, and good morning, everyone. So I actually wanted to follow up on Dara's question there, but just more in the context of your actual performance versus your initial expectations historically, because it's really been a while since organic revenue growth has actually fallen short of your initial outlook. So can you maybe just characterize your confidence in the 2024 outlook at this stage and really whether or not you've embedded enough conservatism, just given what remains a pretty choppy backdrop for the consumer? Thanks.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nSure. Happy to address that. We obviously have a long history here of meeting or exceeding expectations, both our internal expectations as well as the guidance, including this quarter, where we beat revenue and we beat EPS. In fact, we've now met or beat consensus for 55 straight quarters. So we tend to be, I think, appropriately conservative in the way that we communicate to you all. So from that perspective, I think you can go into 2024 with a similar expectation that we should at least achieve the numbers that we've laid out for you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nNik Modi\n\nEquity Ressearch Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Hugh, I was hoping maybe you can just provide some of the macro underpinnings that kind of go into your 2024 viewpoints at this point. Just would love to kind of get your state of the union on the consumer, the economy, and kind of how you guys are thinking that'll shape up as you go through 2024. Thanks.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nSure. Why don't I start? And then, Ramon, obviously, you're super deep on the consumer as well, but I'm happy to start on this one. Number one, I do think that we see the consumer right now being more selective, and you see it in a variety of ways. You see some trade down in terms of channels of trade that they're purchasing products in. You see some orientation toward value. At the same time, the things that I usually look at with the consumer to detect whether there's high stress, we see good results in there. Number one is the convenience store channel. Typically, when gas prices are up and consumer incomes are stressed, you see revenue in those channels under stress as well. For Q3, we saw revenue up 5% in beverages, and 8% in foods in the convenience channel. Number two is food service.\nThat's also typically a leading indicator. That's still growing double digits. So I think we've gone into the year with an approach that says, given all that I laid out during Dara's question, we expect the consumer to continue to be cautious. And to the degree that they are worse than that, we've got cost plans in place that we would use to mitigate whatever challenges we face. But we think our revenue outlook accommodates an increasingly cautious consumer next year. Yeah. And the other thing I would say is all the long-term or structural tailwinds of our categories will continue. If you think about urbanization, demographic shifts, lifestyles, etc., that have been driving our snacking categories or beverage category, the move from unpackaged to packaged, all those things will continue, and they drive a lot of our confidence in our categories.\nObviously, we have almost completed by now our innovation plans, our commercial plans. I think we got better at affordability and premiumization of our portfolios. We think our share of market will be good next year as well. So that's what's driving our kind of confidence for next year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Again, Bonnie Herzog, your line is open. If you have a question, go ahead and ask it. It looks like they didn't have a question. Do you want me to go and move on to the next person?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYes, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. Sure thing. One moment. Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nChris Carey\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nHi, Chris.\n\nChris Carey\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThe inflation got a bit worse quarter over quarter in the PBNA segment specifically, whereas in the rest of the segments, the trend is for continued easing. Can you just comment on some of the puts and takes that you're seeing from a commodity inflation standpoint in this segment, particularly, and how the beverage side is driving the inflation expectations going into next year relative to food? I'm really speaking to Hugh's comments on above-average inflation next year. Just given what we see from commodities in general, I'm trying to parse out where exactly that outlook is coming from. Thanks so much.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Good morning, Chris. Chris, we don't get into by commodity levels of dissecting the numbers and guidance. That's something that historically we haven't done. As you know, the beverage segment is a little more packaging exposed than foods is just by virtue of the nature of the products. But I'd rather not go any further than that to get into the specifics of individual commodities for competitive reasons.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Ottenstein\n\nSenior Managing Director and Head of Global Beverages and Houehold Product Team, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. I just want to shift a little bit more kind of to the long term. I was just wondering if you can kind of give us a sense of your vision for the business, the beverage business, and the food business in the US in light of your large investment in Instacart, what you're trying to accomplish there, and other kind of strategic moves you're doing on the digital side, and all the underlying work that you're doing in terms of automation and productivity. Just kind of what do you see the business looking like in the future, and how does Instacart play into it? Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Good question. Obviously, as Hugh was saying, we continue to drive the transformation of the business with automation at the center of it and digitalization as well. With digitalization, we're trying to obviously give much more precision to our decision-making across everything we do, from how we talk to consumers, how we invest in our pricing with our customers, and how we run our end-to-end operations from agro to the consumers, how we run our routing and everything, all these activities that we do to generate value for our consumers. That is an investment we've been making over time, and that still is the priority of the company to make the company more precise and intelligent and empower our front line to make better decisions all the time with the best information possible, real-time and ideally forward information. So that is a continuous investment.\nNow, when it comes to Instacart, there is a commercial relationship trying to enhance the capabilities of our DSD system with the shoppers that they have in store. That is a continuous focus. I think DSD continues to be a competitive advantage, and I think we can enhance that capability with supporting activities from the Instacart shoppers. That commercial relation led to a very minor investment in Instacart. Just to reinforce the commitment to the commercial relationship, there's nothing more than that in terms of a strategic long-term intentionality with that investment.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nStephen Powers\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, thanks. Two questions, if I could. One, just following up on the 2024 outlook, given the visibility you have on costs and the commercial planning at this point, should we be expecting a relatively even performance and cadence of growth, both top and bottom line throughout the year, or is there a reason to see that growth weighted firt half 2024 versus second half 2024? And then I did want to ask on Gatorade because the improvement we saw this quarter sequentially volumetrically did occur. It just didn't occur at quite the level of improvement that we were expecting from a shipment perspective. I think we went from down high single digits in Q2 to down mid in Q3. So I just would love some perspective on how you view that business performing. Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nGood. Listen, we will not go into more details on 2024. We'll cover that in February in due time. When it comes to Gatorade, we're very pleased with the G2 DSD or the movement of Gatorade to the DSD platform over the summer. We're seeing sequential improvement in the performance of the brand, better performance in August than we saw early in the summer, etc., inventory on display and number of secondary locations, etc. So that move is working. On the velocity of the brand, we also saw that the brand is improving its velocity. It is true that the emergence of Prime in the category took some share from Gatorade, less than other brands in the category, or less proportionally to the size of the brand. But I would say Prime impacted Gatorade in a way, some transactions during the peak of the season.\nWe're seeing that, you know, the size of Prime in the category getting smaller as we go into the fall, which gives us very good optimism that with the new infrastructure we have with our DSD business, some of the innovation with G Fit, Gatorlyte, G Zero, our powders and tablets that are being very well received by consumers, that we're going to have a very good 2024 for Gatorade. So we have a stronger foundation to go into next year with potentially weaker competition, but obviously, I don't know what their plans are.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. So clearly, there's been a lot of concern in the market around the adoption of GLP-1 drugs in the US and the potential impact on your business. So maybe can you comment a bit on what you've seen so far based on your consumer studies, both on the beverage and food side, and how you're thinking that can evolve over the next couple of years, changing consumer behaviors? And then from a Pepsi-specific standpoint, what changes can you make to adapt your portfolio to these new consumer preferences that could emerge if the adoption is greater than? Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nThank you, Filippo. Good question. Listen, obviously, we're looking at this along with many other positive and negative potential risks for our business and our category. So far, the impact is negligible in our business. Overall, if you take global consumption, there's obviously a lot of question marks with regards to these obesity drugs when it comes to medical testing or scalability of the usage of this or what is the impact really on consumer choices. So a lot of question marks. We continue to believe that all the structural positive trends that we had to our categories remain. And I mentioned I referred to that earlier in the conversation. So we're seeing urbanization as a big driver of adoption of our categories. We're seeing middle-class development. We're seeing lifestyle and people snacking to eat.\nSo, meals becoming more mini meals and much more unstructured during the day being a big driver of our categories, both beverages and snacks. So we're seeing a lot of tailwinds that will continue to drive our categories. Of course, we're observing the growth of these new drugs and its potential impact. The other thing we're looking at is our strategy sound when it comes to portfolio transformation. And everything we've been doing for the last five, six years when it comes to reducing sodium, reducing fat, reducing sugar, reducing the portions of our products, adding some new cooking methods to our snacks, those are all very positive trends that will help us pivot the portfolio if needed in the future. We'll continue to do it, obviously. It's one of our key strategic pillars. So again, negligible impact today.\nA lot of these structural trends that are in our category, I think, remain very solid, and even we see them accelerating. Our portfolio strategy, we think, is very solid when it comes to potential protection against some of these future developments five, 10 years from now.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge. One moment.\n\nBrett Cooper\n\nVice President of Financial Planning, Analysis and Insights, Consumer Edge\n\nGood morning. Question for you on the North American beverage business. You've said in the past your goal is to hold share in that business. When you begin to add things like Celsius as an organic business, I'd love to hear how you assess the beverage performance. Are you still looking to hold share with the own portfolio or do distributed brands have a component to hold share? Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Sorry, we missed a little bit of the question, but hopefully, we got what you're trying to ask. Celsius, obviously, is part of our energy drink strategy. We said we had multiple pillars, and our ability to distribute in our system some third-party brands is part of that strategy. Obviously, Celsius continues to grow. We've doubled the distribution and the presence in store of the brand in the last year or so, especially in the convenience channel, which is a key channel for energy consumption. That participation of Celsius in our truck makes our full system more efficient. It makes our salesmen more relevant in the store. It makes our cooler more a go-to cooler in the store. And those are all positives that eventually have a halo effect as well in the rest of our portfolio.\nI don't know if I'm answering the question because really, we couldn't hear it very well. I guess you get a sense of the importance of Celsius in our energy strategy and the value we get from both the actual monetization of that distribution, but also the halo it has in the rest of the portfolio. Okay. Thank you very much for your questions and for joining us today. Especially, thank you for the confidence that you've placed in us with your investment. We hope you all stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.\nGood morning and welcome to PepsiCo's 2023 Q3 earnings question and answer session. Your lines have been placed on listen only until it's your turn to ask a question. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\n\nRavi Pamnani\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, PepsiCo\n\nThank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our business plans, guidance, and outlook. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, 10 October, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to Non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to our Q3 2023 earnings release and Q3 2023 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of Non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements.\nJoining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta, and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. With that, I will turn it over to the Operator for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Once again, in order to ask a question or to make a comment, please press star followed by 11 on your touch-tone phone. We'll pause for a moment while we compile our Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nMorning, Bryan.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nSo my question is just around volume. There's been a lot of focus on that topic, not just for Pepsi, but just, I think, more broadly. So I know in the prepared remarks, there's a little bit of some commentary about a shift to small packs. But maybe, Ramon, if you could touch on what was happening specifically volumetrically for PBNA in the quarter, and then kind of relative to what your outlook was for volumes coming out of Q2, just how that might have evolved as the quarter progressed.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Good morning, Bryan. Let me step back beyond PBNA to the broader company. We're seeing sequential volume improvement if you take the last few quarters. So globally, we're improving our volume. But more philosophically, how we're thinking about how we're managing the company, there are two big variables that we're trying to optimize. One is consumer interaction with our brands. And the proxy we're using for that is units or specific purchasing acts. And then the other one is obviously margin for the overall business. And those are the two variables that we're maximizing. In both cases, units are growing much faster than volume. And we're seeing, we're seeing that, you mentioned consumers moving to smaller packs. We're also, in a way, facilitating that through our pricing and mixed strategy.\nAnd then we're obviously optimizing margin. That, as you saw, it was a good improvement in our margin across the company and the particular businesses that you referred to. So that's how we're thinking about volume and margin. When it comes to PBNA, we've been a bit more aggressive than in the other businesses with regards to volume optimization. And we've made some decisions, especially around take-home water, that we were able to prune some promotions that were not profitable for the business. And that has almost two and a half points of volume impact. So that's how we're managing volume. It's clearly an important variable for us, but for efficiency in the plant and some others. But unit transaction and consumer interaction with the brands are the metric that we're trying to maximize as we're making these trade-offs between volume, net revenue, and margin expansion.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. Carrying on Bryan's question, but taking it a little bit further out into 2024. It was great to get kind of some preliminary perspective on next year so early. I was also curious how you're thinking about that balancing volume and price mix as we go into next year because price mix has continued to outperform. So just kind of thinking about that more forward look as well. Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, Lauren, we'll give you more details, obviously, in February when it comes to the actual composition of some of our key metrics. But what I would tell you at this point, as we've obviously seen all the commercial plans from the different markets and our innovation plans, and our productivity plans, and our cost trends, that there will be still a higher inflation in our businesses. And therefore, there will be higher price mix versus not the last couple of years, but if you think about the historical price mix that we had in the past, I think 2024 will have a bit more elevated price mix in the equation than in the previous years.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. So right to add a finer point to Ramon's comments, Lauren, if you think of pre-pandemic inflation being kind of in that two to three percent range, inflation's going to be a little elevated relative to that. And our pricing will be roughly in line with inflation. So that should at least give you a rough sense as to how things might check out.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Reearch Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Good morning. So going back to your comments about volumes in PBNA, was that specific to the quarter, or should we still see about this 2.5% headwind to volumes included and potentially into the first half of 2024? And if you can also comment on the volumes in Latin America, how should, we should be thinking towards the end of the year and potentially into 2024. Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, Andrea. So with regards to PBNA, we continue to optimize the portfolio. So we should be probably thinking about a couple more quarters where we will continue to see volume decisions that, again, we're trying to maximize units and transactions, and we're trying to continue to optimize the margin of the business. And you saw that this quarter and balance of the year, we feel very good about the margin expansion in PBNA. Now, when it comes to LATAM, it's mostly our snack business, what you see there in our numbers. And we've been making, again, decisions around affordability, making sure that our brands continue to be within affordable price points to consumers that we know that their disposable income is limited, and they make decisions a lot based on price points. So we've been reducing size, portion size of our products, making sure that we're still very affordable.\nThat has an impact on the actual volume. But again, the transactions are much healthier. And that's a metric that we use to assess the health of the business with regards to consumer, along with brand equity and some other metrics that we use, obviously, to understand full consumer picture. So we'll continue to make optimizations, Andrea, as we need to absorb inflation and make sure that our brands remain a choice for consumers that are clearly more limited in their disposable income.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Could you just discuss the motivation behind the decision to provide guidance for 2024 a bit earlier than is typical? What do you think your level of visibility is at this point versus a typical year? And as you look out, maybe what are some of the areas that give you confidence, and what might be some of the areas where there's more uncertainty, particularly given the volatile consumer environment here? Thanks.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Hi, Dara. I can answer that one. I think, in general, as we build the plans, we're focused on a couple of things. Number one is, obviously, the level of commodity inflation. You know we buy forward about nine months. So that's roughly in line with the past. Number two is the balance of the PepsiCo cost structure. As we've talked about the last couple of quarters, we've put even higher focus than we've had in the past on driving productivity and driving out unnecessary costs using the tools that we've discussed: the investments in digitalization, the investments in global business services, and the investments in driving out overlaps within the organization. Because that work has been going on for a longer period of time, I think that gave us earlier line of sight into what we would expect our cost outcome to be for next year.\nAnd then number three, we're in a good spot in many of the developed markets in terms of our commercial plans. We do joint business planning with our customers. And we're probably in line to maybe even a little ahead of where we've been historically with all of that. So given the information was available to us a little bit earlier, and given there was undoubtedly questions in the investment community on what 2024 looked like, given the evolving pricing and inflationary environment, we thought it was prudent to at least give some indication of what guidance would look like in 2024. So that's what drove the decision.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nExecuive Director, UBS\n\nThanks, Operator. And good morning, everyone. So I actually wanted to follow up on Dara's question there, but just more in the context of your actual performance versus your initial expectations historically, because it's really been a while since organic revenue growth has actually fallen short of your initial outlook. So can you maybe just characterize your confidence in the 2024 outlook at this stage and really whether or not you've embedded enough conservatism, just given what remains a pretty choppy backdrop for the consumer? Thanks.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nSure. Happy to address that. We obviously have a long history here of meeting or exceeding expectations, both our internal expectations as well as the guidance, including this quarter, where we beat revenue and we beat EPS. In fact, we've now met or beat consensus for 55 straight quarters. So we tend to be, I think, appropriately conservative in the way that we communicate to you all. So from that perspective, I think you can go into 2024 with a similar expectation that we should at least achieve the numbers that we've laid out for you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nNik Modi\n\nEquity Ressearch Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Hugh, I was hoping maybe you can just provide some of the macro underpinnings that kind of go into your 2024 viewpoints at this point. Just would love to kind of get your state of the union on the consumer, the economy, and kind of how you guys are thinking that'll shape up as you go through 2024. Thanks.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nSure. Why don't I start? And then, Ramon, obviously, you're super deep on the consumer as well, but I'm happy to start on this one. Number one, I do think that we see the consumer right now being more selective. And you see it in a variety of ways. You see some trade down in terms of channels of trade that they're purchasing products in. You see some orientation toward value. At the same time, the things that I usually look at with the consumer to detect whether there's high stress, we see good results in there. Number one is the convenience store channel. Typically, when gas prices are up and consumer incomes are stressed, you see revenue in those channels under stress as well. For Q3, we saw revenue up 5% in beverages, and 8% in foods in the convenience channel. Number two is food service.\nThat's also typically a leading indicator. That's still growing double digits. So I think we've gone into the year with an approach that says, given all that I laid out during Dara's question, we expect the consumer to continue to be cautious. And to the degree that they are worse than that, we've got cost plans in place that we would use to mitigate whatever challenges we face. But we think our revenue outlook accommodates an increasingly cautious consumer next year. Yeah. And the other thing I would say is all the long-term or structural tailwinds of our categories will continue. If you think about urbanization, demographic shifts, lifestyles, etc., that have been driving our snacking categories or beverage category, the move from unpackaged to packaged, all those things will continue. And they drive a lot of our confidence in our categories.\nThen, obviously, we have almost completed by now our innovation plans, our commercial plans. I think we got better at affordability and premiumization of our portfolio. So we think our share of market will be good next year as well. So that's what's driving our kind of confidence for next year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Again, Bonnie Herzog, your line is open. If you have a question, go ahead and ask it. It looks like they didn't have a question. Do you want me to go and move on to the next person?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYes, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. Sure thing. One moment. Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nChris Carey\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi.

And everything we've been doing for the last five, six years when it comes to reducing sodium, reducing fat, reducing sugar, reducing the portions of our products, adding some new cooking methods to our snacks, those are all very positive trends that will help us pivot the portfolio if needed in the future. We'll continue to do it, obviously. It's one of our key strategic pillars. So again, negligible impact today.\nA lot of these structural trends that are in our category, I think, remain very solid, and even we see them accelerating. Our portfolio strategy, we think, is very solid when it comes to a potential protection against some of these future developments, five, 10 years from now.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge. One moment.\n\nBrett Cooper\n\nVice President of Financial Planning, Analysis and Insights, Consumer Edge\n\nGood morning. Question for you on the North American beverage business. You've said in the past your goal is to hold share in that business. When you begin to add things like Celsius as an organic business, I'd love to hear how you assess the beverage performance. And do you still need to hold share with the own portfolio, or do distributed brands have a component to hold share? Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo",
    "content2": "Yeah. Sorry, we missed a little bit of the question, but hopefully, we got what you're trying to ask. Celsius, obviously, is part of our energy drink strategy. We said we had multiple pillars, and our ability to distribute in our system some third-party brands is part of that strategy. Obviously, Celsius continues to grow. We've doubled the distribution and the presence in store of the brand in the last year or so, especially in the convenience channel, which is a key channel for energy consumption. That participation of Celsius in our truck makes our full system more efficient. It makes our salesmen more relevant in the store. It makes our cooler more a go-to cooler in the store. Those are all positive that eventually have a halo effect as well in the rest of our portfolio.\nSo I don't know if I'm answering the question because really, we couldn't hear it very well. But I guess you get a sense of the importance of Celsius in our energy strategy and the value we get from both the actual monetization of that distribution, but also the halo it has in the rest of the portfolio. Okay. So thank you very much for your questions and for joining us today. And especially, thank you for the confidence that you've placed in us with your investment. We hope you all stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day."

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until it's your turn to ask a question. In order to ask a question or make a comment, please press star followed by one one on your touch-tone phone at any time. You may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star one one again. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.\n\nRavi Pamnani\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, PepsiCo\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared remarks, both of which are available on our website.

Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO Hugh Johnston. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question, and with that I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Once again, in order to ask a question or make a comment, please press star followed by one one at any time on your touch-tone phone. One moment for our first question. Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nThanks operator. Hey, good morning Hugh. Good morning Ramon.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nGood morning, Bryan.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nGood morning, Bryan.\n\nBryan Spillane\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nSo I guess Ramon, my question is more kind of related just how you're looking at the bigger kind of macro picture in the consumer specifically. I think as we went into this year there was an expectation that elasticity would increase and there'd be more of a consumer response, I guess, to all the inflation we're seeing really globally. So I guess it seems like in the first half volumes effectively have been better than expected.\nSo I guess as we're kind of looking forward in the back half of the year and even into next year, can you just kind of give us a little bit of a some insight into how what you're seeing with the consumer, what your expectations are, and just how that may have differed from what we were seeing or what you were thinking maybe going into the start of the year?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYes. Good morning, Bryan. Yes. So I'll give you two. There are two areas which we're looking at very carefully. One is on the supply side. Things have become much better. We've seen much better flow of materials from suppliers. We're seeing in general better labor market. And that has helped us to run a better company. So, you know, that's one area we're looking at very carefully. During COVID it was, you know, it was not perfect. It's becoming better. And that's why you will see that our costs are performing better and how we're flowing some of the net revenue down into the bottom line on the consumer front as well.\nWe're planning the year with more of historical data on elasticities both in developed and developing markets. And we're seeing, in the majority of the markets where we operate, we're seeing better elasticities. And that continues to be during the first half of the year, even though we're seeing lower income consumers strategizing around, obviously, optimizing their budgets. But we're seeing the majority of consumers staying within our categories, staying within our brands. And it's remarkable what our marketing teams, our commercial teams have been doing to minimize elasticity in some respects is what we have been investing for the last few years.\nOur brands are stronger, the perceived value of our products is better than it was, and obviously we've been able to raise prices and consumers stay within our brand. Now we're seeing consumers making some adjustments. We're seeing consumers shopping in more stores than before. They're looking for better deals. They're starting to look for optimization. They're going to channels that have better perceived value. They're buying more in Dollar stores, or they're buying more in mass or in clubs. So every segment of the consumer. It's making an adjustment. Overall, we're seeing very positive, and I think it has to do with the levels of unemployment that we're seeing all around the world.\nUnemployment is very low in most of the economies, if you think about developed markets, but also developing markets. So markets like Mexico. Record low unemployment, some markets. In Asia as well. So we're seeing overall very good consumer behavior, especially when it refers to our categories. And that's why we raised guidance on our top line. And because of the first factor, we raised guidance on the second on the bottom line as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nBeverage, Household, and Personal Care Product Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, thanks. So maybe could we just extend that question a little bit? You mentioned some of the strength in Mexico. International came in very strong in general in the quarter. Obviously you have a lot of different countries and regions within that and two distinct businesses. But just high level thoughts on what drove the international strength, the state of the consumer internationally. And then I'm thinking particularly about the pricing side of things.\nObviously we're sort of cycling tougher comps going forward globally, not just internationally. But can you also give us an update on the competitive environment you're seeing around the world heading into a period when in theory, pricing drops off as we cycle these tougher comps? Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, thank you. Thank you. There are obviously some markets around the world that are suffering from currency situations. There we have to adjust to the reality. I'm talking about Turkey, Pakistan, Egypt, and Argentina. So there's a subsegment of markets where I would not apply the global rule. We're acting very specifically in those markets. But beyond those markets overall we're seeing, and I think it's because what I was saying earlier, unemployment levels being very low. We're seeing consumers continue to behave in a positive way. Our category penetrations in most of those markets is still relatively low and we continue to be an affordable treat in those markets.\nSo our products continue to be part of the repertoire that they can afford and they make trade-offs to stay within our category. So we're seeing that in a very positive way now, competitive-wise. I think there's very rational competition across the world from what we can observe in the first half of the year, both in our snacks and our beverage business. That's what we're assuming in the balance of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman. The Barclays line is open.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to get a little bit more specific around the [inaudible] activity that you guys have been pursuing, particularly on [inaudible], it's just dollar sales.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nLauren, hi. We cannot hear you very well because you're coming up. You're breaking up. I don't know if it's our phone or it's.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nOkay now?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nIt seems to be better.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nIs it better? A little?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nA little better. [crosstalk] call back.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\n[inaudible] call back [inaudible].\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nThank you. Sorry for that.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nRight. No.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thank you. Good morning. Ramon and Hugh. I wanted to circle back on your guidance. I just had a question on it. You know, your new guidance implies, I guess, above algo growth in the second half, but I guess that doesn't really imply much bottom line leverage. So I wanted to understand, you know, if there might be some level of conservatism baked in or if you're planning on stepping up your reinvestments in the second half or if there are any incremental headwinds we should be aware of. Thanks.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, great question, Bonnie. It's you. You're right in that the balance of the year guidance is in effect. 7.5 revenue, 8.5 EPS. That's the squeeze on the balance of the year. What is implied in the margins are two things. Number one, actually continued strong productivity. If you look at where we are year-to-date, our pricing and our commodities are right in line with each other.\nThe margin improvement that you saw in the quarter, 132 bps on gross and 45 on net, is entirely driven by productivity, which is reflective of the productivity investments that we've made over the last couple of years in things like digitalization, in automation, and in leveraging Global Business Services to standardize how we operate. That's actually kind of been a pivot this year, and that's a pivot that I think you'll see ongoing, not just in the back half of this year, but actually into 2024 and beyond, where we're getting margin improvement out of these productivity initiatives.\nObviously the margins are quite good year-to-date, entirely driven by productivity in the back half. You'll continue to see that level of productivity improvement. If anything, it'll accelerate. We are continuing to invest. We're investing in advertising, and marketing, and A&M was up 50 bps in the Q2. You're going to continue to see us invest in A&M. You're going to continue to see us invest in capabilities. Our investment cycles tend to be more back half oriented than they are front half oriented when we have a sense as to how the year is going to turn out. That's what you're seeing in the implied guidance in the balance of the year.\nIt's not that the productivity is going to diminish. It's not that anything is going on with the pricing other than the overlap effects of pricing. It's really a reflection of some of the productivity being reinvested in the back half of the year so that we continue that strong momentum into 2024 and beyond.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nVivien Azer\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you. I was...\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nMorning.\n\nVivien Azer\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\n...looking to actually follow up. Good morning. On Bonnie's question, but just to drill down on PBNA margins down a little bit year-over-year. In your prepared remarks, you reiterated your confidence in expanding margins on a full year basis. I was hoping you could just expand on some of the headwinds that you saw in the quarter and what gives you confidence on the full year margin outlook for the segment specifically. Thank you.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, hi, Vivien, it's Hugh. The margin in PBNA was down in the Q2. We had a big gain on an asset transaction in 2022. We're cycling over that transaction in 2023. And for the full year on PBNA, you'll see the margins up in a healthy way north of 100 basis points.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nHi. Is this better? Hopefully?\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nMuch better.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nIt is.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nMuch better.\n\nLauren Lieberman\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nOkay. I'm still sitting in the same place. Okay. I'm really sorry about that. I was going to ask about Gatorade. So tons of innovation activity. You guys have talked about it. We're seeing it very much in the marketplace, and in the release you talked about Gatorade being up double digits in the quarter. But when we look at Nielsen, it shows something that significantly trails that. And so was just curious, I guess, about mix of untracked, how much of maybe some of the performance you're seeing has to do with incremental shelf space and distribution given the breadth of innovation and new product activity. There's been.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, Lauren. I think there are a couple of factors. The G2DSD has a meaningful impact on timing, on when we reflect our sales and when the consumer actually buys compared to previous years. The cycle has reduced substantially given our DSD model, and that might have some implications on the readings. We feel good about the sports category even though it has been cold in some parts of the country for the month of June and so on. But in general, within the categories, continues to have healthy metrics in terms of penetration, usage, and everything else.\nOur innovation, GFit, Gatorlyte, and most importantly for us long term our powders and tablets is going very, very well. So we believe in those subsegments continue to develop along with G0, which continues to attract new consumers to the category. So we feel good. We're seeing all the execution metrics for Gatorade improving, so inventory on display. Service levels to our customers, which were a little bit handicapped in the past due to supply chain issues. So we're seeing the health of the brand and the category in a pretty good level.\nIt is true that there are some new entrants in the category, like PRIME, that have been taken some space, especially with younger audiences. They've been affecting Gatorade, but they've been affecting more some other brands in the category that had that kind of profile. So we, we feel good about the execution, we feel good about how the brand is performing.\nWe've increased advertising substantially against Gatorade, and we'll continue to do so in the back end of the summer and the year. So we feel good about Gatorade. I think the G2DSD is going to be a structural move that will give us better execution and capacity to respond to weather changes and opportunities in the marketplace going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nAndrea Teixeira\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone. So my question is more on the balance of pricing and volumes. Obviously, you're lapping some of the most strong price increases from last year, and you're expecting, I would say, are you expecting still high single digits in the second half with volumes more flattish or still negative? Because to get to the math of 10%, perhaps you're lapped in Russia. But seems that the UK, France, and Spain have lagged a bit for the top line.\nSo I'm trying to reconcile the implied organic 7.5%-ish with better volumes. So in other words, you are seeing some improvement there as pricing kind of ease off for the consumer, how we should be thinking to Ramon's comment on some of the discounters and that happening, or you're still seeing room for continued pricing but to a lesser extent, as Hugh mentioned at CNBC interview? Thank you.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nI, go ahead, Ramon.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, no, we can have Hugh continue the CNBC interview.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nHi, Andrea. Yeah, so balance of year revenue. The increase is 7.5%. What I think we're going to see is volumes will be sort of in the flattish range for the balance of the year. Obviously, there is still carryover pricing, and I don't think we'll do anything different than our normal cycles on pricing in the balance of year. You tend to see pricing in the beverage business in the Q4, Frito tends not to go in the balance of the year, but that's TBD. We'll see how the year plays out.\nBut the implication that we have in the forecast right now is kind of back to our relatively more normal pricing. And obviously that sets us up for 2024. I mean, a lot of ways to think about it as the back half of the year is a little bit ahead of our long-term guidance, which I think is the momentum that will carry forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nChris Carey\n\nEquity Analyst and Head of Consumer Staples Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nMorning, Chris.\n\nChris Carey\n\nEquity Analyst and Head of Consumer Staples Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHey, Hugh. Just one quick follow-up on the gross margin. You said that the pricing tailwinds year-to-date are basically in line or offsetting inflation. I couldn't tell if you said commodity inflation. I guess what I see is about 600 basis points benefit from pricing and a 400 basis points headwind from commodity inflation. So it seems like you're actually tracking ahead. But when you made that comment, was that a total inflation comment?\nOr is there a mixed tailwind as well? So maybe price is actually below what we can see in price mix. So I just wanted to clarify that, and I guess connected is just in the context of full year gross margin. Unless there's some offsets, it seems like you could see some notable expansion for the full year. Am I reading that wrong? That's going to allow you to invest, or are there some offsets I'm not thinking about? So thanks so much.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Hey Chris, it's you. So what I had said was pricing was up exactly in line with our commodity inflation. So both, both are in the teens, and the numbers are basically identical. So that obviously is not driving margin improvement because those two are essentially offsetting each other in terms of the balance of the year. Margins we have previously communicated we'd be at least equal with where we were last year. We're now clearly going to be ahead of where we were last year. So margins will improve this year as opposed to the at least equal that we had previously communicated.\nAnd the driver of course behind that is productivity. And the things that I've been talking about and Ramon's been talking about for a while. You know, we've made these investments in digitalization, we've made these investments in automation. We've been investing in building out a Global Business Services operation.\nI think that's the pivot that you see happening inside of our numbers right now is the margins will improve, I think, on a sustained basis and it'll be driven by productivity and that productivity will come out of those three buckets. I don't think this is a one- or two-quarter thing. I think you're going to see margins continue to steadily improve this year and into the coming years.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. So I was hoping to get some updated thoughts on the Celsius agreement and kind of what you've learned over the past several months. Obviously the growth has been tremendous, but has that outsized growth or better than expected share performance shifted your view as to whether this is the right structure for PepsiCo longer term? And then just having previously distributed Bang and kind of given the BANG and Monster news, do you have any updated thoughts as to whether this could impact the growth trajectory for Celsius? Looking ahead. Thanks.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, good morning. I think there's a couple of realizations on this. The number one is that the power of our distribution system. Our DSD machine in the US is very powerful. Obviously you can see by the increase in the numerical distribution and the quality of execution. That's one element that makes us feel very strong about our capabilities in the US beverages. Second, I think Celsius is a brand that is capturing new consumers to the energy category.\nConsumers that were not consuming energy drinks for many reasons in the past, flavor or image or some other element that is a positive. The category keeps expanding, and we're glad that that's in our portfolio and we're working together with Celsius to see additional international opportunities, whether we can expand the brand in some other markets, especially more developed markets where the category is a bit more developed. Those are the three conclusions that we're taking from our relationship so far.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nThe only thing I'd add is we're very happy with the investment we've made and we feel very comfortable where we are with that company right now. I think we're both benefiting from each other's team's capabilities.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Ottenstein\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thank you very much, and congratulations on another terrific quarter. I wonder if we could focus on area we haven't spent that much time talking about it in the past, but it is really doing well, and that's Europe, and maybe perhaps parse it out for us. Or, remind us the business mix in Europe between snacks and beverages.\nAnd then talk a little bit about how the business is doing so well. Very significant pricing. I know you had relatively easy comps, and whether you think that there are structural long-term changes in the pricing dynamics in Europe. I mean, for many years Europe was very deflationary and extremely tough retail. I'm sure a lot of that persists. But are there clues here that maybe there are structural changes in that environment that can go forward? Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, thank you. Yes. Good diagnostic. The fact that our European business clearly has had a terrific first half of the year and we're expecting that to continue in the second half. A couple of elements. I think we have a portfolio that is quite robust on the snacks side. We have very good market positions in snacks, and we have good, challenging positions in beverages. And our zero propositions in Europe are growing very fast, and they're taking market share in some of the more affluent markets in Europe. So good portfolio mix and good focus by the team on growing that portfolio.\nAs you said, we were a little bit late to pricing last year in 2022, and the team has been courageous and has been able to find win-win solutions with our customers in 2023. So as you see from the numbers, good pricing levels. But what is also very remarkable in Europe is the levels of productivity that the team has been executing through simplification of the business and everything else that Hugh was saying about digitalization and automation and also moving some service to essential points that we can service the businesses more effectively, more efficiently.\nSo good work by the European team both on portfolio managed simplification and then in driving productivity. So we feel good about Europe. We have very strong business in both Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and parts of the economy that are growing faster. So we feel good about the portfolio composition and the business going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nStephen Powers\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Household and Personal Care, Beverages, and Food, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks and good morning. Maybe putting a final bow around Bryan's original top line question, I guess, Hugh. The volume cadence that you implied a little earlier, down 2% or so in the first half based on results reported to date. And if I heard you correctly, flattish. In the second half, how does that compare with your outlook coming into the year? Because I guess just stepping back, I'm trying to get a better sense of. Whether the four points of upside you. Now, see, in organic growth versus that February forecast is more driven by better volumes, or whether the upside is really driven by greater than expected price mix realization or whether it's some kind of combination? Thanks.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. Hey, Steve, good morning. It's a combination. Volumes are certainly a bit better than we expected. And price realization is a little better than we expected as well. So it's a combo. It's not dominant, one or the other.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah. And I would say the commercial teams have done a great job in minimizing elasticity. So going into the year, of course, we were assuming a level of elasticity that was more based on historical levels. I think we've been positively surprised on the strength of the brands in some markets and obviously, as I said earlier, the consequence of the investment we've been making. But the way the teams have executed innovation, have executed range expansion, multiple displays around the store, and some of the tactics we normally use to drive volume and minimize elasticity have been really well executed.\nI think we link it as well to us being a more intelligent company in a broader sense, having better data, having better digital utilization and execution capabilities. So it is all connected. And yeah, we feel good about how the business perform in that respect versus what we had initially planned.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. Quick question on Frito-Lay North America. Clearly very strong results in the quarter, but over the last couple of weeks, we have seen a bit of a slowdown in tracked channels. So the first question is, what do you think is driving the recent slowdown? Partly is obviously cycling high price realization, but also just general sense on what you're seeing from a volume standpoint. Then also, why are you seeing untracked channels in that business? Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, Frito-Lay is having a tremendous year again on top of very good 2022. It's been driven by our large brands performing very well. Linking to what I said earlier about very strong brand programs and commercial programs. The away from home business and the small store independent business, where there is a lot of impulse consumption, is not really reflected normally by a lot of the reports that you've probably seen. So that might be a gap there. Obviously in the summer, this is very relevant as people move around more. But we're seeing. The only thing we're seeing in Frito-Lay in the last few weeks is the lapping versus the P6 price increase with it last year.\nThat's the only element. Everything else, we're seeing a much better. Supply chain. So our service levels to our key customers is improving a lot. That's good news because we were a little bit handicapped in the last year and first half of this year. We're seeing much broader portfolio. So the smaller SKUs that drive, we know they drive frequency and they drive penetration in some, some sub consumers. So we're seeing a lot of positive trends. Some of our innovation, if you think about Minis or if you think about some of the new launches like the Jerky product or.\nRelaunch of the Nuts and Seeds, our permissible portfolio, they're really doing very well along with our big brands. So we feel good about the portfolio composition and the continued executional capabilities of Frito to drive availability universally almost. So we're feeling good about the business.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our last question comes from Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.\n\nGerald Pascarelli\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Wedbush Securities\n\nHi, thanks very much for the question. Mine's also on energy drinks, specifically regarding near-term distribution opportunities. You've obviously been a great partner for Celsius since you took over. Distribution of their products has been readily apparent in measured channels. But looking forward, how do you think about the opportunity to penetrate some of the non-measured channels that have yet to scratch the surface, specifically related to food service, college campuses as an example.\nAnd is a comprehensive rollout of these products something we should expect in the back half of this year or is that more of a 2024 opportunity? I guess any incremental color you could provide on timing and then the potential halo effect that Celsius could have on your legacy portfolio of energy products would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nRamon Laguarta\n\nChairman and CEO, PepsiCo\n\nYeah, listen, we take our energy products along with the rest of the portfolio where it makes sense. Right? So some of the channels you're mentioning, like college universities, they are very large channels for our energy execution. Right? So when you go to a normal campus, you will see a Rockstar, you will see Celsius, you will see our coffee business, you will see. The new Gatorade energy Fast Twitch. So you will see all this execution. Wherever there are consumers that are looking for energy, we tend to be there. So we're not holding. On any opportunities at this point to maximize the reach of our brand. So no, don't wait for 2024. We're executing as we speak. Great.\n\nGerald Pascarelli\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Wedbush Securities\n\nThanks.\nSo I think this is the end of the conversation. Thank you very much. Thank you all of you for joining us today and especially for the confidence that you've placed in us with your investments. We hope that you have a great summer and stay safe and healthy. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.\n\nRavi Pamnani\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, PepsiCo\n\nThank you, Kevin. Thank you everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nYou're welcome.",

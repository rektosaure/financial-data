[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Vance Sherard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nVance Sherard\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Jeannie. Good morning, and thank you for joining the Jack Henry First Quarter Fiscal 2026 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Greg Adelson, President and CEO; and Mimi Carsley, CFO and Treasurer. Following my opening remarks, Greg will share his comments on our quarterly results, operational metrics and the outlook for the remainder of fiscal '26. Mimi will then discuss the financial results and updated fiscal '26 guidance provided in yesterday's press release, which is available on the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website. Afterwards, we will open the lines for a Q&A session.\nPlease note that this call includes forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. The company is not obligated to update or revise these statements. For a summary of risk factors and additional information that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements, refer to yesterday's press release and the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements sections in our 10-K.\nDuring this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures such as non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. Reconciliations for these measures are included in yesterday's press release.\nNow I will hand the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory R. Adelson\n\nCOO, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThank you, Vance. Good morning, and I appreciate each of you joining today's call. I'd like to begin by thanking our associates for their hard work and unwavering commitment to our key differentiators, culture, service, innovation, strategy and execution. I will share 3 key takeaways from the quarter and then provide additional detail about our overall business. First, our financial performance. We produced record first quarter financial results with non-GAAP revenue of $636 million, up an impressive 8.7% over last year's first quarter. That significantly exceeds the 7% to 7.5% increase we anticipated in August. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 27.2%, representing a robust 227 basis points of margin expansion over last year's Q1.\nSecond, our sales performance. Starting with migrations from in-house processing to our private cloud, in Q1, we signed 7 contracts to move existing clients to our private cloud, including $11 billion asset credit union and an $8 billion asset bank. Notably, the asset size of clients migrating to our private cloud was 60% higher over the past 12 months, $43 billion versus $69 billion, while the number of deals has remained consistent with previous years. As a reminder, we earn on average approximately 2x more revenue from clients in the private cloud compared to those on-premise. Today, 77% of our core clients are operating in the Jack Henry private cloud.\nTurning to new core sales. As many of you know, the first quarter is typically our lightest of the year. In Q1, our sales team earned 4 competitive core wins, including 1 financial institution with over $1 billion in assets. For context, last year, we started with 6 competitive core wins in Q1 and finished the year with 51. We remain confident that we will be within that range again this year as we are off to a very strong start in Q2.\nI also want to comment on the new sales procedures we implemented for the contract renewals about 6 months ago, which has resulted in a healthier balance between new sales and renewal contracts as well as improved pricing procedures. Our Q1 fiscal year '26 deal mix was 44% new core sales and 56% renewals compared to 35% new sales and 65% renewals in Q1 last year. We expect this trend to continue throughout the fiscal year.\nThird, our annual client conference. In September, we hosted another highly successful Jack Henry Connect conference in San Diego drawing a record 2,651 clients. This is our largest event of the year and a major driver of new business opportunities. We had a record 91 prospects from 30 banks and credit unions. This is important to note because 20 of last year's new core wins came from prospects who attended Jack Henry Connect, underscoring the strategic value of this event. Additionally, the conference drew 48 consultants and our technology showcase featured 266 third-party fintechs, both all-time highs.\nWe also had a record attendance at our annual CEO forum, hosting 211 CEOs. Overall, attendees expressed less concerned about the macro economy than last year and plan to continue investing in technology to enhance their digital capabilities, strengthen fraud protection, improve efficiencies and modernize their businesses.\nNext, I'd like to highlight several important announcements we made in the quarter. I'll start with our acquisition of Victor Technologies, which closed on September 30. We're excited to welcome the Victor associates to the Jack Henry family. We are equally excited about this technology as we leverage the capabilities to create new opportunities for our clients in the mini fintech serving the financial industry.\nAs you've heard me say, our acquisition strategy targets companies that have great teams are cloud-native, API first and accelerate our product road map. Victor fits that strategy perfectly. Victor's modern innovative platform with direct to core connectivity enables financial institutions to embed payment capabilities into third-party nonbank brands such as fintechs and commercial customers. This helps financial institutions grow deposits, diversify fee income and maintain compliance controls. For Jack Henry, Victor provides a highly scalable solution that creates diverse revenue streams, enhances our payments as a service capabilities and accelerates the delivery of emerging services like stablecoin.\nVictor was already integrated with our SilverLake core banking system and our Jack Henry PayCenter prior to the acquisition. We plan to extend its capabilities to serve our Symitar credit union and treasury management clients and to integrate directly with the new cloud-native Jack Henry platform.\nI will now provide an update on stablecoin as we've been actively developing and executing our strategy. We just completed a proof of concept in less than 2 weeks to allow financial institutions to send and receive U.S. DC. We continue to work with key vendors and emerging fintechs on other aspects of our strategy, which includes the development of wallet, custody and segment services for our clients to service their account holders. Furthermore, the new Jack Henry platform supports 9 decimal places, well above the 6 required for U.S. DC, positioning us very well for both stable coin and tokenized deposits.\nBy contrast, most, if not all, existing core support only 2 decimal places. This advancement has already enabled us to facilitate cross-border stablecoin transactions for third parties through Banno.\nAnother key development this quarter was the launch of our cloud native Tap2Local merchant acquiring solution. Tap2Local is offered exclusively through banks and credit unions, giving them a powerful way to win back deposits from small- and medium-sized businesses that have shifted their card acceptance activities to other providers. Capital local primarily targets the 82% of SMBs that are sole proprietors. Today, only 16% of sole proprietors keep both their retail and commercial accounts at the same community financial institution, largely due to the lack of SMB-focused services.\nBuilt in partnership with Moov, Tap2Local delivers differentiated capabilities for SMBs, including easy enrollment tap to pay on both iOS and Android devices without additional hardware and continuous account reconciliation to the accounting platform of their choice. We showcased a live demo of capital local at Jack Henry Connect and received fantastic feedback. We are currently rolling it out in phases to our Banno clients. We rolled out the initial phase of 40 clients on Monday of this week.\nWe also did a live onstage demo of Jack Henry Rapid Transfers at the conference. In partnership with Moov, we conducted more than 1,000 additional demos of this solution in the technology exhibit hall. Rapid Transfers enables both SMBs and consumers to instantly move funds between external accounts, eligible cards and digital wallets to manage day-to-day transaction and personal finances. There are only a handful of institutions offering this service today, 0 were community financial institutions until now.\nWe are collaborating with both Visa and Mastercard to facilitate these transactions through their respective debit rails. Rapid Transfers is receiving strong initial reviews with 48 clients now live and 126 more in various stages of implementation. These unique solutions are all powered by the cloud-native API-first infrastructure we've built through our technology modernization strategy and are part of the Jack Henry platform. This strategy has enabled us to accelerate our innovation at speeds not typically seen in our industry, especially from a core provider.\nWe developed our Tap2Local and Rapid Transfers solutions in less than 10 months, including close to 40 external certifications. We developed a full proof concept of U.S. DC in only 2 weeks, and we will be launching our public cloud native deposit on core in only 3 years, still on schedule for the first half of calendar 2026.\nThe new Jack Henry platform is integrated with all of our existing cores. Unlike most of our competitors, it's not a side core, which is a separate parallel system that runs alongside the primary core. Side cores do not integrate directly with nor do they extend existing cores to enable new and enhanced use cases in the way the Jack Henry platform does. This integration delivers significant advantages to our clients, including real-time processing, streamline operations, open API connectivity, enhanced security and immediate continuous upgrades.\nNext, I'll provide a few updates on specific products. In our Payments segment, we continue to experience outstanding growth in our faster payment solutions. Over the past year, the number of financial institutions using Zelle has grown by 20%, and the Clearing House's RTP network by 25% and FedNow by 32%. In Q1, payment transaction volume through these channels increased by 55% over the prior year Q1.\nIn our Complementary segment, we signed a total of 38 new financial crimes defender and faster payment module contracts in the quarter. As of September 30, we have 148 Financial Crimes installations completed and another 66 in various stages of implementation. We also have 113 faster payment modules installed and 205 in various stages of implementation.\nSpeaking of Financial Crimes Defender, we are proud that our solution recently won a silver medal from Data Insights for best AML and fraud transaction monitoring innovation.\nContinuing with our complementary segment, we continue to see success with our Banno Digital platform. For the quarter, we signed a total of 18 new clients to the Banno platform. We currently have 1,026 Banno retail clients and 390 live with Banno business. We finished the quarter with 14.7 million registered users on the Banno platform. At the end of Q1 last year, we had 12.7 million registered users, a 15% increase over the past 12 months.\nWe are confident that the tech spending will remain strong based on recent surveys, direct feedback from our clients and our robust sales pipeline. In Bank Directors 2025 technology survey that came out in September, 71% of respondents reported an increase in their bank's technology budget for fiscal year 2025 with a median increase of 10%. These results align with findings from our strategy benchmark published last spring in that survey, 76% of our own clients said they plan to increase spending over the next 2 years with their top priorities being digital banking, fraud prevention, automation, cybersecurity and AI.\nSpeaking of AI, we continue to focus on numerous product and internal use cases to help our clients and our staff improve back-office efficiency. Our new solutions are built with a human in the loop approach, and while reviews are still early, feedback has been extremely positive. We have created over 100 internal AI use cases while we continue working through prioritization, these efforts have already enabled us to control headcount additions from the improvements we have seen across all lines of business. As a reminder, we do not sell any of our products utilizing a seat license model. So factors such as the number of branches or employees at the bank do not have a bearing on our revenue stream.\nLooking ahead, we will hold our annual shareholder meeting next week in Monett, Missouri and offer a webcast for remote viewers. We're also proud to recognize the 40th anniversary of our IPO this month and will commemorate the milestone with a bell ringing at NASDAQ on November 21.\nIn closing, we are extremely pleased with our overall Q1 performance and remain highly optimistic about the rest of the year. I know -- I will now hand things over to Mimi to walk through the financial details.\n\nMimi L. Carsley\n\nCFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Our associates remain steadfast in serving our financial institution clients, delivering shareholder value, leading to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth.\nI will begin with our healthy first quarter results, then conclude with our updated fiscal '26 guidance. Q1 GAAP revenue increased 7% and non-GAAP revenue increased 9%, a continuation of consistently solid performance. Non-GAAP revenue growth was positively impacted by the shift of our Connect Client Conference into Q1 from Q2. Even without this timing shift, quarterly revenue growth would have been a robust 8%.\nFirst quarter deconversion revenue of approximately $9 million, which we previously announced was up approximately $5 million reflecting a steady pace of M&A activity among financial institutions.\nNow let's look more closely at the detail. GAAP services and support revenue increased 6% for the quarter, while non-GAAP increased 8%. Services and support growth during the quarter was primarily driven by strength in data processing and hosting revenue for both private and public cloud, revenue from our Connect Conference and solution implementation. Private and public cloud offerings continue to drive strong growth. Cloud revenue increased 7% in the quarter, this reoccurring revenue contributor is 30% of our total revenue.\nShifting to processing revenue, which is 42% of total revenue and another strategic component of our long-term growth model. We saw healthy performance with 10% GAAP and non-GAAP growth for the quarter. Consistent with recent results, quarterly drivers included increased card, digital and payment processing revenues. Completing commentary in revenue, I would highlight total recurring revenue exceeded 91%.\nNext, moving to expenses. Beginning with the cost of revenue, which increased a modest 1% on a GAAP basis and 4% on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter. Drivers for the quarter included higher direct costs consistent with revenue growth, higher personnel costs, partially offset by lower benefits and increased amortization of intangible assets. For modeling purposes, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was $6 million for the quarter.\nNext, R&D expense decreased 1% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter. The quarter decrease is primarily due to tempered net personnel costs. And ending with SG&A expense for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis, it increased 14% and 9% on a GAAP basis. The quarter increase was primarily due to the timing of our Connect client conference, increased personnel service costs, higher net personnel costs, partly offset by lower commission and benefit costs. Without the Connect client conference costs, SG&A would have increased 12% on a non-GAAP basis and 7% on a GAAP basis.\nAided by our consistent revenue growth, we remain focused on generating annual compounding margin expansion. Q1 delivered 227 basis point increase in non-GAAP margin to 27%. Non-GAAP margin benefit from inherent leverage in our business model, strategic cost management, and leveraging existing workforce as we continue to focus on enterprise, process improvement and AI utilization. These strong quarterly results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.97, up 21%.\nReviewing the 3 operating segments, we are pleased to see positive performance across the board. Core segment non-GAAP revenue increased 6% on the quarter, with operating margins increasing a robust 114 basis points. We continue to gain benefits from private cloud trends and disciplined cost management. The Payments segment quarterly non-GAAP revenue increased 8%. The segment again had outstanding non-GAAP operating margin growth with quarterly results of 170 basis points. Revenue growth was due to resilience in our card-related services, consistent growth in the EPS business and large -- continuing large percentage growth on faster payments all bet on a smaller dollar basis. Margins benefited from operational efficiencies and disciplined cost management.\nFinally, Complementary segment quarterly non-GAAP revenue increased an impressive 9% with healthy 75 basis points of margin expansion. Quarterly revenue growth continued to reflect digital solution demand, beneficial product mix and sales sourced from both new core wins and noncore financial institutions.\nNow a review of cash flow and capital allocation. Q1 operating cash flow was $121 million, a $4 million increase over the prior fiscal year. Quarterly free cash flow of $69 million delivered by a $10 million increase was positively impacted by the collection of remaining annual maintenance billings and full tax depreciation and development expenses related to recent tax legislation. Our consistent dedication to value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 22%, compared to the 20% in the first quarter of the prior year. We're very proud of the durability of this metric performance.\nAdditionally, I would highlight the following significant capital allocation decisions. $100 million in share repurchases year-to-date through October, the asset acquisition of Victor and $42 million in dividends paid. We ended the quarter with a minimal amount of debt consistent with normal course revolver line usage that expect to end the year debt-free, barring acquisitions or other opportunities.\nI will now discuss the updated increased full year guidance. As you're aware, yesterday's press release included updated increases to fiscal '26 full year GAAP guidance. These deconversion guidance will continue to follow the conservative methodology introduced in fiscal '24. Fiscal '26 deconversion revenue guidance has been increased to $20 million. Aligned with guidance methodology, we will update the outlook as we confirm more activity throughout the year.\nFull year GAAP revenue gross guidance increased to a range of 4.9% to 5.9%. This is driven by deconversion revenue increase, expected revenue contribution for the remainder of the year from the Victor acquisition. I will emphasize GAAP revenue remains almost certainly understated due to the conservative deconversion revenue guidance.\nBased on our strong first quarter results, and expected continued momentum, we have increased the lower end of the non-GAAP revenue annual growth rate guidance, resulting in a new outlook of 6% to 7%. As a reminder, fiscal '26 and the first quarter of fiscal '27, Victor acquisition-related financial impacts will be excluded as part of non-GAAP reporting. Based on the above revenue growth and our resilient financial model, we expect to again generate sustainable, accretive sources and margins.\nWe are increasing full year guidance for non-GAAP margin expansion to a range of 30 to 50 basis points. All of the above are indicative that our business operations remain healthy and sound with near-term growth opportunities. The full year GAAP tax rate estimate for fiscal '26 is 23.75%. The above increased guidance metrics resulted in a stronger full year outlook for GAAP EPS of $6.38 to $6.49 per share, a growth of 2% to 4%. And as a reminder, updated conservative deconversion revenue guidance almost understates -- almost certainly understates EPS GAAP growth.\nFiscal '26 is expected to have superior free cash flow conversion due to recently passed tax legislation, and we have elected to take the accelerated election. Full year free cash flow conversion outlook is for 85% to 100% for the fiscal '26, matching our expected target but with a bias to the higher end of the range. As a reminder, we see fluctuations in quarterly results relating to software usage license components, along with the timing of implementation. Therefore, the correct performance indicator for our business is the consistently strong fiscal year financial results.\nIn conclusion, Q1 results reflect outstanding performance leading to increased guidance. We're pleased by the start to our fiscal year and remain positive on the outlook. Demand for our solutions aligned with continued technology spend by our clients and prospects will drive superior shareholder returns and value. We appreciate the contributions of our dedicated associates that achieve these superior results and our investors for their ongoing confidence.\nJeannie, please open the line for questions."

Welcome to the Jack Henry Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I also note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Vance Sherard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nVance Sherard\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Jamie. Good morning, and thank you for joining the Jack Henry Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2025 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Greg Adelson, President and CEO; and Mimi Carsley, CFO and Treasurer. Following my opening remarks, Greg will share his comments on our quarterly and full year financial results, operational metrics and the outlook for fiscal 2026. Mimi will then discuss the financial results and full year fiscal 2026 guidance provided in yesterday's press release, which is available in the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website. Afterward, we will open the lines for a Q&A session.\nPlease note that this call includes forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. The company is not obligated to update or revise these statements. For a summary of risk factors and additional information that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements refer to yesterday's press release and the Risk Factors and forward-looking Statement sections in our 10-K. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures such as non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. Reconciliations for these measures are included in yesterday's press release. Now I will hand the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory R. Adelson\n\nCOO, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThank you, Vance. Good morning, everyone. I appreciate each of you joining today's call. I'd like to begin by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication to our success. They consistently go above and beyond to take care of our clients. That, combined with our unwavering focus on culture, service, innovation, strategy and execution continues to differentiate us in the market. I will share 3 main takeaways for the quarter in fiscal year, and then we'll provide additional detail about our overall business. First, our financial performance. Our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025 results reflect solid overall performance.\nIn Q4, our non-GAAP revenue increased 7.5% and our non-GAAP operating margin was 23.2%, representing a strong 146 basis points of margin expansion over last year. For the fiscal year, we again produced record revenue and operating income. Our non-GAAP revenue was $2.3 billion, and our non-GAAP operating income was $541.1 million. As you saw in the press release, we shared guidance for fiscal year '26. We do anticipate some slight revenue headwinds from industry consolidation, the impact of renewal pricing pressure and macroeconomic uncertainty. However, we remain committed and bullish on continuing to realize solid margin expansion growth along with strong free cash flow metrics for the year.\nWe are confident that our technology innovation and execution will continue to drive our sales engine and position us very well for the long term. We will discuss more of the fiscal '26 specifics and comments. In addition, I want to communicate openly regarding the large bank merger that was recently announced and includes a Jack Henry core payment and complementary solution client. It has been speculated that Jack Henry's technology would not be selected for the combined financial institution. After conversations with both parties, there has been no indication of an intent to terminate any agreements. If contract changes were to take place, they would happen in fiscal '27 and not in fiscal '26. Second, continued industry-leading sales momentum. For Q4, our sales team had an impressive 23 core winds topping the 22 wins we had in Q4 of fiscal '24. For the full fiscal '25, we signed 51 new core deals, banks and 20 credit hands.\nAdditionally, we signed 37 contracts to move existing in-house core clients to our private cloud, including 11 in Q4. We now host 77% of our core clients in Jack Henry's private cloud environment. Third, we continue to win larger new core deals. Over the past 3 years, the total assets of new core clients won has nearly trickled. We had 47 wins totaling $19 billion in assets in fiscal '23, and wins totaling $39 billion in fiscal '24 and 51 wins totaling $53 billion in fiscal '25. Of the 51 core wins this fiscal year, institutions that have over $1 billion in assets. In fiscal '24 and '25 combined, we won 31 core deals in this segment as compared to only 16 in fiscal '22 and '23 combined. Our strategy is also resonating with the 5 billion to 10 billion asset institutions as well.\nOf our 16 greater than 1 billion wins, we won 4 in the $5 billion to $10 billion segment after winning only 1 in fiscal year '24 and none in fiscal year '22 and '23. Now for more detail on our overall business, starting with some accolades for the team. We're proud to have recently received recognition in 3 prominent publications, U.S. News and World Report Best Companies to Work for Time Magazine's best midsized companies and Newsweek's greatest workplaces. These awards are important because they reflect our people-first culture and deep commitment to doing the right thing for our employees and ensuring they are valued.\nI also want to recognize the tremendous effort of our team and our clients on the highly successful migration of Fedwire funds to ISO 20-022 standard on July 14. This was a major industry-wide event for the United States payments infrastructure, aligning it with international standards and enhancing crucial capabilities such as fraud detection and data sharing. Related to the migration, we had 5 clients go live with a new wires component of our cloud-native Jack Henry platform, including one of our largest credit union clients. They did this at the same time as the migration and it went extremely well. This is a strong validation of our component strategy for easing concerns about large-scale migrations and conversions.\nNext, I will provide a few updates on specific products and new solutions that are part of our technology modernization and SMB strategies. Within our Payments segment, we now have 376 clients on the Zelle platform, 414 clients using the real-time payments network and 401 clients using Fed now. In our complementary segment, we added 18 new financial crimes Defender contracts in Q4 and 47% for the fiscal year. In addition, we signed 66 new contracts for the Financial Crimes Defender faster payment fraud module, in Q4 and 149 for the fiscal year. As a reminder, this module is a real-time solution designed to help mitigate fraud in Zelle, Banno and RTP transactions.\nAs of June 30, we have 136 financial crime installations completed and another 71 in various stages of implementation. We also have 85 faster payment modules installed and 189 in various stages of implementation. Our Banno digital platform continues to experience high demand. For the quarter, we signed 26 new clients to our Banno retail platform as well as 39 new Banno business deals. For the full fiscal year, we closed 70 new Banno retail contracts and 106 Vando business contracts. At the end of June, we had 1,023 clients on the Battle platform, including 344 live with Banno business. We finished Q4 with 14.3 million registered users on the Banno platform. And when compared to Q4 of fiscal '24, we experienced a strong 17% increase over the past 12 months. With last week's exciting announcement of the launch of Tap to local, our merchant acquiring solution developed in collaboration with Moov, we are leveraging the Banno platform as the primary source for delivering this innovative solution to the industry.\nTap to local is currently in closed beta testing with several financial institutions. It is on track to be rolled out to the 1,023 banks and credit unions on the Battle platform over the next several months. Unlike most other payment solutions for small businesses, Tap to local Is offered exclusively through financial institutions. The Cloud Native solution delivers many distinguishing features for merchants including easy enrollment, the ability to accept debit and credit card payments directly through tap to pay on both iOS and Android devices, thus eliminating the need for traditional point-of-sale hardware and continuous account reconciliation to the accounting platform of their choice. Another solution that we recently launched with Move is Jack Henry Rapid transfers. This cloud-native solution enables both SMBs and consumers to quickly move funds between external accounts, eligible cards and digital wallets to manage day-to-day transactions or personal finances.\nWe are collaborating with both Visa and MasterCard to facilitate these transactions through their respective debit rails. Rapid transfers is now available on the Banno Digital platform, and we are in the process of enrolling more than 50 new clients. Now that we have closed key feature gaps with several competitors and have added advanced functionality that no other digital provider has totally as today, like Jack Henry Rapid transfers and Tap to local we are winning larger competitive takeaways in the digital banking space than in previous quarters. Another indicator of our progress, Banno business was recently named a leading small business digital banking platform for strength and capabilities by Datos Insights, a prominent research firm. The ranking highlighted Banno business' ease of use, open architecture and excellent support.\nWe also continue to make excellent progress on our technology modernization strategy. We now have 20 components of the new cloud native Jack Henry platform live in various stages. While some of these are for internal use, eliminating duplicated development efforts across the company, several components are already benefiting our clients. These include the wire solution that I mentioned earlier, DataHub, which provides a centralized hub for reporting and analysis, entitlements, which manages permissions and access rights for users and systems and a new general ledger. All components are receiving very favorable reviews from our clients. We will promote all of our new technology at the Jack Henry Annual Conference, Jack Henry Connect in September. This is a great opportunity every year for us to be with our prospects, clients and partners.\nLast year, 20 of our new core wins were with prospects who attended the Jack Henry Connect conference. Before I wrap up, I want to share an update on our stable coin strategy. While there is a lot of external hike around stable coins, there are still significant industry hurdles to mainstream of adoption, including regulations that must be developed over the next 6 to 12 months. to implement a stable coding legislation that passed in July known as the Genius. Our plan is to take a strategic phased approach, supporting stable coin solutions through our banking credit union clients and not a renting them. This allows us to ensure we do the things the right way while regulations are being written. Unlike many of our competitors, we already have the public cloud native platform and infrastructure needed for a successful stable coin implementation. Today, our clients can securely integrate with a number of third-party stable come providers using our open APIs. We are currently working on enabling stable coins of the payments rail via our JHA PayCenter, we are also in discussions with regulated stablecoin issuers, digital asset infrastructure providers and key players to explore additional strategic partnerships. We will keep you informed as we have more updates.\nIn closing, we are very well positioned for the future. Technology spending by financial institutions remain strong, and there's clear demand for our differentiated and innovative technology solutions. We have a robust sales pipeline and a proven ability to attract and win new clients, including larger financial institutions. Our unwavering focus on culture, service, innovation, strategy and execution continues to set us apart -- these pillars will enable us to drive continued industry-leading revenue growth with strong margin expansion, benefiting our associates, clients and shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Mimi for more specifics on our financials.\n\nMimi L. Carsley\n\nCFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. The relentless dedication of our associates in serving our financial institution clients and delivering shareholder value led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. I will begin with fourth quarter and full year results, then conclude with our fiscal '20 guidance. Q4 GAAP revenue increased 10% and non-GAAP revenue increased 8%, a continuation of consistently solid performance. Full year growth was 7% on a GAAP basis and 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Fourth quarter deconversion revenue of approximately $20 million, which we previously announced, was up approximately $14 million, reflecting the increasing base of M&A activity among financial institutions. Full year deconversion revenue of $34 million, $17 million more than the prior fiscal year exceeded guidance.\nNow let's look more closely at the details. Gas services and support revenue increased 11% for the quarter, while non-GAAP increased 7%. For the year, the increase was a healthy 7% for GAAP and 5% on a non-GAAP basis. Services and support growth during the quarter was the result of volume increases in data processing and hosting revenue, consulting work orders and release revenue. The full year growth rate for services and support revenue was due to similar drivers partially offset by lower hardware and license revenue. Driving and public cloud offerings continue to drive impressive growth, low revenue increased 11% in both the quarter and the year. This reoccurring revenue contributor is 32% of our total revenue and has a multiyear track record of double-digit growth into processing revenue, which is 43% of total revenue and another strategic component of our long-term growth model.\nWe got healthy performance with 9% non-GAAP growth for the quarter and gas growth of 9% for the quarter and 8% for the full year. Consistent with recent trends, quarterly drivers included increased car, digital and payment processing revenue. Completing commentary on revenue, I would highlight total recurring revenue exceeded 91%. Next, moving to expenses. Giving it come revenue, which increased 5% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and full year. Drivers for the quarter and full year were consistent and included higher direct costs and higher personnel costs. Next, R&D expense increased 7% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and 10% for the year for both GAAP and non-GAAP. The quarterly and full year increase was primarily due to the higher net personnel costs, increased internal license and fees, ending with SG&A spend for the quarter, non-GAAP GAAP basis increased 8% and 9% on GAAP base.\nFor the year, the increase was 7% on a non-GAAP basis and 2% under GAAP. The quarterly increase was due to higher net personnel costs, increased professional services and higher deconversion costs, partially offset by gain on assets versus previous loss on assets for the prior quarter year. The full year increase included all of the previous factors plus higher travel and contract labor costs. We remain committed to generating annual compounding margin expansion. Board delivered 146 basis points increase in non-GAAP margins 23%, resulting in a notable 70 basis points non-GAAP margin of 23% through the full year. Non-GAAP margin benefited from a continuing focus on cost management and leveraging an existing workforce.\nFor the year, headcount increased a net 72 position or 1%. For the last 5 years, excluding the Bay rails acquisition, we've added less than 1% annually during the continued ditto efficiency. These strong quarterly results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.75, up 26%. Fiscal '25 fully diluted EPS was $6.24, up 19%, benefiting from strong operational results and a higher deconversion activity. Breaking down results into the 3 operating segments, we're pleased to see constant performance across the board for both the quarter and the full year. Our core non-GAAP segment revenue increased 7% for the quarter with operating margin increasing a robust 274 basis points. We continue to gain benefits from private cloud trends and disciplined cost management. Full year non-GAAP core segment revenue growth was 6% and the associated margin increased 113 basis points.\nPayments non-GAAP segment quarterly revenue increased 6% this segment, again, had strong non-GAAP operating margin growth of 99 basis points. Full year non-GAAP revenue growth was 6% with non-GAAP margin expansion of 109 basis points. Revenue growth was due to the continued growth in our card related services, EPS and a large percent growth on data payment, granted on a smaller dollar amount. Margins benefited from operational efficiencies and disciplined cost management. Finally, complementary segment non-GAAP quarterly revenue increased an impressive 11% and with 155 basis points of margin expansion. Fiscal year non-GAAP revenue and margins strongly increased 9% and 170 basis points, respectively. Both quarterly and full year revenue growth continued to reflect digital volition demand, beneficial product mix sales, sources from both core print and noncore financial institutions.\nNow a review of cash flow and capital allocation. Fiscal '25 operating cash flow was a record $642 million, a $73 million increase over the prior fiscal year. Excluding proceeds from sale of assets in both fiscal years, free cash flow was $410 million, significantly more than a $336 million the last year. Full year free cash flow was positively impacted by timing of certain contract payments and tax payments unrelated to recent tax legislative changes. Free cash flow conversion was an impressive 90%, and I will provide more details when discussing the full year price. Our consistent dedication to value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 22%. Additionally, I would highlight other notable return of capital metrics for the year, including 35 million share repurchases, more than offsetting annual dilution, $150 million in debt reduction and $165 million in dividends.\nWe're pleased to announce 0 debt at fiscal year-end, providing us with maximum flexibility for future capital deployment. For modeling purposes, our amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was $6 million for the fiscal quarter. Heading into a new fiscal year, I will conclude with guidance. As you're aware, yesterday's press release included fiscal 2026 earlier GAAP guidance. The conversion guidance will continue to follow the conservative methodology introduced in fiscal '24. Fiscal '26 deconversion revenue guidance is $16 million. And as we inform more TV during the year, we will update the quarter ale. For the Full year GAAP revenue growth guidance is 4.2% to 5.4%. This is understated due to the conservative deconversion revenue guidance. Non-GAAP revenue growth guidance is 5.8% to 7%. [indiscernible] on the above revenue growth and are predominantly SaaS like operations, we expect to again generate sustainable, accretive sources of margin. We are guiding for the third year in a row to annual non-GAAP marketing expansion of 20 to 40 basis points.\nAll of the above are indicative that our business operations remain healthy and consistent. The full year GAAP tax rate estimate for fiscal 2016 is 23.75%. The above guidance metrics resulted in a full year outlook for GAAP EPS of $6.32 to $6.44 per share, a growth of 1% to 3%. We -- as a reminder, due to the conservative deconversion the new guidance at the beginning of the year, GAAP EPS growth is understated as a result. Fiscal '26 is expected to have a strong free cash flow conversion due to recently case legislation. Highlights of the tax legislation includes sole expensing of R&D costs on Section 174, and bonus tax depreciation will have a meaningfully positive impact. We will be making an election in the coming months on how we will implement the tax law changes, resulting in 1 of the following 2 scenarios. We could see a more significant impact in fiscal 2016 with limited nonrecurring impact in fiscal '27 or we could elect to take the debit spread gross the fiscal year '26 and '27.\nOverall, this legislation will allow for free cash flow conversion of approximately 85% to 100% in future years. Our current view has the cadence of fiscal 26 non-GAAP revenue being strongest in Q1, lower in Q2 and increasing on a reported basis for quarter 3 and 4. Our Annual Customer Conference, [indiscernible] will be held in Q1 this year, partially during higher revenue during that quarter and the lower performance in Q2. Absent the timing switch of this revenue growth in quarters 1 and 2, would result in the first 3 quarters showing similar growth in Q4, showing moderate sequential increase. Our Jack Henry conference will revert back to Q2 in fiscal 2017 and stay in that quarter for several years, ending this occasional timing mismatch. Consequentially, estimation for non-GAAP revenue growth is approximately 7% to 7.5%. As a reminder, we see fluctuations in quarterly results relating to software usage license components along with the timing of implementation.\nTherefore, the correct regards indicator of our business is a consistently strong fiscal year financial results. In conclusion, Q4 and full year results reflect solid performance in meeting or exceeding provided guidance. We enter fiscal 2016 with positive momentum and high expectations to deliver on our full year guidance target. Demand through our solutions and the fiscal strength of our clients remain strong, which we expect to drive superior shareholder value. We appreciate the contributions of our dedicated associates that achieved these strong results and our investors for their ongoing confidence. Jamie, please open the line for questions."

Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vance Sherard, the Vice President. Thank you and over to you.\n\nVance Sherard\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Myron. Good morning and thank you for joining the Jack Henry Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Greg Adelson, President and CEO; and Mimi Carsley, CFO and Treasurer. Following my opening remarks, Greg will share his insights and observations on our quarter and year-to-date financial results, operational metrics and outlook. Mimi will then discuss the financial results provided in yesterday's press release, which is available in the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website. Afterwards, we will open the lines for a Q&A session.\nPlease note that this call includes forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. The company is not obligated to update or revise these statements. For a summary of risk factors and additional information that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements, refer to yesterday's press release and the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements sections in our 10-K.\nDuring this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures such as non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. Reconciliations for these measures are included in yesterday's press release.\nNow I will turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory R. Adelson\n\nCOO, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThank you, Vance. Good morning and I appreciate each of you joining the call. I'd like to begin by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication to our success, consistently going above and beyond and taking care of our clients. Our commitment to people-first culture, service excellence, technology innovation and a clear strategy backed by consistent execution continues to differentiate us in the market. I will share 3 main takeaways from the quarter, and then we'll provide additional detail about our overall business.\nFirst, our financial performance. Our third quarter fiscal year 2025 results reflect solid overall performance. Our non-GAAP revenue increased 7% and non-GAAP operating margin was 23%, representing an impressive 207 basis points of margin expansion over last year. In terms of GAAP revenue, we are starting to see an increase in M&A activity, and our Q3 deconversion revenue was $9.6 million. We expect a continuation of increased deconversion revenue in Q4. Thus, we are forecasting a full year deconversion revenue range of $22 million to $28 million.\nSecond, our fiscal '25 guidance. As you saw in the press release and with 3 quarters now closed, we adjusted our full year guidance for GAAP and non-GAAP revenue, margin expansion and EPS. Despite revenue guidance revisions, our primary or key revenue consists mostly of processing and cloud with 76% of total revenue for the quarter and grew at 9.8% versus a growth rate of 8.8% for Q3 fiscal year '24. The adjusted non-GAAP revenue guidance is primarily due to macroeconomic concerns and the softening of nonstrategic revenue such as hardware purchases and consulting engagements.\nAs most of you know, hardware is sold to our in-house processing clients at a time they desire to add or replace equipment. Similar to hardware purchases, we are seeing some customers delay the start of signed nonrecurring projects. Examples include of work orders and the implementation of post-core conversion products in our complementary and payment segments.\nWe are also seeing some softening in debit card transactions, which is similar to what the card associations experienced in their U.S. debit businesses. Based on these factors and what we have seen through April, we felt it was necessary to lower our revenue guidance. However, due to our key revenue growth and higher incremental margins as well as our disciplined approach to expense management, project prioritization and capital expenditures, we have increased our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance on margin expansion and EPS growth. Mimi will provide more details in her comments.\nThird, we are continuing to win larger competitive core deals. Over the past 2 years, the aggregate assets of competitive new core takeaways have more than doubled. This is important to note since our core revenue models include asset-based and per account pricing options, both benefiting from larger institution wins. To date, this fiscal year, we have secured 28 new core wins, including 11 in Q3 with financial institutions totaling $30 billion in assets. This compares to 35 core transactions totaling $21 billion in assets at this time last year and 31 core deals totaling $14 billion in assets 2 years ago.\nOur core and total pipeline remain very strong, and we will see a significant increase in competitive core wins in Q4 over the previous 3 quarters. We can expect a win total similar to what we did in Q4 last year, and again, with larger asset financial institutions.\nIn addition to core wins, we are seeing a similar trend in migrations of existing customers for in-house processing to our private cloud. This fiscal year-to-date, we have contracted to migrate 26 clients, including 7 in Q3 that totaled $42 billion in assets. That compares to 29 clients with $27 billion in assets at this time of last year, representing a 55% increase in assets. We currently have 76% of our clients processing in the Jack Henry private cloud environment.\nOur success with new core wins and migration aligns well with the core platform survey results published by the American Bankers Association in February. For the first time, the ABA named the core providers. Previously, they used generic labels like company A, B and C. The title of the report is All Core Platform Providers Are Not The Same, and we wholeheartedly agree. Jack Henry scored near the top across multiple categories. And when the respondents were asked what matters most in a core provider, innovation and customer service top the list, definitely 2 key differentiators for Jack Henry.\nTurning to specific product and strategy updates. I will comment on the payments and complementary segments, followed by providing updates on technology modernization, our new SMB solutions and our annual benchmark survey results. In our payments segment, we continue to see strong growth with our faster payment solutions. Over the past year, we've grown the number of FIs using Zelle by 10%, The Clearing House's RTP network by 37% and FedNow by 96%. We now have 354 clients on the Zelle platform, representing 14% of FIs using Zelle; 384 clients on RTP, representing 43% of FIs using RTP; and 370 clients on FedNow, representing 26% of FIs using FedNow.\nIn our complementary segment, 32 contracts were in the quarter for Financial Crimes Defender, or FCD, Faster Payment Fraud Module, a real-time solution designed to mitigate fraud in Zelle RTP and FedNow transactions. As of the end of March, we have installed 115 Financial Crimes Defender customers and have another 83 in various stages of implementation. We also have 69 Faster Payment modules installed at 160 in various stages of implementation.\nOur Banno Digital Platform continues to experience healthy growth with 29 new Banno Platform contracts in the quarter. At the end of March, we had more than 1,000 Banno Platform clients, including 270 live with Banno Business. We finished the quarter with more than 13.7 million registered users on the Banno Platform. At the end of Q3 last year, we had 11.6 million registered users, an 18% increase over the past 12 months.\nRegarding our technology modernization, we continue to execute very well and ahead of schedule on our core strategy for the new public cloud-native Jack Henry Platform. We are now live in various stages with 15 components. Some of these are only used internally to eliminate duplication of development costs across the company, but most are utilized by our clients and are getting favorable reviews. As a result of the efforts of our development teams, we remain on track to deliver our public cloud-native consumer and commercial deposit-only core in the first half of calendar year 2026, which will be about 6 months ahead of what we communicated in February of 2022.\nAnother example of our technology modernization progress is our new enterprise deposit and loan account opening solution. This technology enables banks and credit unions to grow loans and deposits by streamlining processes, automating workflows and better serving retail and business clients through a single digital deposit and loan account opening experience. We have initiated our closed beta process with 2 clients, and we'll continue to add more early adopter clients over the coming months.\nAnother area of focus that the industry is excited about is our medium-sized business strategy. A key aspect of our strategy is to only provide the service directly to financial institutions, allowing them to recapture high-value deposits and service the needs of their account holders. Our initial offering called Jack Henry Rapid Transfers is in closed beta with 3 clients. We are currently extending availability to all Banno customers and actively enrolling clients through our digital operations team.\nJack Henry Rapid Transfers enables both SMBs and consumers to instantly move funds between external accounts, eligible cards and digital wallets. We are collaborating with both Visa and MasterCard to facilitate these transactions through their respective debit rails.\nThe second offering is our unique merchant acquiring solution in partnership with Moov. This solution delivers many distinguishing features for merchants, including instant decisioning, tap-to-pay for both iOS and Android devices, the option to receive settlement funds up to 8x per day and continuous account reconciliation to the accounting platform of their choice. We are on track for a closed beta in June with 2 Banno clients. We are also currently working on several additional phases to our SMB strategy as we expect to continue to deliver new functionality and solutions over the next 18 to 24 months to both Jack Henry and non-Jack Henry core institutions.\nWe recently released our seventh annual 2025 Strategy Benchmark Survey. While we track many industry surveys, this one stands out because it reflects insights directly from the CEOs of our own bank and credit union clients. The survey indicated that 76% of our bank and credit union clients plan to increase technology spending over the next 2 years. Of those, the largest segment, 33%, plans to increase investments between 6% and 10%.\nWe also asked where they expect to invest over the next 2 years. The top 3 areas identified were digital banking fraud prevention and enhancing efficiency through automation, all areas where Jack Henry has been investing and executing with innovative solutions such as the Banno Platform, Financial Crimes Defender and the digital positive loan account opening solution that I mentioned earlier. It's worth noting that the survey was conducted in January and February prior to April's market volatility.\nHowever, we did spend a significant amount of time speaking with our clients about the current environment at our Strategic Insights event last week in Minneapolis. Much of what we learned in the survey still holds true for them today. Banks and credit unions are generally concerned about the impact of tariffs on their commercial clients, especially SMBs. They remain optimistic overall and see expected regulatory relief as a positive as well. Our clients continue to suggest that M&A activity is picking up, and we are also seeing an increase in our clients making acquisitions, which presents additional revenue opportunities in the future.\nIn closing, we remain excited and confident that our unwavering approach to culture, service, innovation, strategy and execution will continue to enable Jack Henry to drive industry-leading revenue growth and margin expansion through this evolving macro environment. We have a robust sales pipeline and a proven ability to attract and win deals, especially with larger financial institutions. We will continue to evaluate acquisitions that will accelerate or complement our strategy, remain disciplined in our expense management and continue to rationalize products that fall in our nonkey revenue segment. In short, we remain well positioned for the future.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mimi for more detail on the financials.\n\nMimi L. Carsley\n\nCFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I want to open by thanking the dedicated Jack Henry team for their steadfast focus on execution and support of our clients. While the quarter results differed modestly from our fiscal year expectations, it was another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. I will discuss the details behind our third quarter and year-to-date results then conclude with commentary on our updated fiscal '25 guidance.\nQ3 GAAP and non-GAAP revenue increased 9% and 7%, respectively, with GAAP revenue outperformance driven by notable uptick in deconversion revenue. Despite strong performance in previously identified key areas, overall non-GAAP revenue growth was tempered by lower nonkey revenue growth, especially from a slowdown in hardware sales and nonreoccurring revenue from customer projects. Excluding hardware impact, Q3 non-GAAP revenue growth would have been 8%.\nQuarterly deconversion revenue of approximately $9.6 million, which we released prior to our full earnings, increased $8.8 million compared to the same period last year, reflecting an accelerating pace of consolidation in the industry. In light of year-to-date results and fourth quarter pending agreements, we have raised our full year deconversion guidance to a range of $22 million to $28 million. Financial institution M&A activity will have minimal non-GAAP impact in fiscal '25 but potential for a meaningful impact in fiscal '26.\nNow looking closer to the quarterly results. In the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP services and support revenue increased 8% and 6%, respectively. Data processing and hosting continue to dominate services and support growth for the quarter and year-to-date. Hardware revenue was down $4 million in the quarter and $11 million year-to-date, creating headwinds for services and support revenue. As a reminder, hardware revenue is both nonreoccurring and low visibility, making it a part of nonkey revenue.\nOur private and public cloud offering increased 11% in the quarter, reflecting strong persistent new installs, an existing FI growth trend. This reoccurring revenue growth contributor is 33% of our total revenue and continues to be a double-digit growth engine.\nMoving to complementary revenue, which is 43% quarterly revenue and a significant contributor to our long-term growth model. We saw strong performance with 9% growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter. Continuing long-term trends quarterly drivers include increased card, digital and payment processing revenues.\nCompleting commentary on revenue, I would highlight quarterly total reoccurring revenue, excluding deconversion revenue, was 92%. We focus on key revenue, which is comprised of our strategic reoccurring revenues. Nonkey revenue includes lower-growth and merchant solutions that are typically nonreoccurring or not aligned to our future strategic direction yet often support existing operations.\nQuarterly key revenue was 78% of total non-GAAP revenue and grew a robust 10%. The year-to-date key revenue was 75% of total non-GAAP revenues with continued momentum, producing healthy growth of 9%. Quarterly nonkey revenue makes up the remaining non-GAAP revenue during the quarter and year-to-date has contracted 2%, creating a headwind to total growth.\nSo Jack Henry is not immune to the broader macroeconomic challenges. The high reoccurring revenue, long-term contracts and critical functionality of our products ensure the resiliency of our business model. We are well positioned regardless of economic conditions.\nNext, moving to expenses. Starting with cost of revenue, which increased 4% on a GAAP basis and 3% on a non-GAAP basis during the quarter. The quarterly increase was due to higher direct costs, internal licenses and fees, which partly offset by an increase in labor cost deferrals. For clarification and to assist with model, the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was $6 million in the quarter.\nNext, R&D expense increased 9% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter. The quarterly increase was primarily related to nonpersonnel costs -- sorry, net personnel costs. Ending with SG&A expense, it increased 7% for the quarter on a GAAP basis and 5% on a non-GAAP basis is also related to an increase in net personnel costs. We remain focused on prioritization, cost efficiencies and effective utilization of our workforce that will result in annually compounding margin expansion.\nWe are pleased to report that the quarter delivered 207 basis points increase in non-GAAP margin to 23%. We remain confident in our ability to deliver margin expansion and have increased the full year guide. These solid quarterly operating results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.52, up 28%.\nReviewing the 3 operating segments. We are pleased with core segment key revenue performance, monitoring payments for consumer sentiment impacts and continue to benefit from strong complementary performance. Core segment increased 6% for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis due to the headwinds from the license and credit union hardware that rolls up into this segment. On a key basis, the segment revenue grew 11%, a 10 basis point increase over the prior period. Core segment performance primarily came from organic growth in data processing and hosting, partly offset by lower maintenance fee revenue and credit union-related hardware, the result of our core clients continuing to shift from on-prem to private cloud.\nNon-GAAP segment income margin for core increased 141 basis points from improved operating leverage. Payments segment non-GAAP quarterly revenue increased 7% and saw a non-GAAP segment income margin growth of 59 basis points. Performance was due to continued higher card revenue for volumes, increased payment processing revenue, including FedNow, RTP, Zelle and elevated EPS. Margins in the payments segment also benefited from ongoing improvement to operating leverage.\nFinally, complementary segment quarterly non-GAAP revenue increased 10% from strong product mix with digital and hosting revenues driving growth momentum. Segment margins strongly expanded 164 basis points from the high incremental margin of reoccurring revenue and SaaS-like nature of our business model.\nNow let's turn to a review of cash flow and capital allocation. Third quarter operating cash flow was $108 million, a $10 million increase over the prior period -- year's period. Strong cash flow reflects higher profitability from operations and increased deconversion revenue, partly offset by higher tax payments.\nTrailing 12-month free cash flow was a hearty $303 million, resulting in a 71% conversion, in line with the full year guidance range. Our dedication to value creation resulted in a 12 -- trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 20%. This is a nice improvement, and we expect to see this increase returning to historic levels in the near future.\nFor the quarter, we repurchased $18 million of Jack Henry shares, aligned with our constructive outlook for future Jack Henry growth. As we move towards the close of fiscal '25, I will conclude with comments on full year guidance and other operating metrics.\nYesterday's press release included adjusted fiscal 2025 full year GAAP guidance along with a reconciliation to our adjusted non-GAAP guidance metric. While the press release also included a fiscal '25 non-GAAP EPS metric, this is not intended to be a new guidance metric. The purpose is to provide additional clarity on our numbers, and it should be noted that a 24% tax rate is used.\nGiven the current dynamic macroeconomic environment, including early signs of softness of consumer-related payments, we are adopting a more cautious stance for the remainder of the fiscal year. Updated full year guidance metric and outlook include full year deconversion revenue of $22 million to $28 million, up from $16 million; non-GAAP revenue growth of 6% to 6.5%, lowered from 7% to 8%; non-GAAP margin expansion of 60 to 70 basis points increased from 25 to 40; a tax rate of 23% decreased from 24%; GAAP EPS of $6 to $6.09, up from $5.78 to $5.87, representing annual growth of 15% to 17%; outlook for free -- full year free cash flow conversion is unchanged at 65% to 75%; and outlook for full year return on invested capital is 21% to 22% based on expected lower debt at the end of the fiscal year. The appropriate performance indicator for our business continues to be the full fiscal year financial results.\nIn conclusion, we are seeing modest headwinds to nonkey revenue items that impact our consolidated results and near-term outlook. Still, we remain confident as the key parts of our business continue to perform strongly and position us for continued growth. Our focus remains on delivering long-term profitable growth at scale through compounding revenue growth and margin expansion. In pursuing these goals, we appreciate the achievement of our approximately 7,200 dedicated associates and our investors for their ongoing confidence.\nMyron, please open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Vance Sherard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nVance Sherard\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Michael. Good morning, and thank you for joining the Jack Henry second quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call. Today, I am joined by President and CEO, Greg Adelson; and CFO and Treasurer, Mimi Carsley.\nFollowing my opening remarks, Greg will share his insights on the first half of our fiscal year and provide observations on our financial results, operational metrics and outlook. Mimi will then discuss the financial results in yesterday's press release which is available in the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website. Afterwards, we will open the lines for a Q&A session.\nPlease note that this call includes forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. The company is not obligated to update or revise these statements. For a summary of risk factors and additional information that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements, refer to yesterday's press release and the risk factors and forward-looking statements in our 10-K.\nDuring this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures such as non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. Reconciliations for these measures are included in yesterday's press release.\nNow I will hand the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory R. Adelson\n\nCOO, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThank you, Vance. Good morning, and I appreciate each of you joining this morning's call.\nI'm pleased to report overall solid financial performance results in the second quarter of our fiscal year 2025. I'd like to begin by thanking our associates for their hard work and commitment to our success by doing whatever it takes in doing the right thing for our clients. Our focus on a people-first culture, service excellence, technology innovation and a well-defined strategy supported by consistent execution continues to set us apart in the market.\nI will share 3 main takeaways from the quarter, and then we'll provide additional detail about our overall business. First, our financial performance. We exceeded our second quarter outlook. We had non-GAAP revenue growth of 6.1% in Q2, slightly ahead of the 6% anticipated on the November call. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 21.5% was also slightly better than expected. We continue to expect results in the second half of our fiscal year that are consistent with full year guidance provided in August.\nSecond, our sales performance. After record sales attainment in Q1, we continued our positive momentum by setting a sales record in Q2 for the second consecutive year. During the quarter, we had 11 competitive core wins. And of the 11, 3 were financial institutions over $1 billion in assets, including $17.5 billion asset win. We also closed 13 deals to move existing clients from in-house processing to our private cloud.\nThird, and may be as impressive as anything this quarter, was our success with client renewals. We typically don't spend much time talking about renewals on these calls, but I am making an exception this quarter because of the volume and size of our renewals. In Q2, we closed 28 core renewals, bringing our total for the fiscal year to 46. That is up 21% over the first 6 months of last year. Among those renewals are multiple banks with over $10 billion in assets including a $17 billion bank that provided the termination notice several years ago but never deconverted to our competitor. They recently determined that the best choice for their go-forward technology strategy is Jack Henry and resigned for 7 years, as well as move from in-house to outsource processing.\nWe also resigned our third largest bank and won several mergers of equals that brought us 2 more banks between $10 billion and $20 billion in assets. This success reflects clients' continued confidence in Jack Henry, our service quality and our ability to deliver innovation that helps our clients grow and meet the evolving needs of their account holders. Our core retention rate, excluding M&A, remains over 99%.\nNow for more detail on our overall business, starting with some recognition for the team. We are pleased that, for the seventh consecutive year, our Symitar core platform ranked as the largest platform for credit unions and Callahan's annual ranking. Symitar also remains the most utilized core service platform for credit unions with over $1 billion in assets with nearly 50% of the total market share.\nIn addition, we are proud to recently received 2 prestigious national workplace awards. Forbes' Most Trusted Companies in America and Newsweek's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity. These honors reaffirm our steadfast commitment to doing the right thing for both our employees and our clients.\nNow turning to specific products on our technology modernization progress. In our Payments segment, we signed 14 new debit processing clients and 2 new credit clients in the quarter. We now have 338 clients on the Zelle platform, 357 clients using RTP, representing about 42% of the live RTP clients, and 339 clients using FedNow, representing approximately 28% of the live FedNow clients.\nIn our Complementary segment, we signed 17 new Financial Crimes Defender contracts in the quarter. In addition, we signed 30 new contracts for the Financial Crimes Defender Faster Payment Fraud module, a real-time solution designed to help mitigate fraud in Zelle, FedNow and RTP transactions.\nAs of the end of December, we have installed 104 Financial Crimes Defender customers and have another 80 in various stages of implementation. We also have 54 faster payment modules installed and 162 in various stages of implementation.\nOur Banno digital platform continues to see very nice growth through competitive wins. For the quarter, we signed 18 new clients to the Banno retail platform as well as 33 new Banno business deals. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly 1,000 Banno retail clients, including 212 live with Banno Business.\nWe finished the quarter with 13.2 million registered users on the Banno platform. At the end of Q2 last year, we had 11 million registered users, a 20% increase over the past 12 months.\nOn Monday, we posted a press release and an update on our SMB strategy. We collaborated with Visa to provide Visa Direct through Jack Henry Rapid Transfers, which is the first phase of our partnership with Move. Visa Direct will enable the delivery of funds to eligible cards, bank accounts and digital wallets. For example, in individuals -- individuals and SMBs can make real-time transfers between linked external accounts to cover same-day transaction needs.\nIn parallel, we are working with Mastercard to facilitate similar transactions using Mastercard Send, part of the Mastercard Move platform. We will begin testing Jack Henry Rapid Transfers with a small number of clients later this month. The Rapid Transfer service will be closely followed by our unique merchant acquiring solution with Move. We are on track to deliver that solution to Banno early adopter clients in May 2025. It will be provided exclusively through financial institutions and will include key features for the merchant. Instant decisioning, tap-to-pay for both iOS and Android devices, option to receive settlement funds up to 8x per day and continuous account reconciliation to the accounting solution of their choice.\nTogether with Move, we will enable banks and credit unions to offer innovative digital payment solutions, attract and deepen relationships, and grow deposits, which remains a top priority.\nI know we have talked a lot on these calls about our technology modernization strategy and the development of our cloud-native API first Jack Henry platform. It's important to point out that none of the work with modern fintechs like Move or the integration of services such as Visa Direct would be possible without the cloud-native infrastructure we have built over the past several years.\nWe continue to execute very well on the Jack Henry platform. We are live with domestic wires, international wires, data broker, which serves as our centralized data hub for reporting and analysis, and entitlements, which manages permissions and access rights for users and systems. We are in beta testing with both exception processing and general ledger. We remain on track to deliver the retail and commercial deposit core functionality of the Jack Henry platform in the first half of calendar year 2026.\nSome of you may have seen Cornerstone's annual survey of bank and credit union executives published in late January. According to that study, 73% of banks and 79% of credit unions expect to increase their technology spending in 2025. This correlates with information we've seen from other sources, including an American Banker survey fielded last fall in which 83% of the respondents said they plan to increase their technology spending in 2025.\nWe are in the midst of conducting the annual Jack Henry strategy benchmark study with our clients and we'll share those results on our May earnings call.\nIn closing, we are laser-focused on second half performance and remain optimistic about our full fiscal year outlook. The demand environment, our sales pipeline and the competitive wins we have seen this year provide confidence for the future. Our customer and prospect conversations continue to validate that Jack Henry's key differentiation -- sorry, key differentiators of culture, service, innovation, strategy and execution have positioned us well for future success.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mimi for more detail on the financials.\n\nMimi L. Carsley\n\nCFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. The Jack Henry team's continued focus on execution and supporting our community and regional financial institution clients resulted in another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. I will discuss the details behind our second quarter and year-to-date results, then conclude with commentary on our fiscal '25 guidance.\nQ2 GAAP and non-GAAP revenue increased 5% and 6%, respectively, consistent with our expectations and providing the base for achieving our full year guidance. Quarterly deconversion revenue of approximately $100,000, which we released prior to full earnings, was down $5 million compared to the same period last year, reflecting minimal consolidation of our clients.\nWe remain confident in our $16 million full year guidance. While we see indicators for increasing industry consolidation, this activity will have minimal impact in fiscal '25, but potential for greater impact in fiscal '26.\nNow taking a look -- a closer look at the details. In the quarter and for the year, GAAP and non-GAAP services and support revenue increased 4% to 5%, respectively. Data processing and hosting continued to dominate services and support revenue growth for both the quarter and year-to-date. Hardware revenue was down $2 million for the quarter and $7 million year-to-date, creating headwinds for services and support revenue.\nAs a reminder, hardware revenue is both nonrecurring and low visibility.\nOur private and public cloud offerings increased 11% in the quarter and year-to-date, reflecting strong persisting growth trends. This reoccurring revenue contributor is 33% of our total revenue and continues to be a key double-digit growth engine.\nMoving to processing revenue, which is 44% of total quarterly revenue and is another significant contributor to our long-term growth model. We saw a strong performance with 7% growth on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and year-to-date. Continuing long-term trends, quarterly and year-to-date drivers include increased card, digital and payments processing revenue.\nConcluding my commentary on revenue, I would highlight quarterly total reoccurring revenue, excluding deconversion revenue, was 92%. If we focus on key revenue, a non-GAAP measure, key revenues comprised of our cloud and processing revenue. Nonfee revenue includes product delivery support, on-premise annual maintenance and other revenue. Quarterly key revenue was 70% -- 76% of total revenue and grew at 9%. For year-to-date, key revenue was 74% of total revenue, growing at 9%. Excluding hardware, quarterly non-key revenue decreased 1%, while year-to-date it increased 1%.\nNext, moving to expenses. Starting with cost of revenue, which increased 4% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter. The quarterly increase was due to higher direct costs and increased personnel costs. For clarification and to assist with models, the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was $6 million in the quarter.\nNext, R&D expense increased 16% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter. The quarterly increase was primarily related to personnel costs.\nAnd ending with SG&A expense, it increased 9% for the quarter on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. This is also related to increase in net personnel costs.\nWe remain focused on generating annually compounding margin expansion. The quarter delivered 25 basis points increase in non-GAAP margins, 22%, and this offsets the year-to-date to a 34 basis point decrease in non-GAAP margin to 23%. We remain confident in our ability to deliver margin expansion in line with our full year guide.\nThese all-in quarterly operating results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.34, up 6%.\nReviewing the 3 operating segments, we're pleased by both positive top and bottom line performance across the board. Core segment revenue increased 6% for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis against a tough comp. Performance primarily came from organic growth in data processing and hosting, partly offset by lower software usage revenue and lower maintenance fees, the result of our Core customers continuing to shift from on-premise to private cloud. Non-GAAP operating margin for the Core segment increased 139 basis points from improved operating leverage.\nPayments segment quarterly revenue increased 6% on a non-GAAP basis. The segment had impressive non-GAAP operating margin growth of 177 basis points. Performance was due to continued higher card revenue from volumes, increased payment processing revenues including FedNow, RTP, Zelle and elevated EPS payments. Margins in the Payments segment also benefited from ongoing improvements to operating leverage.\nAnd finally, Complementary segment quarterly non-GAAP revenue increased 6% from strong product mix, with hosting and digital driving consistent growth. Segment margin expanded 207 basis points.\nNow let's turn to a review of cash flow and capital allocation. Second quarter operating cash flow was $90 million, an $8 million increase over the prior year period. Strong cash flow reflected a higher profitability, increased receivables collections, lower prepaid, partly offset by tax payments.\nTrailing 12-month free cash flow was $296 million, resulting in a 73% conversion, in line with full year guidance range. Our dedication to value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 20%.\nAnd for the quarter, we repurchased $17 million of Jack Henry shares, aligned with our intent to offset dilution from stock comp.\nAs we move into the back half of fiscal '25, I will conclude with comments on full year guidance metrics. Yesterday's press release included fiscal 2025 full year GAAP guidance along with a reconciliation to our non-GAAP guidance metrics, all of which we are reiterating. And while the press release also includes a fiscal '25 non-GAAP EPS metrics, this is not intended to be a new guidance metric. The focus is to provide additional player on our numbers, and it should be noted at a 24% tax rate [ if used ].\nAll of the current fiscal year guidance metrics are aligned with our near-term targets as the business operations remain healthy and on track. Our outlook for the financial performance remains positive with continued expectations for a strong second half that will be more pronounced than typical. The appropriate performance indicator for our business is the full fiscal year financial results.\nIn conclusion, the positive first half of fiscal '25 was consistent with our expectations and provides a base for a full year aligned to our stated long-term target. Our focus remains on delivering long-term profitability growth at scale through compounding revenue growth and margin expansion.\nIn pursuing these goals, we appreciate the achievements of our more than 7,200 dedicated associates and our investors for their ongoing confidence.\nMichael, please open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vance Sherard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nVance Sherard\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Drew. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today is President and CEO, Greg Adelson; and Mimi Carsley, CFO and Treasurer.\nAfter my opening remarks, I will turn the call over to Greg for his comments on our fourth quarter results and observations related to our business in the industry. Mimi will then provide commentary around the financial results and fiscal '25 guidance, including the press release issued yesterday that is available from the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website. We will then open the lines for Q&A.\nAs a reminder, this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to multiple factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to multiple risks and uncertainties.\nThe company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements.\nOn this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures are in yesterday's press release.\nI will now turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory R. Adelson\n\nCOO, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThank you, Vance, and hello, everyone. I appreciate all of you joining this morning's call. We are very pleased to report strong sales and financial performance in the fourth quarter and for all of fiscal 2024. I want to especially thank all of our associates for your hard work, dedication and unwavering commitment that significantly contributed to these outstanding results. I will begin with a summary of what I believe are the 3 main takeaways and then provide additional detail on all areas of our business.\nWe produced record revenue and operating income for fiscal '24 with $2.2 billion in revenue and $489.4 million in operating income. Our sales team set an all-time record for sales bookings for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year that included 22 competitive core wins in the quarter and 57 for the fiscal year.\nWe signed 15 new core contracts this fiscal year with financial institutions that have over $1 billion in assets compared to only 5 in fiscal 2023. This was a direct result of our technology modernization strategy and execution, One Jack Henry initiative and several new innovative solutions.\nNow for more detail on each of the takeaways. For the fourth quarter, total revenue increased 5% and increased 6% on a non-GAAP basis. For the fiscal year, total revenue increased 7% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.\nOperating income increased 1% for the quarter and increased 5% on a non-GAAP basis. For the fiscal year, operating income increased 2% and increased 10% on a non-GAAP basis.\nAs I mentioned, the fourth quarter was the highest quarter for sales bookings in the history of the company, and we set a new record for sales bookings for the fiscal year. I am very proud of the remarkable year by our sales team.\nThe 15 core clients signed with over $1 billion in assets also was a new fiscal year record. Of those clients, 10 are banks and 5 are credit unions. Over the past 4 years, we have continued to see an increase in the average asset size of our core clients. Average assets for our bank clients have increased to $1.35 billion, a 27% increase over the past 4 years. Average assets for our credit union clients have increased to $1.27 billion, a 34% increase over the past 4 years.\nIn addition to the 22 competitive core takeaways in the quarter, we re-signed one long-term client with about $6 billion in assets that had provided the termination notice to us a little more than 2 years ago. That client never deconverted to the computing core platform. They've now re-signed with us for multiple years and multiple new solutions. While this contract is not in our new core win numbers, it is noteworthy that they decided their best choice was to stay with Jack Henry for multiple more years.\nFor the quarter, we also signed 15 contracts to move existing in-house core clients to our private cloud environment. We finished fiscal '24 with 44 existing clients agreeing to move to our private cloud. We now host 73% of our core clients in our private cloud.\nSeveral of our complementary and payment solutions also experienced extremely high demand with our digital suite leading the way. For the quarter, we signed 45 new clients to our Banno retail platform as well as 50 new Banno Business deals. For the fiscal year, we closed 179 new Banno retail contracts and 164 new Banno Business contracts.\nBanno continues to experience exceptional growth. We currently have 12.2 million registered Banno users as compared to 3.2 million at the same time in 2020. We have 924 Banno retail clients and of those, 147 are live with Banno Business and another 81 are in various stages of implementation.\nWe also continue to see increasing success with our card processing solution, signing 21 new card processing clients this quarter and 56 for the fiscal year. We received 16 new Financial Crimes Defender contracts in Q4 and 52 for the fiscal year. In addition, we signed [indiscernible] new contracts for the Financial Crimes Defender faster payment fraud module for the quarter and 134 for the fiscal year. This real-time solution is designed to help mitigate fraud in Zelle, FedNow and real-time payment transactions.\nAs of June 30, we had 52 financial crime installations completed and another 115 in various stages of implementation. We also have 22 faster payment modules installed and 154 in various stages of implementation.\nI am asked regularly why I believe we continue to see significantly more new competitive core wins than our competition. While I believe there are many reasons, I've tried to boil it down to 3 primary things.\nFirst, our associates. We have a happy and engaged workforce, and we believe that leads to having a do whatever it takes attitude with our clients. Our associate engagement scores are well above the industry benchmark, and we consistently win best workplace awards each year. We are pleased to recently receive recognition in 3 national publications, U.S. News and World Report's Best Companies to Work For, Time Magazine's Best Midsized Companies and Newsweek's Greatest Workplace.\nSecond, our service quality, which is a direct result of our engaged and dedicated associates. We have long been known for providing exceptional customer service, and this year was no exception.\nIn fiscal year 2024, our client satisfaction score when rating the engagement with a client service representative averaged 4.74 per month on a 5-point scale. On that scale, a meets expectation is 3.0, and extremely satisfied is 5.0. You have to have a lot of 5s to average a 4.74.\nThe third thing is technology innovation. We continue to invest in technology to help our clients remain vibrant financial institutions in the markets they serve. We are executing on our technology modernization strategy while bringing new leading-edge solutions to the market before our competition.\nA couple of final items. We are looking forward to our annual client conference, Jack Henry Connect, in October. This is a great opportunity every year for us to meet with prospects, clients and partners. Last year, 17 of our new core wins were with prospects who attended the conference.\nAs I reflect back on fiscal 2024, I want to again thank Dave Foss for his outstanding leadership as CEO for the past 8 years. I am honored and humbled to take over as CEO and excited along with our entire leadership team about the opportunities ahead.\nWe are executing on our strategy and our [indiscernible] client satisfaction scores are consistently strong. Technology spending by financial institution remains robust, and there's clear demand for our differentiated and innovative technology as validated by our strong quarter and fiscal year. We are very well positioned for future success.\nI look forward to seeing and speaking with many of you at our Investor Day in Dallas on September 5. We have an exciting agenda, and we'll have several of our new business leaders available for a meet and greet as well.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Mimi for more specifics on our financials.\n\nMimi L. Carsley\n\nCFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Our continued focus on serving our community and regional financial institution clients and delivering shareholder value led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. I will start with the details driving our fourth quarter and full year results then conclude with the fiscal '25 guidance.\nQ4 GAAP revenue increased 5%, and non-GAAP revenue increased 6%, a continuation of the consistently solid performance. Full year growth was 7% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.\nFourth quarter deconversion revenue of approximately $7 million, which we pre-released, was down approximately $8 million reflecting [indiscernible] financial institution consolidation of our clients. Full year deconversion revenue was $17 million, $15 million less than the prior year was consistent with guidance.\nNow let's look more closely to detail. GAAP services and support revenue increased 2% while non-GAAP increased 4%. For the year, the increase was a healthy 5% for GAAP and 6% on a non-GAAP basis.\nServices and support growth during the quarter was the result of volume increases in data processing and hosting revenue and consulting revenue, partly offset by decreases in deconversion, implementation and maintenance fee revenue.\nWe continue to experience impressive growth in our private and public cloud offerings, which increased 11% in the quarter, 10% for the year. This recurring revenue contributor is 31% of our total revenue and has long been a key double-digit growth engine.\nGetting to processing revenue, which is 42% of total revenue and another key component of our long-term growth model, we got robust performance with 9% growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and for the year. Consistent with recent results, quarterly drivers included increased cards, digital and payment processing revenue.\nCompleting commentary on revenue, I would highlight the total recurring revenue exceeded 91%. Next, moving to expenses. Beginning with the cost of revenue, which increased 6% on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and 7% for GAAP versus 6% for non-GAAP for fiscal year. Drivers for the quarter included higher direct costs, higher personnel costs and increased internal licenses and fees.\nNext, R&D expense increased 4% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter. The quarterly increase was primarily due to increased consulting and other professional services, net of capitalization and higher cloud consumption cost, net of capitalization. For the year, R&D expense increased 4% on a GAAP basis and 3% for non-GAAP.\nAnd [indiscernible] with SG&A expense for the quarter on a GAAP basis, it increased 6% and [ 13% ] on a non-GAAP basis. The quarter GAAP increase was due to higher personnel costs and increased professional services. The non-GAAP quarterly increase was impacted by the onetime expense from the write-off of capitalized software development related to internal software tools. Without this onetime expense, the quarter increase would have been 8%.\nFull year SG&A expense increased 18% on a GAAP basis and 10% non-GAAP. The primary GAAP impacts were the $16 million in onetime costs related to the voluntary early departure incentive program, VEDIP, and a [indiscernible] period $5 million gain on asset sales. The non-GAAP increase is driven primarily by higher personnel costs.\nWe remain focused on generating compounding margin expansion. While the quarter results delivered 22 basis points decrease in non-GAAP margin's 22%, full year margin expansion was 60 basis points on a non-GAAP margin of 23%. Non-GAAP margin benefited from the focused process improvement and disciplined management of our workforce.\nThese strong quarterly results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.38, up 3%. Fiscal '24 fully diluted EPS was $5.23, up 4%, facing a $0.37 headwind from previously mentioned VEDIP, a gain on asset disposal of prior year and lower deconversion rate.\nBreaking down the results into the 3 operating segments, we are pleased to see positive performance across the board. Our core segment revenue increased 4% for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis against a tough comp. Non-GAAP operating margin increased 171 basis points.\nCore continues to benefit from private cloud trends and strong [indiscernible]. Full year non-GAAP revenue was 7%, and the associated margin increased 135 basis points.\nPayment segment quarterly revenue increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. The segment had impressive non-GAAP operating margin growth of 183 basis points. Revenue growth was due to continuing growth in our EPS business and strong card growth from fraud and card-related services with delivered growth consistent with U.S. consumer spending trends. Margin benefited from focused cost management. And for the full year, non-GAAP revenue growth was 7% with 124 basis points of margin expansion.\nFinally, complementary segment. Quarterly non-GAAP revenue increased 6% with 75 basis points of margin contraction. Margin contraction was due to direct support cost, amortization and licenses and fees.\nFiscal year non-GAAP revenue increased 8% with 2 basis points of margin expansion. Full year growth continued to reflect digital solution demand and beneficial overall product mix.\nNow let's turn to a review of cash flow and capital allocation. Fiscal '24 operating cash flow was $568 million, $186 million increase over the prior period. Excluding proceeds from sale and assets, free cash flow was $336 million, significantly more than $175 million generated last year. Free cash flow conversion was 88%.\nOur commentary entering the year included an elevated level of cash tax payments based on the negative Section 174 impact. Based on legislative clarity and internal efforts, we were able to meaningfully lessen the impact. The net result was lower cash taxes equating to an approximate $29 million overpayment last fiscal year. Our consistent dedication to value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 20%.\nAdditionally, I would highlight other notable return on capital metrics for the year, including 28 million share repurchases more than offsetting annual dilution, $125 million in debt reduction and $156 million in dividend.\nHeading into a new fiscal year, I will conclude with guidance. As you are aware, yesterday's press release included fiscal 2025 full year GAAP guidance along with an enhanced transparency reconciliation to non-GAAP guidance measure.\nWhile the press release also includes a fiscal '25 non-GAAP EPS measure, this is not intended to be a new guidance measure. The purpose is to provide additional clarity on our numbers for example, current acquisition year-over-year comparison.\nAnd it should be noted that a 24% tax rate is used. Deconversion guidance will continue to follow the methodology introduced in fiscal '24. And for fiscal '25, deconversion revenue guidance is $16 million.\nFull year GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance is 7% to 8%. Based on the above revenue growth that generate sustainable accretive sources of [indiscernible], we're guiding to an annual non-GAAP margin expansion of 25 to 40 basis points. All of the above are aligned with our near-term targets as the business operations remain healthy and consistent.\nFull year tax rate estimate for fiscal '25 is 24%. The above guidance metrics results in a full year guidance for GAAP EPS of $5.78 to $5.87 per share, a growth of 11% to 12%.\nFiscal '23 had lower-than-expected free cash flow conversion due to [indiscernible] payment, which resulted in fiscal '24 having a better-than-expected conversion metric. Absent further legislative action, fiscal '25 will be a reversion to the expected trend line resulting from the expiration tax benefits in Section 174.\nAs such, our full year expectation for free cash flow conversion is 65% to 75%. Our current view has cadence of fiscal '25 non-GAAP revenue and margin increasing sequentially throughout the year. This increase in cadence will result in a strong second half that will be more pronounced than typical.\nConsequently, Q1 is expected -- expectation for non-GAAP revenue growth is approximately 5.25% and non-GAAP margin to contract approximately 100 bps. This is due to slower growth rate on on-premise annual maintenance and card processing. An additional factor is several long-term software usage contracts closing in Q1 of the prior year, which delivered significant allocation of license fees in that same quarter. The rest of the year improved strongly with limited risk, resulting in a full year guidance remaining consistent with our near-term target.\nAs a reminder, we see fluctuations in quarterly results relating to software usage license component along with the timing of implementation. Therefore, the correct performance indicator for our business is the consistently strong fiscal year financial results.\nIn conclusion, Q4 and full year results reflect strong performance and achievement of our targeted goals. We enter fiscal '25 with positive momentum and expect to drive impressive revenue growth and margin expansion.\nWe remain exceptionally positive about demand for our solutions and the strength of our clients, resulting in superior shareholder value creation. We appreciate the contributions of our dedicated associates that drove these strong results and our investors for their ongoing confidence.\nDrew, please open the line for questions."

Foss\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThank you, Vance. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin today's call by remembering Jack Henry Board member, Laura Kelly, who passed away unexpectedly on March 15. Laura served on our Board for over a decade and was a cherished colleague and friend to all who had the privilege of working with her. With over 30 years of experience in senior leadership roles, she brought invaluable insights, wisdom and financial expertise to our organization. Beyond her remarkable professional achievements, Laura was known for her kindness, generosity and unwavering dedication to making a positive impact. Our thoughts and deepest condolences go out to John and Jake and the rest of Laura's family during this incredibly difficult time. Let's now transition to our quarterly results.\nWe're very pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue growth and overall business performance. As always, I'd like to thank our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for the quarter. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, total revenue increased by 6% for the quarter and increased 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Operating income increased 3% for the quarter and increased 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Turning to the segments.\nWe again had a strong quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue was up by 7% for the quarter and increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment performed very well, posting a 5% increase in revenue this quarter and a 6% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a solid quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with a 5% increase in revenue this quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis. As I highlighted in the press release, this was our best third quarter ever for sales bookings. During the quarter, we inked 11 competitive core takeaways with one of them being a multibillion-dollar institution.\nFor the year, we've now signed 6 multibillion-dollar institutions topping last year's full year total of 5. Additionally, we signed 7 deals to move existing in-house core clients to our private cloud environment. We are seeing strong interest in our new Financial Crimes Defender solution with 11 new contracts in Q3. Additionally, we signed 45 new contracts for our new Financial Crimes Defender fraud module, for the Zelle, FedNow and RTP payments networks that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect fraud and money laundering in real time. We continue to see success with card processing solution, signing 14 new card processing clients this quarter. Our Banno digital banking platform remains very popular with 69 new signings in Q3 including 37 contracts for Banno business. We now have over 11.6 million users live on Banno and we're continuing to add approximately 200,000 users per month.\nEven is in Q3, we continued to replenish our sales pipeline and keep it near an all-time high. As we look toward the end of our fiscal year, we remain very optimistic about the industry, the demand for our solutions our ability to deliver outstanding service and our long-term prospects for success.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Greg for more detail on our solutions and businesses.\n\nGregory R. Adelson\n\nCOO, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. As some of you have seen, we recently released the 2024 results from our Annual Strategy Benchmark survey. This survey offers insight into concerns, opportunities and technology priorities from bank and credit union CEOs. The survey indicated that 80% of bank and credit union CEOs plan to increase technology spending over the next 2 years. Of those, the largest segment, 35% plan to increase investments between 6% and 10%. We also inquired where they plan to invest over the next 2 years. The top 4 areas for planned investment were fraud detection, digital banking, data analytics and automation, all areas where Jack Henry has been investing and executing with innovative solutions through our technology modernization strategy.\nAs previously announced, we recently launched our cloud-native AI-powered Financial Crimes Defender fraud detection platform. We now have 16 clients live and another 175 clients in the implementation queue. In addition, we announced in March the Financial Crimes Defender was named the best fraud prevention platform by fintech breakthrough, an independent market intelligent organization. Dave mentioned earlier that we have more than 11.6 million registered users on our cloud-native Banno digital banking platform. We continue to see strong interest in our recently launched Banno business solution that provides a modern banking experience for small and medium-sized businesses.\nAs of March 31, we had 124 clients live and about 70 additional clients in various stages of implementation. In terms of data analytics, we continue to make progress on our data broker and executive dashboard solutions. Both are part of the cloud-native API first Jack Henry platform. Data broker, which is currently in beta will eventually provide access to all of a client's Jack Henry data in a single repository with innovative AI intelligence capabilities. To complement the data broker solution, we are developing an executive dashboard with real-time event monitoring to help executives at our financial institutions make informed dynamic decisions throughout the day based on metrics they customize.\nRelated to automation technology, one new Jack Henry platform offering, we haven't spoken much about yet is our cloud-native online deposit and loan account opening solution. This integrated solution will provide a seamless digital account opening experience for our clients that enables them to streamline processes, automate workflows and better serve both retail and commercial loan clients. We plan to begin the beta phase with clients in early calendar year 2025. The survey also found that 96% of our clients plan to add payment services over the next 2 years. We continue to offer a full range of payment solutions in our pay center application as well as other areas of our payment groups.\nAs of March 31, we had 312 clients using Zelle, 275 clients using RTP, the real-time payments network, which represents 48% of the live RTP clients and 190 clients using FedNow, representing 29% of the live FedNow clients. One final point on the survey findings. They were consistent with what we heard from our clients at our Annual Strategic Initiative Symposium in late April. While financial institutions are concerned about the increasing cost of deposits and impact to interest margins, there is a general feeling of optimism and less concerned about an economic slowdown this year versus what we heard a year ago.\nOne topic we spent a lot of time discussing that the strategic initiative Symposium is artificial intelligence. We presented in detail Jack Henry's framework for building the necessary guardrails, education, training, use of acceptable tools, et cetera. We continue to actively identify opportunities to leverage AI, aiming to enhance client solutions and optimize internal process and work streams. Incorporating AI into select lender, data broker, executive dashboard and Banno Conversations is part of that strategy. We are approaching AI deployment thoughtfully, ensuring it benefits our clients and associates and aligns with our commitment to data privacy, protection and security. Our strategy ensures we are responsibly bold and balanced. It's been about 18 months since our corporate rebranding initiative to retire the [ Symitar ], [ ProfitStars ] and Jack Henry banking brands as we now simply go to market as Jack Henry.\nAs we said at that time, uniting the brands reflects Jack Henry's role as a well-rounded financial technology provider and enables us to speak from a single, consistent brand voice, one Jack Henry. We recently received results from an independent brand study that showed that Jack Henry's brand equity has increased by 9 points in just 18 months. We specifically saw significant improvement with large regional financial institutions and millennials. This is important as we continue to execute on our strategy to provide innovative technology solutions to larger financial institutions beyond what we already provide today through both our payment and complementary groups. And millennials are a critical audience because they are taking on larger leadership roles at these financial institutions and having more influence and technology buyer decisions.\nSpeaking of brand equity, Hopefully, you all have seen the new corporate sustainability report that we published on March 29. We believe the 2024 report is an excellent representation of the key initiatives and accomplishments we've been working on over the past year. This year's report details how we are, we're supporting local communities with a focus on financial well and innovative technology in a variety of philanthropic efforts. We also continue to further our commitment to valuing people with disabilities with the launch of a new associate-led business innovation group focused on awareness of visible and invisible disabilities. The report also highlights some of the public Best Places to Work recognition we received from organizations like Newsweek, Computer World and USA Today.\nAs part of our planned organizational changes, we recently announced the promotion of [ Shannon McLaughlin ], who is currently President of Jack Henry Credit Union Solutions to Chief Operating Officer effective July 1. Shannon has been with Jack Henry for 9 years, but has close to 30 years working with both banks and credit unions and senior technology and operational roles. Shannon is a strategic visionary leader who has significantly contributed to our company's overall success, and we'll continue to do so as the next Chief Operating Officer. I want to close by recognizing Dave for the exceptional job he has done as CEO over the past 8 years. Under Dave's leadership, Jack Henry has experienced outstanding growth both organically and through strategic acquisitions. I also want to thank Dave for his mentorship and guidance. He has prepared me well as I step into the CEO role on July 1, and I'm honored to continue leading our company with an unwavering focus on our associates, clients and shareholders.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Mimi for more details on the numbers.\n\nMimi L. Carsley\n\nCFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning. Our continued focus on serving our community and regional financial institution clients, delivering shareholder value led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. I'll start with the details driving our third quarter and year-to-date results, then conclude with our full year guidance update.\nQ3 GAAP revenue increased 6% and non-GAAP revenue increased 7%, a continuation of consistently solid performance and keeping us on track for a strong fiscal 2024. Year-to-date growth was 7% on a GAAP basis and stronger on non-GAAP at 8%. Deconversion revenue of approximately $800,000, which we pre-released last week, was down approximately $5.3 million, reflecting minimal financial institution consolidation of our clients. Year-to-date deconversion revenue is $9.9 million, $7.2 million less than the prior period. Now let's look more closely at the details.\nGAAP services and support revenue increased 4%, while non-GAAP increased a more robust 6%. Year-to-date, the increase was 6% for GAAP and 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Service and support growth during the quarter was the result of increases in data processing and hosting revenues. We continue to experience robust growth in our private and public cloud offerings, which again increased 10% in the quarter and for the year-to-date. This reoccurring revenue contributor is 32% of our total revenue and has long been a key to double-digit growth engine.\nShifting to processing revenue, which is 43% of total revenue and another key component of our long-term growth model. We saw positive performance with 8% growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and year-to-date delivered 9% for both. Consistent with recent results, drivers include positive demand for our digital solutions, card processing, other payment processing and other processing revenues.\nIn closing out revenue commentary, I would like to highlight total recurring revenue exceeded 91%. Next, moving to expenses. Beginning with cost of revenue, which increased 7% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and 7% for GAAP versus 6% for non-GAAP year-to-date. Drivers for the quarter included higher direct costs consistent with increases in related revenue, higher personnel costs and increased internal license and fees. Next, R&D increased 4% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter. The increase is primarily due to cloud consumption costs net of capitalization. For the year-to-date, R&D increased 4% on a GAAP basis and 3% for non-GAAP.\nAnd lastly, on a GAAP basis, SG&A rose 7% for the quarter and 8% on a non-GAAP basis primarily due to higher personnel costs. Year-to-date SG&A expense increased 23% on a GAAP basis and 9% on a non-GAAP basis. The primary GAAP differences are the $16.4 million in onetime related costs related to the voluntary early departure incentive program. [indiscernible] in Q1 and prior period $7.4 million gain on asset sales. For non-GAAP, the difference is primarily due to the higher personnel costs and absence of gain on sale of assets. We remain focused on generating compounding margin expansion and the quarter results delivered 30 basis points of increased non-GAAP margin, which was 20.8%. Non-GAAP margin benefited from focused process improvements and disciplined management of our workforce, while retaining key talent. These strong quarterly results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.19, up 7%.\nSeparating results into the 3 operating segments, we're pleased to see across the board positive performance. Our core segment revenue increased 8% for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis, with non-GAAP operating margins increasing 216 basis points. We continue to benefit from private cloud trends and strong cost control. Year-to-date, non-GAAP revenue growth was 8% and the associated margin increased 124 basis points. Payments segment revenue increased 6% on a non-GAAP basis. The segment had impressive non-GAAP operating margin growth of 121 basis points. This was due to continuing growth in our EPS business, and moderate card growth consistent with U.S. consumer spending trends and a slightly tough comp combined with the focused cost management.\nYear-to-date, non-GAAP revenue growth matched the quarter at 6% with 103 basis points of margin expansion. And finally, complementary segment, non-GAAP revenue increased 8% with 33 basis points of margin expansion. Year-to-date, non-GAAP revenue also increased 8% with 28 basis points of margin expansion. Growth year-to-date reflects digital solution demand and beneficial overall product mix. Segment quarterly margins were impacted by moderate headwinds from direct support costs and license and fees. Let's now turn to a review of cash flow and capital allocation.\nYear-to-date operating cash flow was $336 million, $129 million increase over prior period. Excluding proceeds from the sale of assets, free cash flow was $172 million, significantly more than the $54 million last year. Our base case entering the year included an elevated level of cash tax payments based on the Section 174 impact. Based on legislative clarity and internal efforts, we were able to meaningfully lessen the impact. The net result was lower cash taxes equating to an approximately $29 million overpayment last fiscal year, as well as improved cash tax outlook this fiscal year. Our consistent dedication to share value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 19%. Additionally, I would highlight other notable return on capital metrics for the year-to-date period, including $20 million in share repurchase offsetting annual dilution, $25 million in debt reduction and $116 million in dividends.\nWith 3 quarters of the year complete, we're nearing the conclusion of our fiscal year, and therefore, I'll conclude with guidance changes. As you're aware, yesterday's press release included updated fiscal 2024 full year GAAP guidance along with a reconciliation to non-GAAP metrics. As a reminder, we filed an 8-K on August 3 that described how starting in the current fiscal year, we're using a revised approach for deconversion guidance. While we reported third quarter deconversion revenue of approximately $800,000, we are reiterating our full year deconversion guidance of $16 million. We are reiterating both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue growth and expect non-GAAP growth to potentially have a bias towards the lower end of our [ 7.4 ] to [ 8.0 ] growth range.\nDue to the continued positive operational results and a focus on cost management, we now expect an increase in annual non-GAAP margin expansion of 45 to 50 basis points compared to the 35 to 40 basis points previously provided. The full year tax rate estimate remains at 23.5%. Incorporating the noted positive update, full year guidance for GAAP EPS is revised upward to $5.15 to $5.19 per share from the previous guidance of $5.09 to $5.13 per share. As a reminder, the guidance or deconversion revenue compared to actual fiscal 2023 deconversion revenue [indiscernible], severance-related costs and nonrecurring gain on asset sales results in approximate $0.37 headwind for GAAP EPS for fiscal 2024. Due to the better than initially anticipated cash tax payments, improved margins and contributions from favorable net interest, our full year guidance for free cash flow conversion has increased to 70% to 75% from the previous commentary of 60%.\nIn conclusion, Q3 results reflected continued momentum of the strong execution we've seen thus far this year and we expect a solid finish for the remainder of the fiscal year. We remain exceptionally positive about our ability to deliver innovative and in-demand solutions, the resilience of our clients and our focus on execution and shareholder value creation. We appreciate the contributions of our diligent and dedicated associates that drove these strong results in Jack Henry investors for their continued confidence.\nBefore I turn the call back over to Dave for closing remarks. While I haven't had the pleasure of working with Dave as long as others, I cherished our time together. I want to thank Dave for giving me the opportunity to work for this amazing company for being so incredibly generous with his wisdom and support for so many small and meaningful pieces of guidance over the past 2 years. He is a role model of service, leadership and doing the right thing. We are fortunate to have him lead the Jack Henry Board, and I look forward to this continued journey together. Dave?\n\nDavid B. Foss\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nWell, thank you, Mimi. As you are all undoubtedly aware, this marks my final earnings call as CEO before my transition to Executive Board Chair on July 1. Reflecting on my career at Jack Henry, this has been an incredibly humbling journey for me, both personally and professionally. And I'm beyond grateful to have had the opportunity to lead this great company for the past 8 years.\nAs we move forward, I have the utmost confidence in Greg and the rest of our exceptional team to sustain our reputation for great technology and service as well as our strong financial performance. I've cherished the opportunity to get to know all of you over the years and appreciate your insightful questions and thorough analysis. I thank our investors for their trust in Jack Henry and our clients for allowing us to serve their needs. And lastly, I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to our associates. It is their dedication and unwavering commitment to supporting our clients and each other that drives our success and makes this company special.\nWith that, we'll open up the floor for questions. Alan, if you would, please open the line."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Vance Sherard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nVance Sherard\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today is David Foss, Board Chair and CEO; and Mimi Carsley, CFO and Treasurer; and Greg Adelson, President and COO.\nAfter my opening remarks, I will turn the call over to Dave for his comments on our business and industry outlook. After Dave concludes his comments, Greg will discuss his transition to CEO, provide commentary on our operations, including updates on our technology modernization strategy and other key initiatives at Jack Henry. Mimi will then provide commentary around the financial results and updated guidance included in the press release issued yesterday that is available from the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website. We will then open the lines for Q&A.\nAs a reminder, this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to multiple factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to multiple risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements.\nOn this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures are in yesterday's press release.\nI will now turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid B. Foss\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThank you, Vance. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for the quarter.\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2024, total revenue increased by 8% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Operating income increased 11% for the quarter and increased 14% on a non-GAAP basis.\nTurning to the segments. We again had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue was up by 8% for the quarter on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment also performed well, posting a 6% increase in revenue this quarter on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.\nWe had another strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with a 7% increase in revenue this quarter and a 9% increase on a non-GAAP basis. As I mentioned in the press release, our sales teams again had an outstanding quarter with a number of notable wins. In fact, this was the best second quarter ever for sales bookings and second highest sales quarter in our history, trailing only our June quarter last year.\nIn the second quarter, we inked 14 competitive core takeaways with 4 of them being multibillion-dollar institutions. Additionally, we signed 12 deals to move existing in-house core clients to our private cloud environment. We continue to see success with our card processing solutions, signing 12 new card processing clients this quarter.\nWe also continue to see strong success signing clients to our Banno digital suite with 135 new contracts in Q2, including 56 contracts for our new Banno business offering. We also surpassed 11 million registered users on the Banno platform, which is a 25% increase over a year ago.\nI mentioned last quarter that our sales pipeline was at the highest level ever. It's logical to assume that it would be depleted after such a strong sales quarter in Q2. And However, we continue to add to our pipeline, and we ended the quarter on par with Q1, which projects very well for us for the remainder of the sales year.\nIn late January, Cornerstone Advisors published the results of its annual survey of bank and credit union executives. According to that study, nearly 65% of banks and 75% of credit unions expect to increase their technology spending in 2024.\nThis correlates with information we've seen from other sources, including bank directors technology survey last fall, in which a large majority of survey respondents said their bank's technology budget increased over the past year at a median rate of 10%.\nWe are in the midst of conducting our annual Jack Henry strategic benchmark study and we'll share those results on our earnings call in May. We were pleased to have recently received 2 national workplace awards Newsweek's greatest Workplaces for Diversity and Computer World's Best Places to Work in IT.\nWe also were named as 1 of America's most responsible companies by Newsweek for our corporate sustainability efforts. We are very proud of that recognition because we view corporate sustainability as a strategic investment for our stakeholders. I encourage you to read our 2024 sustainability report which will be published on March 29 on the Investor page at jackhenry.com.\nAs you all know by now, a couple of weeks ago, I will retire from my current role on June 30 of this year. Greg Adelson will become CEO and President beginning July 1, and I will serve as Executive Board Chair effective on that same day. This transition plan has been carefully considered for some time and we are fortunate to have someone like Greg ready to step into the CEO role.\nAs I said in the press release, it has been my immense pleasure to serve as CEO of this wonderful company for so many years. When I came into this role almost 8 years ago, I had a number of large projects I wanted to address, and I'm happy that all of them have now been completed or are well on their way.\nI'm confident that Greg and the outstanding team we have in place today can continue our trajectory of strong growth, and I'm looking forward to working with them in my new role as Executive Board Chair.\nOf course, I'll be on the May earnings call, and I have a number of investor meetings scheduled between now and the end of our fiscal year. So I look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming months.\nAs we focus on the second half of this fiscal year, our sales pipeline is very robust, and we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our clients, our ability to expand client relationships, the spending environment and our long-term prospects for success.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Greg for an operational update.\n\nGregory R. Adelson\n\nCOO, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. I'm honored and humbled to become the next CEO of this great company in July. I do want to take a moment to acknowledge the outstanding job that Dave has done as CEO the past 8 years. Since Dave became CEO at the start of fiscal year 2017, and Jack Henry has experienced outstanding growth with revenue and net income both up approximately 50%.\nIn addition to driving organic growth, Dave has led 26 acquisitions during his 25 years with the company. The legacy Dave is leaving will be remembered for many years to come.\nOn a personal level, I want to thank Dave for his mentorship and guidance for the past 13 years. He has prepared me well for this role, and I will continue to lead this company with an unwavering focus on our employees, clients and shareholders.\nAs the next CEO, I will continue the strategic journey that we are on today and we'll execute our strategic priorities, which include continuing to enhance our exceptional culture continuing to advance our tradition of customer service excellence, cultivate a 1 Jack Henry mindset in all we do, drive technology innovation and execution at the speed and scale foster an open ecosystem, evaluate strategic acquisitions that will provide additional value to our clients and shareholders.\nJack Henry has maintained a philosophy for over 47 years that starts with treating our associates as our first priority. Happy associates are more invested in ensuring we have happy clients and happy clients ensure we reward our shareholders. In short, you can expect continued focus on growing our company and delivering outstanding value to all of our stakeholders.\nDave and I will continue to work closely to ensure a smooth transition in July, and I look forward to collaborating with him in his new role as Executive Board Chair. I'm also excited about continuing to work with the other great leaders at Jack Henry and specifically more closely with Mimi and Vans. Meny has done an outstanding job since becoming CFO in September of 2022, and Vance provides tremendous perspective for all things Jack Henry.\nBefore I speak to our operational performance, I want to go back to Dave's comments regarding our continued strong sales performance. Dave shared our strong success in winning competitive core takeaways as well as our robust sales pipeline.\nAdditionally, we are beginning to see an increase in what has been historic low merger activity among our financial institutions, specifically with our core clients as the acquirers. Due to this increased demand, we are currently adding resources to both our banking and credit union core conversion teams.\nOn the November earnings call, I promised an update on our technology modernization strategy. As a reminder, this strategy is changing how we deliver our solutions through a cloud-native API-first environment, utilizing several key benefits embedded in the Google Cloud platform, including cutting-edge security and business continuity advancements.\nThe premise of this strategy is rebuilding traditional core and noncore functions into a flexible, cloud-native portfolio of services and solutions. Each component will integrate with other Jack Henry solutions and also with third-party fintechs via the Jack Henry platform.\nOur clients will be able to access everything they need to run their financial institution in a single platform with all the advantages that the cloud offers, including extremely high system availability, real-time processing, streamline operations, rapid update, deployment, modern security standards and extensive scalability.\nAs we have indicated previously, our approach to technology modernization has created more pipeline activity in the larger community bank segment as well as a couple of introductory calls with regional institutions.\nAnother benefit we will realize over time is the shared services model that is at the forefront of our technology modernization strategy. Features or solutions that were once built several times throughout the organization are now developed once and use in multiple solutions.\nOur ability to develop and deliver more rapidly to our clients is an important benefit that will reduce development costs for each new or enhanced solution. The technology will allow us to share the same services with outside partners and competitors to create a better overall experience for all community and regional financial institutions.\nAt Jack Henry, we are focused on execution and doing what we say we're going to do. So everything I'm about to discuss is share with our clients through 6-month road map visibility. Road maps are updated for all products, including the technology modernization strategy and published every February and August for our clients to view. We hold our teams accountable for road map execution as well.\nAs a reminder, our technology modernization strategy already includes recently launched cloud-native solutions like PayCenter, Banno Business and Financial Crimes Defender. We now have over 250 clients using the real-time payments network and almost 150 using FedNow in our pay center application. For additional context, Jack Henry has approximately 60% of the live real-time payment clients and 35% of the live FedNow clients.\nWe recently announced general availability for Banno business and continue to add both banking and credit union clients. We now have more than 90 clients live and over 70 clients in various stages of implementation. Financial Crimes Defender is also generally available, and we have 7 clients live in more than 150 in the implementation queue.\nOne new offering we haven't spoken about yet is our open banking solution that provides turnkey API access to the largest integrated banking data aggregators across the industry is an immediate answer to the industry and regulatory pressure to remove screen scraping and share credentials.\nBy creating direct API connections with clients, Jack Henry is making it easier for consumers to connect financial accounts securely and reliably without the need to share user names and passwords. This offering is generally available today and has received a great deal of interest from both Jack Henry core and noncore clients.\nI also want to update you on some of the key functions we are building on the Jack Henry platform that are already in beta or planned to go in beta in calendar year 2024. I'll start with the incoming and outgoing wires, which we have talked about on previous calls.\nWe plan to be generally available with our domestic wire solution over the next few months and move into beta with international wires by the end of this fiscal year. We are building a general ledger component that will support the common base functions of a financial institution's back office and enable deeper insights on transactions and advanced fraud detection. We plan to be in beta by the end of the calendar year.\nA key advantage of the Jack Henry platform is our clients being able to easily access their data. Our new data broker solution, which is currently in beta, will enable clients to access all of their Jack Henry data in a single repository with innovative AI intelligence capabilities.\nTo complement the data broker solution, we are creating an executive dashboard with real-time event monitoring to help our C-suite clients make informed dynamic decisions throughout the day based on metrics they customize and update.\nI will now provide some context to the pricing philosophy will be used to deploy these components. Our go-to-market strategy centers around bundling key components that complement each other and provide enhanced financial and operational benefits like time to deploy new feature enhancements, enhanced security, improved uptime, et cetera. For example, a bundle may include wires, general ledger and data broker.\nOur pricing model strategy will incorporate elements from our industry accepted pricing models such as license and/or per seat fees, consumption-based and per account pricing. We will encourage engagement with any combination of our solutions and further reward those who consume more components. Ultimately, the value proposition becomes evident as clients recognize the benefits of additional modules as well as the compelling features of the Google Cloud Platform.\nOne last topic from our November call is our plan to offer several key solutions outside of the Jack Henry core base by the end of calendar year 2024. We remain on track to begin selling Banno Business, Financial Crimes Defender, various payment solutions and available components from the Jack Henry platform in our fiscal year '25 sales year.\nWe have targeted several competing cores that we believe bring the best mutual value and have a need for premier digital fraud and real-time payment solutions. I will continue to keep you updated on this strategy.\nIn closing, I am passionate about accomplishing our strategic priorities and moving our company forward through innovation and execution. I am grateful for the opportunity to lead this finest group of talented and dedicated professionals in the industry. I want to thank all of them for their tireless effort and commitment.\nI will now turn things over to Mimi for some detail on the numbers.\n\nMimi L. Carsley\n\nCFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning. Our continued focus on serving our community and regional financial institution clients, investing in our joint future and delivering shareholder value led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth.\nI'll begin with the details driving our as expected strong second quarter and year-to-date results, then conclude with our full year guidance update. Second quarter GAAP and non-GAAP revenue increased 8%, a continuation of the strong start to our year and keeping us on track for a tremendous fiscal 2024 as year-to-date growth was 8% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.\nDeconversion revenue of $4.9 million, which we pre-released last week, was down approximately $1.5 million, reflecting minimal financial institution consolidation. Year-to-date, deconversion revenue is $9 million, $1.9 million less than the prior period.\nAs a reminder, effective September 1 onward, Payroll's results are included in both GAAP and non-GAAP figures. Now let's look more closely the details. Cap services and support revenue increased a healthy 7%, while non-GAAP increased a more robust 8%. The first half increased 7% for GAAP and 8% for non-GAAP basis.\nServices and support growth during the quarter was the result of increases in data processing and hosting and the timing of user group revenues. We continue to experience robust growth in our private and public cloud offerings which again increased 10% in the quarter and for year-to-date. This reoccurring revenue contributors has long been a double-digit growth engine.\nShifting to processing revenue. We saw consistently positive performance with 9% growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and first half from this reoccurring revenue source. Similar to recent results, drivers included a combination of higher card and other payment processing with strong digital demand.\nNext, moving to expenses. Beginning with cost of revenue, which increased 5% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis during the quarter, 7% for GAAP versus 6% non-GAAP year-to-date. Drivers for the quarter included higher direct costs consistent with increases in related revenue and internal license and fees. Growth in cost of revenue was limited to 5% due to active cost control and the timing of merit increases.\nNext, R&D expense decreased 3% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter. The decrease was due to lower personnel expense, net of capitalization and inclusive of benefits. For the first half, R&D expense increased 4% on a GAAP basis and 3% for non-GAAP.\nAnd lastly, on a GAAP basis, SG&A rose 24% for the quarter, 21% on a non-GAAP basis, primarily due to the shift in our customer conference from Q1 to Q2 and was higher personnel and related costs. Year-to-date, SG&A expense increased 31% on a GAAP basis and 9% non-GAAP. The primary difference is the $16.4 million in onetime costs related to the voluntary early departure incentive program need in Q1.\nWe remain focused on generating compounding margin expansion and the quarter delivered 111 basis points in non-GAAP margin at 21.3%. Non-GAAP margin benefited from operational performance, and a onetime shift in our merit increases from Q2 to Q3, offset slightly by the timing of our customer conference. These strong quarterly results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.26 and up 14%.\nBreaking down the results into the 3 operating segments, we're pleased by the consistent solid performance achieved. Our core segment revenue increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis, with non-GAAP operating margins increasing 166 basis points, benefiting from private cloud trends and strong cost controls. Year-to-date, non-GAAP revenue growth was 8% and the associated margin increased 80 basis points.\nPayments segment revenue increased 6% on a non-GAAP basis. This segment had impressive non-GAAP operating margin growth of 128 basis points. This was due to the strong growth in our EPS business, moderate card growth coupled with our scalable operating model and disciplined cost control.\nYear-to-date, non-GAAP revenue growth matched the quarter at 6% with 94 basis points of margin expansion. It should be noted that card revenue growth has been negatively impacted by lower card production among other nonprocessing revenue items. Excluding these impacts, processing-related revenue increased 8% for the quarter and 9% year-to-date.\nFinally, complementary segment non-GAAP revenue increased 9% with flat margin. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue also increased 9% with 25 basis points of margin expansion. Growth year-to-date was driven primarily by digital, recently released solutions and overall product mix. Quarterly margins faced headwinds from direct support costs, amortization of new products and licenses and fees.\nNow let's turn to a review of cash flow and capital allocation. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $239 million, a $48 million increase over the prior period, producing free cash flow of $129 million, slightly more than the $119 million last year.\nExcluding asset sale impacts of $1 million and $28 million from the current year-to-date and prior period, respectively, free cash flow was $37 million higher through the first half of our current fiscal year. Additionally, the timing of tax payments this year represented a $15 million headwind to free cash flow.\nOur consistent dedication to value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 20%. Additionally, I would highlight other notable return of capital metrics for the first half of our fiscal year, including $20 million in share repurchases offsetting annual dilution, $20 million in debt reduction and $76 million in dividends.\nAs we head into the second half of fiscal 2024, I will conclude with guidance highlights. As you are aware, yesterday's press release included updated fiscal 2021 full year GAAP guidance along with a reconciliation to non-GAAP guidance metrics. As a reminder, we filed an 8-K on August 3. It describes how starting in the current fiscal year, we are using a revised approach for deconversion revenue, guidance.\nBased on current trends, we expect to see similar acquisition levels of our core customers for the second half of the fiscal year. As such, we're reiterating our full year deconversion revenue guidance of $16 million. Based on positive year-to-date results from strong execution and near-term visibility, we are tightening our revenue growth outlook around the current midpoint.\nWe now expect to generate full year non-GAAP revenue growth of 7.4% to 8.0% compared to the 7.2% to 8.2% provided on the November call. This corresponds to an increased full year GAAP revenue guidance of 6.6% to 7.2% for fiscal '24. In tandem with our revenue outlook, we now expect an increase in annual non-GAAP margin expansion of 35 to 40 basis points compared to the 30 to 35 basis points previously provided.\nThe full year tax rate is now approximately 23.5% with potential bias slightly higher. Incorporating the noted positive updates Full year guidance for GAAP EPS is revised upwards to $5.09 to $5.13 per share from previous guidance of $4.98 to $5.04 per share.\nAs a reminder, the guidance for deconversion revenue compared to actual fiscal 2023 deconversion revenue, VIP severance-related costs, and nonrecurring gain on asset sales resulted in an approximate $0.37 headwind for fiscal 2024 GAAP EPS.\nLastly, some additional modeling commentary. We are comfortable with the current level of huge consensus for revenue growth, operating margin and GAAP EPS. Our full year guidance of 60% free cash flow conversion is reiterated.\nHowever, the legislation that passed the house last week would have a material beneficial impact on fiscal 2024 free cash flow and beyond. We are monitoring legislative progress and are hopeful for a swift and positive outcome. Based on the current bill language, it past our free cash flow conversion would rebound to historical normal levels either in fiscal '24 or fiscal year '25, depending on the timing of certain items.\nIn conclusion, Q2 reflects the strong performance we've seen consistently in the first half and expect the remainder of our fiscal year. We are exceptionally positive about our ability to deliver innovative and in-demand solutions, the resilience of our clients and our focus on execution and shareholder value creation.\nWe appreciate all the contributions of our hardworking and dedicated associates that drove these strong results. We thank all Jack Henry investors for their continued confidence.\nLaura, will you please open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vince Sherard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nVance Sherard\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today is David Foss, Board Chair and CEO; Mimi Carsley, CFO and Treasurer; and Greg Adelson, President and COO. After my opening remarks, I will turn the call over to Dave for his thoughts about the state of our business and some industry comments. After Dave concludes his comments, Greg will provide additional insight on our new solutions, Payrailz and other key initiatives at Jack Henry. Mimi will then provide insight regarding the financial results and updated guidance included in the press release issued yesterday that is available from the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website. .\nWe will then open the lines for Q&A. As a reminder, this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to multiple factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to multiple risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements.\nFor a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures are in yesterday's press release. I will now turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid B. Foss\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThank you, Vance. Good morning, everyone. As Vance mentioned, Greg is joining me this morning to provide an update on several innovative new solutions we've recently launched, followed by Mimi, who will take a deeper dive into our financial performance. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth for our company. As always, I'd like to thank our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for the quarter. .\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2024, total revenue increased 8% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. At the same time, deconversion fees were down 8% as compared to the prior year quarter. Turning to the segments. We had another solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 8% for the quarter on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Our Payments segment again performed very well, posting a 7% increase in revenue this quarter and a 6% increase on a non-GAAP basis.\nWe also had another strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with a 9% increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue. As I have discussed previously, the first quarter is normally our lightest sales bookings quarter because our fourth quarter tends to be extremely strong, and the sales pipeline is depleted as a result. As you may recall, the June quarter was the strongest sales quarter in the history of the company, so we certainly expected that historical trend to hold true.\nThis year, however, our sales pipeline was the largest ever entering a new fiscal year. In the first quarter, we booked 10 competitive core takeaways and another 10 deals to move existing in-house customers to our private cloud environment. This strong start leaves us confident that we are well positioned to achieve approximately 50 to 55 competitive takeaways this fiscal year. We continue to see success with our card processing solution, signing 7 new debit processing clients this quarter and 2 new credit clients.\nWe also continue to see success signing clients to our Banno digital suite, with 44 new contracts in Q1, including 21 contracts for our new Banno business offering. Speaking of our digital suite, at the end of Q1, we had more than 10.5 million registered users on the platform. That number is now growing at approximately 200,000 users per month. At the end of Q1 last year, we had about 8.3 million registered users on the platform, so we've experienced a 27% increase over the past 12 months.\nThe continued success we've seen with sales and the adoption of our digital suite is consistent with results in the Bank Director Technology survey published in September. As they do every year, Bank Director surveyed their subscribers during June and July regarding a variety of technology prioritization and spending topics. More than 50% of the responses they received were from bank CEOs and Board members and more than 80% of the respondent banks have greater than $500 million in assets. Most respondents said their bank's technology budgets grew over the prior year with a median increase of 10%. That level of spending is consistent with our own strategic priorities benchmark study published last spring. Responders to the Bank Director survey named digital business account opening, payments capabilities and digital business lending as their top 3 planned investments.\nOne of the interesting items from this year's Bank Director survey was the analysis of technology and use by respondent banks as it relates to their ability to serve different generational groups. [ Fully 96% ] of the respondents said they have the technology in place to serve baby boomers, but only 18% said they have the necessary technology in place to effectively serve Gen Zers. Of course, it's primarily the younger generations that expect to conduct all banking services without ever entering a branch.\nClearly, the innovative -- the initiative for all banks to get to digital presentation layer has a long way to go. All of this bodes well for the future of our digital suite as well as the other innovative solutions offered by Jack Henry that help financial institutions facilitate an improved customer experience through a digital front door. Digital Banking was one of the many topics discussed at our annual client conference held last month in Indianapolis. This is our largest conference of the year, and this year, we hosted more than 160 prospect attendees an all-time record.\nOf the financial institution prospects, over 30 have more than $1 billion in assets with a couple in the $10 billion to $30 billion range. Additionally, more than 250 third-party fintechs participated in the trade show, which underscores our approach to accessibility and open banking. Of course, events like this not only present a wonderful opportunity for relationship building and education, but they also generate a substantial number of new sales leads. We saw strong interest in our technology modernization strategy and our ongoing development of a single public cloud native platform that can run the entire financial institution.\nWe've now branded that solution as simply the Jack Henry Platform, and we were able to demonstrate some of the current functionality at the conference. In one of the most talked about mainstage sessions, our Chief Technology Officer, hosted an executive from Google and one of our bank CEOs to highlight the use of generative AI on the platform as well. As we normally do at Jack Henry Connect, I hosted our Annual CEO forum attended this year by nearly 150 client CEOs.\nAlthough we didn't conduct a formal survey during the meeting, the general feedback was that while attendees are concerned about the overall economy, they continue to invest in technology to enhance their digital capabilities, improve efficiencies and position their businesses for the future. During the quarter, we were proud to be included in several national workplace rankings. We placed 11th in Newsweek's list of Top 100 Most Loved Workplaces, up 6 spots from last year. We also made Newsweek's greatest Workplaces list earning 5 stars, which is the highest possible rating.\nAdditionally, we were named a top company in our sector by U.S. News & World Report based on work/life balance, stability and professional development. We are honored to be recognized in these national rankings because they reflect our people-first culture and the engagement, energy, collaboration and client focus that our employees bring to work each day.\nNext week, we'll conduct our annual shareholder meeting in person in Monett. We're excited to be able to meet with our shareholders and once again, we'll offer an option for people to observe remotely. As we move forward, I remain extremely optimistic regarding our robust sales pipeline, the demand environment, the strong interest in the solutions we're delivering and the strategies we're executing. We remain committed to our disciplined approach to running the company, and we expect that focus to continue to provide stability and solid performance for our employees, customers and shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Greg.\n\nGregory R. Adelson\n\nCOO, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. As we continue to execute on both our operational and technological strategic priorities, we're pleased to announce the general availability of a few new solutions in the first quarter. In addition, we continue to make outstanding progress on our technology modernization strategy and the development of our cloud-native API-First Jack Henry platform. We will provide an update on those platform components currently in beta or going into beta on our February call. .\nAs we mentioned during the August call, our cloud-native Banno Business solution developed for small and medium-sized businesses is now generally available for our [ Silver Lake ] banking clients and the response has been outstanding. At the end of September, we had approximately 60 banks live and more than 70 additional clients in various stages of implementation. We are currently in beta with several credit union clients and plan to be generally available for that base of Jack Henry customers by the end of the calendar year.\nWe delivered Financial Crimes Defender, our real-time fraud and anti-money laundering compliance platform into general availability for our Silver Lake banking clients in September. We also released our real-time faster payment Financial Crimes Defender fraud module for Zelle in September. The faster payment module uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect fraud and money laundering in real time. We plan to release additional Defender modules in late 2023 and early 2024 for both the FedNow and RTP networks. We currently have more than 120 clients in our implementation queue for Financial Crime Defender, of which more than 50 include utilizing the real-time payments module.\nIn addition, we remain on track to launch Financial Crimes Defender to our credit union clients in late December. As we also mentioned on our August call, we were among the first service providers to support live transactions on the Federal Reserve's new FedNow instant payment network when it launched on July 20. We now have all 4 Jack Henry [ cores ] connected to FedNow through our PayCenter offering and continue to provide the most comprehensive implementation process requiring almost no effort from our clients to go live on the network.\nWe currently have more than 40 clients live on FedNow with over 150 contracts in the implementation queue. We expect to have approximately 150 live customers on the network by the beginning of 2024. Today, every client is set up for receive only, but we expect to see more clients who want to add send capabilities in early to mid-2024 as use cases become more defined. As a matter of comparison, we have over 210 clients live on the Clearing House's RTP network and another 100 in the implementation queue.\nWe continue to see tremendous transaction growth from our RTP clients over the past year. When comparing September 2022 to September 2023, we have realized a 66% transaction growth with the majority of these transactions stemming from digital wallet transfers to bank accounts, A to A transfers from Tier 1 institutions and payroll or gig worker payments. Speaking of payments, it's been a little more than a year since we acquired Payrailz. We have successfully integrated the team and large portions of the technology stack into our culture and technology modernization strategy.\nWe continue to find, develop and execute additional back-office synergies while building a premier payment acceptance platform capable of handling bill payment, P2P, A2A, B2B and much more. As part of our planned strategy, we have created one Jack Henry Bill Payment Group that provides product and operational support for both our legacy solution, iPay and for Payrailz as well. Over the next 18 months, we will finalize the build-out of a single cloud-native API-first payment platform that will include all the key features of both iPay and Payrailz as well as additional new features not offered in either solution today.\nSpecific to Payrailz, we now have more than 100 clients live, another close to 50 clients in various stages of implementation and additional 20 that were recently signed. A question that is regularly asked, when are all these new innovative solutions going to be sold outside of the Jack Henry core base. I'm pleased to report that we have finalized our strategy to sell each of these solutions as well as components from the Jack Henry platform to several targeted competitive cores. We have aligned our strategy with the competitive cores we believe will bring the best mutual value and have a need for premier digital fraud and real-time payment solutions.\nEach of our components is being developed to go outside of the Jack Henry core base and will be available to do so as they move to general availability. We expect to start selling some of these solutions early next fiscal year. On the operational side, we've been highly focused on ensuring that Jack Henry is the easiest core provider to work with in the industry. We operate with full transparency while collaborating across business units to deliver a consistent enterprise experience. We call this program One Jack Henry and you've heard me talk about it in detail our annual Investor Day event in the past few years. We continue to receive tremendous validation of our efforts through meetings with industry consultants, prospects, clients and our associates.\nOur industry-leading survey and service scores continue to move up and to the right at a time where that is not happening across our industry. Furthermore, the work we are doing around One Jack Henry is aligned with the objectives outlined by the American Bankers Association Core Platforms Committee. Those objectives include fair and transparent contracts, exceptional customer service, responsive and open communication, open banking and the highest standard of data protection and privacy. In closing, we all came back from our Jack Henry Connect client conference in mid-October with a little extra pep in our step. After hearing from our clients and our prospects that our technology modernization strategy, coupled with the work we are doing to focus on road map execution and service excellence is truly a differentiator in our industry. I want to thank all of our talented and dedicated associates for helping us move this strategy forward. We wouldn't be where we are today without them. I will now turn things over to Mimi for some detail on the numbers.\n\nMimi L. Carsley\n\nCFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Our continued focus on serving our community and regional financial institution clients, growing our business, investing in our future and delivering shareholder value led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. I'll begin with the details driving our positive first quarter and then conclude with our full year guidance update. We're encouraged by Q1 GAAP revenue and non-GAAP revenue increasing 8%, establishing a healthy start to our year and setting us up for a fantastic fiscal 2024.\nDeconversion revenue of $4.1 million, which we pre-released last week, was down approximately $400,000 reflecting continued [indiscernible] financial institutional consolidation. As a reminder, given the September 1, 2022, close of [ Payrailz ] acquisition, the first 2 months of Q1 2024 results are excluded from non-GAAP financials.\nSeptember 1 onwards, Payrailz results are included in both GAAP and non-GAAP. Now we'll look more closely at the details. First, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, services and support revenue increased a healthy 7%. Services and support growth was the result of increases in data processing and hosting, software usage and subscription and hardware. We continue to experience robust growth in our private and public cloud offerings, which increased 10% in the quarter. This revenue contributor has long been a double-digit growth engine. Shifting to processing revenue. We saw vigorous performance with 10% growth on a GAAP basis and 9% growth on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter.\nConsistent with prior period results, drivers include a combination of higher card volumes and services plus strong digital demand. Next, moving to expenses. I'll begin with cost of revenue, which increased 8% on a GAAP basis and 7% on non-GAAP. Drivers include higher direct costs, personnel and benefit costs and internal licenses and fees. Next, R&D expense increased 12% on a GAAP basis and 10% on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting higher personnel and benefits costs, net of capitalization. This is in support of our continued solution innovation, maintaining competitiveness and our technology modernization strategy, including the Jack Henry platform.\nFinally, on a GAAP basis, SG&A rose 38% for the quarter, primarily due to the $16.4 million onetime cost related to the voluntary early departure incentive program, VEDIP. This cost was lower than the $17 million to $18 million estimate based on the final participation in the program. As a reminder, all VEDIP costs are in this quarter, and there will be no additional P&L impact as we move through the year. When these onetime VEDIP costs and last year's $6.2 million gain from real estate divestures are adjusted and non-GAAP, SG&A decreased 2% during the quarter. These adjusted figures reflect our ongoing commitment to cost control. We remain focused on generating compounding margin expansion and the quarter results delivered 121 basis points increase in non-GAAP margin, which was 26.1%.\nThis increase was partially driven by the timing shift of our Connect Customer Conference into Q2 compared to Q1 last year. These strong quarterly results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.39. Breaking down non-GAAP results, we're pleased by the consistent solid performance achieved by the 3 operating segments. Our core segment revenue increased 8% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, with non-GAAP operating margin increasing 5 basis points to 59%. We benefit from positive tailwinds from winning share, continued migration from on-premise to private cloud and customer growth. The Payments segment revenue increased 7% on a GAAP basis and 6% for non-GAAP. The segment had an impressive non-GAAP operating margin growth of 59 [ basis ] to 46%. This was due to increase in card transaction and related revenues plus growth in our EPS business.\nThe Fed recently announced its considered [indiscernible] the debit card interchange that would translate to an approximate 28% decrease in interchange for issuers. It should be noted that our revenue model for card processing is transactional and not reliant on interchange. Finally, our complementary segment, revenue increased 9% on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis with strong non-GAAP operating margin expansion of 47 basis points to 61%.\nOur diverse mix of solutions, including key headliners like Banno, LoanVantage, treasury management, in addition to the numerous additional solutions contribute to this strong growth trend. And our new fraud Financial Crimes Defender solution will soon contribute to the growth in this segment as well. Now let's turn to a review of cash flow and capital allocation. Quarterly operating cash flow was $157 million, a $20 million increase over prior year, producing free cash flow of $107 million, slightly less than the $116 million last year.\nLast year included $26 million contribution from asset sales that was nonreoccurring in nature. Our consistent dedication to value creation resulted in an annual return on invested capital of 20%. Additionally, I'd like to highlight notable return of capital, including $20 million in share repurchases, offsetting annual dilution; $30 million in debt reduction; and $38 million in dividends during the quarter.\nWith Q1 in our rear view, we shift our focus to the remainder of 2024, and I will conclude with guidance change highlights. As you're aware, yesterday's press release included updated fiscal 2024 full year guidance, along with the reconciliation to non-GAAP guidance metrics. As a reminder, we filed an 8-K on August 3 that described how starting in the current fiscal year, we're using a revised approach for deconversion guidance. Based on current trends, we expect to see minimal financial institution consolidation in the first half of fiscal 2024 with possible acceleration in the second half.\nAs such, we're maintaining and reiterating full year deconversion revenue guidance of $16 million. Based on a positive Q1 results from strong execution and near-term visibility, we see upside over our prior guidance. We now expect to generate full year non-GAAP revenue growth of 7.2% to 8.2% compared to the 7.0% to 8.0% provided on the August call. This corresponds to an increased full year GAAP revenue guidance of 6.4% to 7.4% for fiscal 2024. In tandem with our increased revenue outlook and continued focus on cost efficiencies, we now expect an increase in annual non-GAAP margin expansion of 30 to 35 basis points compared to the 20 to 25 basis points previously provided.\nThe full year tax rate remains unchanged at approximately 24%. Incorporating the noted positive updates, full year guidance for GAAP EPS is revised upward to $4.98 to $5.04 per share from previous guidance of $4.92 to $4.99 per share. As a reminder, the conservative guidance for deconversion revenue compared to actual fiscal 2023 deconversion revenue, slightly lower VEDIP severance-related costs and the nonrecurring gain on asset sales results in approximate $0.37 headwind for fiscal 2024 GAAP EPS.\nAnd lastly, some additional modeling commentary. As previously highlighted, we recently hosted our customer conference, JH Connect. The associated revenue and expenses will be reflected next quarter. Please recall in FY '23, the related financial impact was in Q1. We believe this timing shift has led to an approximate $0.01 to $0.02 higher consensus Q2 EPS estimate. Our full year guidance of 60% free cash flow conversion remains consistent, given the continued impact of tax deductibility timing on development expenses resulting in higher cash taxes.\nIn the relative near term, we expect to return to historical norms of conversion. We appreciate the contributions of our hardworking and dedicated associates that drove these strong quarterly results. In conclusion, Q1 was a strong start to our fiscal year, and we remain exceptionally positive about our ability to deliver innovation and value solutions, the resiliency of our clients, our focus on execution, growth accelerators and shareholder value creation. We thank all Jack Henry investors for their continued confidence. MJ, could you please open the call for questions."

As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our fourth quarter and for the entire fiscal year.\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, total revenue increased 11% for the quarter and increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were up as compared to the prior year quarter, but were still down significantly for the full fiscal year.\nTurning to the segments. We had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 11% for the quarter and increased by 10% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment performed well, posting a 9% increase in revenue this quarter and a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a very robust quarter in our Complementary Solutions businesses, with an 11% increase in revenue this quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis.\nAs I highlighted in our press release, the fourth quarter was the strongest quarter for sales bookings in the history of the company. With those of you who follow us close -- those of you who follow us closely will know that in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '22, we set an all-time sales record. We broke that record in the second quarter of fiscal '23, and now we've set another new record in the fourth quarter of '23. Additionally, we set a new annual sales record in fiscal year '23. All in all, this has been a remarkable year for the sales teams.\nTo provide a little detail regarding sales successes in the quarter, we booked 16 competitive core takeaways and an additional 19 deals to move existing on-prem core clients to our private cloud environment. Several of our complementary offerings also saw a very strong demand in the quarter with, as you might guess, our digital suite leading the pack.\nWe signed 63 new clients to our Banno digital platform in the quarter and 19 new clients to our card processing solution. For the full year, we signed 47 competitive core takeaways, with 5 of those institutions with greater than $1 billion in assets. Additionally, we signed 52 contracts to move on-premise core clients to our private cloud, 56 new clients for our card processing solution and 198 new Banno digital customers. Of course, we signed a variety of other contracts for many of our other solutions as well, but it's important to note that almost all of these contracts represent long-term recurring revenue commitments to Jack Henry for a wide variety of our solutions.\nRegarding the Banno digital suite, we were at almost 10 million registered users at the end of the fiscal year. As a point of reference, on July 1, 2020, we had about 3.2 million registered users. So in 3 years, we've seen our user count triple in size. This is significant because, as I've stressed in the past, most of the revenue for a business like this is tied to the number of users on the platform.\nWe delivered Banno Business into general availability for our bank clients in late July, and the response has been outstanding. More than 25 banks are live, and we signed an additional 53 Banno Business clients in fiscal Q4.\nOn July 20, we became one of the first service providers to support live transactions on the Federal Reserve's new FedNow Instant Payment Service. More than 100 of our clients are in various stages of implementation, and we expect to add hundreds of financial institutions over the next 12 months. We plan to deliver Financial Crimes Defender, our real-time fraud and anti-money laundering compliance platform, into general availability for our banking clients in late September and for our credit union clients late this calendar year.\nAs you may recall, it's been 1 year since we announced our corporate rebranding to retire the Symitar, ProfitStars and Jack Henry Banking brands, and go-to-market is simply Jack Henry. I said on this call a year ago that uniting the brands reflects Jack Henry's role as a well-rounded financial technology provider and enables us to speak from a single consistent brand voice. We've seen strong results during the year from our rebranding, including a 50% increase in website visits and a 30% increase in social media followers.\nI also mentioned on our last call that we recently published our 2023 sustainability report. I am pleased to share that Jack Henry has been recognized as a 2023 Climate Leader by USA TODAY and Statista for our ongoing efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, we were recently recognized as one of America's Greatest Workplaces by Newsweek. Our consistent placement in Best Places to Work rankings is a testament to the workplace culture we have at Jack Henry, and our employee engagement scores reflect that strong culture.\nOur continuous listening program enables us to gather feedback from our associates throughout the year, and I'm pleased to share that overall, our participation rate this year was greater than 65%. We achieved an engagement capital score of 81%, and 87% of our employees say that they believe in Jack Henry's values, all well above industry benchmarks. By taking care of our associates, they in turn are taking care of our clients, delivering outstanding customer service as a hallmark of our company, and this past year was no exception.\nOn surveys we send to customers, we scored an average of 4.6 out of 5 for overall customer satisfaction and 4.75 out of 5 for satisfaction with our customer service representatives. Both are increases over our already industry-leading satisfaction scores. We are encouraged by recent surveys of financial institutions showing positive growth and sentiment around technology spending for the balance of the calendar year. To that end, Bank Directors 2023 Technology Survey will be published in September, and it will provide a helpful barometer of bank sentiment relative to technology. I will plan to share these results with you on our November call.\nIn today's environment, we found that no matter what a financial institution is trying to solve for, technology is almost always the solution. Our breadth of solutions regularly positions us well to participate in these opportunities.\nIn Mimi's comments, she will discuss a program we recently offered to a select group of associates who meet certain criteria. Internally, we refer to this offering as our Voluntary Early Departure Incentive Program. We have many employees who have been with us for a long time, and this program enables us to reward them while giving others a chance to move up in the organization. While there is a cost associated with this program, it is something we've offered in the past that has been well received and produced positive long-term results for the company.\nAs I reflect back on fiscal 2023, I can confidently say it was a very good year for our company. Our employee engagement scores remain high, and our levels of customer engagement and customer satisfaction scores are also very high. Mimi has been in her CFO role for nearly a year, and her collaborative thoughtful leadership has had a visible impact on both you, as investors, and our associates. Our sales teams are performing extremely well and have positioned us for continued success with the sales pipeline that is the largest we've ever had entering a new fiscal year.\nWe believe that our commitment to doing the right thing for our constituents will continue to serve us well. We will continue with our disciplined approach to running the company and expect that approach to help provide stability for our employees, customers and shareholders. As we begin the new fiscal year, I continue to be very optimistic about our future.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mimi for some detail on the numbers.\n\nMimi L. Carsley\n\nCFO & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Dave, and hello, everyone. As always, we remain focused on serving our community and regional financial institution clients, growing our business, investing in our future and delivering shareholder value. This focus led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. This morning, I'll begin with the details driving Q4 and the full year 2023 results, notable capital management items and end with our initial outlook for fiscal year 2024.\nFor the quarter, GAAP revenue increased 11% and non-GAAP increased 8%. Delivering solid results in the fourth quarter, we closed out a strong year for our business as full year 2023 non-GAAP revenue grew 8% to over $2 billion.\nNow let's look more closely at the quarter details. Firstly, on a GAAP basis, services and support revenue increased 12% for the quarter and 5% for the full year. Services and support were positively impacted during the quarter as deconversion revenue increased approximately $10 million. Despite the better-than-expected volume in Q4, full year deconversion revenue was down approximately $22 million versus prior year. And as we discussed all year, this was due to the limited market acquisition activity in our space.\nOf note, product delivery and services increased 27% in the quarter, driven by higher deconversion, license and hardware and implementation-related revenue. For the full year, given the significant headwind of over 40% lower annual deconversion revenue, we're pleased with the strong growth in all other areas, resulting in a modest 2% decrease.\nNext, we continue to experience robust growth in our product -- in our private and public cloud offering, which increased 10% in the quarter and for the full year. I would highlight that on a non-GAAP basis, services and support revenue grew 8% for the quarter and 7% for the year.\nFinally, shifting to processing revenue. We saw consistent strength with 10% growth on a GAAP basis for the quarter and the year and, on a non-GAAP basis, healthy growth of 9% for the quarter and the year. Noted on previous calls, performance continues to be driven by higher card volumes and services and robust digital demand.\nNext, moving to operating expenses. I'll begin with the cost of revenue, which was up 8% for the fourth quarter and full year, roughly tracking revenue performance. At a total company level, quarterly and full year drivers were consistent and included higher direct costs, personnel costs and amortization expenses. Similarly, R&D expense increased 13% during the quarter, mostly due to higher personnel costs and internal license fees used to drive innovation. Based on the same drivers, these expenses increased [ 15% ] for the full year.\nAnd lastly, SG&A rose 9% for the quarter and 8% for the year, driven by increases in personnel-related costs, reflecting talent market conditions. We continue to deliver savings across the company stemming from our disciplined focus on prioritization and efficiency. I'm happy to report a 22% increase in net income, driven by operations and increased deconversion revenue, resulting in a fully diluted earnings per share of $1.34 for the quarter. We appreciate the collective contributions of our hard-working and dedicated associates that drove strong quarterly and full year results.\nNow let's turn to reviewing cash flow and capital allocation. Across the year, we faced large headwinds impacting cash flow, and therefore, full year operating cash flow at $382 million was down from $505 million posted last year. Impacting the decline was lower deconversion revenue, higher prepaid expenses and legislative changes to the deductibility of development expenses, which shifted the timing of tax payments.\nConsistent with operating cash flow factors, we produced free cash flow of $203 million. Subsequent to fiscal '23, we have paid down our debt by an additional $75 million to $200 million.\nRegarding capital management, our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. We're fully committed to our disciplined approach, which includes investing in our business; maintaining a strong balance sheet; pursuing high-return acquisitions, where appropriate; and returning capital to shareholders. This consistent dedication to value creation resulted in an annual return on invested capital of 21.7%. And I would highlight that for the full fiscal year, we returned over $172 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nSo with that, I'll conclude with guidance for the fiscal year 2024. As you're aware, yesterday's press release included fiscal 2024 full year GAAP guidance, along with the reconciliation to non-GAAP guidance metrics. As a reminder, we filed an 8-K on August 3 that described how, starting in the current fiscal year, we're using a revised approach for deconversion revenue. Of note, we've moved to deconversion revenue estimates in line with the recent historical low. And with that framing in mind for fiscal year 2024, we're guiding to $16 million evenly distributed across the year.\nAdditionally, approximately 10 days prior to our quarterly earnings release, we will prerelease actual deconversion revenue figures so that your models may be updated. This will allow us to focus our quarterly call on results from operations. And going forward, each quarter, we will update guidance based on actual deconversion revenue, which is expected to likely exceed the beginning full year estimates.\nIt's important to note the negative impact of this change. Based on the new approach, full year GAAP EPS guidance will understate anticipated EPS growth since deconversion revenue was $32 million in fiscal year 2023. Pay close attention to the impact to GAAP EPS of $0.01 per million dollars of deconversion revenue using current share count.\nBased on current trends, we expect to see minimal fiscal institutional consolidation in the first half of fiscal '24, with possible acceleration in the second half.\nAdditionally important, in 2024, there will be a onetime impact from a Voluntary Early Departure Incentive Program, VEDIP for short, that was initiated at the start of this fiscal year. As Dave mentioned, the program opens paths for employees to move into more senior positions. The financial impact from VEDIP for fiscal year 2024 is $17 million to $18 million in severance-related costs, which will have an approximate negative $0.18 impact on our reported GAAP EPS, all of which will be in our Q1 results.\nLastly, related to our latest acquisition, Payrailz has been successfully integrated into our payments segment. Therefore, we will not provide specific metrics for FY '24. And as a reminder, our financials will reflect 2 months of related non-GAAP results. Going forward, for FY '23 and '24, non-GAAP results reflect 10 months of Payrailz, aligned with the September 1 acquisition date.\nWe expect full year Payrailz revenue to more than double and become EBITDA positive starting in the first half and continuing to ramp for the full year. Based on current momentum, strong execution and near-term visibility, we should generate 6.3% to 7.3% for full year GAAP revenue growth for fiscal '24. And I would highlight non-GAAP revenue growth expectations, a 7.0% to 8.0%, consistent with our recent Investor Day discussions.\nTo be helpful, as it pertains to the expected cadence of non-GAAP revenue growth, we currently see Q1 being the low point of the year at approximately 6.4% to 6.6%, then a sizable increase in Q2 with sequential increases in Q3 and Q4. We will update this trend if we see changes.\nDriven by a combination of our year-over-year growth and continued focus on cost efficiency, we will deliver margin expansion in 2024. At a total company level for the full year, we expect non-GAAP margin expansion of 20 to 25 basis points. We expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 24%, and we will provide updated guidance during the year, if applicable.\nIncorporating these discussed impacts, full year guidance for GAAP EPS is $4.92 to $4.99 per share. And as a reminder, the conservative guidance for deconversion revenue, the VEDIP severance-related costs and the nonrecurring gain on asset disposals result in approximately $0.39 headwind, assuming deconversion fees consistent with fiscal '23.\nThe expected trend of our quarterly GAAP EPS is consistent with current estimates, where Q1 and Q4 are the best performing quarters with slightly lower results in Q2 and Q3. Additionally, on last year's Q1 call, we said we expected the expenses related to our 2023 client conference to remain in Q1. However, instead, we will be hosting our clients in October 2023, and the related cost impact will be in our fiscal Q2.\nAlso of note, for fiscal 2024, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 60%, impacted by the higher onetime capital expenses, lower guided deconversion revenue and continuing high cash taxes from last year's change in the deductibility of development-related expenses, the trend to increasingly higher prepaid, both for sales commissions and third-party relationships.\nLooking beyond this year to provide near-term targets, we expect non-GAAP revenue growth of 7% to 8%, as discussed at Investor Day in May, and we see annual non-GAAP margin expansion of 20 to 40 basis points. These targets are based on stable economic conditions and do not incorporate potential significant macroeconomic headwinds.\nSo in closing, 2023 was a strong year for our business, and I'm energized about the opportunities ahead. We thank all our investors for their continued confidence in Jack Henry. Anthony, will you please open the call for questions?"

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vance Sherard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. .\n\nVance Sherard\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today is David Foss, our Chairman, CEO; and Mimi Carsley, CFO and Treasurer; and Greg Adelson, President and COO. After my opening remarks, I will turn the call over to Dave for his thoughts about the state of our business, financial and sales performance for the quarter, industry comments and other key initiatives. After Dave concludes his comments, Mimi will provide additional commentary regarding the financial results and fiscal year guidance included in the press release issued yesterday that is available from the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website. We will then open the lines for Q&A.\nAs a reminder, this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to multiple factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to multiple risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements.\nOn this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures are in yesterday's press release. I will now turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid B. Foss\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThank you, Vance. Good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue growth and an overall solid performance by our business. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our third fiscal quarter.\nFor Q3 of fiscal 2023, total revenue increased 6% for the quarter and increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Consistent with our prior comments regarding the reduction in bank M&A this year, deconversion revenue was down approximately 65% as compared to the prior year quarter.\nTurning to the segments. We again had a good quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased 4% for the quarter and increased by 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment performed very well, posting a 6% increase in revenue this quarter and a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a strong quarter in our Complementary Solutions businesses with a 6% increase in revenue this quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis.\nAs I highlighted in the press release, our sales professionals posted an extremely strong quarter led by the core sales team. On our last quarterly call, I mentioned that the sales team set an all-time sales booking record in our fiscal Q2. Although we didn't break that record this quarter, we did set a record for the strongest Q3 in history.\nDuring the quarter, we inked 13 competitive core takeaways, so we continue at the approximately 1 deal per week run rate I've discussed in the past. In addition to our success in signing new core clients, we signed 13 existing on-prem core customers to move to our private cloud environment.\nIn addition to the tremendous success we've experienced in our core business this quarter, we continue to attract new clients to our digital banking suite. During the third quarter, we signed 39 new clients to our Banno retail platform with another 35 clients sign up for Banno business. Regarding our Banno digital suite, as of March 31, we now have just over 9.3 million users live on the Banno platform. We continue to enjoy the highest consumer rating in the App Store, and we are regularly recognized as the fastest application in the industry. The feedback from our 30 Banno business beta testing clients has been outstanding, and we remain on track to deliver Banno business into general availability later this quarter.\nLet me take a moment to address the banking landscape related to the liquidity challenges experienced by a couple of large regional banks in March and earlier this week. Although I'm not aware of any Jack Henry core clients who have tapped into the Federal Reserve's new bank term funding program, I think the announcement has had a positive effect on the overall concern in the market regarding bank liquidity. And I applaud the Fed on their swift and decisive action.\nSince those events grabbed the headlines, members of our team have spoken with hundreds of our clients, and I personally have visited with a large number of CEOs at our client banks. I'm pleased to say that our banking clients have indicated they have been largely unaffected by these events with the exception of several who have reported an influx of new accounts as business clients look to diversify their deposit balances. Our clients typically have a diversified customer base, serve small and medium businesses and consumers in their local communities, and have long-standing and loyal customers. So I think it's logical that they wouldn't see an adverse impact as a result of a few extreme scenarios.\nAlso remember that a large part of our business is focused on the credit union industry with approximately half of all credit unions with more than $1 billion in assets partnered with Jack Henry as their primary technology provider. Those clients also report being largely unaffected by the challenges in the banking sector. In late April, IntraFi conducted a survey which generated responses for more than 550 bank CEOs, Presidents and CFOs primarily at banks with less than $10 billion in assets. Approximately 77% of the respondents saw no significant inflows or outflows of deposits. 14% said they saw deposits decline by 2% or more and 9% said they saw an increase of at least 2% in deposits. I think these results are consistent with what we've heard anecdotally from our clients. We have seen no hesitation on the part of our clients to move ahead with technology decisions since the middle of March. And as I mentioned earlier, this was the largest third quarter in terms of sales bookings in the history of our company. What's more, our sales pipeline is now larger than at any other time, including a recognizable uptick in opportunities since our last quarterly call in February.\nI'm well aware of the challenges bankers face in today's economy and understand that things could change. But as we speak today, our clients are generally performing well, and banks and credit unions are continuing to prioritize modernization of their technology stack to remain competitive and serve the evolving needs of their account holders.\nHopefully, you've all seen the new corporate sustainability report that we published on March 31. I think it's an excellent representation of the key initiatives and accomplishments we've been working on since we published our last report. In this new version, we provided a more detailed review of Jack Henry's demographic makeup, a summary of the results of our annual employee engagement survey, an overview of our data privacy and cybersecurity practices and an outline of our commitment to setting science-based targets through the science-based targets initiative, or SBTI, to address the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the report highlights some of the recognition we've received from organizations like Newsweek, Computer World and LinkedIn's Top Companies list.\nAs we look toward the end of the fiscal year, our sales pipeline is much larger than it's ever been, and we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our customers, our ability to expand our customer relationships and our long-term prospects for success.\nI look forward to seeing and chatting with many of you at our Investor Day in Denver in a couple of weeks. With that, I'll turn it over to Mimi for some detail on the numbers.\n\nMimi L. Carsley\n\nCFO & Treasurer\n\nThanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. As Dave shared, Jack Henry had a successful third quarter, and I will call out the details driving those results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. For both the third quarter and first 9 months of our fiscal year, total revenue is up 6% on a GAAP basis and solidly up 8% on a non-GAAP basis.\nNow on to the third quarter detail. On a GAAP basis, services and support revenue increased 3% in both the third quarter and year-to-date. Consistent with trends over the past 2 quarters, services and support were negatively impacted as deconversion revenue decreased $11 million for the quarter and $31 million year-to-date. This remains in line with the limited broader market activity, acquisition activity in our space.\nWith only a couple of months left, we are projecting approximately $20 million in deconversion revenue this fiscal year. However, forecasting deconversion activity is always challenging given the limited advance notice and general uncertainty of M&A. Our private and public offering show robust growth this quarter, growing 11% and 10% year-to-date. Product delivery and services decreased 10% in the quarter, 11% year-to-date, impacted by lower deconversion revenue and convert merge activity, offset by higher license and hardware revenue.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, services and support revenue grew 8% for the quarter and 7% year-to-date, which serves to highlight the consistent strength of our business model. Processing revenue increased 11% on a GAAP basis for the quarter and 10% year-to-date. On a non-GAAP basis, the growth was 10% for the quarter and 9% year-to-date. The increases were driven by the higher card volumes and services plus robust digital demand.\nNow reviewing costs. Cost of revenue was up 9% for the third quarter and 8% year-to-date. Quarterly drivers included increased card processing costs consistent with card revenue growth, higher personnel costs and amortization expense. These drivers are consistent across our year-to-date results. Research and development expense increased 13% during the quarter, mostly due to higher personnel costs and license fees furthering innovation. Year-to-date, these expenses increased 19% based on the same factors. SG&A rose 9% for the quarter, driven by increases in personnel-related costs. Year-to-date, the increase was 8%, driven by personnel, travel, professional services costs partly offset by the gain on sales of assets earlier this year.\nWe remain focused on actions involving facility rationalization, head count and travel controls, procurement wins and other expense management. Collectively, these efforts are helping offset inflationary pressures in driving positive operational results. Despite a decline in net income primarily related to deconversion revenue and partially offset by a lower tax rate, we delivered fully diluted earnings per share of $1.12 for the quarter.\nThanks to our hard-working and dedicated associates, GAAP and non-GAAP results for the third quarter and 9 months of the year are consistent with internal expectations and set us up for a strong conclusion to FY '23. As a reminder, for transparency, the impact from the gain on sale of assets, the Payrailz acquisition and deconversion revenue are shown as part of the non-GAAP adjustments in the press release.\nTurning our attention to cash flow. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $207 million, down from $301 million in the same period last year due to lower deconversion revenue and the timing of taxes. The tax payments were a significant outflow at $64 million in the quarter related to a change in the timing of the deductibility of development expenses.\nFree cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software plus proceeds from the sale of assets, was $82 million year-to-date. Excluding the previously discussed tax payments and keeping year-to-date deconversion revenue flat, free cash flow would have been approximately $163 million. While balancing repurchase activities with maintaining a conservative balance sheet, we repurchased 151,000 shares during the quarter.\nWe also returned capital to shareholders through a dividend of $0.52 per share, representing a 6% increase. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. We're focused on maintaining ample liquidity and investing in our business to fuel growth, evaluating acquisitions, paying dividends and opportunistically repurchasing our stock. This consistent dedication to value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 20.1%.\nWith that, let's review our outlook for the completion of our fiscal year. The press release included updated full year GAAP guidance. The GAAP guidance remains inclusive of the Payrailz acquisition, gain on asset sales and conversion revenue. We expect the year-to-date trends to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year, impacting GAAP results. Most significantly, assuming continued minimal consolidation in our customer base, deconversion revenue will remain muted. Considering year-to-date activity, we expect approximately $20 million of annual deconversion revenue, representing a $5 million increase from our previous guidance provided on the last call.\nTo be [ transparent ], on our August full year earnings call, we will outline our new approach to providing guidance for deconversion revenue. While the integration of Payrailz continues to meet expectations, there has been third-party implementation delay impacting FY '23 revenue amounting to a shortfall of $3 million. This revenue remains in our pipeline. We remain confident in the strategic value and financial performance trajectory. We expect full year GAAP revenue growth for fiscal '23 to be between 5.5% to 5.9%.\nWith respect to full year GAAP EPS, we expect $4.85 to $4.87 per share with improvement driven from positive impacts from a modestly higher expected deconversion revenue, lower tax rate, partly offset by a slight increase in Payrailz dilution. Non-GAAP guidance remains unchanged due to the continued impressive and consistent performance of our business model.\nSo in closing, we delivered another quarter of strong operational and financial results and remain solidly optimistic about the conclusion of this fiscal year. We thank all of our investors for their continued confidence in Jack Henry. Debbie, will you please open the call for questions?"

As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our second quarter.\nFor Q2 of fiscal 2023, total revenue increased 2% for the quarter and increased 6% on a non-GAAP basis. This variance was primarily due to a reduction in deconversion revenue, which I'll detail in a few minutes.\nTurning to the segments. We again had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue was flat for the quarter, but increased by 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment also performed well, posting a 3% increase in revenue this quarter and a 6% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We had a very strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with a 4% increase in revenue this quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis.\nYesterday's press release included revised guidance, which Mimi will outline in her comments. One of the key drivers behind this change in guidance was the actual and forecasted reduction in deconversion revenue for the year. As we disclosed yesterday, deconversion fees are down $20 million year-to-date, and this was the primary driver of the variance in GAAP versus non-GAAP revenue and operating income performance for Q2.\nAs a reminder, we receive deconversion revenue when 1 of our clients is acquired by another institution and is required to pay us a fee to terminate their contract prior to the end date. I normally reference this as the revenue you don't want to see because it indicates we've lost a client to M&A. This lack of consolidation by financial institutions is also impacting our services revenue associated with convert and merge activities. Because of the impacts to bank stocks and valuations, M&A is down overall in the banking space and the experts in the industry don't see any significant rebound for at least a couple of quarters.\nOf course, consolidation is outside of Jack Henry's control, and we normally update guidance for deconversion revenue as we become aware of pending M&A activity. The other primary item impacting our guidance is the recent change in consumer spending behavior. Due to economic conditions, consumer card usage is slowing and transactions are shifting from debit to credit. Our card processing business is significantly weighted to debit processing, so we are revising guidance to reflect what we believe to be a temporary economic trend.\nAs I've said many times in the past, our financial model is very resistant to significant swings resulting from changes in the overall economy but were not completely bulletproof. Despite these external factors, our primary businesses remain strong and continue to perform very well. As I mentioned in the press release, our sales teams again had an outstanding quarter with a number of notable wins. In fact, Q2 set a new quarterly sales record for Jack Henry, breaking the record we set in the June quarter last year.\nIn the second quarter, we inked 12 competitive core takeaways and an additional 15 deals to move existing in-house core clients to our private cloud environment. December 30 was a particularly memorable day for us at Jack Henry as we signed 3 core takeaways of multibillion dollar financial institutions on the same day. We continue to see good success with our new card processing solution, signing 12 new card processing clients this quarter. We also continue to see great success signing clients to our Banno digital suite, with 36 new contracts in Q2.\nSpeaking of our digital suite, our Banno Business solution is scheduled to go into general release next quarter. We already have 18 institutions live in early adopter status with the feedback being extremely positive from those users. We have 308 clients under contract for this solution, and we're positioned to bring them into full production at a very rapid pace once we achieve general availability.\nWe are also continuing to implement new financial institution clients on retail Banno platform at a similar pace to recent quarters. At the end of Q2, we surpassed 8.8 million registered users on the platform, and Banno continues to hold one of the highest consumer ratings in the App Store.\nNormally in January, I share with you the results of bank spending survey projections from the publications we follow closely. Unfortunately, this year, none of those major publications provided forward-looking projections around the topic of expected tech spending in the banking segment. I have received a number of smaller surveys, and we conducted our own informal survey at a banking CEO roundtable last month, with the results being all relatively consistent.\nThe average increase appears to be settling at around 7% for calendar 2023, with the most popular range being a 5% to 10% increase. I'll continue to watch for firm objective data, and we'll share as it becomes available.\nAs you may have noticed last month, we took a major step forward with our environmental efforts by signing a commitment letter indicating our intention to set science-based climate targets with the Science Based Targets initiative, or SBTi. Science-based targets are aligned with the level of decarbonization necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Jack Henry will pursue validation for near-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets through SBTi.\nThis commitment follows extensive analysis and discussion and is supported by our low carbon transition plan, which outlined several mitigation tactics to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. More information regarding this plan will be disclosed in our next sustainability report, which will be released on March 31 through the investor site on jackhenry.com. As you will recall, it was on this call last year that we announced our new technology modernization strategy. We developed this multiyear strategy to help us deliver the public cloud native capabilities to community and regional financial institutions allowing them to innovate, compete and meet the evolving needs of their account holders. We are continuing to make great progress on the strategy's 4 main objectives: first, we're redefining the core processing system by unbundling services that traditionally would be in the core and building them as stand-alone modules on the public cloud.\nIn September, we announced plans to build these services on the Google Cloud, and we've been testing our wire processing and authorization management services modules on the Google Cloud since that time. We currently have 6 clients live in early adopter status with domestic wires and plan to offer general availability for this solution in July. We expect to launch the international wire solution for early adopters in April and expect that module to be generally available late in the fourth calendar quarter this year.\nSecond, we're working to provide multiple data integration options utilizing our open philosophy and technology. Our newest offering in this area is real-time data streaming, simultaneous constant streaming of necessary data to all systems on the platform. We're currently in beta with real-time data streaming, which is essential to support real-time payments and fraud detection. We expect this functionality to go into live production later in this calendar year.\nDelivering industry-leading capabilities across a single next-generation platform is the third objective. Banno is a key element in this part of the strategy, but we're working on several other additional solutions to build upon this commitment. As an example, in September, we added Payrailz, a public cloud native digital payments platform to our suite of payment solutions. Additionally, this summer, we're launching Financial Crimes Defender, our next-gen financial crimes platform with enhanced capabilities, including machine learning and artificial intelligence. This new fraud solution has been built entirely on our public cloud native platform.\nThe last step in the strategy is to move from acting as a core processor to offering a full banking ecosystem. This includes our own capabilities plus access to leading fintechs through a single platform that prioritizes openness, agility, speed and optionality. A year ago, I announced that we had more than 850 fintech providers in our ecosystem. Today, it's closer to 950 and the number continues to grow.\nWe're also the only platform provider that has relationships with all 4 major financial data aggregators, Finicity, Plaid, Yodlee and Akoya. Through these companies, financial institutions can give account holders a complete financial picture in a safe, secure manner that eliminates screen scraping.\nWe've seen strong interest in this strategy from both prospects and customers. Anecdotally, I can tell you that we are currently in conversations with a number of prospects who have indicated that the technology modernization strategy I just described is the primary driver for them to engage with Jack Henry to help develop their technology strategy for the future.\nCommunity and regional financial institutions are the lifeblood of Main Street America. Many of them, however, are at a crossroads. The personal service and experience they are known for is being disrupted by technology as nontraditional financial service providers have entered the market and the way people bank has fundamentally changed, especially for the younger generation.\nAs a well-rounded financial technology company, Jack Henry is in a unique position to provide modern technology and services to help community and regional financial institutions capitalize on this opportunity and strengthen connections with their account holders.\nThe key takeaway is that while we're successfully meeting the needs of our clients today as shown by our performance results, we're also preparing them for the future. We're pleased with the progress we've made on this exciting strategy, and we'll share more updates at our Investor Day in May.\nAs we begin the second half of our fiscal year, our sales pipeline is very robust, and we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our clients, our ability to expand the client relationships, the spending environment and our long-term prospects for success.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mimi for some detail on the numbers.\n\nMimi Carsley\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. As highlighted by Dave's comments, Jack Henry had a successful second quarter, and I will discuss the details driving those results. Total revenue was up 2% for the quarter on a GAAP basis and solidly up 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Fiscal year-to-date GAAP revenue was up 5% and non-GAAP revenue increased 7%. So let's jump into the details.\nOn a GAAP basis, services and support revenue decreased 2% in the second quarter but increased 3% year-to-date. Services and support were negatively impacted as deconversion revenue decreased $21 million for the quarter, $20 million year-to-date. This is consistent with the broader market lack of acquisition activity in our space. We now anticipate approximately $15 million in deconversion revenue this fiscal year. However, forecasting deconversion revenue remains challenging given the limited advance notice and the general uncertain nature of M&A.\nOur private and public cloud offerings showed robust growth this quarter, growing 11% and 10% year-to-date. Product delivery and services decreased 26% in the quarter impacted by lower deconversion fees and convert/merge activity, offset by slightly higher implementation-related revenue. As a reminder, user group conference related to our major customer conference, shifted into Q1 this year, contributing to the year-over-year Q2 revenue decline.\nYear-to-date, product delivery and services revenue decreased 11%, influenced by similar drivers as the quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, services and support revenue grew 6% for the quarter and 7% year-to-date, which serves to highlight our consistent fundamental business strength.\nProcessing revenue increased 9% on a GAAP basis for both the quarter and year-to-date. On a non-GAAP basis, the growth was 7% for the quarter and 8% year-to-date. The increases were largely driven by higher card volumes despite a slight increase in the rate of growth. Additionally, digital revenue continues to show rapid growth led by robust demand for our Banno Digital Platform.\nNow turning to costs. Cost of revenue was up 8% for both the quarter and year-to-date. Quarterly drivers included increased card processing costs consistent with card revenue growth, higher personnel costs and amortization expense. These drivers are consistent across our year-to-date results.\nResearch and development expense increased 22% for the quarter, mostly due to higher personnel costs and licensing fees. Year-to-date, these expenses increased 23% based on the same factors. SG&A rose 2%, driven by increases in personnel, travel, professional services, partly offset by the gain on sale of assets. Year-to-date, the increase was 7% influenced by similar drivers.\nThe quarter and the remainder of the year benefit from disciplined focus and actions involving facility rationalization, headcount and travel control, procurement wins and other expense management. These collective efforts helped to offset inflationary pressures and mitigate lower revenue.\nAs we have previously mentioned, some compensation and travel-related cost increases result from the lower cost comparisons from our first half of fiscal 2022. Due to previously mentioned management rigor on cost controls, we concluded Q2 with strong operational results. Despite net income declining 16% primarily due to lower deconversion fees and increased interest expense, the quarter saw a fully diluted earnings per share of $1.10.\nOur GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter and year-to-date are consistent with internal expectations and set us up for a strong finish to fiscal year '23. As a reminder, for transparency, the impact from the gain on the sale of assets including this quarter's sale of an Albuquerque property, yielding a $1.2 million gain, the Payrailz acquisition and deconversion fees are shown as part of non-GAAP adjustments in the press release.\nTurning our attention to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $191 million for the year-to-date, down from $197 million for the same period last year, essentially due to lower deconversion revenue. Total R&D investment remains slightly elevated but should normalize by next fiscal year.\nFree cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software plus proceeds from the sale of assets was $119 million. We remain committed to maintaining ample operating liquidity, reinvesting for growth, evaluating financially sound strategic acquisitions, paying dividends and opportunistically repurchasing our stock. This consistent dedication to value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 21.4%.\nFocusing ahead, let me discuss updated guidance. The press release included revised GAAP and non-GAAP full year guidance, the GAAP guidance remains inclusive of Payrailz acquisition, gain on asset sales and deconversion fees. We expect the trends impacting Q2 results to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year, impacting both GAAP and non-GAAP results. Most significantly, assuming minimal industry consolidation, deconversion fees will likely remain muted at approximately $15 million for the fiscal year, representing a $20 million decrease from our previous guidance.\nSecondly, languishing bank M&A-related consolidation negatively impacted our outlook for our convert/merge services revenue for the fiscal year. As a reminder, this revenue is driven by our clients acquiring and implementing Jack Henry solutions at their newly purchased institution.\nFinally, in line with the announced payment network activity, we're experiencing a slower rate of growth than anticipated for debit transaction volumes in our card processing business, primarily driven by a combination of lower consumer spending and the spending shift to credit cards. As a reminder, card processing is approximately 22% of our total revenue and as Dave highlighted, more heavily weighted to debit card business.\nAs a result of these impacts, GAAP revenue growth for fiscal '23 is now expected to be 5.4% to 5.8%. Guidance for non-GAAP revenue growth is now 7% to 7.3%. Outlook for full year GAAP operating margin is now approximately 22.9%, which is negatively impacted by the expected lower deconversion fees and is inclusive of the impacts from both gain on sales assets and the Payrailz acquisition.\nFull year non-GAAP operating margin guidance due to strong management expense control, is now expected to deliver slightly margin improvement for the fiscal year compared to previous guidance of flat to slightly down. The management team remains focused on returning to margin expansion in fiscal '24.\nFull year GAAP EPS guidance is now a range of $4.79 to $4.83. The midpoint of $4.81 is an $0.11 decrease from previous guidance even though the lower deconversion fee drives a $0.20 reduction. The headwind caused by lower deconversion fees is mitigated by the team's collaborative and disciplined cost control, gain on sale of assets and lower net income.\nWe expect the remainder of fiscal year '23 quarterly non-GAAP revenue growth momentum to deliver increases in both in the third and fourth quarters to achieve our revised full year guidance targets. We anticipate similar growth patterns for non-GAAP operating margin, delivering the revised increased full year guidance.\nSo in closing, we delivered another quarter of strong operational and fiscal results and remain solidly optimistic about the success of our business model. We thank all of our investors for their continued confidence in Jack Henry.\nKeith, will you please open the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vance Gerard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nVance Sherard\n\nSenior Director of Corporate Development & IR, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chuck. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry First Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today is David Foss, Board Chair and CEO; Mimi Carsley, CFO and Treasurer; and Greg Adelson, President and COO.\nAfter these opening remarks, I will turn the call over to Dave for his thoughts about the state of our business, financial and sales performance for the quarter, industry comments and other key initiatives. After Dave concludes his comments, Mimi will provide additional commentary regarding the financial results and fiscal year guidance included in the press release issued yesterday that is available from the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website. We will then open the lines for Q&A.\nAs a reminder, this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to multiple factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to multiple risks and uncertainties.\nThe company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements.\nOn this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures are in yesterday's press release.\nI will now turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid B. Foss\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThank you, Vance, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started today, I'd like to welcome the other folks in the room with me, as introduced a moment ago by Van.\nTo begin, I'd like to welcome Mimi Carsley to her first quarterly call with Jack Henry. Mimi has been sitting in the CFO chair for a couple of months now and have spent a good bit of time immersing herself on the details of our business. Of course, you'll hear from her in a bit, and I'm happy to have the opportunity to introduce her for the first time to all of you.\nAdditionally, I'd like to welcome our President and Chief Operating Officer, Greg Adelson, to his first earnings call. Many of you know Greg from our Investor Day and other events. Greg will be a participant in these calls going forward. But today, he will primarily focus on answering any questions regarding our recent Payrailz acquisition.\nAnd last, I'd like to welcome Vance Sherard to his first earnings call. As you probably know, Vance was recently promoted to Vice President of Investor Relations, and he will host these calls every quarter going forward.\nWith that, let's move to the update section of our call. As I noted in the press release, I'm very pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth for our company. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for the quarter. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, total revenue increased 8% for the quarter and also increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were up slightly as compared to the prior year quarter.\nTurning to the segments. We had another solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 6% for the quarter and also increased by 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment again performed very well, posting an 8% increase in revenue this quarter and a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had another strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with an 8% increase in revenue this quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis.\nAs I've discussed previously, our first quarter is normally our lightest sales bookings quarter because our fourth quarter tends to be extremely strong, and the sales pipeline is depleted as a result. As you may recall, the June quarter was the strongest sales quarter in the history of the company, so we certainly expected that historical trends hold true.\nThis year, however, although sales bookings didn't set a record, they were up by double digits over the prior year quarter with many notable wins. In the quarter, we booked 6 competitive core takeaways and 5 deals to move existing in-house customers to our private cloud environment. As some of you may recall, we started last year with 6 core wins and ended with a total of 52 for the year.\nAlthough I can't predict our full year performance with any certainty, the pipeline gives us optimism that we're likely to see that kind of trend this year as well. We continue to see success with our card processing solution, signing 9 new debit processing clients this quarter and 1 new credit client. We also continue to see remarkable success signing clients to our Banno Digital suite, with 60 new contracts in Q1.\nSpeaking of our digital suite, at the end of Q1, we were hosting approximately 8.3 million registered users on the platform, and that number is now growing at almost 200,000 users per month. At the end of Q1 last year, we had about 6 million registered users on the platform, so we've experienced more than a 38% increase in the intervening 12 months.\nWe are currently expecting to have the Banno business offering generally available in early 2023, providing another avenue to increase the number of Banno users. The Banno Digital suite continues on the path to becoming the industry-leading digital banking solution in our markets.\nThe continued success we've seen with sales and adoption of our digital suite is consistent with the expectations coming out of the Bank Director Technology survey published in August. As they do every year, Bank Director surveyed hundreds of their subscribers during June and July regarding a variety of technology prioritization and spending topics. More than 50% of the responses they received were from bank CEOs and/or Board members, and more than 80% of the respondent banks were greater than $500 million in assets.\nAlthough this survey didn't predict spending for 2023, it did highlight that the median increase in expected technology spending this year was 11% as compared to the prior year. One of the interesting items from this year's survey was the analysis of technology in use by respondent banks as it relates to their ability to serve different generational groups.\nFully 93% of the respondents said they had the technology in place to serve baby boomers, but only 25% said they have the necessary technology in place to effectively serve Gen Z-ers. Of course, it's the younger generations that expect to conduct all banking services without ever entering a branch.\nClearly, the initiative for all banks to get to a digital presentation layer has a long way to go. All of this bodes well for the future of our digital suite as well as the other innovative solutions offered by Jack Henry, which help facilitate an improved customer experience through a digital front door at the financial institution.\nOn August 9, we announced a definitive agreement for Jack Henry to acquire Payrailz, and we completed the deal on August 31. Payrailz accelerates Jack Henry's technology modernization strategy by immediately adding next-generation digital payment capabilities to our public cloud-native technology stack and payments ecosystem. Payrailz also enhances Jack Henry's payments-as-a-service strategy, enabling clients to simplify the complexity of payments, modernize their existing payments channels and remain at the center of their account holders' payment experiences.\nAcquiring Payrailz has strengthened our position in the payment space by providing our collective clients with additional functionality, optionality and flexibility that enhances their diverse digital and payment strategies. To that end, in mid-October, we announced the launch of a stand-alone person-to-person payment solution that further supports our real-time payment strategy. This offering is available for stand-alone implementation or as a strategic component of the full Payrailz payments platform.\nIn addition to the Payrailz acquisition, we recently announced the release of our new financial crimes defender application, an expanded partnership with Mastercard, and a new relationship with Google. We're excited about these key relationships with Mastercard and Google and look forward to continuing the rollout of Financial Crimes Defender. All of these announced solutions and relationships support our ongoing mission to supply our community and regional financial institution clients with leading-edge public cloud-native financial technology offerings.\nAs many of you know, we normally conduct our 2 largest client conferences in the fall each year. This year, we combined those conferences into 1 in-person event in San Diego called Jack Henry Connect. We hosted thousands of attendees at the conference, giving us the opportunity to interact directly with many of our existing clients and prospects. Of course, events like this not only present a wonderful opportunity for relationship building and education, but they also generate a significant number of new sales leads.\nDuring the Connect conference, I hosted our Annual CEO forum, attended this year by more than 200 client CEOs. Although we didn't conduct a formal survey during the meeting, the general feedback was that the attendees are concerned about the general economy, but committed to using technology to position their businesses for the future.\nLast month, we were proud to be included in Newsweek's list of top 100 Most Loved Workplaces. Jack Henry ranked 17th overall and second in the financial services category. The ranking came as a result of a survey conducted by Newsweek of almost 1.5 million employees at thousands of companies, large and small.\nThe list recognizes companies that put respect, caring and appreciation for their employees at the center of their business model. This is an incredible honor for us in no small part because this list focused on several qualities which we aspire every day: collaboration and teamwork, opportunities for advancement, transparency, corporate citizenship and how our company lives up to its own stated values.\nIn addition to understanding the need to treat our employees well, we recognize that business risk resulting from climate change constitutes a key component of our risk management responsibility. Our TCFD-aligned disclosure is included in Jack Henry's 2022 sustainability report and details our assessment of Jack Henry's climate-related risks from acute and chronic physical risks to transition risks like greenhouse gas emissions and regulation. I encourage you to visit our corporate responsibility website via the Investor Relations tab for more information about our ESG efforts and to review our published sustainability reports.\nAs Mimi will highlight in her comments, we recently sold one of our facilities in San Diego. This sale was the result of our ongoing efforts to analyze what our facility requirements will be in the future. We continue to evaluate the best operating model for our company as it relates to remote versus in-office work. As a result, we are not anticipating any significant reduction in our physical footprint at this time. We instead plan to make slower incremental changes that align with our go-forward workforce strategy.\nNext week, we will conduct our Annual Shareholder Meeting, and we'll again be hosting this meeting in-person in Monett. We are excited to be able to meet with our shareholders in person, but we're also very aware of the ongoing pandemic-related concerns that arise when you assemble a group of people. With this in mind, we will once again offer an option to observe remotely for those who wish to listen without attending the meeting.\nDespite the uncertainty caused by the economic challenges we're all dealing with today, let me remind you of a few of the fundamentals about our company, fundamentals we emphasize regularly in our discussions with investors and analysts. First, slightly more than 90% of our non-GAAP revenue is recurring in nature, and most of it is tied to long-term contracts for critical processing systems.\nSecond, we have a very manageable amount of debt on the balance sheet, and we continue to operate with a solid cash position. Third, we have paid quarterly dividends since 1991, increasing them 33x over that same period, and we continue to be committed to our dividend policy moving forward. Fourth, we have an extremely engaged workforce, as we've seen in our employee engagement survey results and Best Place to Work awards.\nFifth, our clients are generally well capitalized and, as evidenced by the survey I stated earlier, we're continuing to increase their investment in modernizing their technology infrastructure. And finally, remember that we weathered the financial crisis 15 years ago with very few bumps or bruises, and it's highly unlikely that any near-term economic uncertainty results in a similar level of financial institution impacts.\nAs we move forward, I remain extremely optimistic regarding our levels of sales activity and customer responses to the solutions we're delivering and the strategies we are executing. We will continue with our disciplined approach to running the company, and we expect that approach to continue to provide stability and solid performance for our employees, customers and shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mimi for some detail on the numbers.\n\nMimi Carsley\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dave. Good morning. I appreciate this opportunity to speak with everyone for the first time as Jack Henry's CFO. Having spent my career at the intersection of finance and technology, I'm thrilled to be at such a highly regarded company with a focus on delivering shareholder value. As highlighted by Dave's comments, Jack Henry has had a successful first quarter, and I'll share some color on the financial details driving those results. Total revenue was up 8% for the quarter, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.\nSo let's jump into the details. Services and support revenue increased 8% in the quarter. Deconversion revenue was up $800,000 for the quarter. Consistent with previous guidance, we expect approximately $35 million in deconversion revenue this fiscal year, and it's expected to be heavier in the second half. However, forecasting deconversion revenue is always challenging.\nOur private and public cloud offerings showed robust growth in the quarter, growing 10%. Product delivery and services revenue grew 11% in the quarter, impacted by the return of our in-person user group conference and higher consulting activities, offset by slightly lower implementation revenue.\nNon-GAAP total support and services revenue grew 7% for the quarter. Processing revenue increased 10% on a GAAP basis and 9% on a non-GAAP basis in the quarter. The increase was primarily driven by higher card volumes. Additionally, digital revenue continues to show rapid growth, led by strong demand for our Banno Digital platform.\nNow turning to costs. Cost of revenue was up 8%, with card costs in line with card revenue, higher personnel, licensing and amortization expense, partly offset by a decrease in labor cost deferrals. Research and development expense increased 23%, primarily due to higher personnel costs.\nSG&A rose 12%, driven by increases in travel, personnel, consulting, professional services and meeting-related expenses, partly offset by the gain on the sale of assets. The increase in meeting expense was due to both our first in-person user group conference since fiscal '20 and the consolidation of our 2 user group events. Expenses for the consolidated conference were solely in the first quarter instead over the first 2 quarters, and this will be the norm going forward.\nWe concluded Q1 with strong results, delivering net income growth of 4%, with fully diluted earnings per share of $1.46. For transparency, the impact from the gain on sale of assets, the Payrailz acquisition and deconversion fees are shown as part of the non-GAAP adjustments in the press release.\nNow turning our attention to cash flow. Operating cash flow increased to $137 million for the quarter, primarily due to a higher collection of accounts receivables. As a reminder, our cash flow is impacted by the collection of annual maintenance in Q1 and Q4 so the conversion accelerates at both the beginning and end of the fiscal year. Currently, total R&D spending is slightly elevated due to the integration of Payrailz that should normalize by the end of the fiscal year.\nFree cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software, adding back net proceeds from disposal of assets, was $116 million or 109% -- 109% conversion. Jack Henry has been a responsible steward of our investors' capital, and as the new CFO, I can assure you that our capital allocation strategy will remain fundamentally consistent.\nWe are committed to maintaining ample operating liquidity, reinvesting for growth, evaluating strategic acquisitions, paying dividends and opportunistically repurchasing our stock. This strong dedication to value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 23.2% or 170 basis point increase.\nTo provide some extra color on the quarter's acquisition, as Dave mentioned, the strategic Payrailz acquisition closed on August 31, thus, the current quarter includes 1 month of results. The purchase price was $230 million, and Payrailz is expected to contribute approximately $12 million in revenue to Jack Henry's fiscal '23.\nThe $0.22 GAAP dilutive impact for fiscal '23 is driven by operations, incremental interest and amortization. As previously mentioned, the acquisition is expected to become GAAP accretive to fiscal '24. Focusing ahead, let me share updated guidance.\nWe provided transparent GAAP and non-GAAP full year guidance in the press release. The GAAP guidance is now inclusive of the Payrailz acquisition and the gain on asset in addition to deconversion revenue. GAAP revenue growth for fiscal '23 is now expected to be 7.7% to 8%, driven by the acquisition of Payrailz as there is no change in our deconversion fee outlook. Guidance for non-GAAP revenue growth remains unchanged at 8.2% to 8.6%.\nOutlook for the full year GAAP operating margin of approximately 23% impacted by both the gain on sale of assets and the acquisition. Full year non-GAAP operating margin guidance remains unchanged at relatively flat year-on-year. We remain very focused on returning to margin expansion in fiscal '24. Full year GAAP EPS guidance is now a range of $4.90 to $4.94.\nOur sequential quarterly cadence for non-GAAP revenue growth is expected to decelerate slightly in the second quarter when compared to current analyst estimates and then rebound with sequential increases in both the third and fourth quarters to achieve our full year guidance targets. The trend is similar for non-GAAP operating margin.\nBut while the second quarter will see a decrease on a year-on-year basis, it will not be the same level seen in the first quarter, allowing us to achieve our full year guidance targets. Based on a solid first quarter results, continued disciplined execution and near-term visibility of continued momentum, we are on track to meet our non-GAAP revenue growth and operating margin guidance.\nSo in closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to best serve our financial institutions and their clients, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. We thank all of our investors for their continued confidence in Jack Henry.\nChuck, will you please open the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please also note, today's event is being recorded.\nAnd at this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Mr. Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nKevin D. Williams\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jamie. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for the Jack & Henry Associates Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year-End 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer. And on the call with me today is David Foss, Board Chair and CEO.\nIn a minute, I'll turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the state of our business, financial and sales performance for the quarter and year, comments regarding the industry in general and some key initiatives that we have in place. Then after Dave concludes his comments, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market close and provide comments regarding our guidance for fiscal year 2023, which was also provided in the press release. We will then open the lines up for Q&A.\nFirst, I need to remind you that this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties.\nThe company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements.\nOn this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found in yesterday's press release.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid B. Foss\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're very pleased to share details with you for a quarter that produced record revenue and operating income as well as record sales bookings. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our fourth quarter and for the entire fiscal year.\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, total revenue increased 7% for the quarter and increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were down about 37% as compared to the prior year quarter. As a reminder, although a reduction in deconversion fees impacts the quarter negatively, it is a long-term positive for our business.\nTurning to the segments. We had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 8% for the quarter and increased by 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment performed well, posting a 5% increase in revenue this quarter and a 5% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a very robust quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with a 9% increase in revenue this quarter and a 10% increase on a non-GAAP basis.\nAs I highlighted in our press release, the fourth quarter was the strongest sales quarter in the history of the company. Those of you who follow us closely will know that in the fourth quarter of 2021, we set an all-time sales record. We broke that record in the second quarter of fiscal '22, and now we've broken that new record in the fourth quarter. Additionally, in the third quarter of this year, we exceeded our highest-ever Q3 sales payment by around 40%.\nAll in all, this has been a remarkable year for the sales teams. To provide a little detail regarding sales successes in the quarter, we booked 17 competitive core takeaways, with 5 of those being multibillion-dollar institutions. Additionally, we signed 18 deals to move existing on-premise customers to our private cloud environment.\nSeveral of our complementary offerings also saw a very strong demand in the quarter with, as you might guess, our digital suite leading the pack. We signed 48 new clients to our Banno Digital Platform in the quarter and 21 new clients to our card processing solution. For the full year, we signed 52 competitive core takeaways, with 10 of them greater than $1 billion in assets.\nAdditionally, we signed 54 contracts to move on-premise core clients to our private cloud, 165 new Banno Digital customers and 58 new clients for our core processing -- for our card processing solution. Of course, we signed a variety of other contracts for many of our other solutions as well, but it's important to note that almost all of these contracts represent long-term recurring revenue equipments to Jack Henry for a wide variety of our solutions.\nOur Annual Client Conference is scheduled for the end of this month, and I'm very happy to say we already have 56 core prospects signed up to attend and hopefully finalize their decision to move to Jack Henry. In case you missed that, I'm going to repeat that. At our Annual Client Conference at the end of this month, we have 56 core prospects signed up to attend and work with our sales organization.\nAt our analyst conference in May, I shared with the attendees that we had just surpassed 7.2 million registered users on our Banno Digital Banking Platform. As of the end of the fiscal year, we were at roughly 7.7 million registered users. As a point of reference, on July 1, 2020, we had about 3.2 million registered users. So in 2 years, we've seen an increase of almost 150% in our user count. This is significant because, as I've stressed in the past, most of the revenue for a business like this is tied to the number of users on the platform.\nOn August 9, we announced the definitive agreement for Jack Henry to acquire Payrailz with an expected closing of August 31. Payrailz accelerates Jack Henry's technology modernization strategy by immediately adding next-generation digital payment capabilities to Jack Henry's technology stack and payments ecosystem. Payrailz also enhances Jack Henry's payments-as-a-service strategy, enabling clients to simplify the complexity of payments, modernize their existing payment channels and remain at the center of their account holders' payment experiences.\nToday, Jack Henry supports the growing demand for payments-as-a-service with a virtual payments hub that consolidates money-moving solutions and supports numerous payment channels and types. Payrailz strategically complements this hub with its extensive capabilities for consumer and commercial bill pay, real-time person-to-person payments, account-to-account transfers, business-to-customer payments account and more. Acquiring Payrailz will strengthen Jack Henry's position in the payments space by providing our collective clients with additional functionality, optionality and flexibility that enhances their diverse digital and payment strategies.\nHopefully, you've all seen the August 1 announcement about our corporate rebranding. As we move forward, rather than using Symitar, ProfitStars and Jack Henry Banking as unique brands, you will see us go to market as simply Jack Henry. We believe that uniting the brands reflects Jack Henry's role as a well-rounded financial technology provider and an advocate for community and regional financial institutions.\nOur new brand is the outcome of the work we are doing to modernize our technology, streamline operations and operate as one company, which we believe will result in a better client experience. We now have a platform to speak from a single, consistent voice as we continue to help community and regional financial institutions, strengthen connections with account holders by offering a full array of solutions and access to a wide network of fintech partners.\nAs many of you know, Jack Henry is regularly named as the Best Place to Work in various publications around the country. Recently, we were thrilled to be named by LinkedIn as a Top 10 Best Place to Work in financial services. Our consistent placement on Best Place to Work lists is a testament to the workplace culture we have at Jack Henry, and our employee engagement scores reflect that strong culture.\nAdditionally, we began a continuous listening strategy this year to gather feedback from our associates, and I'm pleased to share that overall, our participation rate was greater than 65%. We achieved an engagement capital score of 79%, and 87% of our employees say that they believe in Jack Henry's values, all well above industry benchmarks.\nAs we shared at the beginning of August, we have now completed a comprehensive search and have named a new CFO effective on September 1. Mimi Carsley joined our finance team on July 1 and has been busy coming up to speed on the Jack Henry story and financials for the past several weeks. As we stated in the press release, she comes to us with more than 30 years of financial industry experience, but also has a strong technology background.\nMimi will be traveling with our Director of Investor Relations, Vance Sherard, in September to meet with a number of investors and analysts, and I expect that she will lead this call in November. Of course, with the addition of Mimi, we are now prepared to wish Kevin a happy retirement. Kevin has been very accommodating through the search process by delaying his intended retirement date until he was confident that we had found a replacement who could help us build the company for the future.\nAs many of you know, Kevin has been with Jack Henry for almost 25 years, but his association with our company goes back well over 30 years. During that time, he has had a tremendous impact on our execution and our success. I'd like to take this opportunity on behalf of all Jack Henry associates, customers and shareholders to thank Kevin for everything he's done to make us so successful for these many years. You will be missed, Kevin.\nAs I reflect back on fiscal 2022, I can confidently say it was a very good year for our company. Our employee engagement scores remain high, and our levels of customer engagement and customer satisfaction scores are also very high. We have successfully completed several leadership and Board-level retirements and replacement and expect these new members of our leadership teams to continue our track record of success.\nOur sales teams are performing extremely well and have positioned us for another successful year. And overall demand for Jack Henry technology solutions remains high in all segments of our business. We have a commitment to doing the right thing for our constituents that we believe will continue to serve us well. We will continue with our disciplined approach to running the company and expect that approach to help provide stability for our employees, customers and shareholders.\nAs we begin the new fiscal year, I continue to be very optimistic about our future. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers.\n\nKevin D. Williams\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dave. Our service support revenue increased 7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the same quarter a year ago, with fee conversion revenue being down $3 million in the quarter compared to last year's quarter. It was slightly higher than what we thought it would be, but still down 37% from a year ago.\nLicense, hardware and implementation revenue combined were actually up $5 million or 12% compared to the prior year quarter. Our data processing hosting fees in our private and public cloud offerings, which continue to show strong growth in the quarter compared to the previous year, growing by 11% for the quarter.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, total support and service revenue grew 8% for the quarter compared to the prior year. Our processing revenue increased 8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the same quarter last year on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The increase is primarily driven by slightly higher card volumes. And digital revenue continues to show strong growth as demand for our Banno Digital Platform continues to be very strong.\nTotal revenue was up 7% for the quarter on a GAAP basis and increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Our cost of revenue was up 4% compared to last year's third quarter. This increased primarily due to higher costs associated with customer maintenance and license costs, card processing and higher personnel costs compared to a year ago.\nOur research development expense increased 18% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the same prior year quarter. The increase is primarily due to personnel and consulting costs. And SG&A expense increased 16% in the fourth quarter. And this increase is primarily again due to increased personnel costs, which includes commissions and travel-related costs compared to last year.\nOur reported consolidated operating margins were essentially flat at 21.5% on a non-GAAP basis. Our operating margins expanded from 20.1% last year to 20.9% this year for a nice margin expansion on a non-GAAP basis.\nThe effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 increase to 21.8% compared to 19.7% in the same quarter a year ago, primarily due to timing effects of deductions. Our net income grew 5% to $80.4 million for the fourth fiscal quarter compared to $76.9 million last year, with earnings per share of $1.10 for the current quarter compared to $1.04 last year.\nFor cash flow, our total amortization increased 2.9% for the year-to-date compared to last year, primarily due to capitalized software projects being placed into service in the prior year. Included in the total amortization is the amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to $16.3 million this year compared to $17.7 million last year. Depreciation actually decreased 3.2% compared to the prior fiscal year.\nOur operating cash flow was $504.6 million for the fiscal year, which was up from $462 million last year, was primarily due to increased net income of $51.4 million compared to the previous year. We invested $191.4 million back into our company through CapEx, purchase and capitalized software. Our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software and adding back net proceeds from disposal of assets, was actually $313.3 million. This represents 86% conversion in net income.\nThere were 2 primary working capital items that were responsible for this. Our receivables were up $35 million compared to the year ago. However, a little over 1/3 of this is an increase -- is due to increased average monthly billings for recurring revenue, which are average monthly billings, continues to grow. And then the balance is due primarily to the timing of collections, especially our annual maintenance. I will say that our annual maintenance as of last Friday is right in line with where it was a year ago, so we did catch up ground in July and August.\nThe other item -- of working capital item was prepaid expense and other, which increased $26 million, which $20 million of this increase is due to prepaid commissions related to the strong contracting that we had in the previous year -- or in this year, I'm sorry. And the other -- the balance was primarily due to prepaid cost of products. Without the impact of these 2 working capital items, our free cash flow conversion from net income would have been greater than 100%.\nDuring the year, we spent $193.9 million to purchase 1.25 million shares for the treasury. We paid dividends of $139.1 million for a total return to shareholders of $333 million in fiscal FY '22.\nA couple of comments on our balance sheet as of June 30. Cash position of $48.8 million compared to $51 million a year ago, pretty much in line. Our revolver balance was up a little to $115 million compared to $100 million a year ago. Our return on average assets for the trailing 12 months is 15.1%. Our return on average equity for the trailing 12 months is 26.9%, and return on invested capital for the trailing 12 months is 24.9%, which we are very proud of those key metrics.\nFor FY '23 guidance, we provided both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance in the press release yesterday for fiscal 2023. We also provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP revenue in the release following the segment information. However, just to be clear, this guidance is based on today's environment. And if things were to change significantly, then this guidance will also be revised.\nAlso, just to be clear, this guidance does not include the impact of the recently announced acquisition of Payrailz that is scheduled to close later this month. So there is no financial impact in this guidance from that future potential acquisition.\nFor GAAP revenue growth for fiscal '23, based on the announcement we released yesterday, our revenue guidance reflects revenue growth of approximately 7.2% over fiscal '22, which this anticipates deconversion revenue will decrease by approximately $18 million from $53 million, down to $35 million compared to FY '22. And this is based on what we're seeing on the current activity on the M&A front.\nFor non-GAAP revenue growth, our initial guide for FY '23 is approximately 8.4% and 8.5%, which is down slightly from the non-GAAP revenue growth we saw in FY '22 of 8.8%. But obviously, for many parts of our business, implementation, convert/merge and even payments, we had a little easier comp in FY '22 compared to FY '21 than we will have in FY '23. So we are very happy to report that we are guiding to close to 8.5% non-GAAP revenue growth.\nInitial guide for GAAP operating margin for FY '23, it will decrease from 24.4% to approximately 23.7% in '23. And this is primarily due to the anticipated decrease in deconversion revenue because, obviously, deconversion revenue has extremely high margins. Our initial guide for non-GAAP operating margin is projected to be essentially flat at approximately 22.7% for FY '23.\nSome reasons for this projected flat operating margins because there's been some things that changed since the first week of May when we talked about guidance: continued headwinds on license revenue is now 67% of our core customers are in our private cloud; our annual Education Conference, which Dave mentioned later this month, is going to be in person, so there will be some significant expense there that we have not seen in the last 2 years; continued increased cost of third-party processors and other vendors; continued increase in insurance, especially cyber, E&O and health, which I'm sure most of your customers are seeing; increased compensation expense to attract and retain talent in this tough environment; increased facility costs as we now have a return-to-office date of 9/6/22; cost of cybersecurity continues to increase to protect our customers' employees; and then just travel costs have increased significantly.\nJust for our employees, our last month travel airline tickets on average have increased 58% from February. Hotel rooms, on average, last month increased 32% since February. And then, obviously, as we all have noticed, increase in both costs of meals and rental cars since (inaudible). Therefore, even though this guidance is less than the 50 bps of expansion we talked about the first week of May, the environment has changed, and it continues to change significantly.\nObviously, we try to be conservative in our guidance. As you all know, I have always lived under the philosophy to underpromise and overdeliver. And hopefully, that's what this guidance is going to provide.\nOur effective tax rate for FY '23 is projected to increase to approximately 23.8%. But some states have gotten a little more aggressive, and the benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, other than the decreased federal tax rate, have now been fully utilized over the last 4 years. Our FY '23 GAAP EPS guidance is a range of $5.05 to $5.09.\nThis now concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions. Jamie, will you please open the call lines up for questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin D. Williams\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry & Associates Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer. And on the call with me today is David Foss, Board Chair and CEO.\nIn just a minute, I will turn the call over to Dave, so he can provide some of his thoughts about the state of our business, financial and sales performance for the quarter, some comments regarding the industry in general and some other key initiatives that we have in place. Then after Dave concludes his comments, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market close and also provide comments regarding our updated guidance for the remainder of our fiscal year 2022. We will then open the call -- open the lines up for Q&A.\nFirst, I need to remind you that this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements.\nFor a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements.\nAlso on this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found in yesterday's press release.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid B. Foss\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to report another quarter of revenue and operating income growth and an overall solid performance by our business. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our third fiscal quarter.\nFor Q3 of fiscal 2022, total revenue increased 10% for the quarter and increased 7% on a non-GAAP basis. As projected on our last call, deconversion fees were up more than $13 million over the prior year quarter.\nTurning to the segments. We again had a good quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased 12% for the quarter and increased by 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment performed very well, posting a 10% increase in revenue this quarter and a 9% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with a 10% increase in revenue this quarter and a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis.\nAs I mentioned in the press release, our core sales teams again had an extremely solid quarter and we continue to see core activity consistent with our pre-pandemic run rate. During the quarter, we inked 14 competitive core takeaways, so we continue at the approximately 1 deal per week run rate I've discussed on recent calls. In addition to our success signing new core clients, we signed 9 existing on-prem core customers to move to our private cloud environment.\nIn addition to the tremendous success we experienced in our core business this quarter, we continued to sign new clients to our digital banking suite. During the third quarter, we signed 38 new clients to our Banno platform, and we continue to see increased interest in this offering as well as the rest of our digital suite.\nOn our last quarterly call, I mentioned that the sales team set an all-time sales booking record in our fiscal Q2. Although we didn't break that record in Q3, we did set a record for the strongest Q3 in history with sales bookings coming in almost 40% higher than the same quarter last year. This extraordinary sales performance in a quarter that is normally lighter than others is reflective of the interest in our company and demand for Jack Henry technology solutions in our market.\nRegarding our Banno Digital suite, as of March 31, we have just over 7.1 million users live on the Banno Platform. We continue to enjoy the highest consumer rating in the App Store, and we are regularly recognized as the fastest application in the industry. As I've said before, I expect our success in this area to grow as we continue to add new functionality and features to the platform.\nOn our last quarterly call, I shared an announcement regarding our technology modernization strategy and how we believe it will help position our clients for greater success in the future. As many of you know, that announcement has been received very positively by many experts in our industry, and our strategy has been highlighted in a wide variety of publications. Several pieces are still in production, but so far, we've been interviewed for close to 40 different articles, podcast interviews and video podcasts for publications with a combined subscriber base of more than 53 million people.\nHopefully, you've all seen the new corporate sustainability report that we published on March 31. I think it's an excellent representation of the key initiatives and accomplishments we've been working on since we published our last report more than a year ago. In this new report, we provided more detail on the demographic makeup of our workforce, a summary of our employee engagement survey results, more information about our data privacy and cybersecurity practices and a significantly enhanced update on climate-related risks.\nThis year's report also includes an appendix with detailed disclosures aligned with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB, and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure, or TCFD. We continue to make great strides in the key areas of ESG and are committed to providing more detailed information about our progress over time.\nAlthough you regularly see Jack Henry recognized as the best place to work in various contests around the country, we received 2 new designations last quarter that recognize us as a company that isn't simply an outstanding employer. Inc. Magazine recognized us as one of America's best led companies and Newsweek recognized us as one of America's most responsible companies. Both awards are great recognition for our ongoing commitment to do the right thing for all of our Jack Henry stakeholders.\nAs we announced a few months ago, Ted Bilke will be retiring at the end of June after 17 years with our company. Ted ran the Symitar division for many years but shifted to become our Chief Technology Officer a few years ago to help us define and finalize our technology modernization strategy. Our modernization strategy benefited significantly from Ted's years of experience speaking directly with our customers about their technology wants and needs. I'd like to thank Ted for his many years of leadership and for helping us to drive consistent success for our customers and shareholders.\nAs you are also aware, we've been working to find a new CFO so Kevin can enjoy a much deserved retirement. That process has been slower than I had hoped, but we expect to name a new CFO in the near future. Kevin has graciously agreed to stay with us until we're ready to make the transition, so we still have no formal departure date for him.\nToday, however, we're announcing that Renee Swearingen has been named Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for Jack Henry. Renee has been with the company for more than 25 years and is a key leader on our management team. You'll see a press release with this announcement later today, but I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Renee and thank her for her partnership for these many years.\nAs we look forward to the end of our fiscal year, our sales pipeline is very strong, and we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our customers, our ability to expand our customer relationships, the spending environment and our long-term prospects for success. I look forward to seeing and chatting with many of you at our Investor Day in Dallas next Monday.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers.\n\nKevin D. Williams\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dave. Our service and support revenue increased 11% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the same quarter a year ago. As Dave mentioned, our deconversion revenue was up $13.1 million for the quarter compared to last year's quarter. License, hardware and implementation revenue combined were essentially flat compared to the prior year and our data processing hosting fees in our private and public cloud offerings, which continue to show strong growth in the quarter compared to previous year, growing by 11% for the quarter.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, total support and services revenue grew 6% for the quarter compared to the prior year. And just a reminder, that non-GAAP -- essentially the only difference is backing out the deconversion revenue that was recognized in the quarter.\nOur processing revenue increased 9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the same quarter last year on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The increase is primarily driven by higher card volumes and digital revenue continues to show strong growth as demand for our Banno Digital Platform continues to be very strong.\nTotal revenue was up 10% for the quarter compared to last year on a reported GAAP basis and increased 7% on a non-GAAP basis.\nCost of revenue was up 5% compared to last year's third quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with customer maintenance and license costs, card and transaction processing increased in line with the related revenue growth and also higher personnel costs compared to a year ago.\nResearch and development expense increased 12% for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to last year. The increase is primarily due to increased personnel costs this year compared to last.\nAnd SG&A expense increased 13% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter of last year. Again, this increase was due primarily to increased personnel costs and also increased travel-related costs compared to the prior year.\nOur reported consolidated operating margins increased from 21% last year to 23.3% in the current year quarter for a 220 bp increase. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating margins expanded from 20.3% last year to 20.9% this year for a 60 bps expansion. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 increased to 23.6% compared to 21.5% in the same quarter a year ago, which is in line with the guidance we've provided for the year.\nNet income grew 19% to $84.7 million for the third fiscal quarter compared to $71.4 million last year with earnings per share of $1.16 for the current quarter compared to $0.95 last year, for a $0.21 or a 22% increase over the previous year quarter.\nSome comments on cash flow. Our total amortization increased 2.6% for the year-to-date compared to last year due to capitalized software projects being placed in service. Included in total amortization is amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to $12.4 million this year-to-date compared to $13.3 million last year's first 3 quarters of the fiscal year. Depreciation actually decreased 3.7% compared to the first 9 months of the prior fiscal year.\nOperating cash flow was $301.4 million for the year-to-date, which is up from $266.3 million last year, which this is primarily due to increased net income during the first 9 months compared to the previous year and the timing and change of various operating assets and liabilities considered in the calculation of operating cash flow.\nWe invested $145.1 million back into our company through CapEx, purchase and capitalized software.\nOur free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software and then adding back net proceeds from disposal of assets was $156.4 million for the first 9 months of the fiscal year.\nAlso during the first 9 months, we spent $193.9 million to purchase 1.25 million shares for the treasury, none in the current quarter, and we paid dividends of $103.4 million for a total return to shareholders of $297.3 million in the first 9 months of fiscal 2022.\nA couple of comments on our balance sheet. As of June 30, our cash position was $39.8 million compared to $70.1 million a year ago. Our revolver balance was $225 million compared to $200 million a year ago, which the change in cash and our debt balance is primarily related to the 4.1 million shares we've purchased in the last 24 months. Our return on average assets for the trailing 12 months was 16%, our return on average equity for the trailing months was 27.2% and our return on invested capital for the trailing 12 months was 23.4%, all very solid returns.\nFor updated guidance, in the press release yesterday, we provided both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance. We also provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP revenue in the release following the segment information. However, just to be clear, this guidance continues to assume that the country continues to open and the economy continues to improve.\nFor GAAP revenue growth for fiscal '22 based on the amounts in the release yesterday, our revenue guidance continues to reflect a little higher than 10% growth over fiscal '21, which we still anticipate deconversion revenue to be approximately $49 million to $50 million for the entire fiscal year. And as we thought, some of the Q4 actually pulled into Q3 so we are not anticipating very much deconversion revenue in Q4.\nFor non-GAAP revenue growth, we continue to guide to be just under 9% growth for the fiscal year.\nWe continue to anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins to improve a little in FY '22 compared to last year. But again, I continue to be somewhat cautious on guiding too much of a non-GAAP operating margin expansion as we continue to have headwinds on license and hardware revenue as we continue to move more core customers from on-premise to our private cloud. Also, our travel costs continued to increase significantly compared to the prior year. However, we are still comfortable that full year non-GAAP operating margins will expand approximately 50 bps or higher but also a reminder, the highest margin quarter is our Q1 due to software subscriptions in that quarter.\nOur effective tax rate for the year continues to be projected to be slightly higher than 23% compared to the prior year rate. And our updated FY '22 GAAP EPS guidance is now a range of $4.80 to $4.85, which is an increase from the previous guidance of $4.75 to $4.80 a share.\nThat concludes our opening comments, and we are now ready to take questions. Tom, will you please open the call lines up for questions?"

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Jack Henry & Associates Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker for today, Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nKevin D. Williams\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThank you, Olivia. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the Jack & Associates Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. I am Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer. And on the call with me today is David Foss, Board Chair and CEO.\nThe format for our call this morning will be just a little different than our normal format we've typically used in the past. But just a warning, the opening comments will take a little longer than normal. In just a minute, I will turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the state of our business, financial and sales performance for the quarter, comments regarding the industry in general and some other key initiatives that we have in place. Then after Dave concludes his comments, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market closed and provide comments regarding our updated guidance for our fiscal year 2022 provided in the release.\nAt that point, Dave has initial comments and updates that he will make on the press release that we put out Monday morning. Then at the conclusion of those comments, we will then open the lines up for a traditional Q&A.\nFirst, I need to remind you that this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements.\nFor a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements.\nOn this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found in yesterday's press release.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid B. Foss\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our supposed for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our second quarter, while also continuing to deal with the impacts of the ongoing pandemic.\nAs Kevin mentioned in his opening remarks, we're going to conduct today's call a little differently from the cadence of past calls. I'll start with comments regarding the performance of the business in the quarter, then Kevin will share detailed financial results.\nInstead of moving to Q&A after Kevin's comments, however, I'm going to come back and conduct a detailed review with you of an exciting new product technology modernization strategy for our company. This is an important update for you as we believe this strategy, which we've been working on for more than 2 years, will fundamentally find the evolution of our company and our industry. We'll address questions after that strategy review.\nWith that, let's shift our focus to a look at our performance for the quarter we completed in December. As of the end of the quarter, we continue to operate with well over 90% of our employees working full-time remote and continue to evaluate options regarding an appropriate return to office target date. At this time, we have no published date, but we have proven that our business can perform well in a remote posture, so we don't feel any significant pressure to change that.\nFor Q2 of fiscal 2022, total revenue increased 17% for the quarter and increased 11% on a non-GAAP basis. Consistent with our previous guidance, deconversion revenues -- deconversion fees were up almost $25 million over the prior year quarter, which led to the extremely strong gap revenue performance. But you should note that even without the increased deconversion revenue, this was a very strong quarter.\nTurning to the segments. We again had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 15% for the quarter and increased by 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Our Payments segment also performed very well, posting an 18% increase in revenue this quarter and a 13% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with a 17% increase in revenue this quarter and an 11% increase on a non-GAAP basis.\nAs I mentioned in the press release, our sales teams again had a very solid quarter as they booked the largest sales quarter in the history of the company. Those of you who follow us closely will note that our last quarterly sales record was set only 6 months ago. In the second quarter, we inked 15 competitive core takeaways and an additional 15 deals to move existing in-house clients to our private (inaudible).\nAs we've discussed on prior calls, our convert merge backlog is a good indicator for us of what to expect with coming mergers and acquisitions within our base of customers. Our contract volume in this area continues to grow to the point that we have now added one new conversion team on the banking side of our business.\nAdditionally, we will be adding another team next quarter on the credit union side of the business, and we're evaluating adding 1 or 2 more teams in the near future based on ongoing demand. We continue to see good success with our new card processing solution, signing 13 new debit processing clients this quarter and 6 new credit clients. We also continue to see great success signing clients to our Banno digital suite, with 44 new contracts in Q2.\nSpeaking of our digital suite, we are continuing to implement new financial institution clients on the Banno platform at a similar pace to recent quarters. At the end of Q2, we surpassed 6.6 million registered users on the platform, and our Banno platform continues to hold one of the highest consumer ratings in the App Store.\nA couple of weeks ago, we announced a significant promotion for a key member of our leadership team. After more than 10 very successful years with our company, Greg Adelson has been promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer. As I noted in the press release, Greg will retain all of his prior responsibilities as COO, but will now be responsible for leading the recently formed digital and technology office headed by Ben Metz. I would like to congratulate Greg on this well-deserved promotion, and congratulate Ben on his move to his new position. Both will play a major role in our success going forward.\nAs some of you know, we've continued to make major advances with our environmental, social and governance initiatives, and the Board has established a quarterly cadence to discuss matters. Jack Henry's next sustainability report will be published on March 31, and we'll highlight our major advances in this area during the past year. We'll be able to access new report to our sustainability website linked from our Investor Relations site.\nIn January, Cornerstone Advisors published results of their annual survey of bank and credit union executives. According to that study, 84% of the financial institutions in our target market expect to increase their technology spending in 2020 with 24% of them indicating an increase of greater than 10% year-over-year. This correlates with the information we're receiving from other sources, which puts the average expected increase in tech spending for 2022 in our market at greater than 5%. I think pent-up demand is reflected in the continued influx of RFPs we're receiving and the ongoing interest in Jack Henry technology solutions.\nAs we begin the second half of our fiscal year, our sales pipeline is very robust. And we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our clients, our ability to expand our customer relationships, the spending environment and our long-term prospects for success.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers.\n\nKevin D. Williams\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dave. During the quarter, service support revenue increased 18% compared to the prior year quarter, as statement deconversion revenue was up $24.7 million for the quarter compared to last year, license, hardware and immementation revenue combined were actually up 10% compared to the prior year. Our data processing and hosting fees in our private and public cloud offerings continue to show strong growth in the quarter compared to the previous year, growing by 11% for the quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, total support services grew 8% for the quarter compared to the prior year.\nOur processing revenue increased 15% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the same quarter last fiscal year on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The increase was primarily driven by higher card volumes from new customers installed last year and increased debit and credit card usage from existing customers.\nOur Jack Henry digital revenue continues to show strong growth as demand for our Banno digital platform continues to be very strong. Total revenue was up 17% in the quarter compared to last year and on a reported GAAP basis -- I'm reports than it's really hard to hear because of feedback. It's rather difficult.\nOlivia, can you hear us?\n\nOperator\n\nYes, sir, we can hear you, but there are some feedback on the background.\n\nDavid B. Foss\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThe reports I'm getting out is it's impossible to hear.\n\nKevin D. Williams\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nSo Olivia, should I call in on a different line?\n\nOperator\n\nYes, you can try that or would you like me to dial up to you?\n\nKevin D. Williams\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThat's fine.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay.\n\nKevin D. Williams\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nWe're still getting feedback so must be clear.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, I am still hearing feedback on that line. Maybe try from a different line?\n\nDavid B. Foss\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nWe're on a different line.\n\nKevin D. Williams\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nSo Olivia, can you hear us?\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Your voice is clear, but when you speak, it does have some background.\n\nKevin D. Williams\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nBut when you speak, it also has a (inaudible).\n\nOperator\n\nOkay.\n\nDavid B. Foss\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nWhat are you doing to address this? What is some -- we can't do anything wrong.\n\nKevin D. Williams\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nSo Olivia, is somebody on your team doing something to address this?\n\nOperator\n\nYes. I'm not hearing the background sound anymore. And you're pretty load now.\n\nKevin D. Williams\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nOkay. So I have no idea -- Okay. So services and support revenue increased 18% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the same quarter a year ago. As Dave mentioned, deconversion revenue was up $25 million as we sort of guided for the quarter compared to last year's quarter.\nLicense, hardware and implementation revenue combined were actually up 10% compared to the prior year. Our data processing hosting revenue in our private and public cloud offerings continue to show strong growth in the quarter compared to the previous year, growing by 11%.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, total support and service revenue grew 8% for the quarter compared to the prior year. Our processing revenue increased 15% in the second quarter of fiscal '22 compared to the same period last year on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis because all the non-GAAP items are up in support and services line. The increase was primarily driven by higher volumes from new customers installed last year and increased debit and credit card usage from existing customers.\nOur Jack Henry digital revenue continues to show very strong growth as demand for our Banno digital platform continues to be very strong. Total revenue was up 17% for the quarter compared to last year on a GAAP basis and increased 11% on a non-GAAP basis.\nOur cost of revenue was up 10% compared to last year's second quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with customer maintenance and license costs, increased hardware costs, card and transaction processing increased in line with related revenue growth and also higher personnel costs compared to a year ago. Research and development expense increased 12% for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the same prior last year, with this increase was primarily due to personnel costs.\nOur SG&A expense increased 26% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the same quarter. The increase was due primarily again to increased personnel costs and travel costs compared to last year. And last year, we also had a gain on sale of assets, which made for a tougher comp.\nOur reported consolidated operating margins increased from 22.2% last year to 25.4% in the current year for a 320 bps increase. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating margins expanded from 23.3% last year to 21.7% this year for a 40 bp expansion. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased to 23.6% compared to 23.1% in the same quarter a year ago.\nNet income grew 33% to $95.7 million for the second fiscal quarter compared to $72 million last year, with earnings per share of $1.30 for the quarter compared to $0.94 last year for a $0.36 or 38% increase year-over-year. For cash flow, our total amortization increased 2% for the quarter -- or I'm sorry, year-to-date compared to last year due to capitalized software projects being placed into service. Included in total amortization is the amortization of intangibles relating to acquisitions, was this decreased to $8.3 million year-to-date compared to $8.9 million last year.\nDepreciation expense actually decreased 3% compared to the first 6 months of the prior year. Operating cash flow was $197.4 million for the year-to-date, which is up from $194 million last year, which was primarily due to increased net income during the first half compared to the previous year and a timing of -- and change of various operating assets and liabilities considered in the calculation of operating cash flow.\nWe invested $101.1 million back into our company through CapEx, purchase and capitalized software. Our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software and then adding back net proceeds from disposal of assets, was $96.3 million for the first 6 months of fiscal year.\nDuring the first 6 months, we also spent $193.9 million to purchase 1.25 million shares of stock for the treasury. And we paid dividends of $67.7 million in the first 6 months, for a total return to shareholders of $261.6 million in the first half of fiscal 2022.\nA couple of comments on our balance sheet as of June 30. Our cash position of $29.1 million is compared to $147.8 million a year ago. Our revolver balance has a balance of $240 million compared to 0 a year ago, which the change in cash and debt balance is primarily related to the 4.1 million shares purchased in the last 18 months.\nOur return on average assets for the trailing 12 months is 15.2%. Our return on average equity for the trailing 12 months is 24.6%, and our return on invested capital for the trailing 12 months is 22.6%. Also, yesterday, we provided GAAP and non-GAAP updated revenue guidance in the press release. We also provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP revenue in the release following the segment information. However, just to be clear, this guidance continues to assume that the country continues to be open and the economy continues to improve. Obviously, if things were to go differently, than this guidance will be revised.\nFor GAAP revenue growth for fiscal 2022, based on the amounts of the release yesterday, our revenue guidance has been updated to reflect a higher than -- a little over 10% growth over fiscal '21, which we now anticipate deconversion revenue to be approximately $49 million to $50 million for the year. And right now, it appears the Q3 deconversion revenue will be approximately half of the deconversion revenue we saw in Q2.\nIf you remember on the last call, we said that a big percentage of the deconversion fees we saw coming in Q2 and Q3. For non-GAAP revenue growth, we have updated our guide to be just under 9% for the fiscal year. Obviously, these will be updated during the year.\nWe continue to anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins to improve a little in FY '22 compared to last year. But I continue to be somewhat cautious on guidance -- guiding too much of a non-GAAP operating margin expansion as we will continue to have headwinds on license and hardware revenue as we continue to move core customers from on-premise to private cloud. Also, personnel costs and travel costs continued to increase significantly compared to last year.\nHowever, we are still comfortable that full year non-GAAP operating margins will expand approximately 50 bps or a little higher. But also a reminder that the highest margin quarter is now our Q1 quarter due to software subscription revenue under ASC 606.\nOur effective tax rate for FY '22 continues to be projected to be slightly higher than 23% compared to the prior year rate. However, significant changes in the corporate tax structure could change this guidance. Our updated FY '22 GAAP EPS guide is a range of $4.75 to $4.82, which is an increase from the previous guidance of $4.64 to $4.73, which is a 15% to 17% increase over prior year actual EPS.\nI will now turn the call back over to Dave for some detailed comments regarding the technology modernization press release that we put out on Monday morning this week.\n\nDavid B. Foss\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. In this third section of today's call, I'd like to provide all of you with an outline of our product technology modernization strategy.\nThis is not a product announcement. It's a strategy discussion designed to set an expectation regarding the evolution of our company. I won't be sharing any specific sales, revenue or profitability numbers with you today, and I probably won't be able to answer all of your questions.\nI want to be clear about that upfront. I'm sharing this with you today because it's important for you to understand how Jack Henry plans to innovate and remain a leader in our industry for many years to come.\nMany of the recent innovations we've made, and you'll continue to see, are directly tied to this multiyear strategy, and we've got developers working behind the scenes on this new technology for more than 2 years. The strategy we're sharing today further expands upon Jack Henry's highly successful open API digital banking platform.\nBefore we get into the details, let me first set some context for this strategy. You've heard me say many times that we are a well-rounded financial technology company focused on serving the technology needs of community and regional financial institutions. That is our primary audience, and we've been focused on that market for the last 45 years.\nToday, we serve close to 8,500 financial institutions through approximately 300 different solutions, and we have more than 850 fintech providers currently connected into our ecosystem. While other providers in our space have shifted direction in the last few years, we continue to be 100% focused on serving the full and complete financial technology needs of community and regional financial institutions. The reason we and our clients have been successful for so long is we've continued to evolve our business in a measured, thoughtful way to help our clients meet the changing needs of their account holders.\nIn the early days of our company, when people visited branches for their financial needs, our focus was on automating everything that was being done on paper. We refer to that as the first generation of financial technology solutions. Then the Internet came along, and caused disruption, as people begin to move away from visiting local branches due to a desire to conduct more business online.\nWhat did we do then? We made more services available via the Internet to ensure a seamless experience between online, mobile and banking. That was the genesis for the second generation of financial technology. Today, we are at a pivotal point similar to when the Internet was introduced. Things are changing to the point that our industry requires somewhat to innovate a next-generation solution.\nMany nontraditional banks have entered the market blurring the lines between traditional and nontraditional providers, and people have learned how to manage their finances digitally. At the same time, a new hybrid monetary ecosystem has emerged as new currencies like crypto have become more mainstream and are actively traded through platforms like Coinbase. It is also becoming more clear that Central Bank Digital Currencies, or CBDCs, are likely on the near-term horizon, and our clients will need a strategy and technology solution to address customer demand for these options.\nSo why does all this matter? The simple answer is these dynamics are fundamentally changing how people want and expect to bank. This is especially true with the younger generation. A recent (inaudible) report shows that nonbanks now provide 65% of financial relationships for Gen Yers and 69% for Gen Zers. Fewer are going into branches or calling customer service. They expect to do everything digitally.\nThe emergence of new financial apps has created an unprecedented level of financial fragmentation. It's not uncommon for someone to use between 30 and 40 different financial applications and services to address their financial needs. This may be great for some people, but this fragmentation also impacts the ability of people to make informed financial decisions, and that can lead to poor management of their finances.\nFor community and regional financial institutions, this digital transformation presents both upside opportunity and downside risk. To capture the opportunity, our clients need a clear growth strategy focused on the customers and customer niches they will serve. They need a product and services strategy that enables them to provide the best solutions to their customers, while delivering service in a customer's moments of need and relevance. And they need a technology modernization strategy that makes all of this possible even as additional changes occur in the future.\nThat's where we come in. Let's talk about what Jack Henry is doing to help our clients capitalize on this opportunity through our product technology modernization strategy.\nLet me start with our end goal here, and then I'll talk about how we're going to get there. At the highest level, we are focused on developing a single modern open banking platform that enables easy access to a broad ecosystem of Jack Henry solutions and high-grade third-party fintech offerings.\nWhat do we mean by next-generation technology? Essentially, it is technology that is component-based. So services are isolated and able to run independently, giving community and regional financial institutions the ability to customize and build platforms that work best for them and their account holders. This technology that is cloud native, which means it's built on the cloud and not just hosted on the cloud. This is a really important distinction from other public cloud offerings because it enables greater flexibility, faster upgrades and efficient scale.\nIt's technology that is open to allow our clients to have the best of both worlds. They have access to our best-of-breed capabilities and they can have fintechs of their choice into the Jack Henry ecosystem. It's technology that is not tightly coupled to any legacy products, databases or other technologies, and it's technology that is digitally-centric, which puts the financial institution at the center of their customers' financial lives. Over time, we will be applying the same next-generation technology approach to virtually all of our services across the Jack Henry platform.\nThere are 4 parts of our technology modernization strategy. These parts are related, but they are not linear. First, we are redefining the core processing system. Second, we're providing multiple integration options supported by our open philosophy and technology. Third, we're delivering industry-leading capabilities across a single next-generation platform. And fourth, we will operate as more than a core processor by providing a full banking ecosystem.\nLet's talk about each of these 4 areas of focus. The first is to redefine core processing system and what the core messaging system is. Essentially, we are unbundling services that traditionally would be in a core processing system and making them discrete services that can be customized and rebundle. Examples of services that we would unbundle and place in the public cloud are new account opening, wire processing, deposit processing and account servicing.\nSince these services will be housed in a safe, secure cloud environment, we can easily make updates so that they can stay current independent of the other services used by our clients. This benefits our clients in that they will have greater flexibility, options to choose which services make the most sense for them and speed to market. We already have several clients running in a beta testing environment with the first of these unbundled services.\nI want to be clear that rebundling core services in the public cloud is a longer-term strategy. We plan for this to happen in stages over the next few years, and we expect no immediate impact on our existing core processing systems. Over time, Jack Henry clients will be able to choose if they want to use cloud native services and they will not be faced with what we do today as a full core conversion. Meanwhile, we will continue to invest in and service our existing cores at the same rate as in the past.\nThe second part of our strategy is to provide multiple integration options supported by our open philosophy and technology. You've heard me say before that Jack Henry has always operated with an open philosophy, and we are continuing to expand on this.\nA key part of this is integrations and the flow of data between them. We have several data integration options, some of which we've offered for a long time. The newest one is real-time data streaming, which is constant data streaming to all systems on the platform at the same time. Those systems are updated in real time. There is no waiting for information to flow through overnight or for someone to respond to a request. This is essential to support the real-time nature of services like payments and fraud detection.\nThe third part is delivering industry-leading capabilities across a single next-generation platform. We've made significant innovations to our capabilities in many key areas of focus for our clients. You've heard me talk about our success with several of these in the past, including digital banking, our PayCenter Payments Hub, our lending suite and our new financial crime solutions. This third part of our strategy brings all of our best-of-breed capabilities into a single technology platform that has the same look and feel and the same underlying technology infrastructure. This is a big deal. None of the single point solution technology providers can capitalize on the use of this next-generation technology like we can.\nThe fourth part of our strategy is operating as more than a core processor by providing a full banking ecosystem. This is what pulls it all together. We just talked about creating a single technology platform that contains our best-of-breed solutions. This ecosystem goes beyond that by also providing access to leading fintechs and third parties such as Dell, Finicity, Autobooks and Alloys, all through a single platform.\nWe have a significant head start on building this ecosystem because we have 800 -- over 850 integrations completed and are adding more each day. Additionally, we are the only platform provider to have relationships with all 4 major financial data aggregators: Venicity, (inaudible), Yodlee and (inaudible). These companies enable financial institutions to provide their account holders a complete financial picture in a safe, secure way that eliminates screen scraping.\nAdditionally, we currently have relationships with all of the major public cloud providers and are running workloads with all of them today. We will be offering a broad range of selection and/or optionality with each provider as well as private cloud options, bringing the best technology to bear for our clients.\nI know this is a lot of new information. So let's use an analogy to tie all of this together. Think of any traditional core solution as a sport utility vehicle, an SUV. Regardless of who you buy your SUV from, it's still an SUV. It's not a pickup. It's not a luxury car. You can hook a trailer to the back. You can put a luggage carrier on top. You can tint the windows and repaint the exterior, and you have a very nice, very functional SUV, but it's an SUV.\nAll of the core providers in the industry have been in the business for years of selling really nice SUVs. At Jack Henry, for clients who choose to adopt our next-generation technology strategy, this new approach will enable them to choose how they want to customize their vehicle. We'll sell them the frame with a preestablished wheel base, but the buyer can choose whether they want a V8, a V6 or a plug-in hybrid engine. For us, that might mean AWS, Azure or private cloud.\nAdditionally, they can decide if they want an SUV, a pickup or a luxury sedan built on that same frame. They can buy the components if they're built correctly -- but the components from Jack Henry or from another supplier because the components, if they're built correctly, will fit in our vehicle without any modification.\nIn this scenario, fintech solutions are aftermarket add-ons. They can be built right into our ecosystem, leveraging reusable components to give the Jack Henry client a tightly integrated, purpose-built and efficient solution even as some of the components aren't purchased from Jack Henry. This, of course, is an extension of the open philosophy Jack Henry supported for most of our history.\nAlthough we will offer the flexibility for our clients to configure their offering in any number of ways, we believe that because we offer that flexibility and many best-of-breed solutions, most clients who are charging their strategies for the future will want to buy most of the components in a bundle from Jack Henry. If the client wishes to purchase a bundle, just like what we referred to as a core solution today, we will certainly offer them that option. This strategy puts the community and regional financial institution at the center of their customers' financial lives, and it helps address the financial fragmentation I talked about earlier.\nIn the end, our clients will benefit from all of this because they will be able to build, customize and evolve digital experiences and products. They can offer access to leading-edge services and capabilities, whether through Jack Henry or a third party, through a single platform to create a unique value that their competitors simply can't deliver. And they'll offer personal service in moments of need and moments of relevance, so they can sustain their competitive advantage of service and trust.\nI know your first questions will be how much will this cost and what additional revenue will generate, so let me address those. On the cost question, we continue to invest about 14% of our revenue in research and development and technology. That will not change. In fact, I mentioned that we've been investing in this strategy for more than 2.5 years. And we've continued to invest in existing systems while maintaining our 14% spend. We've been able to do that because that 14% commitment is based on a rising revenue number. This is important for our existing loyal base of clients because it means we can continue to support all of our current core and complementary solutions at the same rate as before, even as we invest in this new strategy.\nAs to additional revenue, it's really too early to say. As I said, this is a long-term strategy for us, and it will not happen overnight. That said, there are certain things that we are doing now, such as building out our own capabilities and rolling out new services based on this strategy. And I can tell you that we have already won some new core deals because of this strategy, and we expect that to continue.\nWhy? Because most financial institution CEOs know they need modern technology and they wanted from a company like ours, that has a 45-year track record of delivering and supporting a broad set of capabilities and solutions in a manner that is responsive to their evolving need who offer Banking-as-a-Service options to their customers.\nCommunity and regional financial institutions are the lifeblood of Main Street America. As we've discussed, however, many of them are at across the world. The personal service and experience they are known for is being disrupted by technology as nontraditional financial service providers have entered the market. The way people bank has fundamentally changed, especially for the younger generation. This has created fragmentation as consumers and businesses try to manage their finances across multiple providers.\nAs a well-rounded financial technology company, Jack Henry is in a unique position to provide modern technology and services to help community and regional financial institutions capitalize on this opportunity and strengthen connections with their account holders.\nI believe that 2022 is the most significant year for our company since the early 2000s when we executed our profit start strategy, and that strategy turned into a game changer for us. I sincerely believe that the strategy is right, and the long-term opportunity will be significant for our company and our clients. You should expect to hear a lot more about our work around this strategy as we move forward.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Kevin to introduce Q&A.\n\nKevin D. Williams\n\nCFO & Treasurer, Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dave. What a great update on our strategy, and we are so excited about this. And as Dave mentioned, I'm sure after all that information, you've probably got more questions. We have answers. But again, as Dave said, this is not a short-term thing, this is a long-term strategy for Jack Henry.\nSo with that, this now concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions regarding the quarter or our strategy update that they provided.\nOlivia, will you please open the call lines up for questions."

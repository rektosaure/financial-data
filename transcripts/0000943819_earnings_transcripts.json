Good afternoon to those in the U.S., and good evening to those in Europe and beyond and welcome to ResMed's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Call.\nI'm pleased to report that ResMed delivered another very strong quarter, closing out fiscal year 2025 with excellent results. In our fourth quarter, we achieved 10% year-over-year reported revenue growth and 230 basis points of year-over-year gross margin expansion. We continued our disciplined approach to investments in both research and development as well as SG&A, and we delivered another quarter of very strong free cash flow.\nI'm pleased to report that ResMed delivered another very strong quarter, closing out fiscal year 2025 with excellent results.

Second, we're committed to operational excellence as well as driving ongoing operating leverage. And third, that ResMed is a compelling investment opportunity.\nLast quarter, I spoke to 3 key themes: first, that ResMed generates robust free cash flow and has a very strong balance sheet. Second, we're committed to operational excellence as well as driving ongoing operating leverage. And third, that ResMed is a compelling investment opportunity.\nWe have a strong sturdy ship that can go through the waves and especially amidst the global macro uncertainty that we're seeing around tariffs and trade and so on ResMed has a very smooth path. These themes remain highly relevant here as we discuss our fourth quarter and our fourth quarter results illustrate them well.\nWe have a strong sturdy ship that can go through the waves and especially amidst the global macro uncertainty that we're seeing around tariffs and trade and so on ResMed has a very smooth path. These themes remain highly relevant here as we discuss our fourth quarter and our fourth quarter results illustrate them well.\nSo let me walk through the first of those themes. First, our fiscal year 2025 free cash flow was $1.7 billion, which provides ResMed with significant flexibility to both invest in our business and return capital to our shareholders. On the inorganic growth strategy front, we are focused on finding tuck-in size acquisitions that will help us accelerate towards our ResMed 2030 strategy.\nSo let me walk through the first of those themes.

On the inorganic growth strategy front, we are focused on finding tuck-in size acquisitions that will help us accelerate towards our ResMed 2030 strategy.\nRecent examples include Somnoware which is software for sleep physicians and pulmonary physicians. Ectosense, which has their product, the NightOwl, which is basically a wearable fingertip size sleep -- home sleep apnea test. And just last quarter, we completed the acquisition of VirtuOx. These businesses will help patients move through the sleep care funnel more efficiently. VirtuOx reduces diagnostic delays, it accelerates the rate of people moving from symptom recognition to home sleep apnea testing, and it keeps more patients on the path to treatment.\nRecent examples include Somnoware which is software for sleep physicians and pulmonary physicians.

VirtuOx reduces diagnostic delays, it accelerates the rate of people moving from symptom recognition to home sleep apnea testing, and it keeps more patients on the path to treatment.\nVirtuOx will continue to operate independently under its own brand, and there are no changes that we plan to help providers and physicians will interact with either VirtuOx or ResMed. In the U.S. health care system, physician prescriptions, payer requirements and the need for personalized setup and support make home medical equipment or HME providers, our essential partners in ensuring patients receive and stay on effective therapy.\nVirtuOx will continue to operate independently under its own brand, and there are no changes that we plan to help providers and physicians will interact with either VirtuOx or ResMed. In the U.S. health care system, physician prescriptions, payer requirements and the need for personalized setup and support make home medical equipment or HME providers, our essential partners in ensuring patients receive and stay on effective therapy.\nAnd sleep labs and home sleep apnea testing run from sleep labs is also a huge part of the infrastructure that we work with all day and every day. You will see us continue to selectively invest in our what we call digital sleep health concierge capabilities, including screening protocols, clinical tools, seamless workflows and cloud connected care pathways.\nAnd sleep labs and home sleep apnea testing run from sleep labs is also a huge part of the infrastructure that we work with all day and every day. You will see us continue to selectively invest in our what we call digital sleep health concierge capabilities, including screening protocols, clinical tools, seamless workflows and cloud connected care pathways.\nWe will be looking to expand the diagnostic funnel to keep up with new patient flow coming from 3 sources. One, and most importantly, our own ResMed driven demand generation efforts that I'll talk about later. Two, the greater awareness of sleep apnea that has been generated by the promotion of GLP-1 or GLP-1 medications, particularly to the specific primary care physician groups that they target and we can target as well with education. And three, the accelerating momentum in consumer wearables that are capable of sleep health monitoring as well as some with specific sleep apnea detection capabilities.\nWe will be looking to expand the diagnostic funnel to keep up with new patient flow coming from 3 sources.

I'm pleased to announce that ResMed's Board of Directors, my fellow Board of Directors has authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend for fiscal year 2026. Additionally, we are significantly increasing our targeted share repurchase activity for fiscal year 2026. Brett will discuss both these actions in more detail in his remarks in a few minutes, and they represent the strength of our business.\nWe've also returned significant capital to shareholders in fiscal year 2025 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases that have totaled more than $610 million for the year.

But in addition to that, to also have significant funds available for strategic technology and I would call pathway -- seamless pathway type tuck-in acquisitions.\nResMed's very strong free cash flow affords us the ability to invest in the business through R&D and SG&A expenses but also to pursue our share buybacks and raise our dividend, as I just mentioned.

ResMed has demonstrated a very strong track record of improving and driving gross margin expansion and a pipeline of opportunities to deliver further operating leverage across our business. In the fourth quarter, we achieved 230 basis points of gross margin expansion year-over-year and well over 100 basis points sequentially quarter-over-quarter. And we have more runway left. We'll continue the execution on these opportunities over the course of our fiscal year 2026 that we're just firing up on here, and I'll update you here on this call every quarter as we continue to deliver these results.\nMy second key message relates to our commitment to operational excellence.

We're approaching the official opening of our newest manufacturing location in Calabasas, California. This site will double the size of our current manufacturing footprint in the United States and is designed for us to scale up our U.S.-made product volume over the coming years and leverage the amazing technology capabilities of folks in East L.A. in terms of aeronautical and automotive industries that we use in the field of motor technology and motor manufacturing.\nWe will also continue to evolve our global manufacturing footprint.

In June, we integrated our digital assistant that we call, Dawn, as in the sunrises into myAir in our Australia business to provide personalized 24/7 support to our local users. We plan to have a wider rollout of Dawn on the myAir platform, which is our app that sits on smartphones throughout fiscal year 2026 as we get regulatory approvals and move that technology to the various countries that we operate worldwide.

This technology enables our HME partners to create personal touch points with patients and to ultimately increase long-term adherence of those patients.\nGreater long-term adherence leads to better patient outcomes, happier physicians, lower total cost of care for payers and better resupply volumes that are beneficial for HME providers and obviously, for ResMed. As our trained AI technologies improve with more and more data, we foresee ResMed solutions will transform into proactive, personalized health care companions.\nGreater long-term adherence leads to better patient outcomes, happier physicians, lower total cost of care for payers and better resupply volumes that are beneficial for HME providers and obviously, for ResMed.

In addition to our products, we see multiple applications for AI and GenAI in our business processes.\nResMed is extremely well positioned to turn our over 23 billion nights of respiratory medical data as well as our 3-plus decades of sleep science and sleep medicine knowledge into personalized treatments and personalized insights that integrate seamlessly with wearable data, health data and virtual care. In addition to our products, we see multiple applications for AI and GenAI in our business processes.\nIn our R&D team, the use of agents in verification and validation can reduce development time to a fraction of our prior processes. We're using AI to write test scripts, to diagnose test failures, to write reports, as well as in verification of our product library.\nIn our R&D team, the use of agents in verification and validation can reduce development time to a fraction of our prior processes. We're using AI to write test scripts, to diagnose test failures, to write reports, as well as in verification of our product library.\nWe are also rearchitecting development processes. As one example, we've been able to use AI to develop a human head-shaped variance model to represent a broad range of ethnic groups to run virtual fitting studies. This will allow us to replace what was previously our multiple in-person masked fitting studies that would likely be limited in sample size to maybe 100 people and replace it with a digitized model that can simulate many thousands of people using less time, less planning and less investment dollars. This type of doing more with less resources approach is only accelerating as we expand and broaden our use of AI across the business.\nWe are also rearchitecting development processes.

Earlier this year, we announced a comprehensive ResMed brand evolution strategy and several targeted direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns to build brand awareness and really importantly, to drive undiagnosed patients to seek care. Results to date have been very promising as we are in the early phases of this. But if this is a marathon, our first mile, I'm here in Australia, our first kilometer was a great lap time.\nOur SG&A investments have also continued to show a very strong ROI.

But if this is a marathon, our first mile, I'm here in Australia, our first kilometer was a great lap time.\nWe launched a multi-market campaign targeting sleep health awareness, primarily in countries where we have significant direct market channels, including Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Korea and India. To date, we have seen growing sell-through and delivered a strong return on our advertising spend, or ROAS, as the martech people call it, that is many multiples of the investment we've made.\nWe launched a multi-market campaign targeting sleep health awareness, primarily in countries where we have significant direct market channels, including Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Korea and India.

This effort ran in metropolitan areas in the U.S., very specific ones for several months earlier this year and touched both consumers as well as health care providers. So I think physicians, HMEs, primary care physicians and beyond.\nWe've also had an omnichannel U.S.-based campaign that's been focused on the perception of CPAP therapy.

So people are taking these multiple times. We love to see the repeat CME users. That means the PCPs, the primary care physicians, the GPs, they want to get even deeper into the field of sleep health.\nWe're seeing an increased participation from primary care physicians, we had 20,000 unique primary care physician participants who have taken our courses and those CME courses and over 32,000 courses taken.

This builds on earlier efforts that integrated our RCS finance, human resources, cybersecurity and marketing functions and many more over the last periods. By aligning our people, our workflows, our platforms and our data across the business, we can continue to reduce friction, improve therapy adherence and deliver more personalized and more digital care.\nWe are accelerating the next step of our ResMed 2030 operating model by integrating our revenue and product functions of our residential care software or RCS and sometimes called our SaaS or software as a service business into the broader ResMed organization.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank Bobby for his amazing 13-plus years of dedication and service to ResMed. I personally hired Bobby from a company called ON Semiconductor to join the ResMed Americas commercial team that I was running at the time in 2012. Bobby played a key role in our digital evolution, he was 1 of the first ResMedians to jump into our new RCS business straight after our Brightree acquisition in 2016. We put him as Chief Operating Officer there, almost out the gate.\nIn line with this ResMed 2030 operating model evolution, I would like to announce that Bobby Ghoshal, who is the current Chief Commercial Officer for our RCS business that Bobby will be leaving ResMed today, actually, here, we're in the 1st of August here in Sydney, tomorrow for the U.S. and he's leaving ResMed to become President and Chief Operating Officer of a software business that is not competitive to ResMed and it's in the field of software for urgent care.

And I personally wish probably the best of luck in the next phase of his career journey and his life journey.\nAnd in the year since then, Bobby has helped scale our residential care software business across home medical equipment as well as home health, home nursing and beyond.

We're a compelling investment opportunity amidst what I would call global macro uncertainty. We are delivering products. We're delivering solutions that customers love, and I use customers meaning patients, physicians, providers, payers, and they vote with their wallets. They buy our stuff more than our competitors. And we've been closely monitoring the global trade environment and the evolving regulatory landscape in both Washington, Brussels and Beijing.\nSo one key message before I hand over to Brett's fees remarks is this quarter after quarter, ResMed has demonstrated it is able to consistently both deliver financially and operationally.

And we've been closely monitoring the global trade environment and the evolving regulatory landscape in both Washington, Brussels and Beijing.\nAnd as I noted last quarter, because our products are used to treat patients with chronic respiratory disabilities, they've been subject to global tariff relief for decades, and that has been ongoing and continuing. This affords ResMed the opportunity to remain fully focused on our business and helping the more than 2.3 billion people worldwide that need our help for their sleep apnea or insomnia and their respiratory insufficiency as well as all those needing our market-leading software for health care delivered in their phone -- in their home.\nAnd as I noted last quarter, because our products are used to treat patients with chronic respiratory disabilities, they've been subject to global tariff relief for decades, and that has been ongoing and continuing.

I simply cannot get too specific as CMS has not yet announced any of the details as to what product categories included nor the time frame that they plan for the next round. But during this comment period, I'll remind you of this ResMed has a long-standing track record of engaging constructively with the U.S. government policymakers and industry participants over more than a decade in this area. I'm the incoming Chairman of AdvaMed, which is our U.S. based, but also global advocacy group, and I plan to work with AdvaMed and work with all of our sort of industry groups to help give the right comments to the U.S. government as we go through this process.\nLet me make some brief comments about the competitive bidding program that CMS recently stated that it plans to resume.

We have driven sustained strong top line growth, and we're highly focused on operational execution, as you saw in our gross margin expansion that we delivered this quarter and throughout fiscal year 2025, and we're not done. We have maintained our very strong balance sheet, and that gives us ballast in the boat and flexibility for the future.

My name is Kevin, and I'll be your operator for today's call.\n[Operator Instructions] And also, please note this conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nLet me hand the call over to ResMed's Chairman and CEO, Mick Farrell; for a brief introduction of Salli Schwartz, who recently joined the company as Chief Investor Relations Officer. Mick, please go ahead.\n\nMichael Farrell\n\nThank you, Kevin. I'm very excited to have Salli join the ResMed team, our newest ResMedian. She joined us earlier this week and brings more than 2 decades of experience across capital markets, health care and technology. We look forward to Salli helping us to take Investor Relations to the next level here at ResMed, providing clarity, transparency and long-term alignment amongst current and future investors and all of our stakeholders.\nSo Salli, we're thrilled to have you on board.\n\nSallilyn Schwartz\n\nGlobal Head-Investor Relations & Strategic Capital Management, Moody's Corp.\n\nThanks, Mick. I'm happy to be here, and I look forward to meeting our investors very soon. But first, I want to welcome our listeners to ResMed's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Call. We are live webcasting this call, and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. Our earnings press release and presentations are both available online now.\nDuring today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures that we believe provide useful information for investors. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures with the GAAP reported numbers.\nIn addition, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today.\nI'll now turn the call over to Mick.\n\nMichael Farrell\n\nThank you, Salli, and good morning, good afternoon and good evening to the folks from Asia, here in North America and those in Europe, as we welcome our shareholders around the world and review results for our third quarter of fiscal year 2025.\nI'm excited to report that ResMed delivered another strong quarter, achieving excellent top line and bottom line results. We delivered solid revenue growth, gross margin expansion, both sequentially and year-on-year, very strong free cash flow generation and maintained our disciplined approach to investments in both research and development and SG&A.\nThis performance reflects broad-based momentum and disciplined execution to capture growing demand for our products. Our continued success is driven by our market-leading value proposition with top quality hardware and top-quality software products as well as our expansive digital health software ecosystem, with cloud connected devices, digital health platforms and investments in machine learning, artificial intelligence as well as generative AI technology. Our results are a testament to the work that we do to enhance sleep health, breathing health and health care delivery in the home.\nThanks to the over 10,000 ResMedians who make that happen by delivering products and services to serve patients in over 140 countries worldwide. As the global leader in helping patients with chronic respiratory conditions, we are closely monitoring the evolving global trade environment, particularly in the area of tariffs.\nIn my current role as a Board member at AdvaMed and the current Chair of the International Committee on the AdvaMed Board, we will continue to urge countries around the world to exempt all medical devices from tariffs on a humanitarian basis.\nFor us here at ResMed, the news is even better. I can report that because of the fact that our products are used to treat patients with chronic respiratory conditions, that have been subject to global tariff relief for decades. We have reaffirmed that, that is the case with federal authorities just this month in the current setting. In short, ResMed is very well positioned with exemptions in place for our products that are used to treat sleep apnea and respiratory insufficiency as well as other chronic respiratory conditions.\nIn terms of ResMed's inherent strengths of outperforming our competitors with prior externalities such as the COVID crisis, the supply chain crisis and our ability to ramp up to meet the needs when our competitors simply could not. I will say that our exceptionally strong balance sheet, and our net cash position, our global scale, our accelerating operational efficiency as well as ongoing cost discipline gives us the confidence to not just survive but to thrive whatever the market may bring.\nResMed is all about stability and balance in times like this. Ultimately, we're committed to make sure that sleep therapy, breathing therapy and health care technology that's delivered in the home is both accessible and affordable as well as ensuring that the delivery of our solutions is consistently available for our patients, for our providers and all of the health care partners in our global ecosystem.\nOur Sydney-based and Singapore-based facilities continue to be the core of our manufacturing leadership globally. In addition to that, we will soon open our newest manufacturing location in Calabasas, California. This will double the size of our current manufacturing footprint in the United States of America, serving as the hub of our research and development for our motor technology, increasing the manufacturing capacity of core motor technology even closer to our largest market here in the U.S., and expanding manufacturing of silicone mask cushions, leveraging advanced molding technology that ResMed leads the world in.\nThis facility is designed to scale over the coming years with multiple mask molding cells and more growth as mask manufacturing increases to meet growing U.S. and global demand. And I can tell you, these factories are very automated and very high tech. We're getting -- we're also investing in getting to our products to our home care providers even more efficiently here in the United States. Our largest distribution facility worldwide is our 522,000 square foot campus in Atlanta, Georgia. We also have a West Coast facility just up the road from us here up in Moreno Valley, California.\nOver half of our global research and development investment is now U.S.-based, with tenfold growth in American R&D over this last decade. These investments reflect our leadership, our economic development focus and the health care impact that we have as ResMed right here in the U.S. where we have our global headquarters and where we support our largest global market, the U.S. domestic market.\nResMed is an innovation machine, and our ongoing investments of over 6% to 7% of revenues into research and development is a key growth driver of our long-term success. I'm proud that we have been recognized for these market-leading efforts as we were named in the LexisNexis list of the Top 100 Global Innovators. This award is given to market-leading companies that are driving pioneering innovation in the global economy.\nWe continue to introduce new technology to our customers in the third quarter because it's nice to get awards. But as my father, the founder of ResMed says, innovation is when customers actually pay for it. This quarter marked the first full commercial rollout of NightOwl in the United States. NightOwl is a fingertip sized home sleep apnea test that is being used by physicians, sleep labs as well as independent diagnostic and testing facilities known as IDTFs to diagnose patients.\nWidespread adoption of our NightOwl product will help more efficiently move patients through the screening and diagnostic funnel, so that physicians can then write prescriptions and home care providers can then set up those patients on therapy and take care of them for life.\nIn addition to the nationwide launch of NightOwl, we're providing our sleep lab partners with even more new technology this quarter. On April 15, we launched the AirSense 11 version of VPAP Tx. VPAP Tx is our sleep lab testing and titration platform, built specifically for both hospital as well as outpatient sleep lab environments. VPAP Tx is purpose-built to support everything that a sleep physician needs in the sleep lab, including titration, evaluation and setup across every therapy mode that ResMed offers, including CPAP, APAP, bilevel S, bilevel ST, as well as Adaptive Servo Ventilation, also known as ASV therapy.\nVPAP Tx gives physicians, gives RPSG techs and respiratory therapists, a powerful new tool to personalize the gold standard positive airway pressure treatment decisions and ultimately, to accelerate adoption of long-term therapy for their patients through personalization of that therapy. The VPAP Tx platform is built for flexibility for precision and for clinical confidence. When we pay NightOwl and VPAP Tx with AirView, our cloud-based software for physicians and home care providers, they become part of a complete connected pathway from diagnosis and titration to prescription and ultimately, therapy adherence.\nOf course, we are working to incorporate diagnostic insights from NightOwl into our myAir patient app and to incorporate diagnostic data from both NightOwl and VPAP Tx into Somnoware. Somnoware, our software for physicians and sleep physicians practices continues to grow in its reach and has been adopted by one of the largest private health care systems in the United States as well as being further expanded within the U.S. Veterans Administration, or VA.\nOur investments in testing devices and diagnostic tracking software, which benefits potential patients, sleep labs and our home care providers, demonstrate ResMed's depth of commitment to the entire sleep health and breathing health ecosystems that provides access to the market-leading sleep apnea therapy, and that's from ResMed.\nWe will continue to invest in our digital health ecosystem to help expand the diagnostic funnel to keep up with expanding new patient flow from both our own demand generation, demand capture investments as well as capturing demand from 2 powerful macro trends; one, the widespread adoption of GLP-1 medications, both in the U.S. and worldwide; and two, accelerating momentum in consumer wearables.\nFor consumers coming into the funnel from all of these areas, ResMed will be known as the company answering their questions about sleep health. I call this concept a digital sleep health concierge capability, including screening protocols, clinical tools, seamless workflows and cloud connected care pathways. ResMed is the leading global brand in the field of sleep health and breathing health. We want to expand the reach of that brand to help them more than 2.3 billion people that need our health for their sleep apnea or as I call it sleep suffocation, their insomnia, inability to get to sleep, stay asleep or their respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or neuromuscular disease.\nDuring the quarter, we announced a comprehensive ResMed brand evolution strategy designed to unify our global brand portfolio into one across sleep health, breathing health and health care technology that is delivered into the home. We will continue to build ResMed brand awareness and evolve our brand to be closer to each and every customer. However, I want to make it clear that our marketing team will make certain that there is a positive return on investment or ROI for every single demand generation, demand capture and demand conversion project that we launch as we move more and more people into the diagnostics and treatment fund.\nWhen we talk about ResMed brand development, please note that internally, that means ResMed brand ROI as well. An example of our disciplined demand generation experimentation is shown in our latest effort to educate physicians. We have launched a targeted demand generation program through continual medical education, also called CME programs to help teach physicians the benefits of CPAP, APAP and bilevel therapies for their patients. These targeted education efforts are having an impact with measurably increased prescriptions from those physicians.\nIn addition to physician education, we're also reaching out to consumers looking for what we call sleep health concerned consumers. On this front, I'm happy to say that our experiments on streaming advertising in select cities have resulted in significant increases in patient flow into the screening and diagnostic funnel. It remains early days with these first cities, but we are seeing an openness in consumers to messaging that helps them find relief from their sleep apnea or sleep suffocation, and their lack of good quality of sleep that could be insomnia.\nWe're also continuing to build long-term value across our existing patient base to keep patients on therapy for their own personal health and for the good of the whole health care ecosystem. Research shows that patients who are enrolled in a compliant world-class resupply program are more likely to stay adherent to our therapy over the long term, and therefore, to have better health outcomes. With the provision of just one additional item per patient per year achieved by more efficient outreach, we believe we can provide exceptional value to our home care provider customers and make sure that our patients have access to new, clean masks and accessories for better care and better outcomes for them and for their physicians.\nOur focus is on driving increased patient adherence, improving outcomes. Programs like Brightree Connect, Resupply Complete and Resupply Essentials that are available for HME customers on any of the EHRs and ERPs they may use combined with personalized engagement through myAir are delivering strong results with home care providers right here in the United States. We have the opportunity to adapt and scale these types of resupply and adherence technologies globally to the 140 countries ultimately that ResMed is able to deliver care in.\nKeeping patients on therapy is our moral imperative, our obligation here at ResMed, and it's firmly supported by scientific research. During the quarter, the Lancet Respiratory Medicine Medical Journal published a landmark meta-analysis. And the meta-analysis has a higher clinical value than a randomized controlled trial, or RCT, that many people have considered and looked at as the gold standard for clinical trials. So in short, the Lancet publication showed that CPAP therapy reduces all-cause mortality by 37%. And it reduces overall death rates by 37%. And further, that study went on to say that CPAP therapy reduces cardiovascular mortality by 55%. So CPAP reduces cardiovascular death rates by 55%. And this study wasn't small. This meta-analysis included over 1 million participants.\nSo here at ResMed, we've known for decades that CPAP improves quality of life for sleep apnea patients. We've talked internally about these improvements in cardiovascular and mortality health. But now we have proof that it helps people to ultimately live longer and to live better. These data show that CPAP is not just another medical therapy. It's literally a case of life and death. So here at ResMed, we make the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most cloud-connected and most intelligent therapies for sleep apnea, insomnia and respiratory insufficiency.\nWe also have the market-leading software for health care technology that is delivered right where people want to be, which is in their own home with home medical equipment, home health, home nursing and software that's beyond.\nTo our shareholders around the world, we are building on our ResMed Foundation with our long-term leadership in our global markets. We now serve approximately 151 million lives through our hardware and software platforms. And we remain on track toward our ambitious goal of improving 500 million people's lives in 2030, 0.5 billion worldwide.\nThis quarter's results show the strength of our strategy our investment in R&D, the clarity of our execution and the scale of our impact. We launched a renewed and refreshed brand. We scaled digital diagnostics and titration tools. We expanded intelligent therapy. We activated new patients. And really importantly, we replenish supplies for existing patients worldwide. And while doing all of this, we also delivered very strong financial results with top line growth and leverage down to the bottom line.\nI'd say this, we're just getting started. So thank you to every one of the 10,000 ResMedians around the world who made that possible and will make it possible our future growth.\nAnd with that, I'll now hand the call over to Brett, who's is Sydney today for a deeper dive into our financials, and then we'll open the floor up for questions. Brett, over to you.\n\nBrett Sandercock\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms were applicable.\nWe had strong financial performance in Q3. Group revenue for the March quarter was $1.29 billion, an 8% headline increase and 9% in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflects positive contributions across our product and resupply portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies negatively impacted revenue by approximately $13 million during the March quarter.\nLooking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our residential care software business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 9%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other regions increased by 8% on a constant currency basis. Globally, on a constant currency basis, device sales increased by 7%, while masks and other sales increased by 12%.\nBreaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 6%, and Masks and other sales increased by 13%, reflecting continued growth in resupply and new patient setups.\nIn Europe, Asia and other regions, device sales increased by 9% on a constant currency basis while masks and other sales increased by 7% on a constant currency basis. Residential care software revenue increased by 10% on a constant currency basis in the March quarter, underpinned by strong performance from our MEDIFOX DAN software vertical.\nDuring the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release.\nGross margin increased by 140 basis points to 59.9% in the March quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by manufacturing and logistics efficiencies as well as favorable shifts in product mix, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements. Sequential gross margin increased by 70 basis points, primarily driven by manufacturing and logistics efficiency.\nWe continue to make good progress on our gross margin expansion initiatives, and we are focused on making sustained long-term gross margin improvements. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect our gross margin in Q4 FY '25 to be broadly consistent with our third quarter gross margin.\nMoving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased by 7% on a headline basis and by 8% on a constant currency basis. The increase was predominantly due to increases in employee-related expenses and increases in marketing expenses, including costs associated with our recent global brand launch and demand generation activities.\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19% compared to 19.2% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for the remainder of fiscal year 2025.\nR&D expenses for the quarter increased by 9% on a headline basis and by 11% on a constant currency basis. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related expenses. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.5% compared to 6.4% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the remainder of fiscal year 2025.\nOperating profit for the quarter increased by 13%, underpinned by revenue growth and gross margin expansion. Our net interest income for the quarter was $1 million. Our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 20.1% compared to 20.3% in the prior year quarter. We estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2025 will be in the range of 19% to 21%.\nOur GAAP effective tax rate for the March quarter was 12.6% as we recorded a net income tax benefit of $30 million relating to interest on our tax refunds from the IRS. We have treated this tax benefit as a non-GAAP item in our third quarter financial results.\nOur net income for the March quarter increased by 11%. The non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.37 also increased by 11%. Excluding the impact of investment portfolio write-downs in Q3 totaling $6 million. Earnings per share for the March quarter was $2.41, an increase of 13% over the prior year period.\nI would like to comment on the expected impact of U.S. tariffs, particularly associated with the introduction of a 10% tariff on exports to the U.S. from Australia and Singapore. These locations are where we currently manufacture most of our devices and masks for the U.S. market.\nWe have for many years been importing our products under a chapter of the harmonized tariff schedule of the United States that governs importation of certain medical devices, including equipment to treat sleep apnea and other chronic respiratory conditions. We have worked hard over the years to achieve that status and to maintain it for products we sell in the United States. As a result, we have historically paid negligible duties or tariffs on the importation of most of our products.\nOn April 5, U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a notice of implementation confirming that current tariff treatment of our product like ours continues. Accordingly, we do not expect the introduction of U.S. tariffs to have a material impact on our financial results.\nWe also continue to improve the resilience of our global supply chain by expanding our manufacturing footprint in the U.S. We expect to open our $30 million advanced manufacturing facility in Calabasas, California in June 2025. This high-tech facility will almost double our manufacturing footprint compared to the existing footprint in our Chatsworth, California facility. Over time, it will significantly expand our production capacity in mask resupply for the United States.\nCash flow from operations for the quarter was $579 million. This does include a refund of tax and interest from the IRS of $107 million. Excluding the impact of the tax refund, our operating cash flow was $472 million for the quarter, reflecting strong operating results and lower working capital.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter was $21 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $44 million. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $933 million. On March 31, we had $675 million in gross debt and $258 million in net cash, and we have $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility.\nWe continue to maintain a solid liquidity position and with robust operating cash flows and a strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to weather the current global uncertainty and respond to geopolitical challenges. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share.\nDuring the March quarter, we purchased approximately 314,000 shares under our previously authorized share buyback program for consideration of $75 million. We plan to increase our ongoing share buyback program and purchase shares to the value of approximately $100 million per quarter, commencing in Q4 FY '25. This will comfortably more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions and continue our share buyback program.\nAnd with that, I will hand the call back to Salli.\n\nSallilyn Schwartz\n\nGlobal Head-Investor Relations & Strategic Capital Management, Moody's Corp.\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call over to our operator, Kevin, to provide instructions.",

My name is Matt, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mike Ott, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nGreat. Thank you, Matt. Hello, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Call. We are live webcasting this call, and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website later today. Our earnings press release and presentation are both available online now. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures that we believe provide helpful information for investors. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures with the GAAP reported numbers. In addition, our discussions today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future financial and operating performance.\nWe make these statements based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn the call over to ResMed's Chairman and CEO, Mick Farrell.\n\nMichael Farrell\n\nGreat. Thank you, Mike, and good morning and good afternoon as we welcome our shareholders and review ResMed's second quarter fiscal year 2025 results. I'm pleased to share that ResMed delivered another strong quarter of global top line and bottom line growth. We achieved excellent year-over-year performance in Q2 with solid revenue growth, improved gross margins, combined with disciplined investments in both R&D and SG&A, resulting in very strong operating profit and net profit performance. These results reflect the hard work of 10,000-plus ResMedians and our dedication to improving the lives of patients, improving the workflow of home care providers, physicians, payers and the communities that we serve in over 140 countries worldwide. The foundation of our continued positive performance lies in our clear market-leading value proposition, including the sustainable competitive advantage that we have established with our best-in-class hardware and software products as well as our digital health ecosystem.\nThrough cloud connectable medical devices, masks and accessories as well as digital platforms and ongoing investments in technology, including specifically ML, AI and generative AI, we are committed to helping hundreds of millions of people so that they can sleep better, breathe better and live longer and higher quality lives. Let me start with a high-level review of our financials. I'm proud to report that we delivered global revenue growth of 10%, reflecting positive and consistent contributions across our combined sleep health, breathing health and residential care software portfolio. Global device sales were driven by strong market performance across our U.S. as well as Europe, Asia and Rest of World markets, reflecting the continuing demand for our AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms. Device sales remained strong, growing double digits year-over-year. We increased the global availability of our AirSense 11 platform this quarter, launching in India during Q2. We will have additional country launches of AirSense 11 planned throughout calendar year 2025. We make the market-leading sleep health platform with the AirSense 11. I want to make it clear that there is still strong global demand for the second best device platform in the market, and that is the AirSense 10 range.\nOur masks and accessories business also had another strong quarter, delivering double-digit global growth in that category as well. Ongoing rollout of Brightree ReSupply and SNAP technology have helped in our U.S. market, and we expect to maintain that momentum as we launch SNAP technology that can work on all HME management platforms throughout calendar year 2025. We achieved 230 basis points of margin expansion in non-GAAP gross margin year-over-year to 59.2%, reflecting our ongoing focus on improving operating efficiencies. With disciplined investments in R&D and SG&A, we achieved a 29% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share. Our new Head of Supply Chain, Shane Azii and his team are committed to driving increased supply and increased manufacturing efficiencies by investing in technology and infrastructure to power long-term cost improvements. By balancing this cost discipline with strategic investments in new product introductions, we will continue to drive sustainable and profitable growth for ResMed. We have published peer-reviewed studies showing categorically that resupply programs drive patient adherence. They improve patient outcomes, and they also lower long-term costs for the health care system. In the U.S., our digital health ecosystem, including both AirView for payers, Brightree for home medical equipment players as well as for patients, the myAir app.\nThey continue together to power these resupply programs. We are actively investing in appropriate modified versions of these successful U.S. resupply programs into our global markets. Each of the 140 countries that we operate in have different regulatory, reimbursement, economic as well as cultural norms. It's our opportunity to leverage ResMed's knowledge of each of those markets and to optimize the best way for a person to regularly receive fresh supply for their life-changing and life-saving care. ResMed is an innovation machine. Our ongoing investments of 6% to 7% of revenues into R&D is a key growth driver and a key part of our long-term success. With trailing 12 months revenue around $5 billion, that's $300 million to $350 million that we invest annually into R&D, creating the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the most connected and the most intelligent devices, masks and software solutions. During the quarter, we launched the AirTouch N30i to select markets. The AirTouch N30i is a world first from ResMed with its unique fabric-based patient interface. My philosophy is this. We sleep on cotton sheets. We have fabric covers for the pillars that we sleep on. Why can't we have sleep apnea therapy that is just as comfortable as that. Early feedback from respiratory therapists, from physicians and from patients directly is that the comfort and fit of the AirTouch N30i is outstanding.\nThis new technology could permanently change the basis of competition in mask innovation. It's one thing to create a prototype of a mask. It's another thing to have manufacturability at scale with top quality, top comfort, excellent seal and great long-term patient outcomes. Watch this space for our new-to-world fabric-based AirTouch technology launched first here on the AirTouch N30i platform. During the quarter, we announced another collaboration with the Apple Vision Pro team with the launch of what we call the Kontor Head Strap. This is a premium accessory for the Apple Vision Pro. ResMed, as all of you as shareholders know, is the world leader in providing facial interfaces in the field of sleep health and breathing health and health care technology at home. This is great to see that now a top consumer tech company like Apple has chosen to partner with ResMed on an interface that we make that delivers a superb balance of softness and support for the extended wear time that users of the Apple Vision Pro need. The Apple Vision Pro accessory is crafted with a blend of ResMed's exclusive ultra-premium materials and designed to be gentle on the skin.\nThis project shows that ResMed's expertise is applicable outside of pure-play medical technology, and it's part of this convergence of med tech and consumer tech and the learning that, that will provide for both the medical and consumer fields is an important part of this opportunity. Watch this space. ResMed had a very strong presence at the Consumer Electronics Show, or CES, in Las Vegas at the start of 2025, just a couple of weeks ago. We provided a digital sleep lounge that offered people a place to go to relax and to learn about the importance of sleep health, of breathing health and care delivered at home. Across CES display booths, there were many consumer tech companies showing their latest and greatest sleep wellness and sleep monitoring solutions. from Apple to Samsung, to Google's Fitbit, Oura Rings, Garmin, Whoop and beyond. We are very excited to have sleep health become mainstream. Interestingly, ResMed products were on display in the massive Samsung booth. Samsung was touting their new Galaxy Watch's sleep apnea detection capability and illustrating the link between their Galaxy Watch ecosystem and ResMed's market-leading products for the treatment of sleep apnea. I'll talk more about sleep apnea detectors and this convergence of medtech and consumer tech a little later. But now let me provide a brief update on GLP-1s, the new class of pharmaceuticals that are focused on weight loss, diabetes and metabolic control, cardiovascular outcomes and now also sleep apnea.\nI'll then come back to consumer wearables that can detect sleep apnea. So late during our Q2 on December 20, Eli Lilly gained FDA approval for the use of Zepbound, a GLP-1 in patients with obesity and moderate to severe sleep apnea with a reduced calorie diet and physical exercise. It's interesting to note that this SURMOUNT-OSA trial excluded patients with diabetes. In the lead up to its launch to consumers, Eli Lilly's early educational documents that are available to medical community on the Eli Lilly website includes a patient guide for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea or OSA. It was encouraging to see that Lilly followed the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, or AASM, guidelines that explicitly state that positive airway pressure devices are the frontline and gold standard for treating sleep apnea and that these PAP devices, CPAP, APAP viable have the highest efficacy when used as directed. Beyond just the guidelines, their own FAQs on the Lilly website informed physicians and patients that CPAP devices are now smaller and quieter and that CPAP masks have been refined to increase comfort. We agree. We welcome the opportunity to educate potential patients on the benefit of all therapy options for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, starting with the gold standard frontline CPAP, APAP bilevel, then considering the next most efficacious dental devices and finally, looking at pharmaceutical or even surgical options.\nOn January 14, 2025, the AASM issued a quick reference guide to providers, considering the use of new drugs for the treatment of OSA. The AASM continues to emphasize the use of positive airway pressure as the frontline treatment and suggests that weight loss drugs may be useful as an adjunctive or combination therapy. Our experience with bariatric surgery patients these last 2-plus decades and now with these latest generation GLP-1s these last 5-plus years is that when someone loses weight, that doesn't change their age, that doesn't change their gender, that doesn't change, most importantly, in this context, their craniofacial anatomy. These are key risk factors for sleep apnea. We are looking forward to addressing the educational gap on the prevalence and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with continuing medical education or CME programs that we are aiming specifically at primary care physicians, and we're especially targeting those who are high volume -- currently high-volume GLP-1 prescribers. They will be the front line for the patients that pharmaceutical companies will attract as they ramp up their own consumer advertising throughout calendar year 2025 and beyond.\nWe are now tracking 1.2 million patients who have had a prescription for the latest-generation GLP-1 medicines and who also have a prescription for positive airway pressure therapy. The data are clear in this real-world analysis, and that is that these people are very motivated. In fact, they are more than 10% more likely to start PAP therapy. That motivation versus a garden variety PAP patient remains. One year later, we continue to see north of 3% higher, not just adherence, but actually buying masks and accessories. Then the curve separate with a greater than 5% increased propensity for resupply at 2 years. These data have now been steady with the same trend, plus or minus a couple of tens of basis points as we have grown our analysis from a year ago with 300,000-plus patients to now tracking over 1.2 million patients. One thing is clear, the real-world evidence shows that the combination of a GLP-1 prescription and a PAP prescription is powerful for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. They start our therapy more and adhere more to PAP therapy over the long term. And we know that adhering to PAP therapy over the long term saves health care costs, improves patient quality of life outcomes and lowers patient mortality. We believe that GLP-1s are helping activate a whole new population of patients into the health care system that weren't coming in before, and ResMed is well positioned to support them.\nOkay. Next, let's briefly return to the consumer wearables megatrend. The velocity of change in the way the world operates in consumer tech and in health tech is amazing, and ResMed is right in the nexus of that. In fact, we are driving adoption of basic ML and AI broadly into our software offerings across the board, and we are pioneering generative AI with our commercially available product, Dan, which I see as just the start of what I call the sleep health concierge platform. More to come on that later. But the bottom line is consumers are more focused than ever on tracking their personal health, their personal wellness and their personal well-being. The Samsung Galaxy Watch was the first to get de novo FDA clearance for detecting OSA early in 2024, and Apple announced sleep apnea detection from the main stage as they launched the latest generation Apple Watch in September 2024. The data tracked by those 2 leading wearables will provide the opportunity for their millions -- no, their hundreds of millions of users to potentially detect sleep apnea. This is not a 1-quarter step change, but a chance for gradual and steady long-term demand generation for sleep apnea patients that benefits ResMed. Of course, the information goes both ways. Patients can get their myAir scores from the ResMed myAir app, but they can also get them from their Apple Watch.\nThey can get their myAir scores on their Samsung Galaxy watch. We know that this type of gamification of health care can help drive adherence. We expect more and more people are going to want access real time to sleep data and the interest in improving sleep continues to grow. As I said earlier, it's not just these 2 leading tech players in Apple and Samsung, but it's also Google's Fitbit, Oura's Ring, Whoop's device, Garmin devices and beyond. We expect that they will all continue to expand their sleep architecture and sleep assessment capabilities. And my personal bet is that more than a few of these other wearable players will add sleep apnea detection in 2025. We see this investment by consumer wearables companies and pharmaceutical companies in sleep health as a once-in-a-generation opportunity for sleep apnea awareness. We believe that these technologies will help drive more potential patients to seek out information regarding their sleep health and their breathing health. ResMed's obligation is to help sleep health concern consumers to find their own pathway to appropriate diagnosis and treatment for sleep apnea, where ResMed leads the world with the most clinically effective, the least invasive, the most proven and the most cost-effective solutions on the planet. We don't believe that these 2 megatrends will drive a simple one and done or onetime step change in patient flow.\nRather, we believe that this will be an increase from baseline patient flow that starts over 1, 3, 5 quarters as these technologies roll out, but has durability over 1, 3, 5 years and beyond. We are creating the infrastructure for demand generation, demand capture and demand conversion to help these people find the care that they need. Watch this space. So turning now to our long-term vision that we outlined at our Investor Day at the New York Stock Exchange last September. Our ResMed 2030 strategy is crystal clear. It's focused on 3 key pillars: number one, growing and differentiating our core sleep health and breathing health business; two, expanding into adjacent areas, including respiratory insufficiency such as COPD, including insomnia, including COMISA and beyond; and three, leveraging our leadership in digital health to drive better outcomes for patients, for providers and for payers. So a key component of pillar #1 is driving the value of the ResMed brand. That decision, that moment of truth when a physician writes a script for ResMed, when a respiratory therapist recommends a ResMed mask solution. When a health care provider chooses a ResMed digital health solution or where a consumer anywhere in the 140 countries where we sell our products and services establishes a personal relationship with the ResMed brand.\nAll of these moments added together, that is the equity that is built into the ResMed brand. We will continue to build our ResMed brand awareness and evolve our brand to be more future-focused and closer to the customer. I want to make it clear that our marketing tech team will ensure that there is ROI return on investment for every single demand generation, every single demand capture and every single demand conversion project as we move more and more people into the diagnosis and treatment funnel. With over 1 billion people suffocating with sleep apnea worldwide, we have a lot of runway ahead in our core market. It's great that we have a couple of megatrends on our side to help. The global demand for sleep health and breathing health solutions is growing, and our mission to help people sleep better, breathe better and live higher-quality lives to their fullest potential continues to drive everything that we do. But when you combine those opportunities from our core sleep apnea market with pillar #2, that is expanding into new adjacencies, the future couldn't be brighter. We will continue to invest in our cloud-connected noninvasive ventilators for respiratory insufficiency, including COPD and neuromuscular disease. We will continue expanding our digital health and med tech solutions for insomnia patients.\nI believe we're just at the start of that journey of that awful disease that we need to treat the inability to get to sleep, stay as sleep and wake up with refreshing sleep and beyond. And for the generation of people who want to age in place, to receive health care at the best place, lowest cost, lowest acuity, highest quality of life, which is their home, we have our market-leading software solutions like Brightree and MEDIFOX, and we are best positioned to lower costs, improve efficiencies and improve long-term outcomes. We create life-changing health care technologies that people love. In the last 12 months, we provided over 147 million people with a product such as a CPAP, an APAP, a bilevel, a noninvasive ventilator, a mask, a cushion, a humidifier, other accessories or a digital health solution such as myAir, AirView, Somnoware, Brightree, MEDIFOX and beyond. Our ambitious goal is to empower that impact and to empower 500 million people to reach their full potential in 2030 with sleep health, breathing health and health care technology provided to them right where they live.\nWith our strong financial foundation, our innovative product pipeline and our expanded digital health ecosystem, we are well positioned to meet and beat our goals. Thank you to all the 10,000 ResMedians for your hard work and dedication to make our mission possible. And thank you to our shareholders for your continued trust and support of our global ResMed team. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett and Sydney for a deeper dive into our financials, and then we'll open up the floor to questions. Brett, over to you.\n\nBrett Sandercock\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. Unless noted, all comparisons under the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms where applicable. We had strong financial performance in Q2. Group revenue for the December quarter was $1.28 billion, an increase of 10% on both a headline and constant currency basis. Revenue growth reflects positive and consistent contributions across our product and resupply portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies negatively impacted revenue by approximately $2 million during the December quarter. Additionally, we expect that year-over-year movements in foreign currencies will also negatively impact our Q3 revenue somewhere in the range of $15 million to $20 million. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our residential care software business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 12%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other regions increased by 8%.\nGlobally, on a constant currency basis, device sales increased by 11%, while masks and other sales also increased by 11% Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 12%, supported by solid ongoing new patient diagnosis. Masks and other sales also increased by 12%, reflecting growth in both resupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other regions, device sales increased by 9% on a constant currency basis. Masks and other sales increased by 7% on a constant currency basis. Residential care software revenue increased by 8% in December quarter, underpinned by strong performance from our MEDIFOX DAN software vertical. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 230 basis points to 59.2% in the December quarter. Year-over-year increase was mainly driven by manufacturing and logistics efficiencies and component cost improvements. Sequential gross margin was consistent with last quarter despite the impact from an unfavorable currency headwind of approximately 30 basis points during the quarter.\nWe continue to make good progress on our gross margin expansion initiatives, and we are focused on driving further improvement in our gross margin. Looking forward, we expect gross margin will be in the range of 59% to 60% in the second half of fiscal year 2025. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the second quarter increased by 9% on both a headline and constant currency basis. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs and to a lesser extent, increases in marketing and travel expenses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 18.8% compared to 19.1% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for the second half of fiscal year 2025. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 10% on both a headline and constant currency basis. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related expenses. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.3% compared to the 6.4% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the second half of fiscal year 2025. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 19%, underpinned by revenue growth and gross margin expansion. Our interest expense for the quarter was $1 million.\nGiven our lower debt levels, we expect to generate net interest income in the second half of fiscal year 2025. Our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 18% compared to 20.7% in the prior year quarter. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to higher tax benefits associated with employee equity compensation this quarter. We estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2025 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the December quarter increased by 29% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 29%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $309 million, reflecting strong operating results, partially offset by higher working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $21 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $46 million. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $522 million. On December 31, we had $673 million in gross debt and $151 million in net debt, and we have approximately $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility. We continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share.\nDuring the quarter, we purchased approximately 307,000 shares under our previously authorized share buyback program for consideration of $75 million. We plan to continue to purchase shares for a value of approximately $75 million per quarter in fiscal year 2025. This will more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions and continue our share buyback program. And with that, I will hand the call back to Mike.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks, Brett. Matt, I'll now turn the call over to you to provide instructions and run the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you.",

My name is Kevin and I'll be your operator for today's call.\n[Operator Instructions]\nPlease note this conference call is being recorded.\nI'll now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, Amy.\n\nAmy Wakeham\n\nVice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Kevin. Hello, everyone. Welcome to ResMed's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. We are live webcasting this call and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. Our earnings press release and presentation are both available online now.\nDuring today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures that we believe provide useful information for investors. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release to reconcile the non-GAAP measures with the GAAP reported numbers.\nIn addition, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements including, but not limited to expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on our reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today.\nI'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Mick Farrell.\n\nMichael Farrell\n\nThanks, Amy, and thank you to our shareholders for joining us as we announce results from our full fiscal year 2024 and review our fourth quarter results in more detail. Our global ResMed team executed incredibly well in our fourth quarter, producing another strong period of growth and execution across our business with solid performance across all regions and all segments of our business and strong double-digit bottom line growth.\nOngoing new patient demand for our market-leading flow generators remained robust in the quarter, even against a very tough year-over-year comparable. Media interest in sleep apnea and all the various therapies seems to be helping patients find their way to screening, diagnosis and therapy, and especially the lowest cost most efficacious therapy with the best outcomes, which is positive airway pressure therapy.\nIn terms of our masks and accessories business, physicians respiratory therapists and patients are choosing ResMed masks when they start therapy and as they continue through resupply, resulting in very strong double-digit growth in our masks and accessories business. Our residential care software business delivered double-digit growth in revenue and in net operating profit. Our laser focus on operating leverage has delivered another quarter of strong profitable growth,and we're well positioned to continue on this trajectory as we launch into fiscal year 2025.\nOver 2.4 billion people worldwide suffer from sleep apnea, insomnia or respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or neuromuscular disease. As the market leader in respiratory medicine and residential care globally, here at ResMed, we're uniquely positioned to drive increased market penetration through demand generation to accelerate growth. These chronic conditions in sleep health and breathing health form a global health epidemic that ResMed is well positioned to address.\nWe believe that health care should be delivered in the lowest cost, lowest acuity and highest comfort location possible. In the optimal case, that's right in a person's own home. ResMed is the clear leader in sleep apnea, a market of over 1 billion people globally. Our end markets remain significantly underpenetrated. We're leading the industry in digital health solutions with approximately 19 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and 26 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices sold into over 140 countries worldwide.\nWe've leveraged these de-identified data to show that our therapy solutions lower costs, improve outcomes and bend the curve of chronic disease progression. Significant opportunities remain in digital health, we plan to be right there at the cutting edge of innovation. The latest advances in wearables from the consumer technology industry and the latest medicines from big pharmaceutical companies will bring more and more new patients into the health care system.\nWe have many opportunities to add value, expanding interoperability lowering costs and improving patient outcomes. Billions of people can benefit from our products and solutions, and we're focused on expanding our reach and growing the market to help people get on their pathway to better sleep, better breathing and better care at home.\nSales of our flow generator devices including the category-leading AirSense 11 platform grew 6% year-over-year globally. We're supporting the global market and every patient who needs a device has access to our market-leading 100% cloud connectable platforms, the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11. We continue increasing the availability and production of our AirSense 11 and our AirCurve 11 platforms worldwide as we secure regulatory clearances and launch these market-leading technologies country by country.\nOur masks and accessories business grew 15% year-over-year, expanding in a competitive category globally. Our latest mask innovation, the AirFit F40 introduced last quarter is doing extremely well in the markets that it has launched in. New patients are selecting the F40 for its comfort, fit and ease of use. It is the smallest profile oronasal mask on the market from ResMed. Patients are voting with their wallets and respiratory therapists are voting with their setup protocols and physicians are voting with their prescriptions.\nWe look forward to ongoing success in the U.S. and across global markets as we increase availability and introduce the F40 into more and more countries throughout fiscal year 2025.\nResMed's clinical and commercial teams continue to partner with physicians and providers to drive resupply programs directly with their patients and we're successfully establishing subscription programs in our cash pay countries to help consumers find their path to therapy resupply directly.\nMasks and accessory resupply programs are a very important part of our offering as we serve the ongoing therapy needs of patients globally. Research shows that resupply programs can both improve patient adherence and improve long-term clinical outcomes.\nIn the U.S., our resupply programs are powered by our digital health ecosystem including AirView for physicians, myAir for patients and Brightree for home medical equipment providers. We will continue to develop, launch and scale these technologies and programs to help people take control of their own health, regularly refreshing their ongoing therapy needs.\nAs the global leader in significantly underpenetrated markets, our most important opportunity is to expand and grow the market through awareness, diagnosis and seamless pathways to treatment. We aspire to be the digital health concierge for each person as they pursue their personal journey to better sleep, better breathing and better residential care.\nWe are ramping up our demand generation initiatives to raise awareness and create pathways for patients to help them find access to care for their sleep health and their breathing health. We're serving traditional health care channels as well as investing in cost-effective social media-driven demand generation campaigns to help consumers who are concerned about their sleep and breathing find ways -- their own personal way into appropriate screening, diagnosis, treatment and management pathways.\nOur physician and provider based software ecosystem called AirView now contains over 28 million patient records. Adoption of our consumer patient engagement app which is called myAir, where people choose to participate in their personalized sleep health journey remains incredibly active and now includes over 8.3 million users. These digital health ecosystems are growing every quarter, showing the engagement of physicians as well as patients in accessing their own data to measure progress along their personal health journey.\nAs we look to the future, I've discussed 2 global megatrends that I believe will further support ongoing growth for ResMed. Awareness of sleep and health issues driven by consumer technology companies, specifically sleep tracking wearables like the Samsung Galaxy Watch, which has a de novo FDA clearance to screen for moderate-to-severe sleep apnea. And we expect similar capabilities from other wearable players in consumer tech, such as the Apple Watch, Google's Fitbit, the Oura Ring, Whoop and Garmin.\nIn terms of the second megatrend behind future patient growth, we are seeing increased volumes of patients entering the health care system driven by the efforts of big pharmaceutical companies as they increase awareness of the treatments for diabetes and obesity medicines and they continue their research into the impacts of these medicines on sleep apnea. Together, we believe these 2 megatrends in consumer tech and big pharma will increase patient awareness and be a significant tailwind for long-term growth here at ResMed.\nOur goal is to educate people as they move from what we call sleep wellness tracking on a wearable to what we would call sleep health tracking where they are seeking to help, advice and care of a health professional in the field of sleep medicine. This connection pathway from consumer awareness of sleep health and breathing health issues into a true health care pathway is what we are calling the digital health concierge opportunity.\nOur plan is to be there for that person as they go through the process of screening, diagnosis, treatment and ongoing management of their sleep health and their breathing health for life.\nBig Pharma is squarely focused on GLP-1 medications. For many people dealing with their obesity and diabetes issues, their health care goals are focused on losing weight, while improving their diet, cardiovascular exercise and their sleep routines, something that build them and called the Triumvirate of Health. We believe that increased utilization of GLP-1s to treat obesity will bring many new people into the health care funnel, activating them to see their primary care physicians as they strive to achieve and maintain weight loss.\nWe believe this will open them up to treating other chronic diseases that they may suffer from, including increased awareness of sleep apnea ultimately driving new patients into diagnosis and treatment pathways, but they may not have previously considered or been treated for. So it's not just driving more patients into our channel, but we believe it's also driving more motivated patients.\nThe emphasis on GLP-1 medications and increased focus by big pharma has put a spotlight on sleep apnea like never before. We believe that the growth in weight loss drugs will be a net positive for our business and the data support that thesis. ResMed has added to the biggest study in the field and our data, which is using real-world evidence of the impact of GLP-1s through a de-identified patient analysis leveraging third-party claims data.\nWe now have an expanded cohort of over 811,000 de-identified subjects in our analysis. This analysis demonstrates that GLP-1s are having a positive impact on patients both seeking and adhering to positive airway pressure therapy. The latest numbers are an improvement from what we have presented previously.\nFor patients prescribed a GLP-1 medication, the latest data show a 10.7 absolute percentage points higher propensity to start PAP therapy over those without a GLP-1 prescription. These data show that patients with this drug prescription are more motivated to start their CPAP, APAP or bilevel therapy.\nIn terms of longer-term impacts on PAP therapy, we have seen that the resupply rate at T equals 12 months is 310 basis points. So 3.1 absolute percentage points higher for the patients who have a GLP-1 prescription. And further, at T equals 24 months, the resupply rate is 530 basis points or 5.3% absolute percentage points higher for PAP therapy resupply for patients who have a GLP-1 prescription.\nThese data showed the new pharmaceutical class is a clear tailwind for our business, bringing more patients into the health care system. And more than that, we believe it is bringing highly motivated patients into the health care system. We've included this updated analysis in our quarterly earnings PowerPoint deck, and I encourage you to review the data there in further detail.\nResMed is the clear world leader in sleep health, breathing health and health care delivered at home. Frankly, it's our obligation and it's our brand promise. It's the ResMed brand promise to ensure that sleep concern consumers find their path to the highest efficacy, lowest cost and most comfortable therapy that's out there and is best for them. Our peer reviewed and published evidence demonstrates that we can achieve over 87% to PAP technology, 87% adherence to PAP technology in the first 90 days by combining our market-leading device platforms with digital health solutions, myAir and AirView.\nOf course, that means that 13% of patients in that scenario still need alternatives. And ResMed wants to be there to help those patients too. So we are investing in alternative therapies to help patients who can't adhere to PAP therapy to find their pathway to second-line therapies. And that includes dental devices where ResMed provides Narval, the market-leading 3D printed dental device for treatment of sleep apnea with dental treatment in Western and Northern Europe.\nIn addition, we have investments in third-line therapies, including pharmaceutical options with our investment in Apnimed and hypoglossal nerve stimulation technology with our investment in Nyxoah.\nSo let's step back and talk about broadly our digital health technology investments, leveraging an extraordinary ecosystem of almost 19 billion nights of deidentified medical data. We are developing and continuing to expand a portfolio of artificial intelligence-driven capabilities as well as customer-facing AI products that we're launching into the market from our ecosystem.\nWe continue to roll out and expand the AI products in AirView, such as compliance coach in the United States and our new smart coaching pilot, which is expanding into a few new countries as we go through our current quarter, which is Q1 of fiscal year 2025 and beyond.\nWe are also progressing with our generative AI capabilities to help patients along their health journey. A project that was initially piloted within our Asia Pacific region, our generative AI sleep concierge that we call Dawn. And yes, that is a reference to the sun rising at Dawn after a great night of sleep. Dawn was recently expanded from Asia Pac into our U.S. market. We'll continue to share the progress on this front of Gen AI and simple ML and generic AI as well as this tech is further developed and scaled across our business. It's going to enhance the user experience and drive consumer awareness. And what we're focused on is outcomes, not the tech, but what it can do for a patient, a physician, a provider.\nIn our Residential Care Software as a Service business, we had another strong quarter with year-over-year growth of 10%, supported by strength in our home medical equipment provider business through our Brightree brand as well as very strong growth in our home nursing and nursing home business with our MEDIFOX DAN brand. We've made very good progress in the business segment throughout fiscal 2024 and we plan to maintain high single-digit growth to low double-digit growth throughout each quarter in fiscal year 2025. But really importantly, we're driving operating leverage and we're going to have very strong double-digit net operating profit growth from our residential care software business sector in 2025.\nOur residential care software business is integral to the broader ResMed growth portfolio with ongoing synergistic growth opportunities across our businesses. We are accelerating growth across our residential care software business intrinsically, but we're also helping to support the core business through mask and accessory resupply growth.\nWe continue to drive operating leverage by managing across our businesses with capabilities managed such as cloud compute, cybersecurity, interoperability, privacy, and research and development velocity across our software platforms and with our core sleep health and breathing health businesses.\nWe are transforming respiratory medicine and residential care software at scale. We are leading the industry in developing, applying and adopting digital health technology across the 140-plus countries that we serve. We continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations. We're focused on driving top line revenue growth but with strong cost discipline and increasing efficiencies to accelerate profitability at the bottom line.\nWe made excellent progress on that this quarter. The global team delivered growth in non-GAAP operating income of 30%. The global team also delivered growth in non-GAAP net income of 30%. I'm more than incredibly proud of our global team and their performance.\nWe provide differentiated products and solutions for customers worldwide, driving long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. We lead the industry in digital health technology with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected and most intelligent technologies.\nDuring the last 12 months, we have improved over 178 million lives by delivering a medical device directly to a patient or a complete mask directly to a patient or a digital health software solution that provides personal care. We've helped each person sleep better, breathe better and live high-quality lives with best-in-class health care delivered right where they live.\nIn closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to 10,000-plus Resmedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication today in everyday across 140 countries. Thank you, team.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to our CFO, Brett, who's in Sydney this morning for his remarks, and then we'll open up to Q&A with the global team here in San Diego and Sydney. Over to you, Brett.\n\nBrett Sandercock\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Unless noted, all comparisons out of the prior year quarter are in constant currency terms, where applicable. We had strong financial performance in Q4. Group revenue for the June quarter was $1.22 billion, a 9% headline increase and 10% in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflects positive and consistent contributions across our product and resupply portfolio.\nYear-over-year movements in foreign currencies had a minimal impact on revenue during the June quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 10%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other regions increased by 8%. Globally, device sales increased by 6% while masks and other sales increased by 15%.\nBreaking it down by regional areas. Device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 5%, supported by solid ongoing new patient diagnosis. Masks and other sales increased by 17%, reflecting growth in both resupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other regions, device sales increased by 8% on a constant currency basis, and masks and other sales increased by 9% on a constant currency basis. Software as a Service revenue increased by 10% in the June quarter, underpinned by growth from MEDIFOX DAN and continued strong performance from our HME vertical.\nDuring the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 330 basis points to 59.1% in the June quarter. The year-over-year increase was driven by reductions in freight expense, manufacturing and component cost improvements, favorable product mix and an increase in average selling prices. Sequential gross margin improved by 60 basis points. The increase was driven by favorable product mix and manufacturing cost improvements, partially offset by increased freight costs.\nWe continue to monitor the freight cost headwinds arising from the Middle East conflict and congestion in Asian ports. We expect increased freight cost rates will continue to impact our gross margin in fiscal year 2025. We have made good progress expanding gross margin over the last several quarters and we will continue to drive initiatives to improve gross margin. Looking forward, we estimate our gross margin will be in the range of 59% to 60% in fiscal year 2025.\nMoving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter increased by 1%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.8% compared to 21.5% in the prior year period and reflects savings and ongoing cost discipline following restructuring actions undertaken in the December quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for fiscal year 2025. Consistent with historical trends, we expect Q1 FY '25 will be at the higher end of this range.\nR&D expenses for the quarter increased by 4% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.6% compared to 7% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2025.\nOperating profit for the quarter increased by 30% underpinned by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and modest growth in operating expenses. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $6 million. Given our lower debt levels, we expect interest expense in the range of $1 million to $3 million in Q1 FY '25. Additionally, we will likely generate net interest income in the second half of fiscal year 2025.\nDuring the quarter, we recognized unrealized losses of $15 million associated with our minority investment portfolio. This reduced our Q4 earnings per share by $0.10. Our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 18.7%, broadly consistent with the prior year quarter. We estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2025 will be in the range of 19% to 21%.\nOur net income for the June quarter increased by 30% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 30%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $440 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and improvement in our working capital position. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $25 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $44 million.\nWe ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $238 million. During the quarter, we reduced debt by $300 million. As of June 30, we had $707 million in gross debt and $469 million in net debt, and we have approximately $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility. We continue to maintain a healthy liquidity position.\nToday, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share, representing an increase of 10% over our previous quarterly dividend and reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance. During the quarter, we purchased 232,000 shares under our previously authorized share buyback program for consideration of $50 million. We plan to continue to repurchase shares, the value of approximately $50 million per quarter in fiscal year 2025. This will more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year.\nGoing forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions and continue with our share buyback program.\nAnd with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.\n\nAmy Wakeham\n\nVice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Brett, and thanks, everyone. Kevin, I'd like to turn the call back over to you to review the Q&A instructions and run that portion of the call.",

My name is Kevin, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded.\nI'll now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Amy, you may begin.\n\nAmy Wakeham\n\nVice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Kevin. Hello, everyone. Welcome to ResMed's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. We are live webcasting this call, and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. Our earnings press release and presentation are both available online now.\nDuring today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures that we believe provide useful information for investors.

Our third quarter fiscal year 2024 results reflect another strong period of execution across our entire business, resulting in solid top line growth and strong double-digit bottom line growth. Our results were driven by ongoing new patient demand for our devices across global markets, high single-digit growth in our Software as a Service business and double-digit global growth in our masks and accessories business. This is exceptional performance, given that we are annualizing a very strong quarter of growth in the prior year.\nThe recent launch of our ResMed 2030 operating model and our steady focus on driving increased operating leverage are delivering excellent bottom line results and keeping us on a clear trajectory of ongoing profitable growth. Over 2 billion people worldwide suffer from sleep apnea, what I call sleep suffocation, insomnia or respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or neuromuscular disease. These chronic conditions form a health care epidemic that ResMed is uniquely positioned to address.\nWe believe that health care should be delivered at the lowest cost, lowest security and highest comfort location possible. In the optimal case, that's in a person's own home. We are the global strategic leader in providing therapies for this epidemic as well as market-leading enterprise software for residential care, including home medical equipment home nursing and beyond.\nResMed is the global leader in digital health solutions with over 18 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 24.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices that have been sold into over 140 countries worldwide. We are the clear leader in sleep apnea, a market of over 1 billion people globally. Our end markets remain significantly under-penetrated. We believe the latest advances in big consumer tech and big pharma can potentially bring incredible numbers of new patients into the health care system, where ResMed is uniquely positioned to provide ongoing care at home.\nWe have a myriad of opportunities to add value, to reduce friction to improve interoperability to lower costs and to improve patient outcomes. We're the global strategic leader with software supporting hundreds of millions of people as they take control of their health care journey and navigate the complex health care world beyond the hospital system.\nMany more people can benefit from our products and solutions, and we're laser-focused on growing the market to help people get on the therapy they need and on a pathway to better sleep, better health and better long-term care.\nSales of our devices, including the category-leading AirSense platforms grew 5% year-over-year globally. Excluding the onetime COVID-related ventilator sales in the third quarter of last year, global devices grew about 300 basis points higher than that, so right around 8% global devices growth.\nWe are maintaining supply of 2 -- of the 2 market-leading 100% cloud connectable platforms, the AirSense 10 and AirSense 11. We're working to increase the global availability of AirSense 11 platform by securing market-by-market regulatory clearances.\nWe are following a similar path with our recently launched AirCurve11 bilevel and noninvasive ventilator platform as we continue its launch in the U.S. and beyond in the period ahead.\nOur commercial teams are successfully demonstrating the clinical and economic benefits of the ResMed mask portfolio. Our masks and accessories business achieved 10% growth year-over-year, expanding at or above the market in a competitive category globally.\nDuring the quarter, we introduced our latest mask innovation into the U.S. market called the AirFit F40. The F40 features a proprietary new technology that we call AdaptiSeal. It is a silicon cushion designed to create and maintain a better facial seal even when the person is moving frequently during sleep. It leverages a fully flexible frame technology to cope with such frequent nocturnal movement.\nPhysicians, respiratory therapists and patients love the F40 for its comfort, its fit and its ease of use. It is the smallest full-face mask on the market from ResMed. Patients are voting with their wallets and respiratory therapists and physicians are voting with their recommendations and their prescriptions. We look forward to ongoing success in the U.S. and to swiftly bring the F40 to other global markets very soon.\nMask and accessory resupply programs are an important element of our offering as we serve the ongoing therapy needs of patients globally. ResMed's clinical and commercial teams continue to partner with physicians and providers to drive resupply programs directly for their patients.\nIn our cash pay markets, we have established a number of subscription programs that have been adopted by consumers. Research shows that resupply programs lead to better patient adherence and better long-term clinical outcomes for the patients and their caregivers.\nIn the U.S., our resupply programs are powered by our digital health ecosystem, including AirView for physicians, myAir for patients and Brightree for home medical equipment providers. We will continue to develop, launch and scale these technologies as well as direct subscription programs to help people take control of their own health, regularly refreshing ongoing therapy needs, including masks, tubing, humidifiers and other accessories.\nLet's now turn to a discussion of our top 3 global strategic priorities here at ResMed. Number one is to grow and differentiate our core sleep health and breathing health business. Number two is to design, develop and deliver market-leading med tech and digital health solutions that can be scaled in 140-plus countries worldwide. Number three is to create and leverage the world's best software solutions for residential care.\nAs the global market leader in these significantly under-penetrated markets, our most significant opportunity is actually to expand and grow the market itself through awareness, diagnosis and pathways to treatment. We aspire to be the digital health concierge for each person as they pursue their personal journey to better sleep, better breathing and better care where they live. We are ramping up our demand generation initiatives to do just that.\nThe ResMed 2030 operating model changes that we made recently position us for success as a product-led customer-centric brand enhanced leader in health tech. We're raising awareness and creating pathways for patients to find access to care for their sleep health and their breathing health across the globe. We are leveraging traditional market channels and investing in cost-effective social media-driven demand-generation campaigns. The goal is to help consumers concerned about their sleep and breathing find their way into appropriate screening, diagnostic, treatment and management pathways.\nAs we continue on our journey to create this digital health concierge for individuals, we are tracking progress with hard metrics. We are looking at new patient starts in our physician and provider-based ecosystem, including AirView, which now contains more than 27 million patient records. We're also tracking new starts in myAir, our consumer patient engagement app where people choose to participate in their personalized health care journey to better sleep and better breathing. myAir now includes a population of 7.8 million users. We will drive more and more of the over 1 billion people worldwide who need our help for their sleep suffocation into the health care system.\nWe believe 2 global megatrends will further support our ongoing growth. Awareness driven by consumer tech specifically sleep tracking wearables like the Samsung Galaxy Watch, which has a de novo FDA clearance to screen for sleep apnea. We expect similar capabilities from other wearables from big tech, including the Apple Watch and Google's Fitbit. In addition, we believe that the population of patients -- the other megatrend, the population of patients coming from big pharma as they focus on obesity and related impacts on health, including sleep health will bring an incredible volume of patients into the health care system. And the patients will have clinically significant sleep apnea that is best addressed by our therapies post these other therapies.\nWe love this attention from big consumer tech on the field of sleep wellness tracking, and we believe that many of these wearable technologies will help consumers find out if they have issues with breathing during sleep while maintaining high quality sleep. This could be one of the biggest ways of people taking control of their own pathway for discovering they have sleep issues like sleep apnea or insomnia or both a new disease state that is being called by the physicians, COMISA.\nUltimately, we believe that this will lead to increased patient awareness and sustainable long-term growth for ResMed. Our goal is to educate people as they move from sleep wellness tracking with these wearables to what I call sleep health tracking. And from consumer awareness to a true health care pathway for screening, diagnosis, treatment and ultimately, ongoing management of their sleep health and breathing health. We believe that here at ResMed, we are [indiscernible] with their obesity. Their health care goals are focused on losing weight, while improving their diet, exercise and their sleep routines. We believe that increased utilization of GLP-1s to treat obesity will bring many new people into the health care funnel, activating them to see their primary care positions as they strive for weight loss and other medical health.\nWe believe this will open these patients up to knowledge of their other chronic diseases from their primary care physicians, including awareness of chronic diseases such as sleep apnea, ultimately driving new patients into diagnosis and treatment pathways that may not have previously been considered or being treated for those patients. So we believe this will drive not just more patients into our channel, but also more motivated patients into our channel.\nResMed has been tracking the impact of GLP-1s through a de-identified patient analysis using an overlap of our data and third-party claims data. With another quarter of data analyzed, we are now up to an incredible N equals 660,000 subjects in our analysis. The bottom line is that the data show that GLP-1s are having a positive impact on patients seeking and adhering to positive airway pressure therapy. The latest numbers are an improvement from what we presented previously.\nFor patients prescribed a GLP-1 medication, the latest data show a 10.5% higher propensity to start positive airway pressure therapy over those not taking the drug. As we follow these patients longitudinally, the resupply rate at T equals 12 months is 310 basis points higher. That's $3.1 billion absolute basis percentage points higher for patients who have a GLP-1 prescription. And then at T equals 24 months, the resupply rate is 500 basis points so 5.0 absolute percentage points higher for patients who have a GLP-1 prescription. These data show clearly that these new GLP-1 pharmaceutical class is actually a tailwind for our ResMed business. bringing more patients and more motivated patients into the health care system.\nWe've included the full analysis of these data in our investor deck, and I encourage you to review the data there. It's very positive information and very thorough and detailed work by our health care economics and outcomes research as well as our digital health analytics teams here at ResMed. Existing clinical studies show many factors impact sleep epidemiology, including craniofacial anatomy, age of the subject, gender and weight. With over 1 billion people on the planet with sleep apnea right now, 80-plus percent of them are undiagnosed in our biggest market, the United States, and over 90% of patients are undiagnosed globally. There remains an incredible opportunity to help people sleep and breathe better through positive airway pressure therapy. The universally recognized gold standard for treating sleep apnea. We look forward to more patients entering the health care system for care and more motivated patients who can get on our therapy faster and stay on it longer.\nIn terms of best-in-class treatments for sleep apnea, achieving that goal of good sleep and good breathing, we have peer-reviewed and published evidence demonstrating that we can achieve over 87% of patients adherent through our positive airway pressure technology by combining our market-leading device platforms, our market-leading masks with our digital health solutions. Even with this best-in-class global tech just over 10% of patients still need alternative therapies. And we have a very high volume of patients coming through these days.\nWe're investing in alternative therapies and we're working to help patients who just can't adhere to positive airway pressure therapy despite the latest technology to find their path to second-line therapies, such as dental devices where ResMed has the market-leading 3D printed dental device on the planet for sleep apnea in Western Europe and Northern Europe. That's called Narval.\nIn addition, we have investments in third-line therapies, including pharmaceutical options, we're an investor in Apnimed. And we're also an investor in hypoglossal nerve stimulation technology, through our investment in a company called Nyxoah. ResMed is about sleep health. It's about breathing health, and it's about delivering the best care right where you live. We make sure the person finds the path to the highest efficacy, lowest cost, most comfortable therapy that's best for them.\nLet's pivot now to talk about our digital health technology investments, leveraging our 18 billion nights of de-identified medical data in the cloud and our 24.5 100% cloud connectable devices that are there in our ecosystem across 140 countries. We are investing in a portfolio of artificial intelligence-driven capabilities as well as customer-facing AI products in our ecosystem. We continue to roll out these products in our AirView ecosystem, such as compliance coach that I talked about last quarter, that's rolling out in the United States.\nWe're also progressing well with our generative AI capabilities to help patients along their journey, really people before their patients and then they become people seeking sleep health and breathing health solutions and then on their journey, they become patients. And we're rolling out that GenAI capability in the Asia Pac region for now, and we'll look to scale that as we move forward. We'll continue to share progress on this front as this revolutionary tech is developed and scaled across our business and many of medtech and health tech peers are doing the same and our ecosystem will move forward.\nOur respiratory health business continues to be supported by sustained activity across our noninvasive ventilator platforms and our life support ventilator platforms. We continue to invest in clinical and economic trials for high-flow therapy that we call HFT to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at home at a cost-effective rate. This is a long-term opportunity focused on generating evidence, developing pathways and driving new reimbursement options. We are focused on driving adoption of these technologies for treatment at home. The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD as well as neuromuscular diseases, continues to increase, and we have low-cost high efficacy and high-tech treatments in HFT and beyond to address this health care epidemic.\nTurning to our Software as a Service business in the field of residential care we had another strong quarter with year-over-year growth of 8%. We plan to maintain high single-digit growth in the remainder of fiscal year 2024 and we plan to accelerate to double-digit growth for our residential care Software as a Service business on an organic basis throughout fiscal year 2025. We are seeing ongoing customer-facing synergies between our Brightree offering in the U.S. and our core home medical equipment channel and its resupply capabilities. We are driving good growth across both our residential care SaaS and our core sleep health and breathing health businesses, while serving many hundreds of thousands of patients.\nOur residential care SaaS business is integral to ResMed's growth portfolio, and we're excited to have created a global business that will achieve double-digit growth on organic basis throughout fiscal year 2025. We continue to drive OpEx leverage by managing our capabilities for cloud compute, cybersecurity, interoperability, privacy and R&D across our go-to-market brands that include Brightree, MatrixCare and MEDIFOX DAN. And those synergies go not just across the SaaS businesses, but also directly into our core sleep health and breathing health business.\nAnd beyond this infrastructure leverage, our residential care SaaS business drives platform development synergies and customer engagement facilities and capabilities that are synergies as well. And these highly complement the market-leading med tech and software solutions capability that's there right in our core sleep health and breathing health business ecosystem, including products like AirView and myAir and beyond.\nWe are transforming respiratory medicine and residential care at scale. We are leading the industry in developing, applying and adopting digital health technology across our markets. We continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations. We're focused on driving top line revenue growth, focused cost discipline and increased efficiencies to accelerate profitability all the way to the bottom line and we made very good progress on that this quarter. The team delivered non-GAAP operating income up 23% and non-GAAP net income up 27%. We have created differentiated products and solutions for customers worldwide, driving long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. We lead the industry in digital health technology with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected and most intelligent medtech solutions.\nDuring the last 12 months, we have improved over 174 million lives by delivering a medical device directly to a patient, a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that provides personal care for a patient right where they live. We've helped each person sleep better, breathe better and live higher-quality lives with best-in-class health care.\nIn closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 ResMedians for their perseverance hard work and dedication today and every day. Thank you.\nWith that, I'll hand over the call to Brett in Sydney for his remarks, and then we'll open up to Q&A with the entire team between Sydney and San Diego. Over to you, Brett.\n\nBrett Sandercock\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms, where applicable. We had strong financial performance in Q3. Group revenue for the March quarter was $1.2 billion, a 7% headline increase and a 7% increase in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflects positive and consistent contributions across our product and resupply portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies had a negligible impact on revenue during the March quarter.\nLooking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 9%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 3%. Globally, device sales increased by 5%, while masks and other sales increased by 10%.\nBreaking it down by regional areas. Device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 7%, supported by solid ongoing new patient diagnosis, while mask other sales increased by 12% and reflecting growth in both resupply and new patient setups.\nIn Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 1% on a constant currency basis. Year-over-year growth moderated due to incremental revenue in the prior year quarter of approximately $15 million from COVID-related demand. Excluding the COVID-related sales, device revenue increased by 8% on a constant currency basis. Masks and other sales increased by 6% on a constant currency basis.\nSoftware as a Service revenue increased by 8% in the March quarter, underpinned by growth from MEDIFOX DAN and continued strong performance from our HME vertical.\nDuring the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release.\nGross margin increased by 240 basis points to 58.5% in the March quarter. The increase was driven by reductions in freight expense, manufacturing cost improvements favorable product mix and an increase in device average selling prices. Sequential gross margin improved by 160 basis points. We continue to monitor potential headwinds that could arise from the Middle East conflict. Disruptions in the Red Sea have increased freight costs and shipping lead times. We estimate this will negatively impact our Q4 gross margin by around 30 to 50 basis points.\nMoving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased by 1%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.2% compared to 20.5% in the prior year period and reflects savings and ongoing cost discipline following restructuring actions undertaken early in the December quarter.\nLooking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for the balance of fiscal year 2024.\nR&D expenses for the quarter increased by 2% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.4% compared to the 6.8% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the balance of fiscal year 2024.\nOperating profit for the quarter increased by 23%, underpinned by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and modest growth in our operating expenses. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $11 million. Given our lower debt levels, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $7 million to $9 million in the final quarter of fiscal year 2024.\nOur effective tax rate for the March quarter was 20.3%, broadly consistent with the prior year quarter. We continue to estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the March quarter increased by 27% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 27%.\nCash flow from operations for the quarter was $402 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings and improvement in our working capital position.\nCapital expenditure for the quarter was $21 million, depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $43 million. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $238 million. On March 31, we have $1 billion in gross debt and 670 -- sorry, $769 million in net debt.\nDuring the quarter, we reduced our debt by $220 million. On March 31, we had approximately $1.2 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility, and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share.\nDuring the quarter, we purchased 261,000 shares under our previously authorized share buyback program for consideration of $50 million. We plan to continue to purchase shares to the value of approximately $50 million per quarter for the balance of fiscal year 2024. This will more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, pay down outstanding debt and deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions.\nAnd with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.\n\nAmy Wakeham\n\nVice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Brett. Thanks, Mick. Kevin, let's go ahead and turn the call back over to you to provide the instructions and then run the Q&A portion of the call.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Amy Wakeham. Please go ahead, Amy.\n\nAmy Wakeham\n\nVice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's Second Quarter Earnings Call for fiscal year 2024. We are live webcasting this call, and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of the earnings press release and presentation. Both of these are now available. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures that we believe provide useful information for investors. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the GAAP reported numbers.\nIn addition to our discussion today, it will include forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today.\nI'll now turn our call over to ResMed's CEO, Mick Farrell.\n\nMichael Farrell\n\nThanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today. Our second quarter fiscal year 2024 results reflect strong execution across our entire business, driving double-digit top and bottom line growth. These results are a testament to the incredible efforts of the global ResMed team. Our results were driven by double-digit global growth in both devices and our Software as a Service business, together with high single-digit global growth in our masks and accessories business, holding our leading market share amongst high comps from the same quarter a year ago. In terms of bottom line leverage, our reorganization efforts and efficiency efforts in the quarter have set us on a clear trajectory of profitable growth.\nTaking a step back, all 10,000 ResMedians are energized about the opportunities in front of us. There are over 2 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease or insomnia. These chronic conditions form a health care epidemic in which ResMed is uniquely positioned to help. We believe that health care should be delivered in the lowest cost, lowest security and highest comfort location possible. Very often, that is a patient's own home.\nOur end markets remain underpenetrated with many opportunities to add value, reduce friction, lower costs and improve patient outcomes. We support hundreds of millions of people as they take control of their health care journey and navigate the complex health care world outside the hospital system. ResMed is the global leader in digital health solutions with over 17 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 23.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices sold into over 140 countries worldwide. We are the clear market leader in sleep apnea, a huge and growing market with over 1 billion people impacted globally.\nOur category-leading flow generator platforms grew 11% year-over-year. We have achieved and are maintaining supply of our two 100% connectable AirSense platforms, with unconstrained supply of the AirSense 10 platform globally. Every quarter, we continue to gain regulatory approvals to launch and to increase delivery volumes of the best-in-class AirSense 11 platform on our pathway to support more and more patients worldwide. Our commercial teams are successfully demonstrating the clinical and economic benefits of the ResMed mask portfolio.\nDuring the quarter, our masks and accessories business grew 9% year-over-year in a highly competitive market, maintaining good market share with all players in the field in this category globally. We are excited to have achieved regulatory and reimbursement approval for our latest and greatest mask innovation and we look forward to bringing this technology to market soon. I have personally worn this new mask and our test data show, not just n equals 1 from the CEO, that it is highly favored by physicians, respiratory therapists and especially the most important customer, our patients.\nIn terms of maintaining our momentum of mask and accessory growth, our clinical and commercial teams continue to partner with physicians and providers to drive resupply programs directly with their patients. Peer-reviewed and published clinical evidence shows that using resupply programs leads to better patient adherence and to better patient outcomes. This is proving out in the real-world customer by customer. We continue to see strong growth in the U.S. mask and accessories business, where resupply programs are powered by our digital health ecosystem, including AirView for physicians, Brightree for home care medical equipment providers and myAir for patients. Outside the U.S., we are focused on developing, launching and scaling our direct outreach and subscription programs, to help consumers take control of their own health and engage directly in refreshing their own mask, their own tubing, their own humidifier and other accessories.\nThe importance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene in the eyes of consumers has seen a permanent uptick since 4 years ago when the COVID-19 epidemic started. We're supporting our customers with digital solutions and services to meet their needs and to ensure they have clean and fresh equipment to best treat their sleep suffocation and improve their health. Before I review updates on our key strategic priorities, I'd like to discuss recent actions we have taken to accelerate profitable growth across ResMed and to power our long-term success.\nLast quarter, I discussed the steps we've taken to ensure that we can refocus and drive even more profitable growth. We stopped some projects that were not working out and we increased investment in areas that will be pivotal to our long-term success, including our digital health technology investments as well as focused device platform and mask technology development. We have introduced a new operating model centered on making ResMed even more product-led, even more customer-centric and even more brand enhanced. We will measure the success of this new 2030 operating model by an increase in the velocity of new product innovation as well as enhanced value in the ResMed brand while accelerating profitable growth. As the founder of ResMed states, innovation is not just invention of a great new technology is when a customer loves it, adopts it and chooses to pay for it. We have an incredible legacy and an exciting product pipeline to bring to market. Let's now turn to a discussion of our 3 key strategic priorities.\nNumber 1 is to grow and differentiate our core sleep health and breathing health business. Number 2 is to design and develop and deliver market-leading med tech and digital health solutions that can be scaled in 140 countries plus worldwide. Number 3 is to create and leverage the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and preferably in the home. In terms of addressing strategic priority #1, as the world's clear leader in the field of sleep apnea and breathing health, we're laser-focused in 2024 on ramping up our demand generation initiatives. We're raising awareness and creating pathways for patients to find access to care for sleep suffocation across specific global markets. We are leveraging traditional health care channels and investing in cost-effective social media-driven demand generation campaigns to help consumers who are concerned about their own sleep and breathing to find their way into screening, diagnostic, treatment and management pathways.\nOur goal is to provide a digital health care concierge service to help guide people on that journey. We are tracking new patient starts in our physician and provider-based ecosystem, which now contains more than 26 million patient records as well as the new user starts in myAir, which is a patient app where patients choose to participate in their own personalized health care journey to better sleep and better breathing. Our goal is to cost effectively drive more and more of the over 1 billion people worldwide who need our help into the channel. There are 2 megatrends that can have an influence on increasing that patient flow, 1 from big consumer tech and 1 from Big Pharma. Let me talk briefly about each of these megatrends.\nMany of the big consumer tech companies are increasing their focus on the area of sleep wellness. Apple has sleep wellness tracking built into its latest-generation Apple Watch and has plans to enhance that capability with further sleep quality assessment. Google's Fitbit division has sleep wellness tracking built into its platform. WHOOP is doing the same. Samsung have not only built sleep wellness tracking into its latest operating platform, but is helping to define sleep personas to help consumers better understand a 30% of their lives they spend in the state of sleep.\nWe love this attention on the field of sleep wellness and many of these technologies will help each person find out if they have issues with sleep architecture, issues with breathing during sleep, or issues maintaining high quality sleep. This could be one of the biggest waves of people taking control of their own pathway for discovering they have sleep apnea or they have insomnia, or maybe they have both, a state that is called COMISA for comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea. Ultimately, this will lead to increasing patient growth for ResMed overall. And our goal is to best educate the person as they move from sleep wellness tracking to sleep health tracking and from consumer awareness into a true health care pathway for screening, diagnosis, treatment and ongoing management of their chronic condition. ResMed plans to be there with the person through that entire journey.\nIn terms of the impact of megatrends from big pharma, the current focus is squarely on GLP-1 medications. Let me take some time to address what we are seeing in the market with patients on latest-generation GLP-1 therapies and positive airway pressure therapy. We're tracking a cohort of over 0.5 million patients with prescriptions for both GLP-1 medications and positive airway pressure therapy. These data are included in our investor deck, so you can review them there on our website, but I'll briefly summarize what we have observed. Around 6 months ago, there was a thought among some in the market that patients on GLP-1 medications would be less likely to start positive airway pressure therapy.\nWe stated at the time and still do, that this was not likely the case as important risk factors such as craniofacial geometry, gender, age and the basic physics and anatomy of the upper airway would remain unchanged despite this new pharmaceutical therapy option. Still, the theory remained. So now we have real-world data and real-world evidence at scale. Our analysis of over 529,000 patients with GLP-1 prescriptions shows that not only is there not a reduction in the propensity to start positive airway pressure therapy, it is the exact opposite.\nFor patients who have been prescribed a GLP-1, there is an increase of 10% of the absolute percentage of patients that commence positive airway pressure therapy. So as an example, if you take a baseline of 75% of patients that commence PAP therapy after their prescription on average in a certain group, that would become 85% of those same patients who were on a GLP-1 that would commence positive airway pressure therapy. And by the way, the vast, vast majority of these GLP-1s are the latest generation medications. Another hypothesis about 6 months ago was that patients on GLP-1 therapy and PAP therapy would quit their PAP therapy, their CPAP or their APAP at a higher rate than the general population over time. The real world data, again, with a cohort of over 0.5 million patients shows the exact opposite. At t equals 12 months after therapy commencement on PAP, the delta from general PAP population to a PAP plus GLP-1 prescribed population shows an increase in the resupply rate of 300 basis points.\nSo again, as an example, if the general population resupply rate at 12 months was, say, 70%, it would then become 73% for the population that was prescribed both PAP and GLP-1 therapy. This delta actually increases over time going further with the delta from the general PAP population receiving resupply at 12 months being 500 basis points higher for a population prescribed both PAP and GLP-1s. Here at ResMed, we believe in treating the whole person, including a combination of what Professor Bill Dement, one of the founders of the field of Sleep Medicine, may he rest in peace, called the Triumvirate of Health. That triumvirate is one, regular cardiovascular exercise; two, balanced diet and nutrition; and three, good sleep and breathing. We believe that addressing all 3 aspects results in the best patient outcomes.\nIn terms of best-in-class treatments for sleep apnea, achieving that goal of good sleep and good breathing, we have peer-reviewed and published research demonstrating that we can achieve over 87% of patients adherent to our PAP technology by combining our market-leading device platforms with digital health solutions, including AirView for physicians and myAir for patients. Even with this best-in-class global technology, we still have more than 10% of patients that need alternatives. We just can't get them adherent to those 10%. We're investing in these alternative therapies and we are working to help patients who do not adhere to positive airway pressure to find their path to second-tier therapies, such as dental devices where ResMed has invested and scaled the market-leading 3D printed dental device for sleep apnea in Europe called Narval. In addition, we have investments in other third-tier therapies, including pharmaceutical agents with our Apnimed investment as well as hypoglossal nerve stimulation technology with our [indiscernible] investment.\nResMed stands for respiratory medicine, not CPAP company, and we want to take care of the patient. We obviously start with the lowest cost, highest efficacy therapies, including CPAP, APAP and bilevel therapies. And we then work through the alternatives to help the person sleep better and breathe better. The bottom line is this, a huge number of people need our sleep apnea treatment solutions today and for the next decade, 2 decades, 3 decades and beyond. We want every patient to find a path to good breathing and good sleep.\nLet's pivot for a moment to talk about our digital health technology investments, leveraging the 17 billion nights of deidentified medical data and the 23.5 million 100% cloud connectable devices in our ecosystem. We are investing in several artificial intelligence-driven data products and capabilities in that ecosystem that we call Air Solutions. We're continuing to roll out, one publicly we're talking about, which is called ComplianceCoach to customers in the U.S. market in a controlled market launch. ComplianceCoach is a solution that helps home medical equipment providers to prioritize both digital and personal outreach to improve patient compliance and drive better patient outcomes at a lower cost.\nComplianceCoach models and predicts the likelihood that a particular patient will or will not adhere to therapy based on algorithms built on billions of data points. The AI product then identifies for the HME provider, the key patients who may struggle to meet compliance requirements and takes a step further to drive digital and/or human actions to maximize the probability of adherence across the group. Customers using the product in its initial launch are excited and are starting to see very positive results across their business and for their patients. One final update on AI technology for this quarter. We recently launched an in-market trial of a ResMed developed generative AI product that serves as a digital concierge to help a group of people that we call sleep-concerned consumers, to best navigate as they search for their sleep-related information and they ask questions about their sleep wellness and potential treatment options.\nThis generative AI tool helps the person identify, engage and enroll on their personal journey to better sleep and better breathing. We're currently beta test marking this product in Asia Pacific, and we will look to scale globally over time. Our goal is to develop and scale this digital sleep concierge so that all those seeking better sleep and better breathing can find their personal pathway for the best outcome, the best treatment and the best long-term care.\nOur Respiratory Health business continues to be supported by sustained activity across our noninvasive ventilator platforms as well as our life support ventilator platforms. We continue to invest in clinical and economic trials for high flow therapy that we call HFT to even more cost effectively treat COPD in the home. As we develop these next-generation therapies, we will generate strong clinical evidence and economic outcomes that will support broader adoption of these innovations for treating respiratory conditions at home. The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD as well as neuromuscular disease continues to increase, and we offer low-cost, high-quality treatments to help address this health care epidemic.\nTurning to our Residential Care Software as a Service business, we had another great quarter with year-over-year growth of 24%. Organic growth of our SaaS business was solid across our Brightree and our MatrixCare brands with another full quarter contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN brand in Germany. Ongoing customer-facing synergies between our Brightree offering in the U.S. and our home medical equipment resupply revenue remains very strong, driving good growth across both our SaaS business and our core sleep health business. We expect to have sustainable organic growth across our portfolio of SaaS solutions in home medical equipment, home health, home nursing and beyond to be in the high single digits as we continue through this fiscal year and to achieve stable double-digit organic growth through fiscal year 2025 and beyond.\nWe continue to drive operating expense leverage through management of our capabilities for cloud compute, our capabilities for cybersecurity, interoperability and technology development and we plan to accelerate net operating profit growth across our SaaS portfolio and across the entire ResMed business. Our residential care SaaS business remains an integral part of ResMed's growth strategy. This business complements the market-leading software and the market-leading device solutions that we have in our sleep health and breathing health business, and we are well positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for residential care. We are transforming respiratory medicine and residential care at scale. We are leading the industry in developing, applying and adopting digital health technology across our markets. We continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations. We're focused on driving top line revenue growth, focused cost discipline and increased efficiencies to accelerate profitability.\nWe have created differentiated products and solutions for customers worldwide, driving long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. We lead the industry in digital health technology with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected and most intelligent solutions, and we don't plan to stop innovating anytime soon. We invest around 7% of our revenues straight back into market-leading research and development. ResMed's mission remains crystal clear: To improve 250 million lives through better residential health care in 2025. This patient-centric mission motivates me and ResMedians every day. During the last 12 months, we have improved over 170 million lives by delivering a medical device directly to a patient or a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that provides personal care for a patient. We've helped each person to sleep better, to breathe better or to live higher-quality lives with best-in-class health care delivered right where they live. I'm very excited about the opportunities in front of us and the pipeline we have ahead.\nIn closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, their hard work and dedication today and every day. Thank you.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks, and then we'll open up to Q&A for Brett and me and the team. Over to you, Brett.\n\nBrett Sandercock\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms, where applicable. We had strong financial performance in Q2. Group revenue for the December quarter was $1.16 billion, a 12% headline increase and 11% in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflects the ongoing combined availability of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 sleep devices to support solid underlying global demand and continued growth across our mask portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies positively impacted revenue by approximately $11 million in the December quarter.\nLooking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 9%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 12%. Globally, device sales increased by 11%, while masks and other sales increased by 9%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 7%, masks and other sales increased by 10%, reflecting growth in resupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 16%, again, reflecting strong demand and significantly improved availability of cloud connected devices. Mask and other sales increased by 4%, reflecting the impact of a strong prior year comparable growth rate. Software as a Service revenue increased by 24% in the December quarter, reflecting the contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, and continued strong performance from our HME vertical. Excluding our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue grew by 10% in the December quarter.\nMEDIFOX DAN contributed revenue of $28 million in the December quarter, consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. Note as we have now passed the first year anniversary of our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, our future SaaS revenue year-over-year will reflect organic growth. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 10 basis points to 56.9% in the December quarter. The increase primarily reflects a decrease in freight costs and increase in average selling prices and favorable foreign currency movements.\nThe benefits are partially offset by unfavorable product mix. Sequential gross margin increased by 90 basis points, primarily driven by a reduction in freight costs and an increase in average selling prices for our devices, partially offset by unfavorable product mix. We remain confident of a positive gross margin trajectory. Like many companies, we are monitoring potential headwinds that could arise in the Middle East conflict. Disruptions in the Red Sea will likely increase sea freight costs and shipping lead times. We're closely tracking the situation and taking action to mitigate potential impacts where we can.\nMoving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the second quarter increased by 4%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.1% compared to 20.5% in the prior year period and reflects savings and cost discipline following specific actions taken early in the December quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for the second half of fiscal year 2024. This guidance reflects the impact of our restructuring activities that resulted in a reduction in our workforce of approximately 5% during the quarter. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 6%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.4% compared to the 6.8% in the prior year period.\nLooking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the second half of fiscal year 2024. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 20%, underpinned by strong revenue growth and modest growth in our operating expenses. Following the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, our net interest expense for the quarter was $14 million. And as we continue to pay down debt, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $10 million to $12 million per quarter in the second half of fiscal year 2024. Our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 20.7% compared to 18.3% in the prior year quarter. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a significant reduction in the tax benefit associated with employee equity compensation this quarter compared to the prior year quarter.\nWe continue to estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year '24 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the December quarter increased by 13% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 13%. During the quarter, we recorded $64.2 million of restructuring-related charges following an evaluation of our existing operations and actions undertaken to improve operational efficiency and increase profitability. Restructuring charges included $28.6 million of employee severance and other onetime termination benefits, $33.2 million of intangible asset impairments associated with the wind down of certain business activities and $2.4 million of other asset impairments. The restructure charge has been treated as a non-GAAP item in our Q2 financial results.\nDuring the quarter, we also recorded a provision of $6.4 million for expected costs associated with the recently announced Masks with Magnets field safety notification. This expense has been treated as a non-GAAP item in our Q2 financial results. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $273 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings and relatively stable working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $23 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $45 million. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $210 million. On December 31, we have $1.2 billion in gross debt and $1 billion in net debt. During the quarter, we reduced our debt by $130 million. On December 31, we had approximately $955 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility, and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position.\nToday, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. As we advised last quarter, as part of our capital management activities, we resumed our previously authorized share buyback program in the December quarter. We purchased 335,000 shares for consideration of $50 million. We intend to continue to purchase approximately $50 million per quarter in the second half of fiscal year 2024. This will more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, pay down outstanding debt and deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions.\nAnd with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.\n\nAmy Wakeham\n\nVice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Brett, and thank you, Mick. Let's go ahead and turn to the Q&A portion of our call. Kevin, I'd like to turn it over to you to provide the instructions and then run this part of the call.",

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Communications and Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, Amy.\n\nAmy Wakeham\n\nVice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, everyone. Good morning and good afternoon. Welcome to ResMed's First Quarter Earnings Call for Fiscal Year 2024. We are live webcasting this call, and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today along with a copy of the earnings press release and presentation, both of which are available now.\nOn the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Following our prepared remarks, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer, to answer any questions you may have.\nDuring today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the GAAP reported numbers. In addition, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today.\nI'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.\n\nMichael Farrell\n\nThanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today. Our first quarter fiscal year 2024 results reflect strong growth across our entire business with double-digit top line growth. This growth was driven by double-digit global growth in the masks category and double-digit growth in our Software as a Service business. We also achieved high single-digit global growth in devices even as that category annualizes very high growth in the prior year period. The flexible and agile work of our supply chain, manufacturing and distribution teams has enabled us to provide ongoing global availability of our market-leading 100% cloud connectable flow generator platforms.\nWe have unconstrained supply of our AirSense platforms enabled by excellent volumes of the AirSense 10 platform globally and fast-ramping approvals, launches and delivery of the best-in-class AirSense 11 platform country by country. During the quarter, we accelerated delivery of the AirSense 11 in Japan, and we launched the AirSense 11 in Australia and New Zealand.\nWe have plenty of runway ahead on our pathway to launch in all of the 140 countries where we sell our solutions. We are very proud to be able to support all global demand for flow generators through a combination of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms. We remain laser-focused on accelerating the production and delivery of the AirSense 11 platform. We are moving swiftly on that front.\nOur Masks and Accessories business grew 21% year-over-year, amongst a highly competitive market with all global players on the field in this category. Our commercial teams are doing an amazing job of showing the clinical and economic benefits of the ResMed mask portfolio. Our clinical and commercial teams are also partnering with physicians and provider customers to drive resupply programs directly with patients.\nThe peer-reviewed and published clinical evidence showing that adoption of a resupply program leads to better patient outcomes is proving itself out in a real-world customer by customer. We continue to see strong growth in the U.S. masks business where provider resupply programs can scale, powered by our digital health ecosystem, including AirView for physicians and providers and myAir for patients.\nFor patients around the world, especially in nonreimbursed markets, we are developing, launching and scaling outreach and subscription programs to help the consumer who is the ultimate customer to take control of their own health and engage directly in refreshing their mask, tubing, humidifier and other accessories. This has been a permanent uptick since COVID-19. People care about respiratory health and respiratory hygiene and they are taking action, and we are supporting them with digital solutions and services to meet their needs.\nBefore I turn to review updates on our key strategic priorities, I'd like to spend a little time discussing actions we've taken to accelerate profitable growth across ResMed and to power our long-term success. We've taken immediate steps to ensure we're prioritizing the right things to drive profitable growth, and our leadership teams have carefully reviewed opportunities to improve our performance. We have stopped some projects that were not working out as well as we thought.\nWe've increased investment in areas that we believe will be pivotal to long-term success, such as our digital health tech investments as well as focused hardware and software development. Creating the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the most connected and the most intelligent health care solutions in the market. These changes have impacted some of our teams. And this week, we have taken actions that resulted in a reduction of our global workforce by 5%.\nDecisions like this that impact people are never easy. However, we know that we are doing the right thing, and we're doing the right thing to accelerate our growth and to refocus on our long-term mission. I feel more strongly than ever that we are well positioned with an incredibly long runway of profitable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders as we move forward.\nLet's now turn to a discussion of our 3 key strategic priorities: number one, to grow and differentiate our core Sleep Apnea and Respiratory Care business; number two, to design, develop and deliver market-leading medical technology as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to create, innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, a field that we call residential medicine.\nThere are over 2 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease and insomnia. There are millions more that we can support as they navigate the complex outside hospital health care system. We believe that health care should be delivered in the lowest cost, lowest acuity and highest comfort location possible. Very often, that is a patient's own home. We have a massive opportunity ahead of us to help hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Our end markets remain incredibly underpenetrated with many opportunities to add value, reduce friction, lower costs and improve patient outcomes.\nNow that we've been able to comfortably support overall global market demand for sleep devices for the last few quarters, we're ramping up our demand generation initiatives. We're investing in marketing efforts to raise awareness and patient engagement across specific global markets. We are leveraging traditional health care channels as well as investing in cost-effective direct-to-consumer demand gen campaigns to help what we call sleep concern consumers find their way into the screening, diagnostic, treatment and management pathway. We will act as a digital concierge to guide patients on that journey.\nIn terms of analyzing the results of these efforts to date and ongoing, we are tracking new patient starts in our physician and provider-based ecosystem, AirView, which now has more than 22.5 million patients, as well as the new user starts in myAir, where patients themselves choose to participate in their personalized health care journey to better breathing and better sleep. Patient flow into the funnel is at an all-time high.\nWe are well above the rates that we saw pre-COVID in 2019 across all geographies, triple digits across the board. The bottom line is that we are driving strong growth of patients into the funnel. We believe the work that's being done in the pharmaceutical industry right now with obesity drugs will be a net positive for patient flow and patient growth in sleep apnea, COPD and for ResMed overall.\nIn terms of existing patients in our installed base, we are actively tracking a cohort of many thousands of patients on these GLP-1 medications and APAP therapy. We are not seeing any significant change in the PAP adherence rates nor any reduced participation in resupply programs versus control groups. These data indicate that there is a cohort of patients on combined therapies in a stable state.\nIn terms of new patients activated into the funnel, we are seeing the number of new patients activated into the health care funnel picking up. We see patient flow is not only strong but increasing. We believe in treating the whole person here at ResMed, including a combination of cardiovascular exercise, diet and nutrition as well as good sleep and breathing. That combination was called the Triumvirate of health by Professor Bill Dement from Stanford, may he rest in peace. And we think a combination of these 3 elements will result in the best outcomes for patients. It is quite possible that this new class of drugs may become as large or even larger than the cholesterol class or the blood pressure treatment class of pharmaceuticals.\nIf this is the case, we will see a whole new population of patients activated with their primary care providers that we may never have seen in the health care system. If this comes to pass, we may see benefits for the entire health system and for the people being treated themselves and for ResMed, as more and more people are evaluated and screened for sleep apnea, respiratory insufficiency and other key chronic conditions as part of their primary care evaluations. Our data are showing an all-time high of patient flow and that supports this thesis.\nStepping back and looking at the science in the field of respiratory medicine, we have created a forward-looking epidemiology model for our core market of sleep apnea, spanning over 2 to 3 decades into the future. We have assumed an aggressive case for high market penetration of this new class of pharmaceuticals. We will publish the epidemiology model in our investor deck straight after this call. The model starts using a baseline of the global prevalence of sleep apnea, which was 936 million people in 2015. And this is based on peer-reviewed and published data from the Journal Lancet in 2019. Our epidemiology model grows with conservative population and aging assumptions to a prevalence of around 1.4 billion people suffering from sleep apnea in 2050.\nWe then overlaid an aggressive assumption for the adoption of this new pharmaceutical class globally. We assumed some of the highest penetration rates that we have seen reported by analysts in the industry. With this aggressive and sustained adoption of the new drug class, we forecast that the global prevalence of sleep apnea will still be around 1.2 billion people in 2050.\nNow in terms of the market penetration of our PAP therapy into this population, we have assumed market growth from our 22.5 million patients with PAP therapy here at the end of calendar year 2023 using steady-state market growth rates that we saw in the years leading up to 2019. That is mid-single-digit growth for devices and high single-digit growth for masks.\nWith these growth rates, we reached around 109 million patients on our PAP therapy by 2050. That leaves 1.1 billion people remaining in the addressable market in 2050. Over and above those already on our PAP treatment. We will continue to update our epidemiology model with all the new data as they arise. However, the bottom line is that there remains a huge number of people needing our sleep apnea treatment solutions today and for the next 2 to 3 decades and beyond.\nWhile we're proud that we have peer reviewed and published data showing that we can achieve over 87% adherence of patients to our PAP technology, combining our best-in-class med tech hardware with our digital health solutions, AirView and myAir. That still means 10% of our patients on an annual basis will need alternatives. We are investing in those alternative therapies, and we are actively working with direct -- to direct patients who do not adhere to PAP, that 10%-plus to second-line therapies, such as dental devices, where we have invested and scaled the market-leading 3D printed dental device for sleep apnea in Europe called Narval.\nIn addition, we have investments in other second-line therapies, including pharmaceuticals, and hypoglossal nerve [ stim ] technology. We want every patient who suffocates at night to find a path to good breathing and good sleep. And it looks like there's 1 billion of them we need to help. We start with the highest efficacy and lowest cost therapy, which is PAP technology, where we have very high adherence rates and the best outcomes for patients, and we go from there.\nGiven this incredible multiple decades long plus runway of growth and as part of our ongoing efforts to improve and streamline that end-to-end patient pathway and to make it easier for sleep physicians and sleep labs to diagnose and manage these patients. We're excited about our Somnoware acquisition that we closed during the last quarter.\nSomnoware is software for pulmonary and really all sleep physicians. And it complements our current portfolio of software offerings for physicians, homecare providers and patients, including AirView, Brightree and myAir, respectively. The goal is to ultimately drive greater efficiency and better patient care by helping sleep physicians to take best-in-class care of their patients with increased efficiency and a better overall experience for the doctor and for the patient. We're making progress across several digital health technology initiatives to drive the value proposition of our cloud-connected devices even higher. We are investing in several artificial intelligence-driven data products and capabilities in our Air Solutions ecosystem.\nThis quarter, we started rolling out a digital product in our U.S. market called Compliance Coach. Compliance Coach is built for home care providers to help them efficiently focus efforts and prioritize outreach to increase patient compliance and ultimately to drive better patient outcomes by helping them meet and beat 90-day adherence goals. The application utilizes ResMed's many billions of nights of deidentified sleep and respiratory care data in the cloud to predict the likelihood that a patient will be adherent to therapy or not. The AI product then advises and coaches the home care provider to best identify the patients who may struggle and to meet compliance requirements where they can.\nSo they can prioritize their interventions and outreach to the best probabilities to support patient success. It's early in our rollout program of Compliance Coach. However, customers using the product are excited and engaged and are starting to see results. Watch this space for many more ways that we can work with all of our customers to unlock value from incredible depth of de-identified data using tech like AI and ML for the ultimate benefit of physicians, providers and patients.\nLet me discuss the forward pathway stemming from our joint venture with Verily right now that was called Primasun. Based on a mutual agreement between ResMed and Verily, we've made the decision to unwind the joint venture's day-to-day operations. We expect this to be complete by the end of the current quarter. Over the past years of this partnership, we've learned how to leverage technology to better identify, engage, diagnose and manage sleep concern consumers in our U.S. market.\nWe expect to take ownership of key assets of the Primasun developed model so that we can build on the investment and the learnings and ultimately accelerate our ongoing demand generation efforts with sleep apnea patients across ResMed.\nIt is exciting to take the learning from demand gen work in 1 project and in 1 country and to now look to apply that on a global scale across the 140 countries where we provide solutions. Our growing Respiratory Care business continues to be supported by the increased adoption of both noninvasive and life support ventilator solutions in terms of next-gen respiratory care therapies.\nWe continue to invest in clinical and economic trials for high-flow therapy that we call HFT, with the goal of cost effectively treating COPD in the home. We continue to generate strong clinical evidence and economic outcomes that we believe will support broader adoption of these technology innovations for treating lung disease in the home. We believe this has the potential for future growth for ResMed over the medium to long term.\nWe remain focused on addressing COPD as one of the top 3 chronic diseases for hospitalization and the #1 cause of rehospitalization. The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD as well as neuromuscular disease continues to increase and we are focusing and developing and plan to offer low-cost, high-quality solutions to address this health care epidemic.\nOur SaaS business had another great quarter with year-over-year growth of 32%. SaaS business growth was powered by another full quarter contribution from our fast-growing MEDIFOX DAN business in Germany, as well as high single-digit organic growth across our Brightree and MatrixCare brands in the U.S. market. The sustained high single-digit organic growth in our SaaS business is driven by strength in the HME segment and stability as well as increased tech adoption by customers in the facilities segment. We see a pathway to stable double-digit organic growth across the SaaS business, as well as increased net operating profit performance from this part of our business.\nThe ongoing synergies between our digital health solutions in SaaS and our core business remains strong, and we continue to leverage that through combined management of cloud compute, cyber security, interoperability, tech dev as well as customer-facing synergies, including patient resupply technology in our core business.\nDuring the quarter, we appointed Gregg Timmons as the new General Manager of our Brightree business. I'm excited to support Greg and Bobby to continue to drive growth in our home medical equipment providers and to help our customers across the U.S. market. This quarter, I traveled to Hildesheim, Germany to meet in person with the entire team from our MEDIFOX DAN business.\nThe growth in tech solutions for ambulant home nursing as well as stationary nursing home businesses is very strong in Germany. With an aging population in that country and a government that is driving care to be more home-based through their policies and more digital through their policies, we see a long runway for growth with our MEDIFOX DAN team and across our global Software-as-a-Service business.\nOur SaaS business remains an integral part of ResMed's growth strategy. This business complements the market-leading software and device solutions we have in our respiratory medicine business and we are well positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for residential medicine globally. And we have created differentiated value for customers and will drive long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders.\nBefore we get into a detailed update on our financials, let me say this here at ResMed. We are transforming respiratory medicine and residential medicine at scale. We are leading the market in digital health technology across our markets. As we continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations, we will leverage appropriate pricing and cost reductions to drive profitable growth. We're focused on driving top line revenue and tight cost discipline as well as increased efficiencies so that we can accelerate profitability, delivering value for all of our stakeholders and especially the 2 billion patients plus worldwide who need our help.\nAs we move through fiscal year 2024, I'm confident and laser focused that we will continue to see improvements in our gross margin with [ GM ] leverage programs focused on 5 key areas: number one, to drive the launch of AirSense 11 into new global markets and to increase the availability of AirSense 11 ultimately in all the country markets that we serve; number two, to drive ongoing strong mask growth with a combination of resupply programs, subscription programs and new product launches. And you can see that's working this quarter; number three, to increase software solutions growth moving from high single-digit organic growth to double-digit organic growth with increased net operating profit leverage in that segment; number four, to move the higher cost components and freight costs that we've seen through our legacy through our P&L.\nTurning what was a supply chain crisis headwind into a steady tailwind as we move through fiscal year 2024; and number five, to implement cost reduction actions in noncore areas of our business to free up cash and to accelerate investments in market-leading med tech and digital health solutions.\nSo in terms of Digital Health Investments and Solutions, we now have over 16 billion nights of de-identified medical data in the cloud and over 22.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices sold in more than 140 countries worldwide. We continue to lead the industry in digital health technology, and we don't plan to stop anytime soon. There is so much opportunity ahead of us. ResMed's mission and key goal remain crystal clear to improve 250 million lives through better residential health care in 2025.\nThis patient-centric mission drives and motivates Resmedians every day. During the last 12 months, we have improved over 165 million lives with the delivery of a medical device directly to a patient, a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution, helping each person to sleep better, to breathe better and to live high-quality lives with best-in-class health care delivered right where they live. I'm very excited about the opportunities in front of us.\nIn closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the 10,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, their hard work, their dedication, both today and every day. Thank you.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney. And after Brett's remarks, we will open up for Q&A from the entire group. Brett, over to you.\n\nBrett Sandercock\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q1. Group revenue for the September quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of 16%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 15%. Revenue growth reflected the ongoing combined availability of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 sleep devices to support solid underlying global demand as well as strong growth across our mask product portfolio. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies positively impacted revenue by approximately $10 million in the September quarter.\nLooking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 10%. In constant currency terms, sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 18%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other sales increased by 21%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 2%, which reflects the fact that we are cycling a particularly higher prior year comparable that was driven by sales of our card to cloud devices.\nMasks and other sales increased by 23%, reflecting growth in resupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 20% in constant currency terms, again, reflecting strong demand and significantly improved availability of cloud-connected devices. [indiscernible] patient setups.\nSoftware as a Service revenue increased by 32% in the September quarter, reflecting the contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition and continued strong performance from our HME vertical. Excluding our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue grew by 7% in the September quarter. MEDIFOX DAN contributed revenue of $25.7 million for the September quarter, consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. Note, we will anniversary this acquisition in Q2 FY '24, so our headline SaaS growth rate will moderate in Q2.\nTurning to the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Gross margin declined by 160 basis points to 56% in the September quarter. The decrease primarily reflects an increase in component and manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable product mix due to the increase in mask growth relative to device growth and favorable foreign currency movements. Sequential gross margin improved by 20 basis points, driven primarily by favorable product mix.\nMoving on to Operating Expenses. SG&A expenses for the first quarter increased by 15% or in constant currency terms increased by 14%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs as well as the incremental SG&A expense associated with the MEDIFOX DAN that we acquired in November 2022. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 20.2% compared to the 20.3% in the prior year period.\nLooking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for fiscal year '24. This guidance also reflects the impact of restructuring we initiated earlier this week, and we estimate this will result in a reduction in our workforce of approximately 5%. We expect to complete the restructure during our second quarter of fiscal year '24.\nR&D expenses for the quarter increased by 20% or in constant currency terms increased by 21%. The R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.9% compared to the 6.6% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year '24. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 10%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by a lower gross margin. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $15 million, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $12 million to $14 million per quarter over the balance of fiscal year '24. Our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 20.1%, broadly consistent with the prior year quarter.\nLooking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year '24 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the September quarter increased by 9% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.64 also increased by 9%. During the quarter, we recorded a provision of $8 million associated with the expected cost of the recently announced Astral field safety notification. We also recorded acquisition-related expenses of $0.5 million during the quarter.\nThese both have been treated as non-GAAP items in our Q1 financial results. We recorded losses of $4.5 million in our September quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. As Mick discussed, the joint venture will be winding down operations, and we will incur no further losses going forward in relation to Primasun.\nCash flow from operations for the quarter was $286 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings and stable working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $30 million, and depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $45 million. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $209 million, and at September 30, we had $1.4 billion in gross debt and $1.2 billion in net debt. During the quarter, we reduced our debt by $80 million. At September 30, we had approximately $825 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility, and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position.\nDuring the quarter, we also closed our previously announced Somnoware acquisition, a company that provides an upstream diagnostic management platform that is complementary to our current AirView and Brightree solutions. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. As part of our capital management activities, we plan to resume our previously authorized share buyback program starting in our second quarter. We expect to purchase shares to the value of approximately $50 million per quarter. This will more than offset any dilution from the issue of employee equity during the year.\nFinally, concurrent with our capital management activities, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and expect to deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions.\nAnd with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.\n\nAmy Wakeham\n\nVice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Brett, and thank you, Mick. Kevin, let's go ahead and turn the call back over to you to remind participants about instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.",

If anyone would require operator assistance, please press star zero under telephone keypad. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation.\n\nYou may press star 1 at any time, replacing the question Q. We do ask you ask one question and one follow-up then return to the Q.\n\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's not my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Communications and Invest Relations Officer. Please go ahead, Amy.\n\nGreat, thank you so much, Kevin. Hi, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year, 2023 Ernie's call. This call is being webcast live, and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of the Ernie's press release and the presentation, both of which are available now.\n\nOn the call today, our Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Following our prepared remarks, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Lucille Blaze, President of our Sleep and Respiratory Care Business for the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nDuring today's call, we will discuss several non- GAAP measures . Please review the supporting schedules and today's earnings press release for a reconciliation of the non- GAAP measures to our GAP reported numbers.\n\nOur discussion today will also include forward looking statements, including but not limited to expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward looking statements made today. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.\n\nThanks Amy and thank you to all our shareholders for joining us today as we review the results of our June quarter, the last quarter of our fiscal year 2022.\n\nOur results reflect incredible growth across our entire business with double-digit growth in our devices, masks and software business.\n\nUnconstrained availability of our market leading cloud connected flow generator platforms has enabled us to continue to offer access to 100% cloud connectable airsense 10 flow generated devices in all of our major global markets.\n\nand beyond. In parallel, we are ramping up and improving the availability of our best in-class essence 11 platform, which will gain further geographic regulatory approvals throughout the fiscal year and steadily increasing supply also throughout the fiscal year 2024 and beyond.\n\nAlthough challenges within the post-COVID supply chain haven't completely been mitigated yet, we expect ongoing steady improvements in component and end product supply in the quarters ahead, using a combination of SNS-10 and SNS-11 platform.\n\nWhile we remain focused on scaling production and global availability of the SN11 platform, we remain on allocation for the A11 platform for the next few quarters.\n\nBut I want to be clear on this point, with combined availability of the unconstrained air 10 platform, we have enough devices to meet all of the customer needs that we see in major markets and globally. With the powerful combination of the air 10 and the air 11 platforms, we have the two best device platforms on the market.\n\nOur strong double digit 23% year-over-year growth in the device's category demonstrates that customers are choosing resmed and we are delivered.\n\nOur masks and accessories business also performed at a very strong 18% growth in constant currency this quarter. Patient demand continues to drive increased adoption and utilization of our mask resupply programs or mending a steady cadence of new patient set up.\n\nWe continue to see strong growth in both the US business, where provider resupply programs have all mentored growth and in our markets outside the US, where our consumer outreach and subscription programs are also driving mask replenishment directly with those end user patients.\n\nOur teams continue to work incredibly hard to achieve these strong growth results amid a challenging industry environment where component costs and freight costs are still working their way through our inventory, post-disapply chain cry.\n\nI am proud of the work that 10,000 resmedians have put in every week, every month, every quarter to deliver these incredible results for the business, for our customers, for our shareholders, and ultimately for our most important customer, our patient.\n\nLet's now briefly review updates on the top three strategic priorities for our company.\n\nNumber one, to grow and differentiate our Caul sleep apnea and respiratory care business.\n\nNumber two, to design, develop and deliver market leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally. And number three, to create, innovate and grow. The world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital. A field that we...\n\nIn terms of our patient facing digital health platforms, adoption continues to go very well. The feedback we hear from patients and health care professionals remains very positive.\n\nWe are seeing strong adoption of the MyAir Patient App by folks using S-N-11. In fact, it is more than double the adoption rate that we saw with our S-N-10 platform. With many, many millions of patients signing up and engaging daily on their MyAir app to view their own sleep data on their own phone and to review their own therapy data.\n\nThis is important as engagement with a digital health platform like Maya is directly linked to higher adherence to therapy and patience. And higher adherence to therapy is directly related to better patient outcomes to increased resupply and to better economics for the payer and the healthcare provider with lower overall healthcare costs.\n\nLast month we announced and closed the acquisition of Somnowware. Somnowware is a US-based leader in sleep and respiratory care diagnostics software and physician management software.\n\nas part of our ongoing efforts to improve and streamline the end-to-end pathway for patients and make it easier for sleep labs and physicians and their practices to diagnose and manage patients. We're excited about this acquisition that complements our current ecosystem of software solutions including air view for providers and physicians and bright trees for home care providers.\n\nThese ecosystem together will drive greater efficiency and better patient care by accelerating the pathway to therapy and with a better overall customer experience.\n\nWe're also excited about our progress across several digital health technology initiatives to further increase the value proposition for our connected healthcare eCAS.\n\nover the next several quarters we plan to introduce several artificial intelligence driven data products and capabilities on both the physician and provider facing air view platform as well as the patient facing my air app.\n\nearly testing of these AI-driven data products is very positive in both of these customer groups and we will refine to the optimal digital design and then we will launch and then we will scale these products around the world.\n\nThese AI-driven data products provide personalized suggestions to increase therapy adherence and to ultimately improve patient outcomes, as well as patient physician and provider experience.\n\nWe will continue to invest in the world's largest digital healthcare ecosystem that we have with over 15.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud as we continue to unlock value from those data to benefit physicians, providers, payers and patients.\n\nWe saw strong growth in our respiratory care business in the quarter through ongoing adoption of our non-invasive ventilators, as well as our life support ventilator solution.\n\nWe're still in the early stages of market development with some of our newer to market technologies in this category, including home-based high-flow therapy that we call HFT, for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD in the home.\n\nWe continue to generate clinical evidence and economic outcomes to support broader adoption of these technology innovations for treating lung disease in the\n\nWe're encouraged by the clinical results we've seen with our HFT trial so far, and we continue to remain very focused on addressing COPD as one of the top diseases globally for hospitalisation and the number one cause of re-hospitalisation in the US Geographer.\n\nThe prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD, as well as respiratory insufficiency due to neuro-muscular disease continues to increase. And we are focused on having low cost, high-quality solutions to address this health epidemic.\n\nOur SaaS business had another grape quarter with year over year growth of 34%.\n\nOur SaaS Business Growth was supported by another full-quarter contribution from our fast-growing Medifox Dan business, as well as solid organic growth of 8% across our Breitrie and Matrix series.\n\nWe're pleased to see sustained high single digit growth in our fast business on an organic basis driven by the ongoing strength in the HME and infusion segment and more stability in the facility segment as patient flows have now rebounded post-COVID\n\nI'm very impressed by the leadership of our most recent SAS portfolio addition, Medifox Darn, which is on track and meeting or beating our expectations.\n\nI'll be visiting personally with the team in Hildesheim, Germany, this quarter to discuss the growth face to face with the digital health innovators there in Hildesheim who are changing healthcare and taking care of people in the lowest cost, lowest security, and highest quality of life setting, which is very often the...\n\nWe believe this is the future of health care and that's where we're investing and that's where we're winning.\n\nOur customers continue to see the value of adopting technologies to improve and optimize business efficiencies and personalize care. And we deliver the best software solutions to help customers do just that.\n\nThere is pent up demand for technology investments in residential medicine verticals, particularly as staffing shortages continue to impact the industry, particularly in nursing, but across the clinician and provider groups. This presents opportunities for resmeds fast solutions to streamline operations and create work flowers.\n\nSo our customers staff can focus on providing personal\n\nIt's up to us to deliver for our customers and drive growth. I have confidence that our SaaS business can accelerate from these high single digits on an organic basis to double-dose growth on an organic basis in the mid to long term.\n\nOur fast business remains an integral part of ResMed's growth strategy. This business complements the market leading software and device solutions that we have in our core sleep app near and respiratory care business.\n\nAs an important example, our Brightfree Resupply Program continues to demonstrate strong strategies between SAS and our core business. Providing resupply for patients with sleep apnea, CRPD, neuromuscular disease, and beyond.\n\nThe output of this work can be seen in our very healthy 19% growth in mass revenues in the US geography discord.\n\nUltimately, this work results in better outcomes for the patient, the physician, the provider, and the payer, with lower overall healthcare costs. We are well positioned as the leading global strategic provider of South Solutions, the residential medicine globally, and we have created differentiated value for our customers as low long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders.\n\nHere at ResMed, we are transforming respiratory medicine and residential medicine at scale. Leading the market in digital health technology across our business.\n\nAs we continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations in this post-COVID world, we continue to leverage appropriate pricing and cost reductions to drive accelerated growth in our bottom line.\n\nWe are focused on driving top line revenue and maintaining tight discipline and increasing efficiencies so that we can lower costs and ultimately so that we can accelerate our impact and our bottom line profitability, delivering even further value for all of our share.\n\nAs we move through fiscal year 2024, I see improvements in our business margins with geography mix, with product mix, and specifically with strong by-level and non-invasive ventilator growth, with strong mass growth, and with increased software solutions growth. All these business lines are margin-accretive to our growth.\n\nI also see that the higher inventory costs and freight costs that we've seen through the supply chain crisis continue to work their way through our salt products. And as we progress through the fiscal year, we will continue to drive the transition to essence 11. And we will gain regulatory approvals and we will scale products.\n\nAll these factors above lead to tailwinds for the gross margin and the net margin of our business as we move through the fiscal year. I can tell you we are working furiously to drive all of the above elements with our global\n\nWe now have over 15.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud, as I said earlier, and those data come from over 21.5 million, 100% cloud-connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We continue to lead the industry in digital health, and we don't plan to stop anytime soon, because there's so much opportunity ahead of...\n\nSeven percent of our revenues go straight into R&D to power our hardware and our data innovation.\n\nResumance, mission and key goal remains crystal clear. We will improve 250 million lives through better residential health care in 2025.\n\nThis patient's centric mission drives and motivates resmedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal over the last 90 days. And during the trailing 12 months, we have improved over 160 million lives with the delivery of a complete device platform to a patient or a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that is helping each person to sleep better, to breathe better, and to live a higher quality life with healthcare delivered right where they live.\n\nAs we start fiscal year 2024 here, I'm very excited about the opportunities in front of us. We just had our SAS ASM earlier this week, and I'll be attending the country market groups, CMG group for our North American team in the coming weeks, and South meetings are happening around the world. We're on a good trajectory. We have an exciting part.\n\nIn closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 resmedians for their perseverance, their hard work and their dedication but today and every day. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett and Sydney and then we'll move and open up for Q&A for the group. Brett, over to you.\n\nIn my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 and less noted all comparisons out of the prior year quarter.\n\nWe have strong financial performance in Q4. The revenue for the June quarter was 1.12 billion, an increase of 23% on a headline basis and in constant currency terms.\n\nRevenue growth reflected the ongoing combined availability of cloud connected air-sense 10 and air-sense 11 and sweep devices to support strong underlying global demand as well as solid growth across our broader product portfolio.\n\nYear-on-year movements and foreign currencies negatively impacted revenue by approximately 3 million in the June quarter.\n\nLooking at our geographic revenue distribution, excluding revenue from our software of the service business, South and US Canada and Latin America countries increased by 25.\n\nconstant currency terms, sales in Europe , Asia and other markets increased by 14.\n\nGlobally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 24%, while mask and other sales increased by 18.\n\nBrating it down by regional areas, device sales in the US, Canada and Latin America increased by 30% as we benefited from strong demand. And as previously mentioned, our continued ability to fully supply the market with combined availability of ASPEN and AS11, cloud connected device.\n\nmasks and other sales increased by 19% reflecting growth in resupply and new patient setup.\n\nEurope , Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 15% in constant currency terms, again reflecting strong demand and improving availability of cloud connected device.\n\nMaster and other sales increased by 14% in constant currency terms, reflecting increased patient setup.\n\nBut whereas the service revenue increased by 34% in the June quarter, reflecting the contribution from our Medifilks down acquisition and continued strong performance from our HME Vertex.\n\nExcluding our Medifox ban our position, fast revenue grew by 8% in the June quarter.\n\nRedifox Band contributed revenue of 27.3 million for the June quarter, consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquies.\n\nDuring the rest of my commentary today, I will refer to non-gap numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-gap to gap numbers, now fourth quarter earnings press release.\n\nGross margins declined by 200 points to 55.8% in the June quarter. The B-CREASE primarily reflects component cost increases, warranty and manufacturing related cost increases, and product makes sure that the significant increase in sleep device sales are actually offset by increases in average selling price.\n\nOn a sequential basis unfavorable foreign currency movements accounted for the 30 basis points decline in our gross margin.\n\nAnd we saw a level of unexpected product and expense as we continue to see strong growth in sleep devices in the US market.\n\nMoving on to operating expenses, S-GNA expenses for the fourth quarter increased by 25%, or in constant currency terms increased by 26%.\n\nThe increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs, marketing and travel expense.\n\nAs well as incremental SGNA expenses associated with METIFOX Dan that we acquired in November 2022.\n\nThis year now expenses as a percentage of revenue was 21.5% compared to 21.1% in the prior year period.\n\nLooking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect S-GNA expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20 to 23% during fiscal year 24.\n\nR&D expenses for the quarter increased by 21% or in constant currency terms increased by 23%.\n\nR&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7% consistent with the prior year quarter.\n\nLooking forward in subject currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a definitive revenue to be in the range of 7 to 8% during fiscal year 24.\n\nOperating profit for the quarter increased by 13% under pin by strong revenue growth, partially offset by lower growth margin.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of METE 5 stand, our net interest expense for the quarter is 15 million and we expect interest expense to be a similar amount per quarter in the first half of the fiscal year 24.\n\nOur effective tax rate for the June quarter was 18.3% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 17.6%.\n\nLooking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 24 will be in the range of 19 to 21%.\n\nThat income for the June quarter increased by 7%, and non-gap diluted earnings per share, also increased by 7%.\n\nDuring the quarter, we incurred 1.8 million in acquisition expenses associated with our Somnover acquisition. And we recognised restructuring costs of 9.2 million associated with the closure of the ARIA Limpedema business and workforce rationalisation in our German and SAS business vertical.\n\nWe also recognise a gain of 20.2 million within our income in relation to a business in a rupture insurance claim.\n\nPlease have all been treated as non-gap items in our Q4 financial results.\n\nCash flow from operations for the quarter was 237 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, partially offset by a modest increase in working capital.\n\nCapital expenditure for the quarter was 34 million, depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled 47.\n\nWe ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of 228 million. At June 30, we had 1.4 billion in gross debt and 1.2 billion in net debt. We mainly reflect the funding of our Metifox ban act.\n\nDuring the quarter, we reduced our debt by 145 million. At June 30, we had approximately 745 million available for lockdown under our revolver facility. And we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position.\n\nOur Board of Directors today declared a quorthy dividend of 48% per share representing an increase of 9% over our previous quorthy dividend and reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance.\n\nGoing forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and expect to deploy further capital for tucking acquisitions, such as our recently announced acquisition of SOMNWARE, a company that provides an upstream diagnostic management platform that is complementary to our current air view and proprietary solutions. And with that,\n\nGreat, thank you Brett and thank you Mick. Kevin, I'd like to go ahead and turn the call back over to you to provide the instructions and run the Q&A portion of our call.\n\nCertainly, we're now beginning to have a question and answer session. As a reminder, we ask you, please ask one question and one follow up. If you'd like to be placed in the question queue, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. One moment please. All right.\n\nOur first question today is coming from Matthew Mishon from Keybank Capital Markets, your life is now live.\n\nHey, good afternoon and kind of thank you for taking the questions. And Mick, with the devices number for a steady sequentially around this 600 million mark, is this where the number would kind of base out if you are supplying the majority of the market? And Kenneth, from here, are we looking at just a 600 million and then add on some percentage of what the underlying sleep market is kind of growing?\n\nYeah, thanks for the question Matthew and it's a good one. It's it's hard to predict because there are so many factors\n\ninvolved that are going on in the market right now. But yeah, as you said, a very solid number, $602 million in global devices in the quarter and 30% growth in US Canada, Latin America, 15% growth in Europe Asian.\n\nand rest of the world. Look, we're seeing a strong sort of mid-single digits level of patient flow into the channel. We're seeing in addition to that, like in terms of new patients.\n\nWe're seeing in addition to that, resupply of patients at that five-year point for most US reimbursement and various points in the other 139 countries where people make their own decisions or insurance has other criteria to drive that. So it's new patient setups, it's resupply setups. And there's of course the impact of a competitor recall, which is, you know, was supposed to be over in June 30 and now has no definitive dates. And so as we look to that with all those unknown factors, it's very hard for me to say Matthew that it's just stop and steady growth from here. It might be stronger growth from here.\n\nThanks for the question, Matt.\n\nThank you. Next question today, Clint from Margaret, Couser, from William Blair, your line is now live. Hey, good afternoon and good morning, everyone. I wanted to follow up first on the competitive dynamic to the extent that you'll see anything maybe into the marketplace. So whether your peak competitor is coming back, either approaching or maybe hiring process marketing campaigns, anything that maybe they're gearing up for that you're seeing.\n\nThank you. Next question today, clean from Margaret Kuzor, from William Blair. Your line is now live.\n\nA good afternoon and good morning, everyone. I wanted to follow up first on the competitive dynamic to the extent that you'll see anything maybe into the marketplace. So whether your peak competitor is coming back, either approaching or maybe hiring processes, marketing campaigns, anything that maybe they're gearing up for that you're seeing or is demand relatively similar to what you see in the past, no real change. And ethane it.\n\nYeah, thanks Margaret and welcome back. Yeah, I think it's difficult to predict exactly where they're at from those sort of early emerging signs as you say. Look, we have regional competitors in Europe that we are fighting with every day there. We have regional competitors in Asia that we're fighting with every day and regional competitors in the Americas that we're fighting with every day. You know, when Phil's comes back, they'll have to start at position number four if you like a new patient setups. They are back and we are competing with them in some countries in Europe like in Spain. They never went away because they never had a fun device there. So they've been there the whole time through this recall. It was been...\n\ntakes away that uncertainty and allows us to push forward. But yeah, we're competing head to head with them in some many countries in Asia and some countries in Europe . And it's like it was in 2019, where our smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more connected and more digital solutions are taking share and holding share. And it's an ongoing competitive game. And as I said, we're launching some of these AI driven products on top of the ecosystem. It's an exponential game when you think about digital. And we're well ahead. We've had two or three years here to sprint ahead. We were ahead before that. And I think it's a long-term game. We'll keep productively paranoid. But we are improving outcomes. We're lowering costs and the physicians like the workflow efficiencies and patients like the increased adherence and pay us like the fact that there's an ROI in lowering total health care costs. Thank you guys. Can we have some new patrol from the Z-O group? Realigners now live. Great. Thank you. Congrats on a strong top line here, share gains. Maybe two-part question. Mick, one would be just on the amount of resupply that's now coming in as it relates to the share gains that you've seen over the past two years. Is the resupply number we're seeing now where we actually started in the sea, consumables come off of the new sockets that you gained?\n\nThank you guys.\n\nThe next question is coming from Anthony Patrone from the Z-Hoke Group. Your line is now live.\n\nGreat, thank you. Congrats on a strong top line here, share gains. Maybe two-part question. One would be just on the amount of resupply that's now coming in as it relates to the share gains that you've seen over the past two years. Is the resupply number we're seeing now, where we actually start in the sea, consumables come off of the new sockets that you gain.\n\nSo that would be question one. And then question two, there's obviously the debate out there on GLP ones. Maybe from the perspective of resmed. How do you see the GLP one phenomenon playing out in the sleep space?\n\nSpecifically, do you expect to gain more patients from GLP1's versus maybe certain patients that would fall out of the funnel? Thanks again.\n\nYeah, thanks, Anthony, and welcome back to you too to the ResMed following us here. Thank you both for your question. You follow up in order. So firstly, on resupply, as you know, you've been following us for a number of years, it's not a lock and key. You can use our mask on other devices, and you can use other masks on our devices. The way that we've won masks share, and nobody's been on a major in terms of nothing able to sell recall out there on this. And so we've had head to head in competition with all the top five players in masks these last three years, and we've gained really good share with that. So I think it's just the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the minimalist size, you know, ones that have full freedom, and the ones that have the ability to front-prone sleepers and side-sleepers to provide that capability. And so that's how we've gained share in the mask side and maintained that share.\n\nSo, you know, there is a better together in that when you have an essence 10 or an essence 11, the mask leak data are more accurate, the interoperability of an AHI calculation or a leak calculation are more accurate. So, we certainly push that angle and we do get some extra share through the device, but it's not as material as the fact that the masks themselves are just excellent, which I think speaks to the sustainability there. So, you know, that strong resupplies, you said, you know, 19% growth in the US.\n\n14% growth in Europe , Asia and beyond where, you know, we don't have that sort of automated resupply that we have with Breitree Resupply Solutions in the US. That's been from hard work from our teams in Asia, Latin America and Europe on patient outreach, subscription programs and connecting directly to that end.\n\nSo, you know, I think post COVID people care about respiratory health, respiratory hygiene and taking care of themselves outside the hospital and we've been able to leverage that trend in the consumer side as well. So I think it's sustainable and I don't think, although maybe catalyzed somewhat by our increased device share, I think our mask share is on its own extraordinary due to the intrinsic product.\n\nThe second question around GLP, yeah, look, there's a lot of moving parts. I was just reading in the press today that many US employers banning coverage of GLP wants due to cost. European governments have all said no from the government insurance side. These things are incredibly expensive about 1,000, well, anywhere from 800 to $1,200, $1,000.\n\nSo I think there are three factors that will mitigate GLPs in the space. One is cost, two is adherence, and two is adherence.\n\nI'll take them really quickly in order. If you look at cost, take a 40 year old person who's on therapy full time for 40 years.\n\n40 times 12 times a thousand dollars is $480,000 a lifetime cost for that patient on a GLP one from 40 to 80 lifetime cost.\n\nIf you take that same patient and say, well, let's treat them with CPAP, right? First year, maybe $1,000 and then $39 years of, let's take a really strong case where you get four masks a year and they're all full face masks. That's about $13,000, $1,000. So it's 35 times more expensive to go over the GLP1. It's just like, you know, what's the ROI here? So that's cost. On adherence, the data out there about\n\n33% adherence at one year through the clinical trials on GLP1s. That's incredibly low. We get 87% adherence at 90 days and we hold it pretty strong there. So I think adherence is a big deal. And 30 side effects, reading thyroid, pancreas, kidney, cancer, these major side effects and minor ones like nausea, constipation and pain. You know, our biggest side effect at President Biden had a little mark on his face and he was asked about it and it was from his CPAP.\n\nLook, I think it's a long road to play out here. I think it's frankly good marketing around the area of obesity and It can drive patients into the funnel But I don't think it's going to be a major impact on on patients because we got 936 million of them worldwide And we need them to get into the funnel if they come in the funnel because they try to pill and it didn't work That's good for us too\n\nThank you. As a reminder that Star 1 is the place in the question Q, and in the interest of time we ask you please ask one question that returned to the Q. Our next question is coming from Soraz Kalle from Oppenheimer, your life is in our lives.\n\nSo we saw G, a gross margin step down a little bit. I know you said there was some reasonings for it, but I'm just looking forward, you know, kind of in the future. Maybe you can walk us to the temporary and we're strictly permanent changes. We should think through as far as GM outlook.\n\nYeah, thanks for the question and you look at it's a good one. Lots of factors going on gross margin. Actually the major one that as you noticed sequentially on the 30 basis points was foreign exchange. And that was on inventory as it flowed through our funnel. As we saw, those see perhaps A-PAPs, we had FX that had impact on six, nine months ago that they're flowing through inventory that we sold during the June quarter. That was the headwind of 30 basis points from...\n\nQ3 to Q4 You know we look I think there's so many moving parts But when you add it up and you look at geography mix and the upside opportunity for us to grow our business in Europe Asia Particularly Japan which which you know has some has some chance for acceleration over the coming years product mix\n\nI mentioned in the prep remarks, particularly on by-level and our non-invasive ventilator growth. So think air curve ST, STA, air curve ASV. These are incredibly, and our masks side, particularly the full face, but any of them are.\n\nAll of those are growth margin accretive to our group and I see opportunities for strong growth in all those categories and also our software solutions have growth margin accretive capabilities and as we go on an organic basis from single digits\n\nto high single digits to low doubles. They're on the software, sat side of the business, I think that's margin of creeps. So I feel good about that.\n\nI also know that we're working through the sort of higher inventory cost that we had in that supply chain crisis. We had to spend more on chips.\n\nparts and pieces and those contracts and get more expensive components for the cloud-connective Chippen beyond and those freight costs that we invested in and everyone's talking old and used the freight costs are down You should take what you search for. Well, no actually the freight costs that we paid six nine months ago are working there With through way through our gross margin as you saw in the June quarter and that'll go on for for some time But that's going to continue to go down over time and as that does a go through our sole products There's going to be some tailwinds for gross margin and the final one and really important one is we're going to drive essence 11\n\nIt's the best in the world product.\n\nIt's better than the second best product in the world, which is the SNS10.\n\nand it gives us a chance as we gain regular true fruples and we skyle that production.\n\nto improve our gross margins there as well. So all those are tailwinds for the gross and net margin of the business as we move through the fiscal year. You know, hard to predict in that one of the main factors is, you know, how do we accelerate in the US and particularly in CPAP-APAP? I will never turn down a patient.\n\nIf there's demand for a patient and they want to see Pap and A-PAP, I'm not going to reverse engineer and we know how to do it. We could reverse engineer our gross margin up 30-50 basis points by slowing down sales of product. We're not going to do that. When a patient needs care, we're going to take care of them even if it's a slightly lower gross margin. And by the way, it is a very good gross profit dollars. And we get to take that cash flow as you saw a really strong cash flow in the quarter and reinvest it in R&D.\n\nSo we're working on all the above furiously and we're going to get successes. We go over the next one, two, three and four quarters.\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Morris, I live from UBS, Rebinders, and Live.\n\nHello, thank you. I was responding if you could talk about how your position to increase your mask supply in the event that the consent decree over at the competition impacts. Their ability to provide those, for example, if they end up constrained at a facility level. Thanks.\n\nYeah, look, we have run all sorts of scenario analyses around that. You know, I think one of the differences, if you think in terms of resume and stability to work with suppliers, in the core device side where in terms of chipset.\n\nThe whole MedTech sector is a group and you know I said on the board of AdVonnet and we were advocating for more semiconductor chips for the whole industry.\n\nyou know when we were going to Intel and TI and all these companies and sort of begging for semiconductor chips 12\n\n18 months ago all together we were less than 1% of the supply of chips and it was very difficult We did get some and as you saw we did have to pay a little more But we were able to get those contracts with other other players and get long-term contracts and get that supply\n\nwould then want to keep their factories operating and be looking for other supplies and we would be running the game theory and the analysis of where we go and how we go to ramp that production up. So it is a good problem to have for the business. I think it'd be a bad problem to have for patients, but I think the probability of that is relatively low, but if it does happen, we're ready. But Rob, do you have any thoughts on that, Bob Douglas, our president, COA? Yeah, hi, just one other minor comment on that. And it was said this before, because of the relatively low capex of our supply chain and the equipment that we need, we generally run with quite a lot of burst capacity, if you like, and so our ability to rapidly increase volumes as needed is really strong. Thanks for the question. Thank you. Next question is from Sean Laman. From Morgan Stanley , your loan is our life. Good afternoon, Mick.\n\nBecause of the relatively low capex of our supply chain and the equipment that we need, we generally run with...\n\nquite a lot of burst capacity if you like, and so our ability to rapidly increase volumes as needed is really strong.\n\nThe next question is from Sean Laman. From Morgan Stanley , your line is now live.\n\nGood afternoon, me. Hope you're well. I'm a little wonder if you could characterize for us some some of the price dynamics that might have been present during the quarter.\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Sean. Yeah.\n\nSimple question, very complex answer. You know, across the 140 countries and all the dynamics. I think one thing that I'm comfortable to say though on this is that if you look over the last.\n\nfour quarters, our commercial teams have done an incredible job of partnering up with our customers to say, look, inflation is up, costs are up.\n\nHow do we you know share some of the pain if you like of these increased costs and we were able to Increase some prices on some mask systems and components and and some devices where we could it's tough because customers\n\noften don't get much relief from the payers. They did in the Medicare side in the US market where there was an inflation adjustment up of around 5% January 1. So that was a benefit for our providers and so we could share some of the pains there in terms of increased pricing.\n\nBut we've also had some surchargers on our products in terms of freight. And although, you know, as I said in the prep remarks, we've seen all the news media that freight costs are all down. Well, yes, okay, they are on a spot price. But 12 months ago or 9 months ago, as that works through our inventory, that freight charge is still there and is still impacting our costs.\n\nof price elasticity, a question of how do we make sure we get that balance right? But it's a competitive game. Some of our competitors are out there saying the same thing publicly that costs are up and so we need to move prices appropriately and we're out there working with customers to make sure that we, as an industry, take care of patients in a sustainable economic way. And that involves both quantity, price and supply over the long term. So, you know, through the earlier, early quarters you mentioned that, you know, we were going to see sequential revenue growth through 2003 and we have seen that net fabulous. But with your competitors, keep competitors out of the market. Do you still expect to grow revenue sequentially into\n\nand supply over the long time.\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Leigh Ann Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\n\nGood morning, Nick. Can we ask a question about outlook? So, you know, through the earlier quarters you mentioned that, you know, we were gonna see sequential revenue growth through 2003 and we have seen that in that fabulous. But with your competitive, keep your competitive out of the mark.\n\nDo you still expect to grow revenue sequentially into a first quarter, second quarter, 24, or for however, however long as they remain out of the market?\n\nGreat question, Leanne. 12 months ago, when it was pretty clear that we had a strong runway there on the device aside and it was really we were constrained by our own production.\n\nI was able to very strongly say, look, I am confident that our supply chain team has got access to this reengineering, redesign and redeployment of key components, particularly electronic components, particularly semiconductors. And we did that. And we grew device revenue every quarter throughout fiscal year, 2023, as you noted. I was really excited with the team.\n\nAs we look forward to fiscal year 24, we don't give guidance really on the top line breads given some really solid guidance on our SGNA, our R&D, our effective tax rate, and how we're looking in those parts of the business are very controllable. As I said in some of the earlier questions, we had so many moving factors in overall demand in the market, but look, I'm confident because new patients continue to come into the funnel. Right, that's happening across the world. And it's not having randomly, we're driving demand-gen programs, we're driving them in Australian New Zealand with our WAKINY best campaign. We're driving them through our German teams, our India teams, our social media programs, in our China teams. This is really strong on social media, demand-gen. And so we're getting new patients in the funnel.\n\nenvironment and then there's the factor of you know that number four competitive and probably not coming back during the next 60 days through so the end of this this 90 day period but I'm not going to jump in and predict on that all I'm going to say is we're out there all day every day driving to mangen of new patients in we're out there farming for patients who need to get a replacement device and every day we're engaging with patients on my air and reminding of the importance of the clean hygiene and a new mask and engagement with their digital app so all the above gives me very strong confidence for I growth of res mid throughout the year but I'm not going to call it you know on an every 90 day basis here we just don't do that on the top one. Bacon next question is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs, Rebinder's NLI. Morning, afternoon. Thank you so, Mark on essence 11 you sort of emphasize its importance for gross margin. You also said to the start of the cool.\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs, Releiner's NLIS.\n\nMorning, afternoon, thank you. So, Mick, on air sense 11, you sort of emphasise it's important for gross margin. You also said at the start of the call, you sort of expect this to remain on the allocation for a few more quarters yet. I know this time frame was probably a bit longer than you'd hoped. I just wanted to confirm whether that's entirely a function of supply chain at this point or I guess whether there's any sort of strategic consideration to manage volumes during such an unusual, competitive dynamic.\n\nChris, thanks for the question. You know, we've really been focused on that patient and making sure no one's left behind, you know, as I said in an earlier question. And, you know, although the essence 11 is better margin for us and it's better innovation, and it has a higher engagement on the Maya app, which drives engagement.\n\nYou know, I'm off-replicating everything. Our view is that if there's a patient available and we have the parts and pieces and the ability to make an instance, can and take care of that demand now while we ramp as since 11, we're gonna do it. And we're gonna take care of that patient.\n\nBy the way, there's some really strong upside for that patient in that the alternative is a competitor device which would not be as small, quite comfortable and connected. And so they'd have a much worse experience than the SN10 with a competitive one. So it's better for the patient.\n\nso they'd have a much worse experience than the essence 10 with a competitive one. So it's better for the patient. It is slightly low margin for us, but we get that patient on therapy. And there is the better together with resmeds that it's more likely, hopefully, that they get a resmed mask and that they use that mask for the rest of their life. So I think there's an overlap there, if you like, of altruism in the profit mode of to do the right thing on a gross profit cash flow-driven environment, and we're not going to manage just to a GM line and say, well, let's not do that and make those products. And so it's less.\n\nIt is slightly low margin for us, but we get that patient on therapy and there is the better together with resumids That it's more likely hopefully that they get a resonant mask and that they use that mask\n\nfor the rest of their life. So, you know, I think there's an overlap there, if you like, of altruism and the profit motive to do the right thing on a gross profit.\n\nand if we have to do it with an S-N-10, which is an amazing, you know, seven-year-old platform that we're gonna do it. If we can do it with the brand new S-N-11 platform, we're gonna do it. And look, nothing's throwing us down. Our quality and regulatory teams are going geography by geography to get the S-N-11 approved in each of the regulatory environments. So as soon as that is, we can start selling the products. But the ramp up on S-N-11 is probably not as fast as it would be in a market where you had, you know, all five major competitors competing there because of that excess demand, we're covering a lot of that with the S-N-10. So that's sort of how we're thinking about it. Patient-centric, patient-demand, take...\n\nThanks for the question.\n\nBacon, next question is coming from Dan Harn from MST, your line is Nala.\n\nGood morning and thanks very much. Nick, at the third core result, you seem to be very confident about growth margin. In fact, I think at the time we noted what was the most positive growth margin commentary that we'd heard at a red net in risk memory. So I know you've spoken of component cost and why you don't manage to grow margin, but what else changed since the time again that commentary to the results?\n\nSo let me explain the component cost and why you don't manage to grow smartness, but what else changed since the time you get that commentary to the results? Yeah, thanks for the question. And I think actually, if you go back and look, all the factors that I talked about 90 days ago, we're talking about today, but in addition, the essence 11 ramp that we're putting together there, what happened in these 90 days that was unpredictable was there was more demand. And we thought a competitor may be back and there was more demand for CPAPs and APAPs than we didn't.\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. And, you know, I think actually if you go back and look, all the factors that I talked about 90 days ago, you know, we're talking about today, but in addition to the essence 11 ramp that we're putting together there, you know, what happened in these 90 days that was unpredictable was there was more demand, what we thought a competitor may be back, and there was more demand for CPAPs and APAPs, and we didn't.\n\nYou know, I know the exact number of how we could have slowed down our essence 10 generation to get gross margin to be plus 30 basis points from Q to Q. But we didn't engineer it and reverse engineer it that way. We said there's demand out there. Let's go take care of those patients.\n\nThat was the unexpected factor. It was USC PAP and APAP demand. And it looked through the numbers, you'll see that it was incredibly strong and gross profit generation, cash flow generation, incredibly strong during the quarter. And we did think about it, oh gosh, do we follow through and saying, oh, we want to get a creative GM, 90-90 to 90-day point? Or do we say, take care of that patient? And we said, no, we're going to do the right thing. We're going to take care of the patient. So we're thinking about the long term here. But no, I'm still bullish over this fiscal year, for sure. You know, you never can know what demand is going to look like and where it's at. And we are not going to not take care of a patient.\n\nBut as those higher inventory costs work their way through our system, there's opportunity for growth margin improvement as we go forward.",
    "content2": "a lot of people on that sort of COVID, I'm not traveling, I'm not going to see customs, I'm not going to do the strategic meetings and the planning meetings. We've opened some of that up as you saw in our SGNA, and so that's impacting our net margin as well. We're gonna manage those tightly and carefully, and we'll probably have some further vigilance if you like on our SGNA. We won't be pulling back really on R&D. I think that the innovation engine has to continue to grow and we're doubling down on AI, and I think our leadership and digital health, we have to make that happen. I'm still bullish throughout the fiscal year of FY24, but we're not gonna not take care of a patient if there's excess demand with the CPAP and APAP to manage one component of the PNL versus taking care of the patients and thinking about the 135-year strategic engagement with the patient, with the physician, with the provider, and doing the right thing for the industry. That's the sort of factors that have changed in the next 90 days. I hope actually all this comes together and we continue to do both. We're gonna be able to do the needs of the patient and be able to get a Christian in our GM. And I'm very confident we'll do that over the coming, you know, 369-12 months. Thank you. Next question is coming from David Lowe from GP Morgan, your loan is our life.\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from David Lowe from JP Morgan. Your line is not live.\n\nThanks very much. Nick, could I comment a little on what you saw in the XUS market? Obviously, like quarter, we thought the big vent sale, vent letters, all went to China, just wanting if there's any countries you'd call out or any items.\n\nYeah, David, that's a good point. We didn't really see anything of material context in this quarter in terms of exacerbation of COVID that led to hospital-based and life support ventilator sales. And so we're back to, I would say, the sort of...\n\nsteady growth that we see in our neuromuscular disease, our COPD and other sort of respiratory insufficiency parts of our business for life support events. On the non-invasive events and adaptive server events and by-levels, we're back to steady market growth and actually we saw strong double digit growth. As those, you know, post-COVID was done to see the clinics open up and patients will start to come back. Robin, any thoughts on ventilator? No, not on ventilators because it's gonna come on masks. Yeah. Yeah, though, the masks in all these other markets were really strong and really showing underlying strength of the market, not affected by recalled dynamics or anything like that.\n\nSo really the whole patient diagnostic system that are working in order and everything.\n\nThe next question is coming from Stephen Wien from Jordan. Your line is online.\n\nI just wanted to ask Brett about the working capital position. Again, last quarter, you were thinking that you'd be able to make some inroads into those and to the inventory balances that you had such that we might see a bit of more of the release of cash, but obviously, the inventory stepped up again as has...\n\nthe receivable. Is that just building more to the demand that you see or could just help put that into a bit more context as watching the quite play out the way you thought?\n\nYeah, hi, Steve, it's Brad. The inventory actually came down a little bit sequentially, so that's sort of tracking down how we expect and we expect that the inventory balance should decline over the course of FY24 as well. The receivables you are with up a little bit, but that's really driven by the revenues. I think...\n\nOverall in the working capital, we're in pretty good shape. It was up a little bit this quarter. When you look at that, it's really the timing around tax payments this quarter, so we paid.\n\nhigher tax this quarter and we would typically do each quarter. So that drove, if you like, a little bit of negative working capital, but again, that's just a timing element. So we were expecting pre-robust cash flow generation through each of the quarters in FY24. And we'll continue to work hard on the working capital bringing that down. A big driver of that will obviously be the inventory and working that down progressively over the fiscal year.\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Mike Matson from Neiman Company. Your line is now live. Hi guys.\n\nYou may be talking about the new patient and repat backlog internationally. I guess the way that I understand it is, it's full of work through in the US, but there's\n\nbut still work to do internationally, I don't know if you could, you know, if that's the case and if you could size that at all.\n\nYeah, look, I don't think we've fully worked through the backlog of patients in the US in terms of patients who want to get, who's insurance.\n\ndown that particularly if they are on a competitive device and the demand limitation and the physician saying, look, I've got to take care of new patients. They weren't as prone to write prescriptions or to allocate repAP if you like for patients. So I actually think there's some runways still left on repAP within the US geography. And I think that's even more so in other markets. As Rob just noted, as we talked about, the engagement with consumers and patients in different geographies is driving mass growth.\n\nAs Rob just noted, as we talked about, the engagement with consumers and patients in different geographies is driving mask growth. And...\n\nyou know any quarter to have 14% revenue growth in masks in Europe , Asia, rest of the world would be incredible and that's not driven.\n\nby any recall dynamics whatsoever from competitor. Everybody's been competing in masks globally. And so I think...\n\nThat speaks to our ability to hopefully have a sustainable approach to reap up not only in the US where we have incredibly strong relationships with Breitree and Maya, directly to patients directly to providers.\n\nin the other parts of the world, leveraging the work we've done on the mask side to then remind patients and track them when they're at that three, four, five-year time period to pull forward. Now, I want to be there with the appropriate supplies. I'm not jumping ahead of ourselves, but we do have the programs and capabilities to do that. But I think the demand is there inherently. Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Saul Dawson from Baron Julie Capital. Your line is our line. I'm on the mic and can I break the rope? I'm just wondering on mask, it's been a while since we've seen some...\n\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Saul Dawson from Baron Joey Capital. Your line is now live.\n\nI'm ony mick and I've written Rob I'm just wondering on on mask it's been a while since we've seen some new product coming out from res bed Just wondering how much has the you know the recall better recall impacted on your ability to continue to focus on your product development and your product launch and I guess on the mask because I actually expect anything for me to am in terms of Um a refresh of the mask portfolio\n\nYeah, so it's a great question and yeah, R&D team have obviously been incredibly focused on the re-engineering, the resupplying, the redesign on our core device platforms and we're able to do that right, so we're able to get the supply back of Ed Tens, as you saw, and Aero 11.\n\ntelling me to keep quiet, but I can tell you I'm very excited about the pipeline. There will be new innovation, new masks from ResMed as we go through this fiscal year. As a personal user of these products, I try every new mask that comes out. This new one, which has a great project name that I'm not able to say, but it's a beautiful island that you can travel to by boat. I have tried that mask and it's incredible. I can't wait for that to come to the market. But yeah, look, we do have masks that are coming in the pipeline that are working their way through regulatory and then of course commercial ramp up to make sure that when we deliver it, it's ResMed quality, ResMed capability, first time to fit incredible adherence and to drive through the channel. You'll see those come through our major markets and then globally throughout the fiscal year. So I'm excited about that pipeline. The one that I can talk about is the digital side where we've launched an AI product and I'm really excited. As those get more traction, we'll talk about how the digital rights and the mass products throughout the year are going to impact and keep our incredibly strong double digit growth that we saw this quarter. Thank you. We reached end of our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to McFranagan further closing comments. Yeah, thanks, Kevin. And thanks to all of our stakeholders for joining us this last hour as we talked through.\n\nThank you. We reached end of our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick Fridding for the closing comments.\n\nYeah, thanks Kevin and thanks to all of our stakeholders for joining us this last hour as we talked through our results and we'll talk to you again in 90 days. In closing I want to thank the 10,000 res medians, many of you share holders and listen to these calls as well. Thanks for your dedication and hard work helping people sleep better, breathe better, live better lives in 140 countries. These results are yours. Incredible double digit growth. Thanks for all that you'd do. I'll hand the call back to you Amy to close us out.\n\nAwesome, thank you, Mick. And thanks everyone. We do appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our ResMed's fourth quarter of 2023 conference call. Kevin, I'll turn it back to you to close the call. Thank you. You may now disconnect."

If anyone should require operator assistance. Please press star zero on your telephone keypad.\n\nAnd answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded its now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Communications and Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead Amy.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Kevin Hello, everyone and welcome to resume third quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call.\n\nThis call is being webcast live and a replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of the earnings press release and the presentation both of which are available now.\n\nOn the call today are chief Executive Officer of mixed Farrell, and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandra Cock following our prepared remarks, making Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas President and Chief operating Officer, and David Pendarvis, Chief administrative officer, and Global General Counsel for our Q&A session.\n\nDuring today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures. Please see the supporting schedules in today's earnings release.\n\nOur discussion today will include forward looking statements, including but not limited to expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual.\n\nAdult to differ materially from any forward looking statements made today I'd like to now turn the call over to Nick.\n\nThanks, Amy and thank you to our stockholders for joining us today as we review the results for the March quarter.\n\nOur third quarter fiscal year 2023 financial results reflect very strong performance across our entire business through the hard work of our resumes team worldwide, we've been able to steadily improve supply and manufacturing output to deliver for customers and most especially for patients with now full market availability.\n\nAlthough our life saving products and therapy solutions.\n\nDuring the quarter, we were able to offer unconstrained access to cloud connected essence 10 flow generator devices in North America as well as improved access to those cloud connected devices across our global markets.\n\nWe continue to work through some supply chain constraints with our latest and greatest essence 11 platform and we expect to steadily improve the global availability of essence 11 over the next several quarters we.\n\nWe are thrilled to have the essence 10 platform off allocation and fully available to customers in the U S and other major markets in Swift succession.\n\nI would like to send a huge personal thank you to our six Sigma black belt supply chain and manufacturing teams.\n\nwith our global supplier lines, we have been able to significantly increase production to the point that we are now able to deliver cloud connected devices to meet the needs of all of our customers in the U S. And we are working hard to make that the case in all 140 countries that we sell into worldwide as we move forward.\n\nSure.\n\nLast quarter, we made a commitment to meet the global demand for connected CPAP and iPad devices with a combination of assets 10 in essence 11 by the end of calendar year 2023 as I. Just noted we have already achieved that goal in our largest market and we will be well ahead of that go across all of our global.\n\nMarkets.\n\nSupply chain challenges aren't completely behind us, but we have passed an idea in supply and we see steady increases in supply ahead.\n\nOur amazing R&D teams and global supplier allowance teams have designed and validated new components. They have added new suppliers and they have worked hand in hand with existing suppliers to secure the flow of parts that we need.\n\nWe're also focused on scaling our manufacturing capabilities with the world's biggest and highest output manufacturing plant on the planet in the field of respiratory medicine.\n\nThat high Tech facility is now fully up and running in to Us Singapore.\n\nWe are working country by country to secure the necessary regulatory approvals as we ramp production and delivery of the essence 11 platform across global markets. Given this global ramp plan, we expect to remain on allocation for the essence 11 platform for the next few quarters with their sales team covering all the difference in demand.\n\nWith this combination of air Tien and are living we have the two best sleep apnea therapy platforms in the market and we are now able to service all of our customers' needs.\n\nOur incredible growth rate of 43% and global device revenue this quarter speaks to that market leadership positions of these two platforms customers are voting with their wallets.\n\nOur mask and accessory business also continued its strong growth trajectory with 15% global growth in constant currency this quarter across our mosques businesses.\n\nMask growth is supported by both new patient growth as well as enhanced resupply programs to existing two existing patients catalyzed by ongoing core patient demand.\n\nWe have now reached the point that new patient flow is well above the levels. We saw pre COVID-19. In fact March. This we just finished March 2023 was our highest quarter ever for new patient setups in our cloud based patient management system called .\n\nOur digital health ecosystem enables and drives long term adherence pushing towards 90% adherence for our highest performing customers.\n\nEven as we now passed three years since the start of Covid. There continues to be sustained heightened awareness by patients of the importance of respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. This has been a major step change that is held for now 12 quarters, we consider that a permanent change at this point.\n\nIn the U S market customers resupply programs, including resupply have augmented growth in our consumer driven markets outreach programs and subscription programs have also driven mask replenishment rights.\n\nPatients want fresh equipment, because there is less lake and more comfort for them the person who is suffocating before this treatment.\n\nPhysicians want fresh equipment, because they have seen peer reviewed published evidence that patient resupply is directly correlated to increased patient therapy adherence.\n\nOur teams continue to work incredibly hard to achieve the double digit growth results amid a challenging industry environment.\n\nAll 10000 of US raise millions are laser focused on continuing to deliver both the devices and masks for our customers globally every week every month and every quarter.\n\nLet's now briefly review updates on the top three strategic priorities for our company number one to grow and expand the reach of and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses number two to design develop and deliver market leading devices as well as market.\n\nLeading digital health solutions that can be scaled globally and number three to create innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for delivered outside the hospital.\n\nThe launch of and market reaction to our essence 11 device platform continues to go very well.\n\nPatient feedback remains very positive and we continue to see strong adoption of our my patient App.\n\nIn fact, it 11 adoption rights of my year are more than double the adoption rate of with the 10 platform.\n\nIt turns out that patients love getting their own data every day on my App with a daily score daily coaching therapy engagement through advanced analytics and patient focused algorithms.\n\nUtilization of a digital health platform like Maya is directly linked to adherence, which is then directly linked to better patient outcomes as seen by the physician, which ultimately drives better outcomes for the payer and the provider.\n\nGiven these trends increasing production and global availability of the essence 11 platform clearly remains a top priority and an obligation and we will continue to drive market penetration, leading the market expanding the market as we scale production and achieve regulatory approvals country by country.\n\nMeanwhile, we continue to improve the software and digital health technology that drives a significant component of the value proposition for our connected devices.\n\nOver the next several quarters, we will introduce several artificial intelligence driven coaching features into the system as well as on the patient facing my App.\n\nThese AI algorithms will provide personalized suggestions to improve the patient experience and ultimately to increase patient therapy adherence. Many of these AI driven solutions will be available on both the 10, and the essence 11 ecosystems.\n\nResidents essence 11 device is the best positive airway pressure devices on the planet followed very closely by the second best device, which is the 10 platform.\n\nAnd together they share the same digital health technology ecosystem.\n\nWe will continue to invest in the ecosystem supporting these platforms as we innovate solutions for the benefit of physicians providers and especially patients.\n\nThe bottom line is that our digital health technology investments have a multiplier effect across both air and air 11 ecosystems catalyzed and powered by and Maya.\n\nPivoting to our respiratory care business, we continue to drive growth and adoption of our bi level and other noninvasive ventilator solutions around the world as well as investing in our newer to market technologies for patients, including Europe , muscular disease, COPD and asthma and beyond.\n\nDuring the quarter, we announced the pilot collaboration between our digital therapeutics team under the propeller health brand and the University of California, Davis Health system.\n\nThis partnership allows eligible UC Davis health patients to have access to propellers digital therapeutics platform, including sensors for inhaled medications.\n\nApp, a web portal as well as ongoing patient support.\n\nData from the propeller sensors will be transmitted to the UC Davis health electronic health record system through an IPR to support patient enroll enrollment and remote patient monitoring.\n\nIt's still early days for this technology, however, combined with our investments in clinical research for home based high flow therapy for the treatment of COPD in the home. We see these technology innovations as important clinical additions for trading respiratory disease, and an integral part of our 2020.\n\nOur growth strategy as we now pivot to look beyond to resume in 2030.\n\nTurning to our software as a service offerings for care delivered outside the hospital, our SaaS business grew strongly at 35% year over year in the quarter, including the contribution from our recently acquired many Fox Dawn team in Germany.\n\nOn an organic basis SaaS growth in the quarter achieved high single digit growth of 9% across SaaS portfolio.\n\nWe're excited about the strong sustainable growth of our core SaaS business and we are very pleased to see many folks Don contributing to our growth in its first full quarter as part of the global resume growth.\n\nWe continued to grow with customers that deliver care outside the hospital as they increased utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care.\n\nHewitt resume we believe the future of health care is a lower cost lower acuity settings. We are investing in technology that our customers need to operate and scale as patient volumes grow in these facilities and out of hospital facilities.\n\nAs the post Covid patient census continues to improve in our facilities verticals. We are seeing pent up demand for technology investments that continue to come to market across skilled nursing facilities nursing homes and beyond.\n\nOur home medical equipment SaaS business under the brand continues to grow at a very rapid pace and deliver sustained profitable growth.\n\nWe are seeing the ongoing impacts of staffing shortages across all of the outside hospital health care verticals that we serve this pressure on our customers provides opportunities to drive conversations about the benefits of our software solutions to streamline and drive efficiencies across their businesses. So that they can free.\n\nUp staff to focus on the core purpose of serving patients and improving patient outcomes.\n\nOur SaaS business remains an important part of growth strategy and it complements the market leading software and device solutions that we have in our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses.\n\nOur bright tree resupply program continues to demonstrate the synergies we can generate between our SaaS business and our core business brought tree resupply automates the entire process from contacting the patient interacting with the payer on coverage communicating directly with the patient collecting co pays and .\n\nImaging, the logistics and district distribution process of product the.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to keep a CPAP iPad, we'll buy level therapy used replenished with the supplies that they need to enable a better and longer lasting therapy experience.\n\nThis results in better outcomes for the patient the physician the provider and the Payor.\n\nWe are well positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for outside hospital care globally, and we have created differentiated value for our customers and long term sustainable growth for all stakeholders.\n\nWe are transforming out of hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology across our business.\n\nWe now have over $14 5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and we have over 25, 100% cloud connected medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide.\n\nWe are liberating data to the cloud every day and unlocking value for patients for providers for physicians for payers.\n\nAnd entire healthcare systems, we are leading the industry and we won't stop innovating.\n\nWe're investing 7% of our revenue in R&D, it's worth noting that the annualized revenue pool is now well north of $4 billion.\n\nThere is so much opportunity ahead of us, it's inspiring and it's exciting.\n\nmission remains Crystal clear, we have a goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025. This patient centric mission drives and motivates, whereas millions every day, we made excellent progress towards that inspire in gull without growth over the last 90 days and during the last 12 months, we have improved over 100.\n\nThird 56 million lives with the delivery of the device platform to a patient or a full mask system to a patient or a digital health.\n\nSoftware solutions that directly impacts of patients, helping each person to sleep better to breathe better and to leave a high quality life with healthcare delivered right where they live.\n\nLet me close my remarks, with my sincere gratitude to the more than 10000, working across 140 countries for their perseverance their hard work and their dedication to die and every day.\n\nWith that I'll hand, the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks, and then get in the queue. Because we will open up for Q&A from the group Brett over to you.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Nick.\n\nMy remarks today I'll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023.\n\nAs noted all comparisons out of the prior year quarter.\n\nWe had strong financial performance in Q3.\n\nRevenue for the March quarter was 112 billion, an increase of 29% in constant currency terms revenue increased by 31%.\n\nRevenue growth reflected improved availability of sleep devices to support with strong underlying demand for these products as well as solid growth across our broad product portfolio.\n\nYear on year movements in foreign currencies in particular, a weaker euro negatively impacted revenue by approximately $20 million in the March quarter.\n\nWe recorded incremental revenue of approximately $15 million from Covid related demand in the March quarter. However, looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from Covid related demand.\n\nLooking at geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business.\n\nU S, Canada, and Latin America increased by 32%.\n\nSales in Europe , Asia, and other markets increased by 28% in constant currency terms.\n\nGlobally in constant currency terms device sales increased by 43%, while masks and other sales increased by 15%.\n\nBreaking it down by regional areas people ourselves in U S, Canada, and Latin America increased by 48% as we benefited from strong demand and improving availability of our connected devices.\n\nMasks and other sales increased by 14%.\n\nsolid re supply and growth in new patient setups.\n\nIn Europe Asia, and other markets device sales increased by 36% in constant currency terms again, reflecting strong demand and improving availability of connected devices.\n\nMasks and other sales increased by 15% in constant currency terms, reflecting increased patient setups.\n\nSoftware as a service revenue increased by 35% in the March quarter, reflecting the contribution from our acquisition and continued strong performance from our high generally vertical.\n\nExcluding maybe focused on acquisition SaaS revenue grew by 9% in the March quarter.\n\nMany folks Don contributed revenue of $26 6 million for the March quarter, consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition.\n\nDuring the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release.\n\nGross margin declined by 200 basis points to 56, 1% in the March quarter.\n\nKris primarily reflects product mix shifts due to the significant increase in sleep device styles as well as component cost increases and unfavorable foreign currency movements, partially offset by increases in average selling prices.\n\nMoving onto operating expenses SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased by 25% or in constant currency terms increased by 28%.\n\nThe increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee related costs and travel expenses as well as the incremental SG&A expense associated with that many folks down acquisition.\n\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 25% compared to the 21, 1% we recorded in the prior year period.\n\nLooking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of fiscal year 'twenty three.\n\nOkay.\n\nexpenses for the quarter increased by 14% while in.\n\nConstant currency terms increased by 16%.\n\nR&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was six 8% compared to seven 7% in the project quarter.\n\nLooking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 'twenty three.\n\nOperating profit for the quarter increased by 27% underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by a level of gross margin.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of focused on our net interest expense for the quarter was $15 million and we expect interest expense to be a similar amount for the balance of fiscal year 'twenty three.\n\nOur effective tax rate for the March quarter was 20% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 21, 1%.\n\nLooking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 'twenty three will be in the range of 19% to 21%.\n\nOur net income for the March quarter increased by 28% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased by 27%.\n\nCash flow from operations for the quarter was $283 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings partially offset by a modest increase in working capital.\n\nCapital expenditures for the quarter was 29 million depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $44 million.\n\nWe ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $228 million as of March 31, We had $1 6 billion in gross debt and $1 4 billion and net debt, reflecting the funding of our previously announced maybe folks down acquisition.\n\nDuring the quarter, we reduced our revolver debt by $215 million.\n\nAs a result at the end of the quarter, we had approximately $605 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position.\n\nOur board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of 44 per share.\n\nGoing forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D reduce our overall debt levels and deploy further capital for tuck in acquisitions.\n\nAnd with that I'll hand, the call back to Amy.\n\nGreat. Thank you Brett and thank you Mick Kevin I'd like to now turn the call over to you to provide instructions and then run the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nCertainly, we'll now be conducting a question and answer session. We ask you. Please ask one question the return to the queue, if you'd like to be placed in the question queue. Please press star one at this time a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You May press star two if you'd like to move your question from the queue. Once again Thats star one fee place.\n\nIn the question queue and we ask you. Please ask one question and then return to the queue. Our first question is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\n\nYes, good morning, before I start I wanted to say, thank you to David Pendarvis, certainly sad to see him retire, but we know that we are in safe hands with Amy.\n\nIn terms of my question, obviously, some very good device revenue there but.\n\nJust to talk about that.\n\nYou mentioned the third quarter, you had a new patient high higher than what we've seen pre COVID-19.\n\nCan you provide some comments of how much of that new pipe backlog remains.\n\nAlso what sort of progress you're making on the repack backlog and if you can discuss that.\n\nAccording to the Americas and vegetable separately.\n\nThat would be very helpful.\n\nWell, thanks for the question Lyanne and attribute to dive for us.\n\nPlus he has 22 years of I think it was this is 83rd Investor call eight three.\n\nSo amazing tribute to Diovan, we are in very safe hands with Eylea on the Investor relations from to your to your.\n\nTwo question.\n\nIncredible growth, 43% growth in device revenue this quarter to an all time high.\n\nMany many factors that have gone into that primarily that we were able to deliver on our promise to get unconstrained on essence turn 100% connected devices and we've got those end market and so I think we.\n\nWe were able to take care of the demand of customers in the U S market period end of story, we said we'd be there by the end of this calendar year, but with are already here right now.\n\nAnd as I said in the prep remarks, we're going to be scaling the 11.\n\nSteadily and strongly is that new platform, the latest and greatest comes to market and we move forward.\n\nIn terms of backlog of those sort of new patients.\n\nIn the U S. But in terms of I think there is a lot more to do and we're going to partner across the U S. With all of our thousands of home medical equipment companies to start to work through that re program.\n\nI think that's going to happen over time, we just got to the point, where we're completely unconstrained on essence 10 in this quarter I think it's fantastic I want to get unconstrained, an essence, 11th that's going to take a number of unit numbers of quarters.\n\nAnd then of course.\n\nJust one country.\n\nThird 40 countries worldwide, we Gotta go get regulatory and hold them and then get those products to market and so it's going to be an ongoing process over the coming quarters and years to continue there.\n\nIm not going to say that we're going to see this sort of exceptional 43% growth.\n\nOn an ongoing basis.\n\nGrowth is closer to the mid to high single digits in this space, but we're seeing that market growth come back we're seeing the new patients come back we are through that that pandemic side, and we're getting new patient flow, we see it in our home sleep testing data, we're looking at all the stuff coming through at , We're seeing it in the number of patients being set up and have you all.\n\nHi, but we're looking at that every week every month and every quarter and steadily improving and it's not just the U S.\n\nIt's in Western Europe , Northern Europe , and its certainly coming coming through as a very strong growth in China over the last number of quarters as we've come through the Covid crisis, there as well. So that's my summary daily and great question.\n\nSorry can I just clarify when you said that your data on the backlog is that both for the United States and rest of the world.\n\nYes, so we're thrilled with through the backlog in the U S.\n\nAnd we're going to be progressively working our way through the 139 countries.\n\nIt's not.\n\nIt's a complex system, where when you get regulatory approval for the 11, you've got to go region by region. You can do the European Union, but then you have to go country by country for many of these approaches for Brazil for China for India, and it takes time to get them there to get unconstrained with the the two platform approach that we've been able to take in the U S, Canada and a number of.\n\nAll the countries, but look we'll give you updates over the coming quarters Leann is as we get unconstrained country by country. You will report it to you in and our goal is to be unconstrained everywhere Tomorrow is just not logistically possible to be able to do that so we're going slowly and steadily to that but I'm just happy to be nine months ahead of when we decide we're going to deliver an unconstrained.\n\nAt least in some of our top markets here and we'll keep you updated as we go forward.\n\nOkay. Thank you very much bank.\n\nThanks Leann.\n\nThank you next question is coming from Danaher from MST Marquee. Your line is now live.\n\nGood morning, Thanks for the question.\n\nWhat else off the gross margin question, because all my philosophy out yesterday.\n\nThe fact that it through by relatively constant as a percentage centric revenue.\n\nDuring the course of the recall, which continue to be counterintuitive. When you consider the fact that the products have been in shortage and et cetera, and suddenly selling themselves. So I was wondering if we could talk about the key elements of that SG&A.\n\nIn the mid to long term trajectory there as volumes continue to improve.\n\nYes, that's a great question, Dan and I'll hand over to Rob Douglas, Our President and Chief operating officer to cover our SG&A Yeah. Dan. So you know and you know how we operate no matter, what's going on with fiscally disciplined.\n\nWe're always keeping an eye on the future and where we're going and what's happening is we build we build and expenses.\n\nAbsolutely talked about the fact that we werent doing face to face marketing and.\n\nA lot of travel and those types of things earlier in the pandemic.\n\nHas that started to come back we've had to manage carefully how thats playing an extra load on our SG&A, but it's really really effective careful management everyone's aware of the issue of .\n\ncost and other things, which is which are moving in the time of inflation.\n\nAnd we continue to manage that carefully and we're extremely prudent about what we add in on and how we go and so we really don't want to get ahead of ourselves and end up like some of these other companies that have had the wire either provisioned in the.\n\nGo to market operations and had to make corrections so.\n\nWe are in good shape, and we've got a solid plan.\n\nWe should be out.\n\nvery carefully with that forecast on our SG&A.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nThank you. Our next question today is coming from Mathieu Chevrier from Citi. Your line is now live.\n\nGood morning, Thanks, very much for taking my question and good afternoon to those in California.\n\nYou, obviously had a very strong devices growth in the quarter was just wondering whether you still believe that you can sequentially grow every quarter.\n\nIn fiscal year 'twenty three in devices.\n\nAnd then how should we think about.\n\nFY 'twenty four and the returns potential return of Philips to the market and whether there's been any update there.\n\nYes, thanks for the question Matthew and yes.\n\nLast quarter I, certainly said that we expect to see sequential growth of devices throughout the.\n\nThe calendar year actually here through 2023 and that was our forecast.\n\nI'm going to tell you this $607 $9 million of device sales in the quarter.\n\nIt was ahead of where I thought we were at that point of view.\n\nThat's a big number to come up and as Brett said, there is about $15 million of ventilator sales to China in there as they went through another phase of of Covid as they've reopened during the during the March quarter. So if you take that out.\n\nIt's still a big number to shoot for here in Q4, but we have the best commercial teams on the planet in respiratory medicine.\n\nand .\n\nQ4 for us our fiscal year Q4 is a big time. This presence clubs in some geographies. This fiscal incentives everywhere for people to finish the fiscal year strong and so there's a lot of incentives. So yes, it's a tough number to get there on sequential growth.\n\nThere's been a lot as I think we can do it I'm confident my team all back my team.\n\nThey got a little bit ahead of me here in March and I Love that I'd love them to be a little bit ahead of me in June and so I'm confident we can do that more important than that is that we are now taking care of every patients needs in our major markets and our goal is to be there in all 140 countries. So some of it is that revenue growth and it's amazing, but it's really about patient care.\n\nIt's about leaving no patient behind and it was really disappointing I think for us as an industry. Some of these quarters over the last eight quarters.\n\nAs an industry, we werent able to take care of every patient that got a prescription we're now doing that in our major markets and we plan to absolutely fulfil that not only where we have already achieved it but to get ahead of it and all the other countries. As we go so sequential growth is good we're going to be pushing towards driving that but more important than that taken care of every patient and every geography and working as hard as we can.\n\nTo get to those patients and get them, a well quality mask and get them on a resupply program because that's what leads to long term. It here. It's not just that one time device style, but getting an adherent patient that 80 790 plus percent adherence rights on not just a 90 day basis, but an ongoing basis. That's our challenge Matthew Great question. Thank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you next question is coming from Gretel from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.\n\nThanks, Good morning all.\n\nOff price margin question.\n\nThe mix really the key driver for waste to gross margin.\n\nDo you have the high priced offsetting component.\n\nAnd just as we look forward.\n\nAnd to continue to gain strong device sales.\n\nShould we expect gross margin to continue to be weaker Inc levels.\n\nIn the short term.\n\nYes, Thanks for the question, Greg and as you said and as Brent said in his remarks.\n\nWe had some we had some headwinds on gross margin, which would geography mix.\n\nIt was more in.\n\nLow margin countries U S.\n\nCanada, and then product mix, we saw most CPAP and iPad growth than we did buy level or like support or even though the noninvasive ventilators.\n\nSo those headwinds are going to start to subside.\n\nI am actually I think griddle that as I look forward I see gross margin expansion in.\n\nIn double digit basis points ahead for the coming quarters and throughout the fiscal year in the calendar year on bullish on gross margin expansion, because I see geography mix and product mix headwinds subsiding I'm bullish on gross margin as I see ventilator growth opportunities start to come back and I see mask growth and replenishment growth.\n\nNew patient growth start to come on mosques.\n\nAnd Im bullish on gross margin as we go forward because I see inventory costs, starting to we're going to start to cut into that and bring them down versus the run up we had with our competitor being out of market.\n\nAnd also I'm bullish on gross margin, because I see us being able to get better freight costs as we go forward.\n\nAnd as you said, we have been offsetting some of that.\n\nGross margin headwinds with ISP holding steady in our coal business, increasing Isps and SaaS businesses.\n\nAnd we've had some freight surcharges and others with customers as we start to see our cost come down will take away some of those surcharges and so on and so we'll balance that out but net net I see us being able to expand our gross margin and grow as we look forward throughout not just the fiscal year here 23, but the calendar year here in 'twenty three.\n\nThank you next question is coming from Matt Taylor from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\n\nAlright, Thanks, guys, sorry, I was on mute.\n\nAnd so I just wanted to ask about.\n\nHow much we should expect your math could trend to start following the device trends as you become more.\n\nEncumbered I thought maybe there would be a little bit more mass growth this quarter not not taking away from a good result, but maybe you could talk about that as a derivative.\n\nYes.\n\nYes, Thanks, Matt for your question and you know that.\n\nAs you look at our masks and accessories business, it's sort of 70% to 80% of our mosques growth is replenishment, it's existing patients out there who are coming back for.\n\nOur fresh mask a fresh.\n\nHumidifier fresh set of tubing tubing, and so on and filters. So it's the mask and accessories as 70, 80% replenishment business and so it's not as directly impacts so new patient growth is incredible we're back to.\n\nBetter than pre Covid, and we're growing from there and thats, great to see that sort of strong growth of new patients coming in but it doesn't sort of directly correlate to your point.\n\nLess the derivative and more a sort of a compounding effect over time as you know like compound interest as you build up that installed base of those patients are ordering if they are ordering on three months or six month basis that becomes a compounding effect on the device growth today, leading to a future investment and growth in masks over the coming fiscal quarters and fiscal years.\n\nBuild that install base. So there's not a direct correlation 43% device growth doesn't immediately car like Tomas growth, but to your point, 15% global mask growth on a constant currency basis is incredible pre COVID-19. We were been very proud of a number like that.\n\npandemic coming through this growth.\n\nCredibly proud of the team and what they're able to do not just in new patient setups, but in the replenishment programs and as I said in the prepared remarks, it's not just in the reimbursed markets, where we've got formalized systems.\n\nFrance, the U S. Japan, we have formalized systems to go with our customers to patients to ensure they if they wanted that the patient gets them off when they need. It. We're also working in a consumer driven markets, where we're driving adherence programs subscription programs that are fast growing in many of our geographies, where it's cash pie or direct to.\n\nHumor interaction and they are saying.\n\nWant a fresh mask and so it's true to the core demand. It's not just the system driven one this is a patient driven one and thats. The part about mask growth I think is most exciting final thing I'll say on mask growth is that I think there was some skeptics two or three years ago people like all of this step up in respiratory health and hygiene step up in mask replenishment.\n\nShort term trend Judah due to Covid pandemic with three years since the start of this.\n\nThe pandemic and that has been 12 quarters of strong mask growth. So I think that strong mask growth is sustainable for the future we've been able to execute for 12 quarters. We plan to continue to do that as we go forward.\n\nThank you very helpful.\n\nThanks, Matt.\n\nThank you next question is coming from Michael Pollard from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.\n\nThank you for taking the question.\n\nI'll ask another twist on the mask question, you know as .\n\nButterfield on the device side, especially in the U S are you.\n\nIs there a halo impact in terms of winning share incrementally on the consumables side is that a dynamic that's played out recently or could play out over the next year or so.\n\nAs the device.\n\nKind of the urgency to step into the device void Abates and you refocus on other priorities.\n\nYes, it looked like there's certainly a relationship and you know in our commercial teams working with the best platform Dsm's 11, and the best second Best platform Esn's 10, both of which are better than our competitors. They're also obviously offering the best marks the best mask portfolio out there and we have a.\n\nA leading share in that 140 countries as well so there's definitely a synergy effect and that it's the same people talk to has the same physicians the same providers the same health care systems and so we are there.\n\nIn addition, there is some sort of clinical technical needs I mean, we design our products to work better together.\n\nOur marks on our devices have far more accurate masked leak detection they have far more accurate detection of pressure.\n\nAnd control of an iPad device or by level device in particular, thats loot used on overlap patient site, who is obstructive sleep apnea and COPD or unique that ipass in APAC the pressure control to be right on when you use our bi level without mosque, that's going to be far more accurate than the physicians know that and they will script towards that for those patients.\n\nAnd then for the respiratory therapist doing a setup. They know our product set is on better together our teams have shown them the clinical and technical data of how they design and so there is a strong positive synergy effects. So yes, I do think there is a correlation between them or do you think the sort of simple commercial I mean, they are selling it. But then you look at it from a physician's perspective on clinical and then the therapist.\n\nPerspective on fit and comfort in Lake. So I think all that goes together to show that some good synergy between our device growth and mask growth overtime.\n\nThank you next question is coming from David low from Jpmorgan. Your line is that life.\n\nThanks, very much Nick can we go back to gross margins.\n\nI heard you correctly, you said you expect gross margins to expand at double digits in future can eke out a little bit on what sort of timeframe are we talking.\n\nMargin percentage, we're talking quite powerful I'm trying to understand what you're expecting on that front. Please.\n\nYes, David.\n\nI'm going to hand to Brett to go through more detail, but what I was saying is I expect double digit basis points improvement from from where we're at in the quarter 56, 1% I see as an idea and I want to grow from there. So I see us being able to move that up I don't know 10, 2030, 50, or 100 basis points over the coming quarters.\n\nAnd beyond but Brett you want to provide a little more detail to dive into the headwinds and and all the fun that goes into gross margin.\n\nYes sure.\n\nDavid.\n\nI mean, we wouldn't.\n\nquantified, but when we look at it we do expect margin expansion over the coming quarters.\n\nSome of the key ones that have hurt us.\n\nYear on year.\n\nIts around its product mix obviously.\n\nIncreasing slightly watches we had to deal with component cost increases coming through the year on year, but that looks to be stabilizing base. That's there is two big headwinds that we expect will moderate.\n\nAnd then we're working on manufacturing logistics flight costs looking at efficiencies.\n\nSo we're focused back on that now.\n\nSo again, they should improve over the coming quarters as well.\n\nAnd then on top of that with the ICD 11 platform that does contribute positively to gross margin as well now that one will take time as we roll that out, but if you kind of putting the.\n\nIf you look at it this way.\n\nHeadwinds.\n\nModerating should get a few title wins.\n\nIn manufacturing and logistics and that that kind of gives us the confidence we think we can get that expansion from here on in.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nYeah.\n\nThank you. Your next question today is coming from Margaret because work from William Blair. Your line is now live.\n\nHey, everyone. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nI wanted to maybe follow up on some of the patient demand metrics that you guys gave earlier on the call I think I heard maybe high single digit market growth.\n\nIn the U S or Americas.\n\nAnd then should we add recaps that so that that ultimately leads us to the double digit growth rate.\n\nAnd then how do you think about that I guess once Philips does potentially re enter the marketplace.\n\nFor you guys.\n\nOn a long term growth and I guess continue at that double digit topline growth rate. Thanks.\n\nYes.\n\nYes, thanks for the question Margaret.\n\nSo much that goes into it but yes.\n\nWe're on the other side of this pandemic not only just the pandemic has become an endemic in the way that the worlds opening up and we're driving forward built in in our industry. We're now seeing that strong growth of patients that we're really starting to pick up and yes, it's mid to high single digits growth on the patient starting to come through the funnel now that's really strong how long that is.\n\nSustainable and how we can drive it thats its going to be up to us as the market leader, we have the market lead here and we're going to drive awareness programs. We are going to drive demand generation programs are going to partner with I just got an update from a from a same here in the U S market looking at a at a project to bring patients into the funnel and to drive patients into the funnel and as the market leader.\n\nReally our jobs and not just accept market growth, but to drive market growth. So this is going to be an active thing that we're going to be looking at as we move forward and it's very exciting for us to do that I'm not going to quantify it out I mean, given where we're at I know you have your models of everyone on the sell side buy side has their models.\n\nBut I would say to that whatever your models.\n\nThink about an active leader engaging in digital awareness.\n\nMarketing awareness and driving and patients through the channel and we've learned a lot through the Covid crisis about digital health about engaging with patients in.\n\nTesting in remote setup and virtual pathways that are really.\n\nBe necessary at the peak of the pandemic and now become a catalyst for future demand generation. So I don't know Rob or Lucille if you have any extra thoughts on that just one other minor point Nick.\n\nThat new patient growth is really solid and there's so many untreated patients we see a long term future in that but also as we build a long term adherence programs and start driving long term adherence that will keep the mask growth ahead of that new patient growth and we see a long term outlook for that too.\n\nThank you next question is coming from Andrew Paine from CLSA. Your line is now what.\n\nYes, hi.\n\nGood morning.\n\nEveryone, just thinking about your ability to ability to retain market share.\n\nPhilips comes back to the market.\n\nGood afternoon.\n\nFrom the start of FY 'twenty four.\n\nWhat do you think you can pull here to ensure that you do retain market market share.\n\nWe're looking at things like pricing.\n\nSector.\n\nDo you think there are some other things that will help you retain that sure.\n\nYes, thanks for the question Andrew and.\n\nYes, certainly look we look at all competition, we've got competitors based in Western Europe and in Asia that we've been competing with very strongly for the last few decades and certainly the last two years and one competitor who has been out of the market for new patient setups to use and who knows how much longer.\n\nI will have to come in that third competitor that will have to come in and stop fighting to become the number two share player from a zero percent new patient set up share and we look forward to that we were beating that particular competitor in 2019 before they had the recall so I know, we'll be able to beat them.\n\nWhen they come back in and so our goal is to see zero share. Our goal is to actually maintain and grow share as the market leader that gets more and more difficult to take more and more share but.\n\nThat's our goal we have the smallest quietest, most comfortable and most cloud connected devices, but more importantly that we've created a digital ecosystem that engages patients with my doctors with their health care systems by Ipi is that link into ethical sooner in the U S and healthcare systems around the world in UK and NHS Northern Europe into.\n\nGovernment in Western Europe into government run health care systems, and we're engaging with patients in a consumer driven markets incredibly well. So our goal is to maintain and grow that share, but more important than that to grow the market as the market leader. That's that's sort of our obligation. There are now with the lightest epidemiology rising up by around 1 billion people.\n\nWith obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nNeeds to be traded worldwide and if you add in COPD asthma, and insomnia Youre talking $2 5 billion people in our total addressable market. So.\n\nYou can think about share, but it's really not coke and Pepsi was out and Pepsi is coming back. This is not a low growth carbonated beverages market. This is a high growth digital health technology market in Med Tech and that's how that's how we're driving it forward, but yes.\n\nYes.\n\nLook forward to just getting the uncertainty out of this number three player I want them back in let's say in let's let's compete and will keep our share and grow it and and game on and look forward to it.\n\nAnd actually one last thing I'll say on that people are talking about when the number three competitor comes back.\n\nWill they come back the CFO last week said, although we won't be coming in and lowering prices, we'll look to take 2019 prices and add to that with inflation. So.\n\nGame on I look forward to it we've always competed on value. We've always competed on driving that and it's never been a competition on price for us we've always been a price premium to the other plays but we save them more money. So that the smart customers are using our products because it's more profitable.\n\nThank you next question is coming from Matthew from Keybanc capital markets. Your line is now live.\n\nYeah, Hi, Nick.\n\nYou mentioned at one point that Youre getting 90% adherence on.\n\nSome of your best customers.\n\nJust curious like where that is versus .\n\nVersus kind of a baseline.\n\nAnd how you can move that forward with like the rest of your customer base.\n\nYes, Matt it's a really good question and so the peer reviewed published evidence out there as an 87% adherence number that's that's been out there for a couple of years.\n\nIf you look at the average of the market where people maybe aren't using as much of the digital capabilities of the patients aren't using my other doctors aren't using .\n\nGeneral industry adherence might be on average $60 to 70% right with a competitive device, it's not connected or.\n\nMaybe someone who is not fully engaged with the digital ecosystem, we have as they start to getting Guy age. There is actually peer reviewed published evidence on is just adding just adding the doctor using moves up adherence by 10%. So you go from let's say an average of 65% to 75% for that customer just having the doctor use F is the pie.\n\nuses Maya you move up almost another 10%. So for that example, you might get from 75% to 85% adherence with the doctors using and the patients using to get to those non you need a really special customer that's really engaged and really investing in tech that takes out tech in sort of adds algorithms and add capabilities to it.\n\nAnd we have a number of those sophisticated customers in Europe , and the U S and we partner with them and we do joint development with them and we love that.\n\nTraining, we learned from each other because together is how we deliver the care we are manufacturer and we're a provider of digital health solutions. We've worked with providers in our biggest countries to get there and where are we done in smaller consumer driven markets. We have to pick up the bowl and engaged directly ourselves, but that 90% is achieved in very rare cases, but it's.\n\nPeer reviewed published evidence shows that it can be done with the tech at 87% and yes to your point, how do we get everyone up to that 87% that 90% that is a process of engagement of training and that's why I say our share is not only going to stay where it is but have the chance to grow from that because we are the market later in this .\n\nOne is investing like we are in cloud compute no one's investing like we are in analytics, and AI and ml and engagement with patients and physicians and providers and we're not doing it alone we're doing it with the ecosystem with the patients we're listening to them with the physicians and with the providers. Thanks for the question Matt.\n\nThank you next question is coming from solid often put better enjoy capital. Your line is now live.\n\nThanks for taking my question, maybe just a quick one on premise.\n\nThis quarter the investment was very low suddenly less than what the guidance that vein. So I'm wondering did something change this quarter and any update on how that project is going thanks.\n\nYes, it's a great question, because it lets us talk too.",
    "content2": "Our whole sort of demand generation and engagement approach I mean, as you know it a joint venture with barely in the U S market looking to digitally engage with.\n\nDigitally identify engage and enroll patients in a sort of digital health pathway from sleep concerned consumer all the way through to diagnose patients on treatment and management, we have activities through our core U S and North America marketing team and obviously and the other 139 countries, we operate in where look.\n\nKing at other digital ways to engage.\n\nThe 1 billion people, who need our help so look we're looking at investments where it's a pilot phase of some trials and we're getting ready to to scale. Some approach with with with our U S programs and many of the others were operating in all parts of the world and so as we start to roll those out now that now that we're at the point, where we've got.\n\nFull capability to supply as we said in the prep remarks throughout the call with essence 10 in essence 11 as a combination we can really turn to to start to turn the dial up on these demand generation initiatives with undiagnosed sleep apnea patients and I'm excited to start doing that so those investments might tick up a little over the coming quarters, but that will .\n\nA huge return and bringing patients into the funnel. So watch this space.\n\nOkay.\n\nThank you next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer Company. Your line is now live.\n\nGood afternoon can you hear me alright.\n\nGot you loud and clear Suraj.\n\nPerfect.\n\nFirst let me.\n\nJust express my.\n\nThanks to David David.\n\nHave a great retirement, it's been a pleasure dealing with you all these years.\n\nLot of questions have been asked you comment about AI caught my attention.\n\nSo think about it this way Suraj comes in he's gone through the CPAP titration sleep lab.\n\nCertain parameters have been set by the by level.\n\nVariable whatever.\n\nWhat parameters, specifically would your AI ml obese oligos.\n\nHello patient and the reason I ask is specifically trying to understand how will you use this to improve compliance. Thank you.\n\nWell Suraj, it's a really good question and.\n\nWe only have five minutes left in the call I could spend a.\n\nThe whole 50 minutes all of them a lot of those things are actually quite proprietary as we put together these AI and ml models on how we'd culture patient, particularly you talked about a high acuity patient like that on bi level or ventilation noninvasive ventilation therapy.\n\nBut yes, certainly I look at our compliance predictors and compliance analysis tools that can help empower and in the U S and just some of the ways in which we're able to use.\n\nAI and ml to drive prioritization of the most at risk liquidity patients and those who are so close enough to get there and those would definitely there and just needs some sort of digital coaching that sort of triage. If you like which has previously been done manually is now going to an automated way.\n\nWe've always had some levels of that automation, but to have an algorithm that loans as it goes in to get better and better at it just serves the doctor. It serves the respiratory therapist at both of them.\n\nSuper pleased to see that level of efficiency reduction of if you feel like the administrative management and focus on the toughest patients, but also making sure that the best patients.\n\nThe digital coaching and help the diners. So it's really we're triaging compliance adherence and beyond but what's the space, we're going to launch a bunch of new products that will be able to talk to very specifically, what they are and what they do over the coming quarters.\n\nThank you next question is coming from Craig Wong Pan from RBC. Your line is now live.\n\nThanks for taking my question.\n\nThe inventory balances continued to increase so I was wondering when you might start to see that come down and also is there much constant cloud inventory of parts in that number still.\n\nYeah, Craig Thanks for the question. It did move up just a little bit in the quarter I actually have got a very strong target for Andrew price President of our operations and the whole manufacturing team to get that number down because we're through the peak of this and we've got full supply, let's get that number down, but Brett you want to speak to some of the details of how we're going to turn that inventory.\n\nnumber down significantly over the coming quarters in fiscal year.\n\nSure sure Mike.\n\nYes, let me characterize it quite a bit we stabilized that inventory this quarter and really that drives that really strong operating cash flow that you saw but.\n\nI think there's more that we can do in the to reduce those inventory levels overall.\n\nI mean, a number of things we can do but some of them. Some of them have pointed out we see we're seeing improvement in lead times, which will help you caught.\n\nJust getting from port to Port improved silicon flower inventories.\n\nContinuing to increase safe right first right. So some of that manifest in inventory, but eventually that kind of stabilizes at a ratio.\n\nWe're tuning safety stock levels now because we got more predictability.\n\nWhat we need and when we can get supply.\n\nAnd then inventory obviously its future looking so we're looking to support styles. So we just got to balance all of that but let's say to I think we're looking for inventory levels at trajectory too.\n\nCongratulate go down over the course of FY 'twenty four.\n\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\n\nThanks, Nick.\n\nThanks for taking the question I'm, just asking I'd like to start on the diabetes and obesity drugs. Please.\n\nI guess, we had another positive update last night, they do seem to be coming thick and fast at the moment.\n\nI guess could you just share how risk way to thinking about these and to what extent their success may have any impact on your business. Please.\n\nYes, Thanks, Chris.\n\nIt's a huge market and.\n\nActually quite exciting we've always wanted to have interactions we actually when I first joined the company 23 years ago, we were working with bariatric surgeons and looking at patients that would go through bariatric surgery, and maybe from 450 pounds down to 200 pounds and our challenge in those days when it was mostly a CPAP market was how do we make sure they get on APAC because they are.\n\nTheir needs their IHI might go from 50, when there are 450 pounds to 30, when there were 250 pounds, but thats 30 is still severe sleep apnea. So we had to have an iPad algorithm could adjust with them. These days the market is 80% . So you don't need to make sure that a patient on a let's say a weight loss drug or.\n\nSo on that sees a weight loss in their IHI needs go down from very very seriously back near to just severe or moderate to severe.\n\nHave the algorithms and the capabilities within the devices with our order set algorithm to adjust automatically and we'll also have all the digital health data. So that the pulmonary doctor can partner up with the primary care or bariatric type Doctor that's working.\n\nPresumably be PCP is working on the basically drugs and they can monitor the patient to see how much better they are getting maybe more adhere its more participation in their fitness and exercise for the overall health.\n\nFor us actually we're invested in one of the sleep apnea drugs. It is not a white list drug that actually goes to the core of trying to treat sleep apnea, which is called , where we're going to partner with pharma in this space.\n\nThe substitute of those sort of tiny sort of whatever it is 5% of patient flow into these implanted devices and Theres a company out there doing I think lots of very expensive advertising, but it's driving lots of patients into the funnel it's demand Gen for us because.\n\nThe marketed as a button to treat sleep apnea, but it's actually an implant with medical device the size of a pacemaker that goes into the chest when the patient funds that they say well what are the alternatives. All there is a noninvasive alternative like when the patient goes online with that I think some of the pharmaceutical advertising in this space will drive us to the 80% of undiagnosed patients in the space to say.\n\nLook I'll take the pill first and maybe then on sleep apnea therapy, or vice versa, but we think theres a lot of opportunity to partner with pharma, we're already partnering with our propeller division with some of the COPD and asthma drug delivery.\n\nLook forward to not just with that and we made that these other obesity drugs to understand how they drive patients into the funnel and how we work with them to treat those patients.\n\nThank you we reached end of our question and answer session I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further or closing comments.\n\nWell, thanks, Kevin and thank you again to all of our stakeholders for joining us on the call I would once again like to take the opportunity to thank the 10000 . Many of you are also shareholders. So thank you for what you do and for investing in our company as well. Thank you for your dedication hard work, helping people sleep better breathe better and live better lives and 140 countries.\n\nYou delivered these numbers that we just reported thank you for OLED.\n\nHand, the call back to Amy and then we'll close out.\n\nGreat. Thank you Mick Thanks, Kevin and thanks, everyone. We appreciate your interest and your time, if you do have any questions. Additional questions. Please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our third quarter 2022 conference call. Kevin you can now close this out.\n\nThank you that does conclude today's teleconference and webcast you may disconnect. Your lines at this time and have a wonderful day, we thank you for your participation today."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, please go ahead.\n\nAmy Wakeham\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, everyone. Happy New Year, and welcome to ResMed's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us. This call is being webcast live and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of the earnings press release and the presentation, both of which are available now.\nJoining me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Mick will provide a brief high-level overview of our financial results, review our progress towards ResMed's 2025 strategic goals and discuss our progress as we continue to navigate the ongoing macro industry and supply chain challenges. Brett will then review our financial results in more detail, and we'll then move into the Q&A portion of our call. During the Q&A session, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Pendarvis, Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel.\nDuring today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release. And as a reminder, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future operating and financial performance. We do believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could affect our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.\n\nMichael J. Farrell\n\nCEO & Director, ResMed Inc.\n\nThanks, Amy and Kevin, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today as we review results for the December quarter, our second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Our financial results reflect solid performance across our entire business, once again driven by strong sales growth in the Americas region as we were able to significantly increase both production and delivery of flow generator devices. We're seeing ongoing high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices worldwide, and we're making steady progress working with our suppliers to continue to increase our production to ultimately meet the needs of all customers and especially patients.\nOur mask sales growth was strong across the globe, reflecting a post-COVID pandemic awareness of the importance and need for respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. ReSupply programs in the U.S. continued to drive solid ongoing sustained market mask growth, catalyzed somewhat by the end of calendar year deductible momentum in the U.S. geography. Mask sales across Europe, Asia and the Rest of World also improved, driven by increased new patient setups as connected device supply increased.\nOur teams worked incredibly hard to achieve these extraordinary numbers in the face of an ongoing industry supply chain constrained market. We see the supply environment improving every week, every month and every quarter. And our access to the specific electronic components we need has increased. We are confident in our ability to fulfill all customer demand before the end of calendar year 2023. And we expect to see steady ongoing incremental device revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 2023.\nCustomer acceptance of our reengineered AirSense 10 card-to-cloud device remained strong during the second quarter, particularly in the United States geography. As we increase the volume of fully connected AirSense 10 and fully connected AirSense 11 devices over the next few quarters, we will be able to phase out the AirSense 10 card-to-cloud device and refocus on our strategy, which is based around the growth of 100% cloud-connectable devices across the globe.\nOutside the U.S., we have not seen the same adoption rates of that AirSense 10 card-to-cloud device. However, there have been pockets of success in some geographies, and we see a strong growth path going forward as we ramp up our fully connected AirSense 10 and our fully connected AirSense 11 products and as we achieve regulatory clearance of the latter platform market by market. To that point, we introduced our newest product, the AirSense 11 platform into the Japanese market during December. And we look forward to continuing to support doctors and patients in Japan with our world-leading 100% cloud-connectable medical devices and our cloud-based software technology.\nOur #1 priority across all of our markets will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, COPD, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease, asthma and all those who need access to out-of-hospital health care. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the care that they need, where they need it and when they need it.\nLet's now briefly review our updates on ResMed's top 3 strategic priorities: number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses; number two, to design, develop and deliver market-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in a patient's own home.\nThe launch and acceptance of our AirSense 11 device platform continues to go very well. Patient feedback remains very positive, and we continue to see strong adoption of our myAir patient app. In fact, adoption rates are at more than double the adoption rate of myAir with the AirSense 10 platform at about 55% of all patients getting their data every day on their myAir app. Increasing production and delivery of the AirSense 11 platform remains a top priority for our ResMedians around the globe, and we will continue to achieve better results and stronger market penetration each quarter.\nEarlier this month, we were able to take our AirSense 10 fully connected device off allocation in the U.S. market. This is a very exciting development for our commercial team here in the Americas and for all of our customers. We look forward to continuing to expand the supply of fully connected AirSense 10 and fully connected AirSense 11 devices so that supply can become unconstrained in all countries, but we will progress throughout fiscal '23 on this endeavor.\nAn important aspect of our ResMed 2025 strategy is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud-connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions and home-based high-flow therapy solutions. We are continuing to drive growth and adoption of our ventilated devices around the world, and we saw a good uptake of both our life support and our nonlife support ventilator platforms during the quarter.\nThere is also ongoing adoption of Propeller's monitoring system. Its digital therapeutic platform is now integrated with the 2 leading U.S. electronic health record systems, Epic and Cerner. This digital health integration makes it easier for doctors and health care workers to onboard people to the Propeller platform. It's still early days for this technology. However, combined with our investments in home-based high-flow therapy for treatment of COPD in the home, we see this technology combination as an important clinical addition for treating lung disease and an integral part, an important part of our 2025 growth strategy.\nTurning to our Software as a Service offerings for outside hospital care, our SaaS business grew 18% year-over-year. This extraordinary growth includes sustained high single-digit organic growth of our U.S.-based SaaS business at around 7% and is accelerated by the addition of approximately 6 weeks of MEDIFOX DAN revenue as we closed that acquisition and welcome that German team into the ResMed family of SaaS solutions just over midway through the December quarter. We continue to grow with outside hospital care customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care.\nAs the post-COVID patient census continues to improve in our facilities verticals, we are seeing pent-up demand for technology investments that continue to come to the market. Our HME SaaS business under the Brightree brand continues to grow at a very rapid pace. And we welcome tech solutions for our HME customers across the U.S. market. As I just mentioned, during the quarter, we received final regulatory approval and closed our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, the leading provider of end-to-end software solutions for nursing homes and home health customers in Germany.\nWe're now focused on integrating and growing this business as we accelerate SaaS innovation and SaaS growth in Germany and beyond. I've met in person with many of the key leaders of the MEDIFOX DAN team, and I can tell you, I'm excited about the cultural fit, the technology focus, the sharing and learning opportunities that they bring and we bring to our global SaaS team. This is our first investment in an outside hospital software business beyond the U.S. market, but I can tell you the global SaaS team is very much in sync and have come out of the [grade] strongly, not just in the revenue growth I just talked about, but also in the soft side, team collaboration, transparency and beyond. We look forward to updating you as we achieve key milestones in that business over the quarters and years ahead. Our team is ready to deliver.\nOur SaaS business is an important part of ResMed's future growth and complements the incredibly strong software and device solutions that we have in our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. One great example of the synergies between our SaaS business and our core business is the success of the Brightree ReSupply program. Brightree ReSupply automates the entire process from contacting the patient, interacting with the insurance company on coverage and interacting directly with the patient on co-pays as well as managing the logistics and distribution process. The ultimate goal is to keep a CPAP, APAP or bilevel therapy user replenished with the suppliers that they need to enable a better and longer-lasting therapy experience.\nWe have published clinical data that show that a patient on a ReSupply program has higher adherence to therapy. And we also have peer-reviewed published data in CHEST showing what's called the ALASKA study, that there is a 39% reduction in mortality for patients who are adherent to CPAP versus Control. These are incredible data, and they lead to these synergies, not just being a good revenue opportunity, but being an incredible cost saving opportunity for the health care system and life-saving opportunity for the patients involved.\nWe will continue to identify and capitalize on synergy opportunities as we move forward. We are well positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care globally, and we have created a differentiated value for customers and long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders.\nWe are transforming out-of-hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology across our business. We now have over 13.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 19 million 100% cloud-connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are liberating data to the cloud every day and unlocking value for patients, providers, physicians, payers, and entire health care systems and communities. We are leading the industry, but I see this as just the start of the digital health marathon. And I can tell you, we love the race.\nAs the overlap between digital health and consumer tech industries continues, it is important to note that ResMed's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Carlos Nunez, was recently named Chair of the Board of the Health Division, of the Consumer Technology Association, or CTA, and the Health Division is the fastest-growing division within CTA. The Health Division focuses on consumer-based technology-enabled health solutions to deliver better health outcomes for patients and reduce overall health care costs for the health care system.\nTheir mission is fully aligned with our ResMed mission, and I'm delighted to see Carlos be recognized for his leadership and the sessions that he chaired at CES in Vegas a couple of weeks ago showed that ResMed's thought leadership and Carlos' thought leadership is helping to craft the future of digital health and bring it to consumers as we have done over the past decade. We're excited about the ways Carlos' and CTA's Health Division can help continue to shape our industry for the future, lowering costs and improving outcomes and engaging consumers in their own health care. ResMed's mission and clear goal is to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025. This patient-centric mission drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal over the last period.\nDuring the last 12 months, we improved over 149 million lives with delivery of a device platform to a patient, a full mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution, helping people to sleep better, to breathe better and to live higher-quality lives with health care delivered right where they live and mostly in their own home.\nBefore I close, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude to more than 10,000 ResMedians now for their perseverance, hard work and dedication both today and every day. Thank you.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we will move and open up for Q&A from the group. Brett, over to you.\n\nBrett A. Sandercock\n\nCFO, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter.\nWe had strong financial performance in Q2. Group revenue was $1.03 billion, an increase of 16%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 20%. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep products across our portfolio and ongoing increased device demand generated by our competitor's product recall. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies, in particular, the weaker euro, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $36 million this quarter.\nAs mentioned, we closed the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition on November 21, 2022. And accordingly, we have recognized MEDIFOX DAN revenue of $10.7 million in our Q2 FY '23 result from this date. While we continue to experience ongoing challenges in securing sufficient electronic components to meet market demand, we are now seeing a more predictable and improving supply chain environment. We expect to continue to deliver sequentially higher quarterly device revenue through the balance of fiscal year '23.\nLooking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 26%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 8% in constant currency terms. Our product segment globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 25%, while masks and other sales increased by 13%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 41% as we benefited from incremental revenue derived from the introduction of the card-to-cloud device and improving availability of our connected devices.\nMasks and other sales increased by 11%, reflecting solid ReSupply revenue. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 5% in constant currency terms, reflecting the ongoing supply constraints in those markets for our connected devices. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 14% in constant currency terms. Software as a Service revenue, including revenue from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, increased by 18% in the December quarter, driven by continued strong performance from our HME vertical. On an organic basis, SaaS revenue grew by 7% in the December quarter.\nDuring the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Gross margin declined by 80 basis points to 56.8% in the December quarter. The decrease is predominantly attributable to product mix shifts due to increased flow generator sales as well as unfavorable foreign currency movements, partially offset by increases in average selling prices.\nMoving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the second quarter increased by 14% or in constant currency terms, increased by 20%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs, additional expenses related to our acquisitions and travel and entertainment expenses. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 20.5% compared to the 20.7% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of fiscal year '23.\nR&D expenses for the quarter increased by 4% or in constant currency terms, increased by 15%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8% compared to 7% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year '23.\nOperating profit for the quarter increased by 14%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by lower gross margin. Our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 18.3% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 15.6%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year '23 will be in the range of 19% to 21%.\nOur net income for the December quarter increased by 13% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 13%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $129 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, partially offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $27 million, depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $38 million.\nWe recorded equity losses of $3.1 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $3 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year '23 associated with the joint venture operation.\nOn November 21, 2022, we completed our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN for consideration of $997 million, and this was funded through a drawdown on our existing revolver credit facility. During the quarter, we recorded acquisition-related expenses of $8.4 million associated with the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. The acquisition was EPS neutral on a non-GAAP basis in Q2, and we expect the acquisition to be mildly accretive to EPS on a non-GAAP basis in the second half of FY '23.\nWe ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $253 million. At December 31, we had $1.8 billion in gross debt and $1.5 billion in net debt, reflecting the funding of our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. At December 31, we had approximately $390 million available for drawdown under our fleet revolver facility, and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Following the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, our net interest expense is expected to increase to approximately $15 million per quarter for the second half of fiscal year '23, reflecting our increased debt position.\nOur Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and also expect to continue to fund future tuck-in acquisitions.\nAnd with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.\n\nAmy Wakeham\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Brett, and thanks, Mick. Kevin, I'd like to now turn the call back over to you to provide the instructions and then run the Q&A portion of our call.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, Amy.\n\nAmy Wakeham\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining us. This call is being webcast live and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of their earnings press release and presentation, which are both available now.\nJoining me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Mick will provide a brief high-level overview of our financial results. He'll review progress towards our ResMed 2025 strategic goals and discuss the current state of things as we continue to navigate the ongoing macro industry and supply chain challenges. Brett will then review our financial results in more detail. And finally, we'll move into the Q&A portion of our call. During the Q&A session, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Pendarvis, Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel.\nDuring our call today, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, please review the supporting schedules in today's earnings release. And as a reminder, our discussion today will include some forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future operating and financial performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today.\nI'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.\n\nMichael J. Farrell\n\nCEO & Director, ResMed Inc.\n\nThanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today as we review results for the September quarter, our first quarter of fiscal year 2023. These financial results demonstrate solid performance across our entire business, driven by strong sales growth in the Americas region as well as ongoing high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices and mask systems worldwide.\nAchieving these numbers hasn't been easy given supply chain constraints, but we are powering ahead focused on the long term. Of course, we see the same macroeconomic challenges that many other industries are also facing as well as an industry-specific issue of a competitor-driven supply-demand imbalance the past 18-plus months, resulting in excess demand for our products.\nThe good news is this. Our global ResMed team demonstrates over and over again their incredible ability to pivot and to solve problems, to support customers and to meet the needs of people around the world with market-leading therapies and software solutions.\nWe are building on the success we achieved last quarter with our reengineered AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device. Customer acceptance has been strong, particularly in the United States region, and this has enabled us to substantially increase shipping volumes to support patient demand while we continue to fight through global supply chain challenges.\nIt is interesting to note that outside the U.S., we are not seeing the same magnitude of adoption of the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device as we are in the U.S. This is due to the fact that our 100% cloud connectable platforms, such as AirSense 11 and others, and our ecosystem of software solutions are so embedded into the workflows of health care systems. This is particularly evident in countries where we have partnered to develop digital health reimbursement models.\nCustomers in countries such as France and Japan and beyond, prefer to work with the limited product flow of our 100% cloud connectable devices rather than change their workflows for Card-to-Cloud models. While this means that some patients will have longer wait times in these regions, it does show the power of our long-term digital health strategy, lowering labor costs, improving efficiency and improving patient outcomes are just too hard to switch from.\nNevertheless, on a global basis, the redesign and launch of the Card-to-Cloud device have greatly improved our ability to get closer to meeting the incredible demand in the market. AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud provided meaningful growth for the quarter. And far more importantly, it meant that patients could get access to a world-leading ResMed device to treat their sleep apnea. Clearly, launching this platform to address the spiking demand was and is the right decision.\nOur #1 priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease, obesity, hypoventilation syndrome, asthma and all those who need access to our out-of-hospital health care systems. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the care that they need, where they need it and when they need it.\nWe continue partnering with our global supply chain to increase access to the critical components that are needed to accelerate production of our medical devices. Last month, I had the opportunity to fly to Sydney and meet many of our supplier partners in-person for the first time in 3 years at our STAR Supplier event in Sydney. STAR is an annual celebration of our partnership with top suppliers.\nThe event was also an opportunity to bring the ResMed story to life for our critical suppliers focusing on the life-saving importance of what we do every day. We showed our suppliers that increased component allocation for ResMed ultimately benefits patients, providers, physicians and all of our stakeholders worldwide. Supplier feedback from the STAR event was overwhelmingly positive and many attendees commented how the event helped them to better understand our strong patient focus here at ResMed as well as our commitment to product quality and the patient-driven need for them to increase supply to ResMed.\nAs a consequence of these partnerships, our suppliers are responding positively, and I can share this, we expect steady increase in ResMed's device production each quarter throughout this fiscal year and beyond.\nLet me now review updates on ResMed's top 3 strategic priorities. Number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses; number two, to design, develop and deliver market-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home.\nThe launch and acceptance of our next-generation device platform called AirSense 11 continues to go very well. Patient feedback remains very positive, and we continue to see very strong adoption of our myAir patient app. In fact, more than -- it's more than doubled the adoption rate of MyAir with the AirSense 10 platform, with over 60% of all patients downloading and using the app on AirSense 11.\nWe know that patient engagement in their therapy through myAir is an incredibly important part of the therapy process and the ongoing compliance ecosystem due to our clinical publications in the area. Published real-world evidence data show that we achieved 87% adherence rates when our full tech stack is used, including both myAir and AirView. Clearly, increasing production of the AirSense 11 platform remains a top priority for ResMed, and we are doing that every quarter.\nAdditionally, we look forward to continuing to expand AirSense 11 into additional countries as we progress throughout fiscal year 2023 and as we continue to gain regulatory approvals country by country.\nA key part of our ResMed 2025 strategy is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud-connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions as well as high flow therapy offerings.\nDuring the quarter, our ResMed team presented data at the European Respiratory Society Congress that the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD is much higher than previously estimated. The epidemiology data presented at ERS showed that over 480 million people worldwide have COPD. This is 100 million more than previously published data.\nAs the global population continues to grow and age, we estimate that over 590 million people will have COPD by 2050. This represents a 23% relative increase in global COPD numbers from the baseline of 2020.\nCombined with the estimated 330 million people worldwide that suffer from asthma, these prevalence figures highlight the importance of treating these chronic conditions with our respiratory care solutions.\nTurning to our Software-as-a-Service business for outside hospital care, our SaaS business achieved another quarter of high single-digit growth year-on-year. The continued trend to move to lower cost and lower acuity locations for care is driving strong growth of home-based care. This is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment and our home health software platforms provided under our Brightree brand. We continue to grow with our home care customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize their own business efficiencies as well as patient care, including specifically our Snap resupply offering.\nCensus growth in skilled nursing as well as hospice is still challenged by post-COVID patient flow recovery as well as labor shortages. One of our most innovative solutions in this space under our MatrixCare brand has been technology solutions to improve staffing efficiency, improving both staff hiring and management. As post-COVID patient census continues to improve and pent-up demand for technology investments continues to come to the market, we expect to see even more growth opportunities to sell our services and solutions to new and existing skilled nursing and hospice customers.\nLast quarter, I discussed our agreement to acquire MEDIFOX DAN, the leading provider of end-to-end software solutions for nursing homes and home health customers in Germany. We are on track to close this acquisition before the end of the calendar year. This current quarter, we're in December 2022. And we remain excited about our opportunity to accelerate SaaS innovation and SaaS growth in Germany.\nThis is our first investment in a pure-play SaaS business outside the U.S., and we look forward to updating you as we achieve key milestones in that business over the year ahead. Our integration team is primed and ready.\nI'm excited about the future of our SaaS business. It's an important part of ResMed's growth and complements the incredible software and device solutions we have in our core sleep and respiratory care businesses. We see a lot of opportunities to innovate in lower-cost, lower-acuity settings of care. We believe this is the future of health care delivery, and ResMed is the right strategic home for these growth businesses.\nWe are well positioned as the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care, and we have created differentiated value for our customers and long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. Bringing it all together, we are transforming out-of-hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology.\nWe now have over 12.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 18.5 million cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are liberating these data to the cloud, and we're unlocking value for patients, for providers, for physicians, for payers and for entire health care systems.\nOur mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025, drives and motivates me and ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal over this last period.\nDuring the last 12 months, we improved over 144 million lives with our device platforms, our full mask systems and our software solutions in digital health. We're helping people sleep better, helping people breathe better and helping people live higher quality and happier lives with care delivered right where they live.\nSo before I hand over the call to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my gratitude to more than 8,600 ResMedians for their perseverance, their hard work and their dedication today and every day. Thank you.\nWith that, I will hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks, and then we will open up to Q&A with Brett, me and the gang. Brett, over to you.\n\nBrett A. Sandercock\n\nCFO, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter.\nWe had strong financial performance in Q1 despite the headwinds we faced as a result of significant ongoing supply chain constraints. Group revenue for the September quarter was $950 million, an increase of 5%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 9%.\nRevenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep products across our portfolio and ongoing device demand generated by our competitors' product recall. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies, in particular, a weaker euro, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $36 million this quarter.\nWhile we continue to experience ongoing challenges in securing sufficient production components to meet market demand, we are now seeing a more predictable supply chain environment. This gives us confidence around our expectation of increasing device production in fiscal year '23 relative to fiscal year '22.\nLooking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 18%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets decreased by 6% in constant currency terms.\nBy product segment, globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 9%, while masks and other sales increased by 8%.\nBreaking it down by regional areas. Device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 23%, as we benefited from incremental revenue derived from the introduction of our Card-to-Cloud device. Masks and other sales increased by 11%, reflecting solid resupply revenue achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient setups.\nIn Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales decreased by 10% in constant currency terms, mainly as a result of the ongoing challenges in securing sufficient production components for connected devices and lower sales of higher acuity devices relative to the strong sales we experienced in the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 3% in constant currency terms.\nSoftware-as-a-Service revenue increased by 9% in the September quarter. We saw particularly strong performance from the HME vertical as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses.\nDuring the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release.\nGross margin increased by 40 basis points to 57.6% in the September quarter. The increase is predominantly attributable to increases in average selling prices, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and foreign currency movements.\nMoving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the first quarter increased by 10% or in constant currency terms increased by 16%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs and a post-COVID normalization of travel and entertainment expenses. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 20.4% compared to the 19.5% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for fiscal year '23.\nR&D expenses for the quarter increased by 5% or in constant currency terms, increased by 9%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.6%, consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year '23.\nOperating profit for the quarter increased by 4%, underpinned by strong revenue growth and improvement in gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 19.8% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 20%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year '23 will be in the range of 19% to 21%.\nOur net income for the quarter was $222 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.51, both consistent with the same period in the prior year. Note year-on-year movements in foreign currencies negatively impacted earnings per share by approximately $0.07 this quarter.\nCash flow from operations for the quarter was $45 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $29 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $36 million.\nDuring the quarter, we paid dividends to shareholders totaling $64 million. We recorded equity losses of $2 million in our income statement in the September quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses in the range of $3 million to $5 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year '23 associated with the joint venture operation.\nWe ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $207 million. At September 30, we had $795 million in gross debt and $588 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest. At September 30, we had approximately $1.4 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility.\nIn summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share. As reported last quarter, we expect to close on the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition by the end of the calendar year pending regulatory clearances. Additionally, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and also expect to further deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions.\nAnd with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.\n\nAmy Wakeham\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Brett. Kevin, I'd like to call you back on to the call and turn it over to you to provide the instructions and run the Q&A portion of the call.",

My name is Kevin, and I'll be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.\n\nAmy Wakeham\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Kevin, and hi, everyone. Welcome to ResMed's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. We thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live, and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of our earnings release and the presentation, both of which are available now.\nJoining me on the call today are our Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Following our prepared remarks, we will host a Q&A session, and Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Pendarvis, Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel.\nDuring today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures.

Please refer to our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today.\nI'll now go ahead and turn the call over to Mick.\n\nMichael J. Farrell\n\nCEO & Director, ResMed Inc.\n\nThanks, Amy, and thank you all for joining us today as we review the results for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2022 ended June 30. On today's call, I will provide a brief high-level overview of our financial results. I'll then review progress towards our ResMed 2025 strategic goals, and then discuss our actions to navigate through ongoing industry and supply chain challenges. Brett will then join the call to review our financial results in more detail.\nOkay. Let's jump right in. Our fourth quarter results reflect strong performance across our business with high single-digit revenue growth in both our sleep and respiratory care business segment as well as in our Software-as-a-Service business segment. Our ongoing growth reflects our global team's relentless focus to solve very complex supply chain problems and find alternate design and engineering solutions to address the incredible industry challenges that we have faced over the past year and beyond.\nThe global supply chain environment remains very much in flux across multiple industries. We are starting to see indications that the macro environment is improving, particularly semiconductor availability. However, we're mindful that even as macro trends start to improve, we still need our supplier partners to prioritize med tech component needs over other nonlife-sustaining industries.\nDemand in the market remains very strong. We've been able to mitigate some of the electronic component bottlenecks with the launch of our redesigned card to cloud AirSense 10 devices introduced to the market midway through our fourth quarter. As you can imagine, clearing one bottleneck simply brings the next rate-limiting step to the forefront. Our team is actively working to clear as many bottlenecks as they can as quickly as possible.\nOn the positive news side, the redesign, reengineering and launch of the card to cloud device greatly improved our ability to meet the incredible demand that we see in the marketplace. During the last month of the quarter, during June, we were able to allocate more products to our customers than in recent months and in recent quarters. We're not out of the woods yet, but the compass is pointing to true north and we are on top of it.\nThroughout this crisis of demand and supply, our established ResMed guiding principles remain the same: that is that we will give priority to the production and delivery of devices to meet the needs of the highest-acuity patients first. As we discussed last quarter, we are still facing a challenging freight environment. The key challenges of sea freight and airfreight are due to reduced availability and elevated prices. These forces are impacting our ability to efficiently get components into our factories and then to get the finished goods out of those factories and ship to warehouses and ultimately to customers.\nWe continue to do everything that we can to secure additional supply to ultimately further increase production of our devices. As highlighted on previous calls, this includes a combination of 5 concurrent work streams in supply chain. One, we are locking in the flow of our existing parts from existing suppliers. Two, we are establishing flow of existing parts from new suppliers. Three, we're validating and verifying new parts from existing suppliers. And four, we're validating and verifying new parts from new suppliers. And then finally, five, we're reengineering designs to mitigate the major supply bottlenecks.\nIn summary, we're making good progress with these 5 lines of work, and we've been able to offset some of the impacts of the component shortages to best support patients, providers, physicians and beyond. In addition to the successful launch of our redesigned card to cloud device last quarter, we also continue to support our customers with our market-leading mask portfolio. The supply -- despite the challenges we faced with reduced new patient setups due to a competitor recall, we continue to see strong uptake of our mask solutions as our customers want the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the easiest to fit and the most highly patient-rated masks in the market, and those come from ResMed.\nPeer-reviewed and published studies have clearly shown that patients that are on a ReSupply program are much more likely to remain on sleep apnea treatment adherent for the long term than those that aren't on a ReSupply program. Our home care provider customers not only want to put new patients on therapy, they want to keep those new patients and all of their existing patients on therapy over the long term. And the ultimate goal there is to improve patient outcomes to lower total health care system costs as well as to drive their own recurring revenue streams.\nWe recognize that this demand outstripping supply situation remains a very difficult temporary state for all customers, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers, health care systems as well as the most important customer of all, the patient. We continue to work across the industry to be the best partner and the best solutions provider for all customers. We expect demand to be greater than supply for at least 12 more months, driven by the recall of one of our competitors primarily. The net result is that every device that we here at ResMed make during these next 12 months, we will sell as it leaves the production line to a warehouse and is shipped to a customer. We are looking at every angle to maximize supply and address this incredible demand these next 12 months.\nAs a company, we are learning every day. And as an industry, we will get through this challenge stronger than ever. Our goal is to ensure that every person gets the care that they need, where they need it, when they need it, and we won't stop until we achieve that goal.\nLet's now briefly review the COVID-related market impacts on our industry. Most of the 140 countries that we operate in are now above 100% of pre-COVID levels of patient flow. It is noted that in some regions and some countries, we see ongoing surges of new COVID variants with some select governments continuing to impose COVID restrictions. In these areas, patient flow remains below pre-COVID levels. But across the board, we are seeing ongoing adoption of digital health solutions for screening, for diagnosis and for remote patient setup and monitoring as well as well-established COVID cleaning protocols at sleep labs and physician offices. These trends continue to minimize the impact of new variants and diminish the absolute impact of COVID on our industry over time.\nLet's now step back a little and review ResMed's top 3 strategic priorities: number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses; number two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care that is delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home.\nThe launch of our next-generation device platform called the AirSense 11 continues to go very well. It remains somewhat difficult to differentiate the success of the launch from previous generations with the incredibly high demand we're seeing around the world. Every Air 11 we make is sold immediately as it leaves the manufacturing floor. However, when we drill into patient feedback data, we see that patients are very excited about the platform, including the Air 11 device itself and the myAir software solutions surrounding it.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we introduced the AirSense 11 into several new countries outside the United States where we first launched the platform, including France, Switzerland and across the Nordic countries of Northern Europe. We look forward to further expansion into additional countries as we progress through our fiscal year 2023.\nOne area that we are closely watching is patient adoption of digital health solutions. And to that point, adoption rates of the myAir app by new patients set up on therapy with the AirSense 11 continue to be more than double that of the AirSense 10. This is because the AirSense 11 platform is designed to enable and encourage patients to engage directly with their own health care.\nThe bottom line is that people want personal care. They want their own data on their own app on their own phone. And they love the coaching and personal engagement of our ecosystem. They are voting with their digital presence, and repeat usage of the myAir app is stronger than ever. More patients on myAir means more patients are fully engaging with ResMed's software technology. This has led us to now passing over 12 billion nights of sleep apnea and respiratory care medical data in the cloud. Our software solutions, including myAir and AirView, are delivering a better patient experience, better efficiencies for home care providers and physicians, and most importantly, greater long-term adherence to therapy for the patient.\nAnother key aspect of our long-term growth strategy is driving awareness and increasing the flow of patients through the top of the sleep apnea diagnosis funnel. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of digital health. For our industry, this is specifically seen in the increased usage of home-based sleep apnea tests. Although new patient demand gen is clearly not a top priority in the immediate term given the current supply-demand imbalance, we are maintaining our focus in this area and our long-term investments so that we are ready when conditions improve and we can pivot and fire up our portfolio of demand-gen models and thereby ensure sustainable long-term pipelines of new patients for our industry.\nWith over 1 billion people suffocating every night with sleep apnea worldwide, we see this work as an opportunity, but also an obligation as the market leader in the field. We are innovating with health care system partners and all of our customers to create an even more efficient and effective approach to sleep apnea patient identification, screening, diagnosis, treatment and management. We will continue to invest in technology that enables an end-to-end, seamless, digital experience for patients and their caregivers.\nAs we consider opportunities to address the wider sleep market, we are investing in opportunities to address another major sleep disorder epidemic, that of insomnia. Insomnia has been shown in clinical research to occur in combination with sleep apnea, and that's a deadly combination. To this medical need and this medical opportunity, just last week, we announced the acquisition of a company called mementor. This is a German and Swiss digital health start-up that develops and sells digital medical products in the field of sleep medicine and beyond. mementor offers the first and so far the only permanently listed digital health application in the field of sleep medicine that is reimbursed by the statutory insurances in Germany. The acronym for these German digital health apps is DIGA, D-I-G-A.\nThis acquisition furthers our efforts to diversify and accelerate growth of our ResMed business in Germany and the potential opportunity with DIGA to expand this offering into other markets around Europe and around the world. There's an unmet need in diagnosing and treating people with sleep problems, such as sleep apnea and insomnia, the 2 biggest sleep problems on the planet and especially when there's an overlap of these chronic conditions. This acquisition of mementor broadens our focus in this vertical from a sleep apnea therapy company to a true sleep therapy company. More to come as we pursue growth in this exciting space in Germany and beyond.\nGrowth trends in the global sleep apnea market are in a state of flux in the short term given the market supply-demand dynamics that we talked about and the recall from one of our competitors. Long term, we estimate the underlying growth trends in the global sleep apnea market to be very strong; in the mid-single-digit range for devices and the high single-digit range for masks. As always, our goal is to drive market demand and to meet or beat market growth through generation of new patients and sales of our market-leading therapy solutions and the introduction of new innovations and alternative treatment pathways that enable us to address even more patients with undiagnosed sleep apnea.\nCurrent industry dynamics indicate that we have a multiyear opportunity to drive even greater ongoing acceptance and adoption of our solutions to further solidify our market leadership position. I've challenged our global ResMed team to strive for even stronger growth in the coming months and quarters and the fiscal year and beyond. I'm telling them to go get the share, to go lock in that share with digital health with value that speaks for itself with lower costs, better outcomes for patients and increased efficiencies for the health care system.\nTurning to a discussion of our respiratory care business. I want to focus on our strategy to better serve the 380 million people worldwide with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, with many others with neuromuscular diseases and respiratory insufficiency and the 330 million patients that suffer from asthma worldwide. Our goal is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation as well as life support ventilation; as well as newer therapeutic areas, such as our cloud-connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions from our Propeller team; and high-flow therapy offerings that we are conducting clinical trials on right now, including our product platform called Lumis HFT.\nDemand for our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD and neuromuscular disease and beyond remains solid throughout the quarter. Ventilation solution demand was supported by the continued success, adoption and scaling of our AirView for ventilation software platform by customers as they experience the benefits of remote monitoring to better manage their ventilated patient populations through remote access to clinical data as well as customizable physician notifications.\nLet me now review our Software-as-a-Service business for outside hospital care. Our SaaS business achieved another quarter of high single-digit growth year-on-year across our portfolio of verticals, including home medical equipment as well as facilities-based and home-based care settings. Our SaaS customers recognize the need for technology solutions to solve their challenges with efficiency and scale, and our software, services and solutions help them achieve both.\nThe continued growth of home-based care is providing tailwinds for HME solutions as well as home health solutions. We continue to grow with our customers as they increase their utilization of our software and our data solutions to improve and optimize their business efficiencies and their patient care, including Brightree and Snap ReSupply offerings.\nAs businesses continue to open up, we've been able to visit customers more and more in person as well as attend trade shows, host conferences, where the interest in our Brightree, MatrixCare, HEALTHCAREfirst and Citus offerings remain very strong.\nEarlier this week, I personally attended the Inspire 2022 Conference in Austin, Texas. This is MatrixCare's annual customer summit, and it was in person for the first time since 2019. I had the pleasure and the opportunity of presenting and engaging in person with over 600 customers and partners from home health, skilled nursing, senior living, private-duty home care, life plan community verticals and beyond. The passion for caring for each patient that was involved in every conversation I had this week, the openness, the sharing and the ability for us as a community to move patients to lower-cost, lower-acuity and higher-quality outcome cares, those settings was palpable at Inspire 2022. I came away from that conference even more energized and excited about the opportunities that we have to support customers across the care settings with our digital health and our software solutions.\nThe ultimate goal is that customers of our Brightree- and MatrixCare-branded solutions can provide better care for the people that they serve. Given the passion of our customers and the service levels that we're providing and the product pipeline that was discussed at this conference, I expect we'll continue to not only take share from our competitors across the portfolio, but even drive growth with more tech solutions being adopted by customers across care settings.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been and remains challenging for facility-based verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing and to a lesser extent hospice, where patient census rates below -- remain below pre-pandemic levels. As COVID restrictions continue to ease and our customers improve their line of sight to better conditions and better cleaning, we are seeing pent-up demand for technology investments in these facility-based areas. This provides opportunities for us to sell more services and more tech solutions to existing customers as well as to increase our new customer pipeline.\nOne MatrixCare customer at Inspire 2022 grabbed me at the conference, and he described what he called a rocket ship acceleration of demand at skilled nursing tech solutions for those skilled nursing customers. This is a really welcome sign for sustainable growth across our SaaS portfolio.\nSo as we look at our portfolio of solutions across care settings, we expect our SaaS group revenue to maintain high single-digit growth throughout fiscal year 2023. As always, our goal is to meet or beat market growth rates, and we will continue to invest and innovate to grow the market and to take share. Our growth in SaaS will come through organic and inorganic growth.\nWe've long talked about our desire to expand our SaaS offerings internationally if and when we found the right opportunity for ResMed. In early June, we announced the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, the leading provider of end-to-end software solutions for home health and for nursing home providers in Germany. We've been closely watching the evolution of the German digital health system and the associated outside hospital health care system for many years. And we've actually been closely watching MEDIFOX DAN for a number of years. This is our first investment in a pure-play SaaS business in Europe, and it's a great opportunity to expand our reach in this business globally.\nWe're starting in Germany as it is not only a market where we're vertically integrated in our core business of sleep and respiratory care, it's also one of our largest markets globally and a country where the government is investing in digital health reimbursement. We're excited about the opportunity to accelerate innovation and recurring revenue business models through this acquisition in Germany. As we discussed on the acquisition call that we had in June, MEDIFOX DAN will be immediately accretive to ResMed at close. Progress towards closing this acquisition is moving ahead as expected. We remain on track to close by the end of December 2022 in our fiscal 2023 second quarter.\nWe are the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for outside hospital care globally, and we provide mission-critical software across a broad set of very attractive markets. We are well positioned, and we have created a differentiated value for our customers and for ResMed with our SaaS business investments. I'm excited about the future of our SaaS business. And Bobby Ghoshal and the excitement that he had on Inspire 2022 with the crowd for both MatrixCare and Brightree was an inspiration for me as the CEO of the parent company but also for the whole team there. It's an important part of ResMed's future growth, and I see a lot of opportunities to invest in lower-cost, lower-acuity settings of care. We believe that this is the future of health care delivery, and that's where ResMed competes and it's where ResMed wins.\nTo bring it all together, our strategic focus remains on personal care that is patient-centric, physician-centric and provider-centric. This triple-pronged approach, combined with our unique ResMed culture, means that we are very well positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved medical markets of sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease, asthma, insomnia and beyond.\nWe are transforming outside hospital care at scale. We're leading the market in digital health technology with over 12 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and nearly 18 million cloud-connectable medical devices on people's bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are unlocking value by using de-identified data to help patients, providers, physicians, payers and entire health care systems. We have invested in the cybersecurity, the privacy, the cloud ops, the data analytics, the AI/ML capabilities to do this at scale, unmatched by any competitor. And we are increasing our investments and our lead each and every day.\nOur 2 key global customer-facing software products, AirView and myAir, are 100% in the cloud. Our devices are both cloud-connected and cloud-enabled, making ResMed itself a market-leading cloud-connected and cloud-enabled digital health company. Our mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025 drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal this last fiscal year 2022. We changed nearly 141 million lives these last 12 months with our devices, our mask systems, our software solutions, helping people sleep better, breathe better and live higher-quality lives with outside hospital care.\nBefore I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude and thanks to more than 8,000 ResMedians helping their customers in 140 countries. Your perseverance, hard work and dedication has been impeccable. Thank you.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll open up for Q&A. Brett, over to you.\n\nBrett A. Sandercock\n\nCFO, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter.\nWe had solid financial performance in Q4 despite the headwinds we faced due to significant ongoing supply chain constraints in a challenging freight environment. Group revenue for the June quarter was $915 million, an increase of 4%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 8%. Revenue growth reflects increased demand for our sleep products across our portfolio and increased device demand generated by our competitor's ongoing product recall.\nWe did not derive incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand during the June quarter compared to $20 million in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19-related demand. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related demand in the prior year, revenue increased by 10% on a constant currency basis.\nIn relation to the impact of our competitor's recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $60 million to $70 million in the June quarter. Note, this is consistent with the estimated $60 million to $70 million incremental device revenue in the prior year quarter. For fiscal year '22, this brings the total estimated incremental revenue in the range of $230 million to $250 million associated with our competitor's recall.\nWhile we continue to experience ongoing challenges in securing sufficient production components to meet market demand, we are now seeing a stable to improving supply chain environment. This has given us more confidence around our expectation of increasing device production in fiscal year '23 relative to fiscal year '22.\nLooking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 12%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 1% in constant currency terms. By product segment globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 6%, while masks and other sales increased by 11%.\nBreaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 11% as we benefited from incremental revenue due to our competitor's recall. Masks and other sales increased by 13%, reflecting solid resupply revenue and achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient setups.\nIn Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales decreased by 2% in constant currency terms or excluding the impact of COVID-19-related sales in the prior year increased by 7% in the current -- in constant currency terms. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 7% in constant currency terms or excluding COVID-19-related sales in the prior year increased by 9% in constant currency terms.\nSoftware-as-a-Service revenue increased by 8% in the June quarter. We saw a strong performance from our HME segment as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses. And we are seeing stability in the skilled nursing care segment despite the continuing challenges of COVID-19.\nDuring the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release.\nGross margin increased by 50 basis points to 57.8% in the June quarter. The increase is predominantly attributable to improvement in average selling prices and a positive product mix, partially offset by higher freight component and manufacturing costs, negative geographic mix and unfavorable foreign currency movements.\nMoving on to operating expenses. We are seeing a more normalized expenditure profile as COVID-19 impacts subside compared to the low comparable growth rate we experienced in Q4 last year. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter increased by 6%, or in constant currency terms, increased by 11%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs and T&E expenses. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue at 21.1% remained broadly consistent with the 20.7% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% during fiscal year '23.\nR&D expenses for the quarter increased by 7%, or in constant currency terms increased by 11%. The R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7% compared to 6.8% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% in fiscal year '23.\nOperating profit for the quarter increased by 4%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 17.6% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 21.5%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year '23 will be in the range of 19% to 21%.\nOur net income for the quarter increased by 10%, and our diluted earnings per share for the quarter also increased by 10%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $79 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $29 million; depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $37 million.\nDuring the quarter, we paid dividends to shareholders totaling $61 million. We recorded equity losses of $2.5 million in our income statement in the June quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $3 million per quarter in fiscal year '23 associated with the joint venture operation.\nWe ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $274 million. At June 30, we had $780 million in gross debt and $500 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. At June 30, we had approximately $1.4 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong.\nOur Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share, representing an increase of 5% over the previous quarterly dividend and reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance. Our solid cash flow and low leverage provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. We recently announced the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition and expect to close this transaction before the end of the calendar year pending regulatory clearances. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and also expect to continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions, such as the recently announced acquisition of mementor, a German pioneer and health tech start-up that develops and distributes digital medical products in the field of sleep medicine and related areas.\nAnd with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.\n\nAmy Wakeham\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Brett, and thanks, Mick. Kevin, I'll now turn the call over to you to provide instructions and manage the Q&A portion of the call.",

My name is Kevin, and I'll be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.\n\nAmy Wakeham\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate you joining us. This call is being webcast live and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of our earnings press release and presentation, which are both available now.\nWith me on the call today are ResMed's Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. During the Q&A portion of our call, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jim Hollingshead, President, Sleep and Respiratory Care; and David Pendarvis, our Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel.\nDuring today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, please review the supporting schedules in today's earnings release or the appendix of the earnings presentation.\nAs a reminder, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future operating and financial performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, however, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements that are made today.\nI'd like to now turn the conference call over to Mick.\n\nMichael J. Farrell\n\nCEO & Director, ResMed Inc.\n\nThanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the third quarter of our fiscal year 2022 ended March 31.\nOur third quarter results reflect strong performance across our business with double-digit revenue growth in our Sleep and Respiratory Care business and high single-digit growth in our Software-as-a-Service segment. Our growth is the direct result of our global team's ability to pivot and drive for results, even as we continue to manage through several external challenges that are impacting our business, including: one, ongoing supply chain disruptions; two, COVID restrictions in parts of the world; three, recovering post-COVID peak patient flows; and four, unprecedented demand from a competitor recall, which will keep them out of the market at least through the end of the calendar year.\nThe global supply chain environment remains very challenging across multiple industries. I'm very proud of our team, growing double digits this quarter year-on-year with an astounding 30% growth this quarter for devices in U.S., Canada, and Latin America. Even with this incredible growth, the demand in the market was even greater.\nAs with almost all customers in the global components industry, we remain on allocation from our suppliers, particularly for electronic components with our #1 bottleneck being semiconductor chips. This allocation impacts our ability to meet the incredible demand that we see in our marketplace, and we are forced, in turn, to allocate ResMed products to our customers. We have established guiding principles for allocation, giving priority to [the production and delivery of devices to the] (added by company after the call) highest acuity patients first.\nAdditionally, the ongoing challenges of sea freight and air freight due to reduced availability and increased prices are impacting our ability to efficiently get components into, and finished goods out of, our factories worldwide. We are working closely with our global supply chain partners doing everything that we can to secure additional supply to further increase production of our devices.\nThis work includes a combination of a number of work streams: one, shoring up the flow of existing parts from existing suppliers; two, establishing flow of existing parts from new suppliers; three, validating new parts from existing suppliers; and four, validating and verifying new parts from new suppliers, as we review and redesign across key devices in our portfolio. In addition, we have a fifth line of work. So it's 5 lines of work, and that fifth line is reengineering designs to eliminate and/or mitigate the top bottlenecks to achieve greater flow through our supply chain.\nThe most significant example of a project in this fifth line of work is our newly released AirSense 10 card-to-cloud device. This device eliminates the #1 bottleneck of the 3G, 4G comms chip while facilitating secure data upload to our cloud-based software platform called AirView, so that providers and physicians can access the data and better manage the patient.\nWe've already begun to offer AirSense 10 card-to-cloud devices in select markets to some customers, and we will be ramping up from there. With these 5 lines of work continuing in parallel, we have been able to offset some of the impact of continuing component shortages and decommits to help us better support patients, providers and physicians.\nWe recognize that this is a very difficult situation for all of our customers, including physicians who feel the pressure from their patients, home medical equipment providers who see this every day in their businesses, but also payers and entire healthcare systems and especially the most important customer, the patient themselves. We are partnering across the industry to be the solutions provider to these problems.\nWe expect a significant backlog of patients diagnosed and coming through the system to be present for at least the next 12 to 18 months with incredible associated demand. We are working to address this demand with this portfolio of supply projects and beyond. And we will get through this time stronger than ever as an industry and as a company.\nOur #1 priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who suffer from sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and other key chronic respiratory insufficiency diseases, as well as those who benefit from our out of the hospital care Software-as-a-Service solutions. Our goal is to ensure that every person gets the care that they need, where they need it and when they need it.\nLet's now briefly discuss the other broad market conditions in our industry. We continue to see steady ongoing recovery of patient flow and demand through the diagnostic channel across the countries that we operate in. In fact, many countries are above 100% of pre-COVID levels of patient flow. However, ongoing surges, variants and government restrictions continue to impact a few countries, which remain below pre-COVID diagnostic levels. China is a case in point right now with severe shutdowns in Shanghai and beyond.\nBut across our portfolio, our global portfolio, we're in 140 countries that we serve, I expect that these metrics will steadily improve to pre-COVID patient levels and beyond as vaccines and boosters roll out globally and people remain focused on their personal respiratory health and hygiene. It's been a big learning through COVID.\nWith the adoption of digital health solutions for screening, diagnosis and remote patient setup and remote patient monitoring as well as establish COVID cleaning protocols, sleep labs and other facilities, I expect the impact of new variants to diminish in absolute impact each and every time.\nLet me now update you on our top 3 strategic priorities. Number one, which is to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma businesses. Number two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally. And number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care that is delivered outside the hospital, where people live and especially in the home.\nThe U.S. launch of our next-generation device platform called AirSense 11 continues to go very well. Although it is challenging to differentiate ongoing positive customer sentiment and feedback from the incredibly high demand in the U.S. market and beyond. The AirSense 11 has provided much needed additional product supply as we face all-time high demand for ResMed devices and it couldn't have launched at a better time for that purpose to help us mitigate ongoing component shortages.\nWe will introduce the AirSense 11 into additional countries in the fourth quarter that we're in right now here of fiscal year 2022 and throughout fiscal 2023. In parallel, we will continue to sell our globally available market-leading platform, the AirSense 10, which is second in customer preference only to the AirSense 11. Including the new card-to-cloud AirSense 10, as we seek to maximize the total volume of CPAP, APAP and by levels available for all of our customers.\nWith our digital health technology ecosystem, we are engaging patients in their therapy in a digitally native environment like never before in the industry. We are also making it easier and more efficient for our home medical equipment and home care provider customers to manage their patient populations using our full suite of software solutions, including myAir for patients, AirView for physicians and providers and Brightree for HME providers.\nWhen customers use these digital health technology solutions, they have increased efficiencies, lower costs, and together with us, we achieve improved outcomes for patients and their physicians. With the latest technology built into the AirSense 11 platform, we are driving higher adoption rates of the myAir app by patients, higher than ever before. Right now, we are seeing more than double the myAir adoption rate as patients engage directly in their own healthcare.\nPeople want personal care. They want their own data, on their own app, on their own phones. And they like the coaching and the personal engagement of our digital ecosystem. This means more patients are signing up onto myAir every day and fully engaging with ResMed's software technology, helping us to now pass over 11.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud.\nUltimately, these software solutions, these big data, deliver a better patient experience. They deliver better efficiencies for home care providers, and most importantly, they deliver greater long-term adherence to therapy by patients.\nLet me spend just a couple of minutes outlining some real-world evidence showing that greater therapy adherence leads to lower hospitalizations, lower mortality and better clinical outcomes through mitigation of chronic disease. We are demonstrating better patient outcomes and lowering costs for the healthcare system at a scale not seen before in the industry. These are critical components of the ResMed 2025 strategy.\nThe latest example is a study recently published in the landmark American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Journal, also known in the industry as the Blue Journal. This article demonstrates that patients with obstructive sleep apnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were adherent to CPAP therapy, versus nonadherent to CPAP therapy, and it showed significant year 1 and year 2 reduction of clinical use by over 30% and reduction of inpatient hospitalizations by nearly 50%. It showed a 20% reduction in year 1 and year 2 total healthcare resource costs, which included a 25% reduction in emergency room costs and a 52% reduction in inpatient hospitalizations. These are important metrics for the whole healthcare system.\nAnother key aspect of our long-term growth strategy is driving awareness and increasing the flow of patients through the top of the sleep apnea diagnostic funnel. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of digital health and respiratory health, including telehealth tools and specifically home-based sleep apnea tests. Although driving demand generation is not a priority in the immediate term, given the supply shortage and the incredible demand we're facing, we are maintaining our long-term focus and investments in this diagnostic channel so that we are ready when conditions improve to ensure sustainable long-term pipelines of new patients coming through the channel. With 1.6 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma, it's also our duty to do this.\nWe are innovating with partners and our customers to create even more efficient and effective approaches to sleep apnea patient identification, screening, diagnostics, treatment and management. We will continue to invest in technology that enable what we call an end-to-end seamless digital experience for patients.\nOne example we recently rolled out is the next generation of our remote mask selector tool that makes mask selection and sizing easier and more effective by creating personalized mask recommendations based on a patient's health, sleep attributes and their own facial measurements.\nChoosing the right mask is challenging to do remotely. But getting the right mask fit is crucial to patient comfort and long-term adherence. The technology MaskSelector is a web-based tool that solves this problem by prompting the patient to answer a few simple questions and follow a few easy steps with their camera-enabled smartphone to capture a digital facial scan. Based on the answers and the digital facial measurements, MaskSelector then provides a recommended mask and sizing. Whether a patient is then being set up at home remotely or preparing for a face-to-face interaction with the respiratory therapists and clinical staff at a provider's office, MaskSelector helps the patient quickly get to the right mask for their unique needs.\nTurning to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million patients with COPD worldwide and the 330 million patients that suffer from asthma worldwide. Our goal is to reach many hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas such as our cloud-connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions from our Propeller technology and high-flow therapy offerings such as our product platform called Lumis HFT.\nDemand for our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD and other respiratory insufficiency patients remained strong throughout the quarter, especially in markets outside the U.S. where providers shifted focus to supporting the most severe and highest acuity patients. This demand and the work of providers is aligned with the ResMed guiding principles of our allocation process, specifically to give the highest priority to manufacturing life support ventilation. As I speak, we are not component constrained on our life support ventilator called Astral.\nLet me now review our Software as a Service business for out-of-hospital care. During the quarter, our SaaS business achieved high single-digit growth year-on-year across our portfolio of SaaS markets, including home medical equipment as well as facilities-based and home-based care settings. Our SaaS customers recognize the need for technology solutions to solve their challenges with efficiency and scale. And our software services and solutions help them achieve both.\nThe continued growth of home-based care is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment and our home health products, and we continue to grow with our customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care, including our landmark Brightree and Snap ReSupply products.\nAs businesses continue to open up, we've been able to visit customers in person as well as to attend SaaS trade shows, where interest in our Brightree, MatrixCare and Citus offerings, to name a few, remain very strong. We have a very solid pipeline in SaaS.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been and remains challenging for some verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities, where headwinds have kept patient census rates below pre-pandemic levels. But as COVID restrictions continue to ease and our customers improve their line of sight to better conditions, we expect to see pent-up demand for technology investments, which provide opportunities for us to sell more services and more solutions to existing customers, as well as to increase our new customer pipeline.\nAs we look at our portfolio of solutions across care settings, we expect our SaaS group revenue growth to maintain high single-digit growth as we exit this fiscal year and well into the next fiscal year and beyond. As always, our goal is to meet or beat that market growth rate as we continue to innovate, and we expect to grow the market and take market share.\nWe are the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for outside-hospital care. And we provide mission-critical software across a broad range of very attractive vertical markets. We are well-positioned, and we have created differentiated value for customers and for ResMed with our SaaS businesses. I'm excited about the future of our SaaS business. It's an important part of ResMed's future growth, and I see a lot of opportunities to innovate in lower cost, lower acuity settings of care. It's the future of healthcare delivery with strong organic and inorganic growth ahead for ResMed.\nOur focus is on personal care that is patient-centric, physician-centric and provider-centric. This approach, combined with our unique ResMed culture means that we are positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved medical markets of sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and beyond. We are transforming out-of-hospital healthcare at scale, leading the market in digital health technology.\nAs I said earlier, we have over 11.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud, and we have over 17 million cloud-connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are unlocking value by using de-identified data to help patients directly but also to help providers, physicians, payers and entire healthcare systems.\nWe have invested in the cybersecurity, the privacy, cloud operations as well as data analytics, including artificial intelligence machine learning capabilities to do this at a scale unmatched by our competitors, and we are increasing our lead each and every day. Our two key software customer-facing products, AirView and myAir, are now 100% managed in the cloud. So not only are our devices cloud-connected and our software cloud-enabled, we here at ResMed as a company are cloud-connected and cloud-enabled. In fact, we are a leading digital health company, globally.\nOur mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better healthcare in 2025 drives and motivates me and ResMedians around the world every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal during the last quarter.\nBefore I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to again express my sincere gratitude to the more than 8,000 ResMedians worldwide for their perseverance, their hard work and their dedication during these ongoing and unprecedented times. Thank you for all that you do.\nWith that, I will hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we will move to open the lines for Q&A. Over to you, Brett.\n\nBrett A. Sandercock\n\nCFO, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the third quarter fiscal year 2022. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter.\nWe had solid financial performance in Q3 despite the headwinds we faced as a result of significant ongoing supply chain constraints and a challenging freight environment. Group revenue for the March quarter was $865 million, an increase of 12%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 14%. Revenue growth reflects increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care products across our portfolio driven by recovering market conditions and by increased device demand in response to the ongoing product recall by one of our competitors.\nIn the March quarter, we recorded immaterial incremental revenue from COVID-19 related demand consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19-related demand.\nIn relation to the impact of our competitors' recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $35 million to $45 million in the March quarter. For the first 3 quarters of FY '22, this reflects incremental revenue in the range of $170 million to $190 million. We continue to experience challenges in securing sufficient components, and this has hampered our ability to materially increase our supply of devices.\nWe expect our fiscal fourth quarter to remain supply constrained and similar to our recent fiscal quarters, therefore, limiting incremental revenue during the fourth quarter. We now expect the total incremental device revenue opportunity for fiscal year 2022 will fall somewhere between $200 million and $250 million.\nLooking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 18%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 11% in constant currency terms. By product segment globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 21%, while masks and other sales increased by 9%.\nBreaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 30% as we benefited from incremental revenue due to a competitor's recall and favorable product mix as we sold an increased proportion of higher acuity devices. This is consistent with our guiding principles for product allocation, namely that we are giving priority to the production and delivery of our devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first.\nMask and other sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 7%, reflecting solid resupply revenue achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 10% in constant currency terms. Mask and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 13% in constant currency terms.\nSoftware as a Service revenue increased by 8% in the March quarter. We saw a strong performance of the HME segment as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses, and we are seeing more stability in the skilled nursing care segment as it continues to emerge from the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release.\nOur non-GAAP gross margin declined by 150 basis points to 58.1% in the March quarter. The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher freight, component, and manufacturing costs, partially offset by a positive product mix due to strong growth in our higher acuity devices, and improvement in average selling prices following the introduction of the device surcharge.\nMoving on to operating expenses. We are seeing a normalized expenditure profile as COVID-19 impacts subside compared to the low comparable and negative growth rates we experienced in Q3 last year. SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased by 14% or in constant currency terms, increased by 17%. The increase was predominantly attributable to an increase in employee-related expenses.\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue at 21.1% remained broadly consistent with the 20.9% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of FY '22.\nR&D expenses for the quarter increased by 19% or in constant currency terms increased by 22%. The R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.7% compared to 7.3% in the prior year quarter. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and solutions development will deliver a sustained competitive advantage.\nLooking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of FY '22.\nOur non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter increased by 5%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by the contraction of our gross margin and higher operating expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 21.1% compared to the prior year quarter non-GAAP tax rate of 19.4%. Looking forward, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full fiscal year '22 will be in the range of 19% to 20%.\nOur non-GAAP net income for the quarter increased by 2% and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter also increased by 2%.\nCash flow from operations for the quarter was $117 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $48 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $42 million.\nDuring the quarter, we paid dividends to shareholders totaling $61 million. We recorded equity losses of $2.6 million in our income statement in the March quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $2 million to $3 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year '22 and into FY '23 associated with the joint venture operation.\nWe ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $202 million. At March 31, we had $681 million in gross debt and $479 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at March 31, we had approximately $1.6 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility.\nIn summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance. Our solid cash flow and low leverage provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D. We also expect to continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions.\nAnd with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.\n\nAmy Wakeham\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Brett. Kevin, I'd like to ask you to come back on the line. I'll turn the call over to you to provide instructions and to manage the Q&A portion of the call.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, Amy.\n\nAmy Wakeham\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Kevin, and hi, everyone. Welcome to ResMed's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. We thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of the earnings press release and presentation, which are both available now.\nWith me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. During the Q&A portion of our call, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Jim Hollingshead, our President, Sleep and Respiratory Care; and David Pendarvis, our Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel.\nAs a reminder, on today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the notes in today's earnings press release or the appendix of the earnings presentation. Our discussion today may also include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements that are made today.\nI'll now turn the call over to Mick.\n\nMichael J. Farrell\n\nCEO & Director, ResMed Inc.\n\nThanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the December quarter, the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022. Our second quarter results continue to demonstrate the strong performance across our business, benefiting from the ongoing extremely high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices as well as the steady recovery of markets from the peaks of COVID-19 impacts.\nWe achieved double-digit growth in our business as we navigate 3 major externalities: one, the recovery of patient flow post the COVID maximum peaks; two, global supply chain constraints, particularly in electronic components; and three, the almost unlimited demand associated with the competitor recall, that has actually extended further in terms of volumes of their devices that were impacted and the duration of their repair and replace process. The bottom line is we have at least 12 more months of this incredible demand for ResMed products.\nI'm very proud of 8,000 ResMedians serving patients in 140 countries worldwide. Our global teams are finding ways to deliver products and solutions to home care providers, physicians and health care systems and ultimately into the hands of patients who need them most.\nClearly, the global supply chain environment remains very challenging across multiple industries, and we are not immune to its impact. During the quarter, despite growing double digits year-on-year, we were not able to meet all the demand available in the market. We have being allocated components from our suppliers, particularly electronic components and even more specifically, semiconductor chips, and we are thus being forced to allocate our outbound products to our customers.\nWe have established an allocation process with clear guiding principles that give priority to the production and delivery of devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. In addition to component supply issues, the ongoing challenges of sea freight and air freight are impacting our ability to respond as rapidly as we would like to the demand for ResMed products. Freight costs are increasing across the board on inbound components from suppliers and on outbound products to our distribution centers and for ultimate delivery to our customers. As a result of these increased costs, we implemented a surcharge on our products starting in January to share some of the burden of these increased costs with customers. Given all the increase in prices from commodities to specialty products across multiple industries around the world, the necessity of this surcharge has been understood and accepted by our customers.\nWe are working closely with our global supply chain partners doing everything that we can to gain access to additional supply of the critical components that we need to further increase production of our medical devices. We are also reengineering designs validating new parts, pieces, supplies and accelerating new product launch and development to further catch up with the demand. We understand that this is a difficult situation for all of our customers, including physicians, for medical equipment providers, payers, health care systems and the most important customer, the patient.\nOur #1 priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who suffer from sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and other respiratory chronic diseases, as well as those who benefit from our out-of-hospital health care software solutions.\nTo grow and differentiate our Sleep and Respiratory Care business, we will develop, design and deliver world-leading therapy solutions that can be scaled globally, and we're going to deliver the world's leading out-of-hospital software solutions to empower each person's health care wherever they are. Our goal is to ensure that every person gets the care that they need, where they need it and when they need it.\nLet me step back to discuss the broad market conditions in our industry. We're seeing steady ongoing recovery of demand across the countries that we operate in. We are still seeing a divergence in the total patient flow from 85% to 100% of pre-COVID levels in most countries and above 100% of pre-COVID levels in a few locations. These metrics will continue to steadily increase towards pre-COVID levels and beyond as vaccines and boosters roll out globally. Each new COVID variant has an impact, but with the adoption of digital health solutions for screening, diagnosis and remote patients set up and remote patient monitoring as well as established and well-established processes for COVID cleaning protocols at sleep labs, we expect the impact of new variants to diminish in absolute impact each time.\nOur global ResMed team remains committed to working with national, state and city governments as well as local health care systems, hospitals and health care providers to supply ventilators, masks and training for acute care and the important transition home as needed.\nGiven the steadily decreasing severity of each impact on the hospitalizations and severe disease from COVID, the demand for ventilators is now consistent with pre-COVID levels.\nLet me now update you on our top 3 strategic priorities: #1 is to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; #2 is to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and #3 is to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home.\nThe U.S. launch of our next-generation device platform called AirSense 11 continues to go very well. This new platform has provided much needed additional product supply as we face all-time high demand for ResMed devices. We expect to introduce the AirSense 11 platform into additional countries throughout calendar year 2022. In parallel, we will continue to sell our globally available market-leading platform, the AirSense 10, to maximize the total volume of CPAP, APAP and bilevels available for sale. In fact, the only product that the AirSense 10 is inferior to is the AirSense 11.\nAs you saw in our results with double-digit growth this quarter, the ongoing adoption of both the AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms remains very, very strong. With the AirSense 11 platform and our digital health technology ecosystem, we are engaging patients in their therapy digitally like never before in the industry.\nWe are also making it easier and more efficient for our customers to manage their patient populations using our full suite of software solutions, including myAir for patients, AirView for physicians and Brightree for home medical equipment providers. When customers use these digital health technology solutions, they have increased efficiencies, lower costs and we achieved improved outcomes for patients and their physicians.\nWe have peer-reviewed published evidence showing that combining AirSense platform with myAir software and AirView software, we see over 87% adherence to positive airway pressure therapy. This was in the study with over 85,000 patients. On our latest and greatest platform, the AirSense 11, we are driving even higher adoption rates of the myAir app than ever before.\nIn fact, we are seeing more than double the uptake of patients signing up to myAir and fully engaging with ResMed software technology. The net result is that this delivers a better patient experience, better efficiency for the home care providers and more importantly, greater long-term adherence to therapy. We saw this demonstrated in the Alaska study in partnership with the French health care systems, where we showed in a study with over 176,000 patients that those patients who had adhered to CPAP therapy had a 39% relative reduction in mortality rates versus control. Demonstrating these types of better patient outcomes and lower costs for the health care system at a scale not seen before in the industry are critical components of the ResMed 2025 strategy.\nAnother key aspect of our long-term growth strategy is driving awareness and increasing the flow of patients through the top of the sleep apnea diagnosis funnel. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene but also adoption and acceptance of digital health and telehealth tools, including home-based sleep apnea tests.\nAlthough increasing demand is not as important in the immediate short term, given the ongoing competitor recall, we have a long-term focus, and we're always focused on that long-term demand gen opportunity. We are innovating with partners and our customers to create an even more efficient and effective approach to sleep apnea patient identification, screening, diagnostics, treatment and management. We will continue to invest in technology that enables an end-to-end seamless digital experience for patients.\nAs we mentioned in our October call, during the second quarter, we acquired Ectosense, a leading provider of cloud connected home sleep apnea testing technology worldwide. We believe Ectosense's digital and easy-to-use solutions in the hands of physicians, sleep lab technicians as well as consumers can help significantly increase both diagnostic and screening rates as well as general sleep apnea awareness.\nLet me now turn to a discussion of our Respiratory Care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD worldwide, and the 330 million patients that suffer from asthma worldwide. Our goal is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud-connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions from our Propeller technology and high-flow therapy offerings such as our product platform called Lumus HFT.\nDemand for our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions was strong throughout the quarter, especially in markets outside the U.S., where provide a shifted focus to support the most severe highest acuity patients. This demand is aligned with the guiding principles of our allocation process, namely to give the highest priority to manufacturing life support ventilation and noninvasive ventilation devices, including buy levels that meet the needs of these highest acuity patients first.\nAdoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe a little over a year ago, remains solid, and we continue to expand this technology to regions around the world. AirView for ventilation has provided valued by helping physicians and the health care systems they operate in to manage high-risk patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. But it is also increasingly being used on an ongoing basis to enhance quality of care through early and proactive intervention at the first sign of respiratory medical issues to help reduce the risk of hospitalization.\nWe see a world where AirView for ventilation is standard of care for COPD treatment. The way that our core sleep apnea AirView platform is now standard of care for sleep apnea treatment.\nLet me now review our Software as a Service business for out-of-hospital care. During the quarter, our SaaS business showed improved sequential growth. We achieved high single-digit growth year-on-year across our portfolio of SaaS markets, including home medical equipment as well as facilities-based and home-based care settings.\nThe continued growth of home-based care is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment as well as our home health and hospice products, and we continue to grow with customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care, including Brightree and Snap resupply.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been and remains challenging for some of the verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities as the effects of the highly contagious Omicron variant remains a headwind for patient volumes in these settings. We will continue to watch this closely as COVID rates peak and then decline with this latest variant as has happened in many regions around the country and around the world.\nAs COVID restrictions continue to ease and our customers improve their line of sight to better conditions, we expect to see pent-up demand for technology investments, which provides opportunities for us to sell more and more services and solutions to existing customers, as well as to increase our new customer pipeline.\nAs we look at our portfolio of solutions across care settings, we expect our SaaS group revenue growth to accelerate, achieving sustainable high single-digit growth as we exit this fiscal year. As always, our growth -- our goal is to meet or beat that market growth rate as we continue to innovate and continue to take market share from competitors. We are the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care, and we provide mission-critical software across a broad set of very attractive markets.\nOur latest and greater SaaS solutions addressed the #1 issue reported across our customer base, which is staffing challenges. Our SaaS customers expect this problem to persist and they recognize the need for technology solutions to help solve their challenges with efficiency and scale. And our software services and solutions help them achieve both of these outcomes. We are well positioned, and we have created differentiated value for our customers and for ResMed within our SaaS business.\nLooking at the broader portfolio of ResMed's businesses across sleep and respiratory care as well as our SaaS solutions, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative solutions. Our sleep and respiratory care solutions treat the most prevalent and highest cost chronic conditions, and our SaaS solutions support the care settings where people face these and other chronic conditions.\nWith this combination, we can fundamentally transform out-of-hospital health care at a scale that no other company can match. And we are set up for sustainable growth through ongoing investments in R&D to the tune of 7% of our revenues, commercial excellence in partnerships with CVS, Verily and beyond, as well as future acceleration through strategic M&A as well as tuck-in M&A as we move forward.\nOur patient-centric physician-centric and provider-centric approach, combined with our unique ResMed culture, means that we are positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved medical markets of sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and beyond.\nWe are transforming out-of-hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology with over 10.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 16 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide, we are unlocking value by using de-identified data to help patients, providers, physicians, payers and in entire health care systems. We have invested in the privacy cloud operations and AI and ML-driven data analytics capabilities to do this at a scale that is unmatched by competitors, and we are increasing our lead every day.\nOur mission to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025, drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We again made excellent progress toward that inspiring goal during this last quarter.\nBefore I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude to more than 8,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during these ongoing unprecedented times. Thank you.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney and move to the group for Q&A. Brett, over to you.\n\nBrett A. Sandercock\n\nCFO, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter.\nWe're pleased with our financial performance in Q2 despite the headwinds we faced as a result of significant ongoing supply chain constraints in a challenging freight environment. Group revenue for the December quarter was $895 million, an increase of 12%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 13%. Revenue growth reflects increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care products across our portfolio, driven by recovering market conditions and by increased device demand in response to the ongoing product recall by one of our competitors.\nIn the December quarter, we recorded immaterial incremental revenue from our COVID-19 related demand consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19 related demand. However, we will continue to estimate it for you as appropriate.\nIn relation to the impact of our competitors' recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $45 million to $55 million in the December quarter. For the first half of FY '22, this reflects incremental revenue in the range of $125 million to $145 million. We continue to expect component supply constraints will limit the total incremental device revenue opportunity to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million for the full fiscal year 2022.\nAs we shared last quarter, we expect our fiscal third quarter to remain supply constrained similar to our fiscal second quarter, therefore, limiting incremental revenue during the third quarter. We see supply challenges to some extent easing in our fiscal fourth quarter and into fiscal year 2023.\nLooking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 14%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 12% in constant currency terms. By product segment, Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 16%, while masks and other sales increased by 10%.\nBreaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 19%, as we benefited from incremental revenue due to a competitor's recall and favorable product mix as we sold an increased proportion of higher acuity devices. This is consistent with our guiding principles for product allocation, namely that we are giving priority to the production and delivery of our devices to meet the needs of the high security patients first.\nMasks and other sales increased by 9%, reflecting solid resupply revenue and achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 13% in constant currency terms, again reflecting the benefit from incremental revenue due to a competitor's recall.\nMasks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets benefited from improved patient flow relative to the prior year and increased by 11% in constant currency terms. Overall, our Asian operations, in particular, delivered a strong quarter.\nSoftware as a Service revenue increased by 8% in the December quarter. We saw strong performance out of the HME segment as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses, and we are seeing some stability in the skilled nursing care segment as it continues to emerge from the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor the second half of fiscal year '22, we expect to continue to benefit from our competitors' inability to supply new patients and from the global fleet markets general recovery from COVID-19 impact. However, as we have said for the last few quarters, while we are working hard to increase device output, we will not be able to meet all the expected demand resulting from our competitors' recall, primarily because of significant and ongoing supply constraints for electronic components.\nWe are operating in a very dynamic supply chain environment. As I stated earlier, we continue to expect component supply constraints will limit the incremental device revenue resulting from our competitors' recall to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million for fiscal year '22. This includes the device revenue we were able to generate in the first half of fiscal year '22. We expect Q3 to remain challenging but Q4 to be better.\nDuring the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin declined by 230 basis points to 57.6% in the December quarter. The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher freight component and manufacturing costs and unfavorable currency movements, partially offset by positive product mix, particularly in relation to strong growth of our higher acuity devices.\nMoving on to operating expenses. During Q2, we maintained a disciplined approach in our ongoing spend to support our operations. But we are seeing a more normalized expenditure profile as COVID-19 impacts subside. G&A expenses for the second quarter increased by 9% or in constant currency terms increased by 10%. The increase was predominantly attributable to an increase in employee-related expenses. Importantly, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue improved to 20.7% compared to 21.2% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the second half of FY '22.\nR&D expenses for the quarter increased 14% on both a headline and a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7% compared to 6.9% in the prior year quarter. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and solutions development will deliver a sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 7% for the second half of FY '22.\nOur non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter increased by 5%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by the contraction of our gross margin. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 15%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.6% compared to the prior year quarter of 15.2%. The relatively low tax rate in Q2 in both the current quarter and prior year quarter reflects a favorable tax benefit associated with employee equity investing that typically occurs in the second quarter.\nLooking forward, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full fiscal year '22 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Our non-GAAP net income for the quarter increased by 5% and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased by 4%.\nOur cash flow from operations for the quarter was $220 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by higher working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $30 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $41 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends to shareholders totaling $61 million.\nWe recorded equity losses of $1.9 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $2 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year '22 associated with the joint venture operation.\nWe ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $194 million. At December 31, we had $680 million in gross debt and $486 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at December 31, we had approximately $1.6 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong.\nOur Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance. Our solid cash flow and low leverage provide flexibility in how we allocate capital. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest for growth through R&D. We also expect to continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as (inaudible) Health, (inaudible), an acquisition we completed on October 1.\nAnd with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.\n\nAmy Wakeham\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, ResMed Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Brett, and thanks, Mick. Kevin, let's go ahead and now turn the call over to you to provide instructions and then run the Q&A portion of the call.",

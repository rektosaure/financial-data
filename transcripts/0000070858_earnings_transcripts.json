At this time, I would like to turn the program over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead.\n\nE. Lee McEntire\n\nSVP of IR, Bank of America Corporation\n\nGood morning. Thank you. Thank you for joining us to review our third quarter results. Our earnings release documents are available on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. Those documents include the earnings presentation that we'll make reference to during the call.\nBrian Moynihan will make some brief comments before turning the call over to Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, to discuss more of the details in the quarter. Let me just remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. The forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and those are subject to risks and uncertainties laid out.\nFactors that may cause our actual [indiscernible] about non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials and are also available on the website.\nWith that, Brian, over to you.\n\nBrian Thomas Moynihan\n\nChairman & CEO, Bank of America Corporation\n\nThank you, Lee, and good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us. Bank of America delivered a strong third quarter with good growth both in the top line revenue and bottom line EPS, all driven by strong operating leverage. Our ROTCE improved to 15.4%, this quarter's results provide good momentum as we finish 2025 and head into 2026.\nWe have been demonstrating consistent organic growth for many quarters. This quarter's results highlight the continued organic strength of our world-class deposit and lending capabilities. Our results also underscore the benefits of a diversified business model with top-tier position, not only in lending and deposits, but also across the market-driven businesses in Wealth Management, Global Markets and Global Banking.\nBefore I turn over to Alastair, I'm going to hit a few highlights here. We reported revenue of $28 billion, up 11% year-over-year. EPS was $1.06, up 31% year-over-year. we drove operating leverage of 560 basis points in the quarter. The efficiency ratio fell below 62%. The return on assets reached 98 basis points. And during the quarter, we returned to our shareholders $7.4 billion through dividends and share repurchases.\nNet interest income on an FTE basis reached a record $15.4 billion. That was supported by strong commercial loan and deposit growth, along with continued balance sheet positioning. Investment banking fees exceeded $2 billion, up 43% year-over-year. Our team in Sales & Trading grew revenue 8%, marking our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth.\nOur asset management fees increased 12% compared to last year. All the business segments contribute to earnings improvement and had growth in earnings. 2 stood out this quarter. Our consumer banking team delivered $3.4 billion in after-tax earnings, up 28% year-over-year, with 600 basis points of operating leverage. This reflects strong revenue growth and disciplined expense management.\nThis business is driven off the core operating accounts of our consumer customers, and we gained more than this quarter. These accounts have strong balances per account the customers give us great customer scores, and we operate them at lower cost with more primacy in the account and lower attrition compared to anyone in the industry. That is a winning combination.\nOur Global Wealth and Investment Management teams posted net income of nearly $1.3 billion, up 19%. That was driven by the strong [ Merrill ] and Private Bank adviser productivity and concomitant continued growth in fee-based assets. Spending in this business was particularly strong with $12 billion in loan growth in this quarter. [ GM ] also opened another 32,000 banking accounts and grew deposits $3 billion from quarter 2.\nAs we look ahead, we believe this quarter's performance continues to reflect the impact of the investments we have made on a continuous basis for many years in technology, talent and client experience. These continue to translate into strong financial results. We have been growing loans with the right risk and deposits as we continue to gain market share through organic growth.\nThat translated into continuous NII improvements and complement our growth in our fee-based businesses this quarter. I also, as you will commend you to look at the digital slides in the appendix on Slides 2022 and 24. They show the continued progression across all the businesses of Applied Technology with lots of discussions going on about technology and AI and know the things we give you the stats.\nWhat you'll see in these slides is the customer-facing activities of Erica, for example. There are many other applications of AI going on in this company but this one has been handling successful interactions for years with scale and that application has now been applied across other businesses and even across our employee base. So we're confident in our trajectory of our results, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead.\nWe look forward to talking to you at Investor Day in November. I'm going to turn it over to Alastair to walk through the financials in more detail.\n\nAlastair M. Borthwick\n\nPresident of Global Commercial Banking, Bank of America Corporation\n\nThank you, Brian. And I'm going to start with Slide 3 to begin our discussion. And I just have 3 things on the income statement that I want to add to Brian's comments. First, we're pleased with the continued demonstration of expense discipline across our businesses. So in the third quarter, we delivered 11% year-over-year revenue growth significantly outpacing 5% expense growth and resulting in that strong 6% operating leverage.\nOf the $28.2 billion in total revenue, an aggregated amount of $11.3 billion came from our Sales & Trading, Investment banking and asset management fees, 3 of our more highly compensable market-facing areas. So those areas grew 15% year-over-year in the aggregate and we're excited to continue our investments given their strategic importance and attractive returns.\nWhen coupled with investment spending and inflation, this revenue growth helps frame the 5% expense growth even better. Importantly, expense growth versus the second quarter was held under 1%, while those same compensable revenue streams grew 8% sequentially, further reinforcing our ability to scale efficiently and invest where it matters most.\nSecond, provision expense improved this quarter with net charge-offs declining 10%, and we had a modest reserve release as a result of both credit card and commercial real estate improvement. The strong asset quality reflects the continued strength of our credit portfolio, years of disciplined risk management and higher growth of the portfolio than other banks with good credit results.\nLastly, our average diluted share count declined by 24 million shares from the second quarter. And this quarter included the dilution we've highlighted before in our filings and that comes from our 2008 issued convertible preferred Series L stock. On Slide 4, you'll note the various earnings highlights Brian and I have talked about. I don't have much to add here and would instead spend just a moment on our continued organic growth, which is powering our loan and deposit activity.\nWe added new clients, and we deepened relationships with existing clients and across consumer, wealth, commercial and institutional businesses, our teams are winning in the marketplace by putting our clients first. As always, we highlight the continued organic growth across each of our businesses driven by client engagement, disciplined execution and strategic investment. And you can see the results there on Slide 5.\nConsumer Banking continued to show strong momentum. We grew another 212,000 net new checking accounts, extending our string of consecutive growth to 27 quarters. This includes the fourth consecutive quarter of increased average noninterest-bearing deposits. And those are important because they are the primary operating account for a relationship and they're quite beneficial as a low-cost funding source.\nAdditionally, card, home and auto loan balances grew year-over-year, reflecting healthy consumer demand. and we believe those further cement the relationship beyond just the operating account alone. In small business, we continued our strength of lending growth and we remain the #1 leading provider of credit to small business in the United States.\nGlobal Wealth and Investment Management saw client balances climbed to more than $4.6 trillion driven by strong AUM flows of $84 billion in the past year, strong loan originations and market appreciation. Our advisers continue to deliver comprehensive solutions to help clients achieve their financial goals.\nIn Global Banking, we saw a nice pickup in client activity in investment banking, resulting in market share gains, leadership rankings across many products and the highest non-pandemic fee quarter in our firm's history. Commercial client activity showed a continuation in the demand for loans and cash management needs as treasury service fees increased 12% year-over-year alongside deposit growth of 15%.\nGlobal markets continued to deliver on their string of year-over-year revenue growth and also continue to grow loans from healthy demand of our clients. Let's transfer to a discussion of the balance sheet using Slide 6, where you can see total assets ended the quarter at $3.4 trillion. That's down $38 billion from the second quarter as good loan growth was offset by lower Global Markets assets and wholesale funding reductions as part of our plan to continue to tighten the balance sheet.\nImportantly, this balance sheet tightening will continue to benefit the net interest yield, I Deposits ended just over $2 trillion and were up $72 million from the year ago period, with growth in both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits. Average global liquidity sources of $961 billion remains strong, and shareholders' equity of $304 billion was up $4.6 billion from last quarter as we issued $2.5 billion of preferred stock.\nOtherwise, a $2 billion increase in tangible common equity to $208 billion included a modest capital build as net income was slightly more than capital distributions, and we saw some improvement in AOCI. We returned $7.4 billion of capital back to shareholders with $2.1 billion in common dividends paid and $5.3 billion of shares repurchased. Tangible book value per share of $28.39 in rose 8% from the third quarter of '24.\nLooking at regulatory capital, our CET1 level increased modestly to $203 billion, while the risk-weighted assets were relatively flat and that drove our CET1 ratio higher to 11.6%. This is well above our October 1, 10% regulatory minimum. Our supplemental leverage ratio was 5.8% versus a minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves capacity for balance sheet growth and our $473 billion of total loss absorbing capital means our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements.\nOn Slide 7, we show a 10-quarter trend of average deposits to illustrate the extension of consecutive growth across those periods. Average deposits were up $71 million or 3.7% from the third quarter of '24. Average consumer deposits were up 1% year-over-year, while Global Banking deposits grew 15% compared to a year ago. Our global capabilities, digital solutions and relationship managers continue to win clients in the marketplace. In addition, we remain disciplined on pricing to achieve that growth.\nOverall rate paid on total deposits declined 32 basis points year-over-year, reflecting both lower rates and disciplined actions in our Global Banking and Wealth Management businesses. Rate paid on the roughly $950 billion of consumer deposits remained low at 58 basis points in Q3, driven by the operating nature of that account and client base.\nCompared to the second quarter, total deposit rate paid rose 2 basis points due to mix shift into interest-bearing, and we expect improvement next quarter driven by repricing after the Fed funds rate cut in late September. Let's turn to loans by looking at average balances on Slide 8. You can see loan balances in Q3 of $1.15 trillion improved 9% year-over-year driven by 13% commercial loan growth. Consumer loans grew at a slower pace and importantly, we're up across every loan type.\nFor the second consecutive quarter, every business segment recorded higher average loans on both a year-over-year basis and on a linked-quarter basis. Focusing on commercial loans in global markets, we continue to take advantage of the strong financing demand in the marketplace from institutional borrowers, where we lend against diverse collateral pools. Small business is benefiting from our newly combined local market-based coverage model for small business and business banking, and that's creating more capacity for client expansion.\nAnd lastly, note the 9% improvement in Wealth Management as affluent clients borrowed for investments in assets like sports and arts and businesses. So all of that balance sheet activity across deposits and loans results in net interest income. And let's turn our focus to NII on Slide #9. On a GAAP non-fully taxable equivalent basis, NII in Q3 was $15.2 billion.\nOn a fully taxable equivalent basis, NII was a little less than $15.4 billion and as I said earlier, that's up 9% from the third quarter of '24. NII grew $1.3 billion year-over-year and $572 million on an FTE basis over the second quarter driven by higher loan and deposit balances and benefits from fixed rate asset repricing. And versus Q2, we also gained an extra day of interest.\nThe net interest yield improved 7 basis points from the second quarter, reflecting the growth in NII, while the earning asset balance modestly declined as loan growth replaced lower-yielding securities and Global Markets balances declined modestly. And as I said, we reduced expensive wholesale funding and cash.\nRegarding interest rate sensitivity, on a dynamic deposit basis, we provide a 12-month change in NII for an instantaneous shift in the curve. So again, that means interest rates would have to instantaneously move another 100 basis points lower than the expected cuts that are already contemplated in the curve. So if you think about that, 100 basis points below what the curve implies more simply put, that would mean, for instance, on the short end, the July Fed funds rate next year will be getting down to 2.25%.\nSo on that basis, a 100 basis point decline would decrease NII over the next 12 months by $2.2 billion. And if rates went up 100 basis points, NII would benefit approximately $1 billion. With regard to a forward view of NII, let me give you a few thoughts. In January and again in April, we provided our expectation that we could exit Q4 of 2025 and with NII on a fully taxable equivalent basin on range of $15.5 million to $15.7 billion.\nWe also noted our expectation for that growth to accelerate in the second half of 2025. Despite all the uncertainties we've experienced around tariffs and rates, we've seen good performance against our expectations. And even with the third quarter late quarter interest rate cut, and with the curve anticipating 2 more cuts in October and December, we believe fourth quarter NII will be in the higher end of that range of expectations.\nSo think of that as being $15.6 billion plus on a fully taxable equivalent basis. And that would represent approximately 8% growth from the fourth quarter of '24. Thinking a bit more generally, we just note for the full year of 2026, our expectations about the drivers of growth are largely aligned with 2025 performance. We expect good core NII performance driven by core loan and deposit growth a little bit above GDP, which will additionally benefit from sizable fixed rate asset repricing.\nAnd in 2026, we expect to see roughly $10 billion to $15 billion in combined quarterly mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans. Those will roll off, and they'll be replaced with new assets at 150 to 200 basis points higher yield. That should result in full year NII growth somewhat similar to 2025 performance over 2024. So think of that as something like 5% to 7% growth.\nOkay. Let's turn to expense, and we'll use Slide 10 for the discussion. First, I just want to highlight the strong operating leverage, which we expect again in Q4. We reported $17.3 billion in expense this quarter and that was up modestly compared to the second quarter and up 5% year-over-year.\nAs I noted earlier, the year-over-year increase was primarily driven by incentives tied to growth, especially in our market-facing businesses, as well as ongoing investments across the enterprise. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect expenses to remain roughly in line with Q3. As you know, head count is the key driver of expense from compensation and benefits to occupancy costs and technology.\nAnd we manage this closely not just in total numbers, but also an organizational structure, ensuring we're striking the right balance of managers and teams. And the good news is we continue to manage headcount well. So looking at the past 3 years, we've been able to lower our headcount from a peak of 217,000 to 213,000 now. And more recently, since the third quarter of last year, we're down 500, which includes the addition last quarter of nearly 2,000-plus college grads, and it's this disciplined approach that supports both efficiency and growth. So let's now move to credit and turn to Slide 11. And you can see asset quality remains sound with improvements in several key indicators.\nNet charge-offs were $1.4 billion, down about 10% from the second quarter, with the improvement split pretty evenly between credit card and commercial real estate. The total net charge-off ratio this quarter was 47 basis points, down 8 basis points from Q2. Q3 provision expense was $1.3 billion and mostly matched net charge-offs.\nWe had a modest reserve release associated with improved outlooks for both credit card and commercial real estate. Focusing on total net charge-offs again and looking forward, in the near term, we would not expect much change in total net charge-offs given the steady consumer delinquency trends, stability of C&I and reductions in CRE exposures.\nOn Slide 12, in addition to the improvement in consumer losses, note the reductions in both reservable criticized and nonperforming loan metrics. commercial portfolios. Nonperforming loans are down 19% from Q2 and reservable criticized exposure in commercial real estate is now down nearly 25% from the third quarter of '24 as we dealt with the more problematic exposures across the year.\nLet's turn to the performance across our lines of business, beginning with Consumer Banking on Slide 13. Consumer Banking delivered strong results, generating $11.2 billion in revenue, up 7% year-over-year and $3.4 billion in net income or 28% growth.\nReturn on allocated capital rose to 31% -- these results reflect the value of our deposit franchise, underscoring both the breadth of our platform and the success of our organic growth strategy and digital banking capabilities. Innovations such as family banking, our high-value cashback credit cards and our industry-leading preferred rewards program are delivering differentiated value to clients and value we believe is unmatched elsewhere.\nThis client value proposition, combined with disciplined pricing helped drive a 9% year-over-year increase in net interest income. Another strong highlight this quarter was expense management, which enabled us to deliver more than 600 basis points of operating leverage. Continued innovation and the deployment of advanced technology and tools helped us to hold expense growth to just 1% year-over-year, while revenue grew significantly. As a result, our efficiency ratio improved, falling below 50% for the quarter.\nWe continue to invest in high tech, which drove higher digital engagement, and we continue to invest in high touch. We continued our march into new markets, filled out more of previously expanded markets and supported our brand in those communities. As an example, we just opened 4 new financial centers in Idaho over the past 6 months, expanding our presence and complementing our existing Merrill team in the local market to better serve clients in that region.\nConsumer investment balances grew 17% to $580 billion, supported by market appreciation and $19 billion in full year client flows. Third quarter average balance per new account of $110,000 is up 6% from last year. And the investment platform serves as a great catch basin for first-time investors and for more affluent investors looking to manage some element of their own money.\nAs mentioned earlier, consumer net charge-offs improved on a linked-quarter basis following a decline in delinquencies. The largest component of consumer losses is credit card, and our loss rate decreased from 3.82% to 3.4% linked quarter. This contributed to an improved risk-adjusted margin on credit card approaching 7.5%. Finally, as shown on appendix Slide 20, strong digital adoption and Erica engagement continues and customer experience scores remain elevated, reflecting the impact of our ongoing investments in digital capabilities.\nTurning to Wealth Management on Slide 14. The business delivered a strong quarter, marked by improved profitability. Net income grew 19% year-over-year to nearly $1.3 billion, driven by new household growth, strong AUM flows, loan growth and disciplined expense management that produced meaningful operating leverage and a 26% return on allocated capital.\nWe achieved 300 basis points of operating leverage, which contributed to a 27% pretax margin, an improvement of over 200 basis points. Together, Merrill and the Private Bank managed $4.6 trillion in client balances and continue to generate organic growth with $84 billion in AUM flows over the past year. This reflects a healthy mix of new client assets and existing clients putting more capital to work.\nDuring this past quarter, Merrill and the Private Bank added 5,400 net new relationships with the average size of new relationships continuing to grow across both businesses. And importantly, we're not just adding relationships, we're deepening the ones we enjoy already. And reflecting the strength of our integrated model and our product offering, the percentage of clients with banking products continue to rise, and it's now at 63%.\nIn the third quarter, GWIM reported record revenue of $6.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year, led by a 12% increase in asset management fees. Loan growth remained strong, and we saw a notable pickup in custom lending with both volume and loan size increasing, and that drove a 9% year-over-year increase in average loans. Finally, I'd highlight the continued digital momentum as shown on Slide 22. New accounts are increasingly being opened digitally, underscoring the effectiveness of our digital investments and the evolving preferences of our clients.\nOn Slide 15, you see the results for Global Banking, which benefited from improved investment banking activity, significant deposit growth and solid loan performance. In Q3, Global Banking delivered net income of $2.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year, supported by 500 basis points of operating leverage and a 17% return on allocated capital.\nThe standout driver of performance was a 43% year-over-year increase in firm-wide investment banking fees, which fueled 7% overall revenue growth. Firm-wide investment banking fees rose across the solution set. Advisory was up 51% debt underwriting increased 42% and equity underwriting grew 34%. We maintained our #3 position year-to-date, and we also gained market share during the quarter.\nNotably, we participated in several of the industry's largest transactions, a clear testament to the value clients place on our financial advice and solutions. Noninterest expense grew compared to last year as we continue to invest in the future. And average deposits grew 15% year-over-year, contributing to a 6% increase in global transaction services revenue. And importantly, disciplined pricing, coupled with lower rates led to a 47 basis point decline in rate paid compared to a year ago.\nSwitching to Global Markets on Slide 16. I'll focus my comments on results, excluding DVA, as we typically do. As Brian mentioned, we extended our streak of strong revenue and earnings performance and once again achieved a solid 13% return on allocated capital. In the third quarter, Global Markets generated net income of $1.6 billion, up modestly year-over-year and consistent with the prior quarter. Revenue, excluding DVA, grew 10% year-over-year, driven by strong sales and trading performance and the benefit of higher investment banking revenue shared with Global Banking. Focusing on Sales & Trading, revenue ex DVA rose 8% year-over-year to $5.3 billion.\nFICC revenue grew 5%, driven by improved performance in credit products. Equities trading led the improvement with 14% revenue growth, supported by increased financing activity in Asia. Expense growth year-over-year reflects both the revenue increase and higher trading-related costs in certain Asian markets, and those costs are passed through to clients and therefore, appear in both the revenue line and the expense line.\nAs noted earlier, we continue to benefit from lending opportunities tied to highly collateralized pools of high-quality assets and clients value our expertise and the liquidity we provide in delivering these solutions. On Slide 17, all other shows a loss of $6 million in the third quarter with very little to talk about here.\nOur third quarter effective tax rate was 10.4%. And excluding the tax credits related to investments in renewable energy and affordable housing and a small number -- a small amount of discrete items, the effective tax rate would have been much closer to a normal corporate tax rate at approximately 23%. So thank you. And with that, we'll jump into the Q&A.",

Thank you for joining us. To review the second quarter results, our earnings release documents are available on the investor relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. Those documents include the earnings presentation that we'll make reference to during the call Brian Moynihan, our CEO, will make some opening comments before he turns the call over to Alastair Borthwick, our CFO to discuss more of the details. Let me just remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call.\nForward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause our actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and the SEC filings available on the website. Information about our non-GAAP financial measures. Including reconciliations to US GAAP can also be found in our earnings materials available on our website. With that, Brian, I'll turn the call over to you.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, and thank all of you for joining us for our Q2 2025 earnings results. First, a couple words on environment. We continue to see solid consumer spending data. You can see on our page 21 of the deck improving credit quality. Alastair talked about from already strong statistics, plenty of household net worth growth in the market growth, and also the account balances again staying strong above where they were pre-pandemic. We see solid commercial loan growth, and we see good credit quality with the exception of CRE in office, which we'll talk about. We also see our clients continue to see clarity with the changes in trade and tariffs, and now with the tax bill passing, we can see them start to understand the future and expect them behave accordingly.\nWe saw improving market conditions during the quarter, and that leads our worldwide leading research team to continue to predict no recession, modestly growing economy about 1½% at the end of the year, and continued no Fed rate cuts till next year. So with that backdrop, we talk about our second quarter key points on the second quarter as follows. We produced another solid quarter of revenue growth, earnings, and returns. Second point is these earnings are driven by strong organic growth across all the businesses. The third is we continue to drive technology innovation both on the product side that we offer our customers, but also on the operational excellence side.\nWe're continuing to see the benefits of our long-term investment in technology capabilities, digitization, machine learning, and now we're starting to see the beginnings of the AI practices that we develop pay off, and we're looking forward to much more. On slide two we start the earnings discussion this morning. We reported revenue of $26.6 billion on an FTE basis, net income of $7.1 billion after tax, and earnings per share of $0.89. For the second quarter on a year-over-year basis we grew revenue 4% and grew earnings per share 7%. We produced a return on assets of 83 basis points and return on tangible common equity of 13.4%. In the second quarter we produced $14.8 billion in NII, a record for the company growing 7% from the second quarter in 2024.\nThis represents the fourth quarter of NII growth in line with the guidance we've been giving you, supporting that average deposits have now grown for eight consecutive quarters, and we have achieved this while maintaining very disciplined deposit pricing. That's great work by our teams. Markets-related revenue gained momentum throughout the quarter. We recorded our 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and trading growth. Jim DeMare and the team continue to do a good job there. Revenue was up 15% over the prior year quarter. We also produced more than $1.4 billion in firm-wide investment banking fees, and the better quarterly results improved as each month of the quarter progressed.\nWe reported expenses below $17.2 billion this quarter, $600 million lower than Q1 2025. In line with the expectations we gave you. We reported our sixth consecutive quarter of net charge offs at around the $1.5 billion level. This is a little bit of a tale of two cities. Consumer net charge offs were lower, offsetting that we had elevated commercial real estate office charge offs. We resolved a number of credits in this quarter. In the second quarter, when those credits close in the third quarter, you'll see the reduction in NPLs related there too. The good news is that most of those second quarter charge offs were previously reserved, so it had a modest impact on our profitability for the quarter.\nWe provided capital support of our customers and clients to help them grow. For example, we delivered strong commercial loan growth. As you can see, we also provided more balance sheet to our institutional clients for their financing needs. At the same time, we also increased the capital return to our shareholders. In the second quarter we repurchased $5.3 billion in shares and paid $2 billion in dividends. In the first half of 2025, we have returned $13.7 billion in total capital, 40% higher than first half of 2024. Tangible Book Value per share continued to grow this quarter.\nLet's move our discussion to organic growth. You can see that on slide 3. We added new clients and deepened relationships with our existing clients. That was across all our businesses, consumer, wealth, commercial, and our markets business. Our teams are winning in the marketplace by putting the client first.\nFor example, in consumer banking, we continue to grow primary checking accounts. We grew average consumer deposits for a third consecutive quarter. Balances are up year-over-year for the first time since 2022, putting the effects of the pandemic surges behind us. This quarter we crossed a milestone of $5 million net new checking accounts over the last six years. We saw increases in the average consumer checking account balance of our clients for two consecutive quarters. And now the average balance per account is over $9,200 and 92% of the primary checking account in the household.\nOn the investment side, our clients carry an average funded balance of more than $130,000 strong when compared to the industry. Our home and auto originations grew on a year-over-year basis this quarter.\nWe continue to be a leading supplier of credit to small businesses, helping the core segment economy grow. Loans were once again up year-over-year, reflecting the commitment to add more bankers in the markets that we serve across the United States. In Merrill, client balances reached $4.4 trillion. We saw strong AUM flows, loan demand, and market appreciation. Our advisors continue to deliver comprehensive banking solutions to help our clients achieve their goals. In our global banking business, client activity remains solid.\nCommercial clients are actively using their credit facilities, albeit at still a lower level than they used them as a percentage prior to pandemic, and our risk management approach remains very disciplined. We added more than 1,000 net new clients, most of them driven by our payments capabilities.\nGlobal markets continue to perform well with a record second quarter level of sales and trading revenue. Institutional clients sought funding of their warehouse of loans and other needs at increased pace for high quality collateral. Organic growth means that we're also investing in our own capabilities, our people, and our technology to serve our clients more effectively. Those investments have led to continued expansion in digitalization and engagement across all our lines of business. Nearly 80% of our consumer households are now fully digitally engaged and they benefit from our award winning platforms. Just to give you a sense of the volumes in the second quarter alone, 4 billion logins were made by our consumer. In the second quarter, 65% of our consumer product sales were digital. You can see all these trends in our disclosures on slides 24, 26, and 28 in the appendix.\nI commend you to review them to see how the technology application can be scaled and applied across the businesses. We also continue to invest in our teammates and are moving more money into the AI side and machine learning side. And as we think about the quarters ahead and the operating leverage returning in the company due to the NII growth, it's key to note we have fully absorbed the cost of the last several years of inflation and wages. Inflation, wages, and other third-party provided services 15 years ago to make it an understanding how much an impact technology's had. Fifteen years ago the company had a headcount of 300,000. Today we have 212,000. We did that with a relentless application of scalable, secure, resilient technologies. Customer behavior also changed and matched it.\nDigitization, simplification of products, machine learning, models, and process improvements helped us get there. Now we have a chance to capture the value that, with the new enhanced capabilities of AI and machine learning, artificial intelligence allows us to change the work across many more areas of our company effective than prior tools allowed us. We have deep scaling experience in AI capabilities with Erica. Our AI assistant is the most recognized aspect of that. As you can see on slide 4, we think about the way we apply artificial intelligence and augmented intelligence in four different pillars: AI agents, search and summarization, content generation, and, importantly, coding and automated processes.\nFirst off, as an example, is our virtual assistant Erica. This is a model we introduced back in 2018 and developed prior to that. It was the first true banking industry virtual agent.\nIt averages over 58 million interactions per month today, helping to make it easier for clients to bank how they want and where they want. We also leveraged Erica capabilities for use of our commercial clients in CashPro and as well as with our employees in Erica. For Employees, to give you a sense, 90% of our more than 210,000 teammates have now utilized Erica for Employees to complete such tasks as password updates, equipment refreshes, etc... In wealth management and our other relationship manager banking businesses, AI is helping those relationship managers and advisors search and summarize information, preparing them to deliver personalized planning and personalized pitches to clients for their business and help with their advice copilots, help them organize the prospecting process, and all this is implemented in going through the system. In our operations group, AI tools help improve our process around customer satisfaction.\nOne chat-based AI product works between markets and operations, allows us to have 750 people engage with AI agents to allow them reconcile trades, which has saved many FTE already. In addition, as you can see, we have 17,000 programmers using AI coding technology today, saving 10% to 15% in code generation costs, and we expect that to continue to rise. Overall, we have 1,400 AI patents and have created over 250 AI and machine learning models in the company. We're currently working through many dozens of our AI proof of concepts beyond what I just spoke about. These investments are intended to help both improve the client experience and our own productivity. So if you think about the quarter before I turn it over to Alastair, just a few points.\nWe saw good organic client activity. We enjoyed good growth in revenue and earnings per share. We continue to invest in that growth and are beginning to see the impacts of AI again aiding our efficiency. We managed risk well, that drove healthy returns, and we kept delivering more capital back to you as our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Alastair.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nAll right, well thank you Brian. I'm going to skip slide 5 of the earnings presentation since Brian covered most of that already, and I just want to provide a little more context on the highlights of the quarter starting on slide 6, where you can see revenue of $26.6 billion on an FTE basis grew more than 4% from second quarter last year. Now we saw the year-over-year revenue growth in several areas. NII grew 7% and represented 55% of total revenue. Investment and brokerage fees rose 11%, with both assets under management flows and market levels contributing nicely to the growth. This quarter's $5.4 billion of sales and trading revenue grew 15% from the year ago period. Service charges grew 7% with particular strength in Global Payment Solutions, and card income improved 4%.\nAnd while investment banking was down 9% from Q2 2024, momentum built across the quarter with a good pipeline. Non-interest expense was a little less than $17.2 billion and down nearly $600 million from Q1, driven by the absence of Q1 seasonal elevation in payroll taxes. Provision expense for the quarter was $1.6 billion, with asset quality remaining in great shape, and we reduced our outstanding shares by almost 4% from the second quarter of last year. So together these things resulted in earnings per share improving 7% year-over-year. Let's transfer to a discussion of the balance sheet using slide 7, and here total assets ended the quarter at $3.44 trillion. That is up $92 billion from Q1, driven by strong loan growth and a higher level of client activity in global markets.\nDeposits were up $22 billion on an end-of-period basis from Q1 and up a little more than $100 billion from the year-ago period. Deposits reflect the seasonal headwind from income tax payments and saw inflows that more than offset the tax payment activity. Average global liquidity sources of $938 billion remain strong. Shareholders' equity at $300 billion was up $4 billion from last year as we issued $3 billion of preferred stock this quarter to replace redemptions from last quarter, and we saw modest improvement in AOCI. Otherwise, net income was offset by distributions of capital to shareholders. We returned $7.3 billion of capital back to shareholders with $2 billion in common dividends paid, and $5.3 billion of shares repurchased.\nWith regard to dividends, as we noted in our 1 July press release following the CCAR results, we announced our plan to increase our common quarterly dividend by 8% starting in September pending board approval. We were pleased to see our stressed capital buffer requirement move lower in the results, and it was good to see some of the industry comments about the annual exam coming through. The new proposals. Tangible book value per share of $27.71 rose 9% from a year ago, and looking at regulatory capital, our CET1 level remains stable at $201 billion and the ratio is 11.5%. That's down 26 basis points and remains well above our regulatory minimum today, which will move lower upon finalization of the new stress capital buffer from CCAR as well as the newly proposed rules.\nNow our calculated stress capital buffer and related CET1 ratio from CCAR is 10% and that takes effect on 1 October. Through the newly proposed rules, which include two-year averaging of CET1 depletion, our CET1 ratio would be 10.2% and would be effective on 1 January 2026. Either way we have a lot of flexibility. Our supplemental leverage ratio was 5.7% versus a minimum requirement of 5% and that leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth, and we have $473 billion of total loss absorbing capital, which means our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements.\nOn slide 8, we show a nine-quarter trend of average deposits to illustrate the growth across those periods. Deposits are now 9% higher than their bottom in May of 2023, and that momentum continued as we averaged $2 trillion for the first week of July. Typically, we see downward pressure on deposits as we move from Q1 to Q2 as clients pay their income taxes, and this year we had enough growth to more than offset those tax payments. Average consumer deposits rose $4 billion from Q1, concentrated in noninterest-bearing. We also saw significant growth in global banking deposits, $28 billion or 5% from Q1, and this included some shorter-term deposits from deal-related activity, and that allowed us to outpace the tax payment-related declines in our wealth business as well as corporate CD placements that matured with our institutional clients.\nIn addition, we remained disciplined on pricing to achieve that growth. Overall, rate paid on total deposits declined 3 basis points, led by a 3 basis point decline in consumer, and the rate paid on $952 billion of consumer deposits was 58 basis points in the second quarter. Let's turn to loans by looking at the average balances on Slide 9. Loans in the second quarter of $1.13 trillion improved 7% year-over-year, driven by 10% commercial loan growth. Every business segment recorded higher average loans on both a year-over-year basis and a linked quarter basis. Drilling down on commercial loans, we saw linked quarter growth in every segment of the commercial lending spectrum.\nSmall business and business banking both grew, and we recently combined the coverage model here to provide more calling capacity for our bankers in middle market lending.\nWe saw a nice increase in revolver utilization during the quarter as clients navigated the current environment, and in GCIB we had a little more demand from our larger corporate clients. In global markets, we've been able to take advantage of strong financing demand in the marketplace from institutional borrowers where we lend against diversified collateral pools. Now, the largest growth areas year-over-year have been in asset-based securitization, in credit, and in ABS. We're providing financing solutions for corporate and asset manager clients, collateralized by loan, lease, or other receivables portfolios. In credit, we provide term and warehouse financing collateralized by diversified pools of corporate loans for private credit and asset manager clients.\nWe feel very good about the lending and we feel good about the growth opportunity in these areas, and our expertise has enabled us to participate in a number of attractive deals. Let's turn our focus to NII performance in slide 10. On a GAAP non FTE basis, NII in Q2 was $14.7 billion. On a fully taxable equivalent basis, NII was $14.8 billion. As I said earlier, that's up 7% from the second quarter. NII grew $227 million on a fully taxable equivalent basis over Q1 driven by higher loan and deposit balances, one additional day of interest, and fixed rate asset repricing. Lower loan yields from lower foreign interest rates partially offset those positive contributors.\nThe net interest yield or NIY declined 5 basis points, reflecting a roughly $80 billion increase in earning assets driven by global markets activity. Loans and trading assets generated in global markets contribute solid net interest income, but at a lower relative yield to the overall company net interest yield. Additionally, some of the deal-related commercial deposit growth with relationship clients was net interest income accretive, and modestly net interest yield dilutive. My point here is that net interest income growth continues to be the focus, with net interest yield being an output with regard to interest rate sensitivity. On a dynamic deposit basis, we provide a 12-month change in net interest income for an instantaneous shift in the curve, and that means interest rates would have to move instantly another hundred basis points lower than the expected cuts contemplated in the current curve.\nOn that basis, a 100 basis point decline would decrease NII over the next 12 months by $2.3 billion. If rates went up by 100 basis points, net interest income would benefit roughly $1 billion.\nWhen we turn to a forward view of NII, let's turn to Slide 11, and there remains a good amount of uncertainty from the impacts related to announced tariffs and the potential for continued uncertainty. We've also seen volatility in expectations of future interest rate cuts. So let us give you a few thoughts about the rest of 2025. In January and again in April, we provided our expectations that we could exit the fourth quarter of 2025 with net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis in a range of $15.5 to $15.7 billion. We also noted our expectation that that growth would accelerate in the second half of 2025. Our expectation for the exit rate of NII in the fourth quarter remains unchanged, and the drivers of the improvement remain largely the same as those we've discussed.\nWe will pick up one additional day of interest. Additionally, the fixed rate asset repricing of assets and cash flow swaps is expected to provide the biggest near-term benefits to our NII, and that takes into account the impact of the current interest rate curve. Loan and deposit activity is anticipated to also aid second half NII growth. Lastly, global markets business is also expected to benefit NII a touch from lower rates as we move through the year. Bottom line is our range of NII expectation for the Q4 of this year remains unchanged at $15.5 to $15.7 billion, and that would result in record NII and a full year NII improvement of 6% to 7%.\nOkay, let's turn to expense and use Slide 12 for the discussion. There we reported a little less than $17.2 billion in expense this quarter, and this reflects a nearly $600 million decline from Q1 driven by the absence of seasonal elevation from payroll tax expense and modestly lower litigation costs. Expense compared to the second quarter of last year is up a little more than 5%. That increase reflects an aggregated 9% improvement in wealth management fees, higher sales and trading revenue, and investment banking fees. It also reflects the impact of ongoing inflationary costs and continued investments in people and technology. Inflation is evident across our employee costs of health care and hardware and leased space among many other areas.\nOn the people side, we continue to be an employer of choice with a strong 92% retention rate among our employees, and this quarter we welcomed more than 1,700 interns and our headcount, excluding those summer additions, has fallen 1,500 from the beginning of the year, proving that we continue to manage our headcount effectively and the associated expense. Next quarter we'll bring on more than 2,000 campus graduates to begin their careers and as we move through the back half of the year, we believe expenses will flatten out here and potentially move a touch lower if we see seasonally lower market-related costs. That, coupled with the expectation of improved NII is anticipated to provide operating leverage in the second half of the year and an improved efficiency ratio.\nLet's move to credit. We'll turn to slide 13, where you can see that asset quality remains sound. Net charge offs were $1.5 billion, up modestly compared to Q1, and that's the sixth consecutive quarter that net charge offs have hovered around $1.5 billion. The total net charge off ratio this quarter was 55 basis points, up a basis point from the first quarter. Q2 provision expense was $1.6 billion and mostly matched the net charge offs. Modest reserve builds in some areas, primarily for loan growth, were mostly offset by releases associated with lower office exposures, and mainly from sales. Consumer net charge offs were $1.1 billion down modestly linked quarter and consistent with the past few quarters, 90% of our consumer net charge offs are driven by credit card, and that highlights the importance of prudence in the underwriting growth of that portfolio.\nIt's worth noting the net loss rate on credit card debt declined year-over-year for the first time this quarter since early 2016 outside of the pandemic period. On the commercial side, we saw losses of $466 million. That's up from Q1, driven primarily by office exposures and their associated sales. As I noted earlier, the net charge off ratio for total commercial loans remained low at 29 basis points this quarter. Importantly, our C&I book, Commercial and Industrial, so that excludes the small business and CRE loans. That commercial and industrial loan book is $564 billion and the loss on this book was 9 basis points this quarter. It's averaged 8 basis points from 2013 until now.\nFocusing on total net charge offs again and looking forward in the near term, we would not expect much change in the total net charge off ratio given the steadiness of consumer delinquencies, stability of C&I, and the reductions in our CRE office exposures. On Slide 14, in addition to the lower consumer delinquency statistics, note the modest changes in other stats for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Okay, let's move to the various lines of business and some brief comments on their results. Starting on Slide 15 with Consumer Banking, Consumer delivered strong results with $10.8 billion in revenue that grew 6% year-over-year and $3 billion in net income that grew 15%.\nResults were driven by the increasing value of our low-cost deposit franchise, innovation in deposit products like Family Banking and new higher-value cashback credit cards, coupled with our industry-leading Preferred Rewards program, deliver total value for clients, which we believe they don't get elsewhere. This value recognition and disciplined pricing also drove a 7% improvement in NII. While the revenue growth was led by the NII improvement, it also included solid fee performance in card income, and service charges, and through good expense management we drove 400 basis points of operating leverage in the business as expense growth year-over-year rose only 2% compared to the 6% revenue growth. The efficiency ratio improved more than 200 basis points in the last 12 months to 51% in the quarter.\nInvestment balances grew 13% to $540 billion with market improvement and full-year flows of $19 billion. As I noted earlier, consumer net charge offs improved linked quarter following the move lower in delinquencies, the loss on credit card fell 23 basis points to 3.82%, and delinquencies declined for the second consecutive quarter. Finally, as you can see in the appendix on slide 24, digital adoption and engagement continue to improve, and customer experience scores rose to record levels, illustrating clients' appreciation of enhanced capabilities from our investments.\nMoving to wealth management on slide 16, the business delivered another solid quarter where we added new households, deepened existing relationships, and saw strong client flows. The business generated net income of $1 billion on strong loan growth and solid AUM flows. We saw a modest decline in net income as solid revenue growth was more than offset by higher revenue-related costs and continued investments to build the business. Merrill and the private bank now manage nearly $4.4 trillion in client balances and continue to see organic growth that produces strong AUM flows of $82 billion in the past year contributing nearly 5% growth in AUM balances. And that all reflects a good mix of new client money as well as existing clients putting money to work.\nDuring the quarter, between Merrill and the private bank, we added 7,100 net new relationships, and in both businesses, the size of the relationships added continued to expand. We also continued to add financial advisors to the sales force in Merrill and the private bank. Through our extensive training program and experienced.\nHiring of advisors, approximately 1/3 of net new households in Q2 were added by our newly trained advisors. We're not only growing relationships but we're also deepening as the number of clients that are banking products with us grew to nearly 63%. While this is primarily a fee-based advice-driven model, about 30% of our revenue is now net interest income derived from GWIM clients and the large loan and deposit balances. On us in Q2 we reported revenue of $5.9 billion growing nearly 7% over the prior year, led by that 9% growth in asset management fees. Expense growth of 9% supported both the cost of the increase in revenue-related incentives as well as investment in technology, and cost of hiring to add experienced advisors to the platform.\nIn Merrill and the private bank, average loans were up 7% year-over-year driven by strong growth in custom lending, securities based lending, and a pickup in mortgage lending. We saw solid deposit inflows, and overall deposits declined as a result of the seasonal headwind of income tax payments and some continued movements to other parts of our investment platform in search of higher yield. Our pricing discipline resulted in a three basis points decline in rate paid. We also draw your attention on slide 26 to the continued digital momentum. In this business, new accounts continue to be opened predominantly digitally. Slide 17 shows the global banking results where the prior year rate impacts lowered NII, and this segment has the toughest challenge to make that ground back through growth and pricing. In Q2, global banking generated net income of $1.7 billion.\nBusiness activity was solid in Q2. We already discussed the strong deposit growth, solid loan growth, and investment banking fees that gained momentum through the quarter. While business activity was solid, overall net income fell. NII declined year-over-year from lower rates on the variable loans and higher funding costs for loan growth. Noninterest income included both lower investment banking fees and lower solar and wind investment activity. Noninterest expense to support the business activity grew as we increased investment for the future with more relationship managers across the commercial spectrum, and we invested in technology and marketing.\nFirmwide investment banking fees were $1.4 billion in Q2, down 9% from a year ago, led by a decline in M&A and leveraged finance fees. We still maintained our number three investment banking fee position year to date, switching to global markets.\nOn slide 18, I'll focus my comments on results excluding DVA as I normally do, and as Brian said, we continued our streak of strong revenue and earnings performance, achieved operating leverage, and once again delivered a good return on capital. In Q2, we generated net income of $1.6 billion, which grew 11% year-over-year. Revenue, and again, this is ex-DVA, improved 10% from the second quarter of last year on good sales and trading results while investment banking was lower, focusing on sales and trading. Ex-DVA revenue improved 15% year-over-year to $5.4 billion. Sales and trading built off the momentum of the first quarter. FICC led the way this quarter, growing 19% year-over-year, with rates and foreign exchange trading benefiting from the macro volatility.\nOur equities group had a strong quarter with 10% revenue growth from both trading and financing. Both FICC and equities are benefiting from investments in the international franchise. As we saw increased activity across Europe, Asia, and Latin America year-over-year, expense was up 9% on revenue improvement and continued investments in the business.\nOn slide 19, all other shows a loss of $77 million in Q2, with very little to talk about here. The tax rate ended at 7.4%. It was a little lower than last quarter, driven by $180 million of discrete items. Excluding those $180 million of discrete items and the tax credits related to investments in renewable energy and affordable housing, the effective tax rate would have been much closer to a normal corporate tax rate at approximately 24%. So with that, I'll stop there. Thank you, everyone. With that, we'll open up for Q and A. Please, Chloe.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly at this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star and 1 on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star 2 again; that is, star and 1. We'll take our first question from John McDonald with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nHi, good morning. [crosstalk] Morning, guys. I wanted to ask about retail deposit progress. There's been a lot of talk about different ways o measure retail deposit share. And I know you may take issue with some of the methodologies out there. But Brian, taking a step back, how do you look at and measure the team's progress in growing retail deposit share, and what's your report card, how you've done, and what your ambitions are on that front?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nWell, at the end of the day, if you look at the consumer business with $950 billion in deposits operated very efficiently, the cost of deposits, meaning all the cost over the deposits running under 146 basis points. The total rate paid 58 basis points. 58% of the balances are in checking accounts. You know, it's a tremendous business and we'll only get more and more profitable as the NI kicks in because they're the biggest beneficiary of that. So if you think about it in terms of deposit growth, we look pre-pandemic to now. Our team's gone from $700 billion-odd numbers to $950 billion. We've grown our deposits as a company faster and industry grew from the pre-pandemic to now at 39% versus the industry like 37% and large banks at 32%.\nObviously we contribute to the large bank growth rate, so we feel very good about it. The key is they've grown checking accounts for five years now. They've grown retail deposits, which were influenced a lot because of our mass market customer base being such a big amount by the pandemic stimulus that has all gone through the system. You're seeing the retail, the consumer deposits growth three quarters in a row now. The key is that the average checking account balance is at $9,200. That went into the pandemic about $6,000 to $7,000. You're seeing that grow.\nWe feel good about that. Overall, our average deposit size per branch is $500 million versus the next best at $400 million, and the one behind that at $300 million. I don't know all these methodologies; you guys can look at them. It's a lot of palaver and a lot of debate, but at the end of the day, we're growing deposits fast in the industry, and 92% of core checking, the checking accounts, consumer satisfaction is the highest it's ever been. So we feel very good about it.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay, thanks, Brian. Alastair, wanted to follow up on your expense commentary. Can you elaborate on the outlook for the second half? I think your prior outlook implied some improvement in the second half, and I think you just said you may or may not see that depending on the strength of the markets business.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nWell, I think what we're trying to say is it always starts with us with headcount discipline. So the headcount's been pretty flattish. We've managed that pretty well all the way through the year. We don't see any change in that. So then the only variable that's left really is going to be around revenue related. Now we've seen pretty good growth obviously in sales and trading, up 15% year-over-year. We've seen pretty good growth in AUM fees, up 10%. So I anticipate that any expense growth would be revenue related and that we should be pretty flattish. Maybe we benefit in Q4 from seasonally slower activity.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Autonomous Research\n\nHey, good morning. Hey Alastair, thanks for the update on that trajectory for the second half of the year. I'm just wondering, you know, as we move a step forward, if you can kind of just make sure we're still tracking right on that, the split between the loan securities and swap repricing, and whether, you know, that step up in that bucket is linear in Q3 and Q4 or kind of just builds up as we get towards the end of the year. Thank you.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nI think I would use linear. I think that's probably the easiest way to think about it. We said to everyone that we thought that the second half had a little bit more in the way of fixed rate asset repricing and cash flow swap repricing than the first half of the year. That accounts for the growth being larger in the second half of the year. But it's not different between Q3 and Q4, so it ought to be about the same.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay.\nI think we know that the securities and mortgage loans, but can you kind of just dig us in a little bit on the cash flow hedges and what you're seeing in that? Are you still moving forward with the?\nSame strategy, you know, the off and on and how much you're picking up on those?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYes. So there's no change there at all. That's exactly what we're doing. Just as the old ones roll off with lower coupons, we're replacing them with new ones with higher coupons. No new news there.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Autonomous Research\n\nSo still in that +150 or so range that you said last quarter.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nThat'll be true for some of the cash flow swaps this particular quarter, and it'll change from quarter to quarter. So our NII bridge that you can see takes that into account, and when we update that quarter after quarter, we'll just share that with you at the time.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay, great. Thanks a lot. Alastair.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nMatthew O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. Just want to follow up on the expenses. I guess if you kind of flatline it or flat to just down a little bit, that would put you up, you know, call it 3.5% or so on a full year basis. And I think the prior guide was up 2% to 3% or, you know, the high end of 2% to 3%. Can you just kind of circle back to the cost versus what you were thinking.\nPreviously, and maybe talk about some of the regulatory costs that I think are keeping a little bit higher?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nMatt. So if you look year-over-year, just to give you a simple thing about the expense growth from Q2 last year, Q2 this year, 400 of it was basically incentives in the wealth management business, plus the what we call BC&E that cost it of the markets-based transaction activity, largely markets-based. So that's kind of revenue-related growth which we all cheer for. Growth there because that means the bottom line's growing. If you flip that around, then the rest of the stuff, you know, grew at a really relatively modest growth rate. So if you think about it going forward, out of the orders on AML that were public and stuff, you know, we obviously put 1,000 to 2,000 people to work to clean up a lot of stuff that's now tipping over.\nSo we feel good about that as we move into the second half of the year. And then, frankly, the overall inflation rate and expenses are starting to flatten out, even though you hear a lot of talk about the inflation rate outside in general. But you know, at the end of the day, we've got stability in terms of headcount, in terms of third-party rents, and all that stuff is sort of flattening out. So we feel good about that. And then the idea is then just to bring the headcount down.\nSo if you think about it, over the last 15 years or so, we went from 300,000 people to 212,000 people. We just got to keep working that down. And we've been able to maintain flat headcount across the last four or five years as we've invested heavily in the front end of the business. And you expect us now, with some of these new techniques, frankly make progress a little bit more faster. So we feel good about the expense trajectory, but the key is you're not going to change some of the revenue-related stuff in your. You wouldn't want to. On the other stuff, you control the heck out of it.\n\nMatthew O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, so it does seem like the costs are coming a little bit higher, but I appreciate the kind of higher fees.\nI guess as we think about like more sustainable expense growth. Like I know there's no official guidance for next year, but just kind of talk about, do you get back into that kind of just couple percent growth or? [crosstalk]\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nThat's an outsized sort of market growth or market related activity growth way above what a normal absorption rate would be. We have a model where we can run the place on a couple hundred basis points net of expense growth, which is inflationary cost of 3%, 4%, and then offsetting it by a lot of activity as the NII kicks in.\nEach quarter, we see it go growing, growing, and then growing at a little faster rate. Frankly, as Alastair talked about, that's the operating leverage kicking back in. So we had, you know, five years operating leverage disrupted by the pandemic got back in and then the rates fall off, hurt us obviously from NII as that now hit a record level this quarter and is going to grow off of that record level. You know, you'll see the operating leverage overall kick back in and the size of that revenue stream in all the businesses is huge and the company is obviously huge. And that all pretty much follows the bottom line.\n\nMatthew O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi Brian. Hi Alastair.\nYou guys have had real success in having the digital adoption in your lines of businesses, and you pointed that out in the appendix slides that you referenced.\nDo you think you could ever get the efficiency ratio back down to the pre-pandemic levels of just under 60%, or has the business changed so much since the pandemic that over time 59%, let's call it, may be tough to achieve, not near term, but over time?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nSo Gerard, one of the things that we talked about, I think there's a couple hundred basis points of efficiency ratio difference due to the way the accounting treatment works for the.\nTax incentive clean energy deals, not the housing, because it won't change. But and so those are now changed under the statute, and they run off. But if you look at 2019 and now, 200 basis points of the efficiency ratio is just because we have another income loss, which hurts revenue. It's made up in a tax line. So the bottom line effect is still positive for the company. So that's 200 basis points difference because back then we ran about $300 million a quarter of tax benefit, negative other income due to the tax.\nExempt deals. Now we're running $900, and so you'll see that close out frankly as these deals sunset. Then, on top of that, the NI kicking in just because of the nature of it, and you'll see the consumer business get very, very efficient like it was back then just because it's NI piece basically all follows the bottom line. So we feel very good about that. So yes, we will move back down in low 60s and then potentially crack through it with obviously just the NI lift in the operating leverage lift. But secondly, quite frankly, the tax credit deals will start to run off just due to the change of statute.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat, Brian. As a follow up, just a broader question for you. Obviously there's been a lot of talk about stablecoins. Can you give us your view of where you see the adoption of stablecoins going forward and what that might have in terms of impact on payments, revenues, or deposit trends for Bank of America and possibly the industry?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nYeah. So focusing on stablecoins as a transactional device, if it's a new payment rail. We have trillions of dollars we move for our clients every day. We believe that if they want to use stablecoins to move part of that money, they'll move. So consider them having an account and they can send out money in US Dollars. They can also initiate transaction, have it go into euros, and it could have it go into stablecoins and then transact in that system. So we feel both the industry and ourselves will have, you know, have responses.\nWe've done a lot of work. We're still trying to figure out how big or small it is because some of the places are not big amounts of money movement. So you expect us all to move, you expect our company to move on that.\nYou know, in the end of the day, you know, the debate will be how big an item this will be and how much more an effective payment stream it is. You know, there's places like small balance transfers across border that you can see the case. You can see it with, you know, sort of smart contracts and money movement. You can see it in, you know, digital native apps, in-app payments and stuff. You know, we'll be there just like we were there when we moved from, you know, checks to Zelle. You can see that when the industry puts its mind to it. You know, if you were talking to me six or seven, maybe 10 years, you'd say, you know, this thing called Venmo is coming on and you guys can be left behind. Here we are.\nYou know, our Zelle payments exceed Venmo's total volumes today. And the industries are multiples. It's just because we can move money efficiently, and we have to be aware of the attack on the payment system, and we'll be there to defend it.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nAnd just quickly, Brian, do you think there'd be a consortium like Zelle on stablecoins where the industry defends itself and moves forward, or will the banks go individually?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nI think it'll be all the above. I think in the commercial side there might be applications more individually, but in a broad, you need networks to make this all work. And we will partner with some of the stablecoin. We already have partnerships with some of them. And so it'll be a complex array and hopefully not complex to the customer, frankly.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you for those insights. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nResearch Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, how are you doing?\nI feel like you served up a good meal here. I mean, the main course, we don't lose sight of $2 trillion of deposits where you pay 1.76%, and that's certainly down quarte-over-quarter, year-over-year. The side dishes certainly look good with the NII going to escape velocity, I guess from $14.8, you said, to $15.5 to $15.7 by the end of the year. I'm still left hungry. I guess I need my dessert or something. I'm just wondering why even with all that improved performance, the NII guide isn't even higher. Given the pace of loan growth, you certainly see the expectations.\nAs Alastair said, every segment of commercial lending is doing well. You seem very optimistic about that. You're also asset sensitive and there's less rate cuts. I guess I'm whining for some dessert, some extra. I'm left hungry. Why not more?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America",
    "content2": "Well, Mike, you got a future as a chef.\nLook, I think if you go to the NII Bridge on page 11 for a minute, you know, we put this out at the beginning of the year. There's a lot can happen in a year, and I don't think any of us anticipated all the various things that have happened in the course of the past six months. What's not on here, for example, is you think about international rates. They've been cut pretty significantly. That's a headwind that we don't include here. You're absolutely right.\nThere's some things that we've been really happy with in terms of loan growth. There are some other places which have maybe grown a little less quickly. I'd still love to see the consumer non-interest bearing growing just a little faster. We got some good growth, but we'd love to see a little bit more there.\nI think the balance of all of these various inputs, it all still hangs together six months later. We've removed a lot of risk from the equation, I think, and now we just have to see what happens with rates in the second half of this year. We just have to keep driving the same organic growth that we've been driving when we do that NII growth for the year, 6% to 7%, hopefully a record leaves you satisfied at the end of the year, but we'll be working on next year's course in the second half.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nResearch Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right, when I go for my next meal next year or the year after, any kind of foreshadowing of what you're preliminarily thinking about for next year?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nWell, the only thing I'll say, I mean, we'll talk more about next year when we get into the Q4 discussion three months from now, but I think what we're talking about, which is the organic growth Brian's just talked about driving the deposits and the loans, that should continue. The fixed rate asset repricing we're going to continue to benefit from again next year. We're trying to make sure that we're replicating and sustaining results over a long period of time.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nResearch Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Steven Alexopoulos from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nSteven Alexopoulos\n\nStock Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nMorning.\n\nSteven Alexopoulos\n\nStock Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nTo start. Morning. I want to start the conversation first. I love this AI slide for. I might frame it actually, but to start the conversation there, you know, as we've spoken to the banks, there seems to be a fairly wide range of how banks are thinking about AI. Some are using it really to boost productivity, others are more fully embracing it to leverage digital workers. You seem to be in the second camp. I don't know if you guys saw at the JPM Investor Day where Marianne put that slide up.\nLooking at headcount coming down about 10% or so in the consumer bank over the next five years, wherever that number ends up being. How should we think about your company as you leverage these tools? Should we think about you as leading, fast follower to whatever JPMorgan does? I'd love to hear you unpack this for us.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nWell, let me just walk up to coverage, Steven, but.\nLet's just step back and think about the application technology. Fifteen years ago, we had 100,000 people in our consumer business. Today we have 53,000. The deposits, I think at the time, were, say, $400 billion. Now they're $900 billion plus. The numbers of checking accounts are up 50%, transaction volume through the roof, et cetera, et cetera. All that is enabled by application technology on scale, with control and resiliency.\nWhen you're now doing $2 billion digital interactions, you have to be up all the time. We have invested probably $2 billion on what we call never down hot, hot, hot backup so that those systems can run all the time. You know, you don't have to, we don't have to debate the future. You know, we don't. You just look at what we've done.\nWe're down half the people in this business, and it's bigger, more complex, more widespread, et cetera. That's one. As we look forward, you take something like, take something like Erica, and you know, it was developed when none of us knew what a large language or small language model was. It is built, it's operating, and what I described earlier is it now does 20 million consumers use it every quarter actively. They use it 60 million times a month. This is not again, and every one of those would have been a phone call and stuff. As we bring it out to wider use case, wider things it can do, and train it on, as we bring it across various parts of the company, commercial business with CashPro, Erica, and full employees, etc.., you're seeing these models that are.\nThe data is carefully crafted so it works. They get the right decision, they can train them, and we're using it in more places. We just see that going and going and going. Meanwhile, in that consumer number, we have twice as many relationship bankers as we did at the start. We reinvested part of that savings to drive net checking growth on a consistent basis for five years. If you start to think about $5 million net checking accounts with $9,000 out of balance sheets and start to do some math, you start to think that we've grown a good-sized bank incrementally over the last four or five years. You know, it enables you to do that while the cost structure went down $1 billion a quarter in consumer over the time frame. That's what happens.\nThey take something like this Optimus model, which is a model that we built with others, third party models that we fine tune, an ability for fixed income traders, which is relatively bespoke. Still, we have one common equity. We have 300 CUSIPs for fixed income, to give you an example, just as our company, to allow them to reconcile trades all through using bots and agents between operations itself instead of emails and share drives and everything going on. It's pretty powerful. We're just starting that, 750 people. This is 90 days old for implementation, and we'll see the benefits of that. Five people so far, 10 people. You'll start to see more people, and we'll just stop adding, stop replacing headcount attrition in these areas, or reapply that headcount somewhere else. We think there's a lot to go here now. I think I.\nWe've got to be careful. It's got to be done right. The decisions we make are meaningful to people's lives. It can't be made in a way that's not correct, meaning it comes up with the wrong decision. Yeah, the.\nThe customers are vivacious. I mean, their confidence will come and go if you don't handle them right. We have to be very careful, and that's why it's not a fast follower or a leader. It's can you apply it at scale? That's the question. If you can apply it at scale, then you can get the benefits. If you can't apply it at scale, meaning it isn't always up and operating, then you have problems. That's what we're driving at.\nYou'll figure out in five years whether we were the leader or not the leader. We got the patents, we showed you, we got the model. The question is, are you actually getting the benefits in the scale? We have, and we will, and we expect to continue, yet we're still in the early stages.\n\nSteven Alexopoulos\n\nStock Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay, that's great color for my follow up. Just going back to your response, Brian, to Gerard's question on digital assets. You know, as I study BofA, I think you were the first bank out there with a mobile app. You're the first one out there with Erica, right, the digital agent. It seems like the way you're thinking about stablecoins is your, it's a little wait and see, right? JPM has a tokenized deposit. Citi has a tokenized deposit. I haven't seen any announcement from you guys. You don't have a large cross border business right now relative to others.\nYou could be the disruptor in this new ecosystem, same way you were with mobile, same way you were with Digital Agent. Are you just skeptical on what this could mean long term? Like, why not lean in with this breakthrough technology the same way you have with these others?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nWell, you're forgetting that a lot of if you're going to go to customer facing activity in this area, we had to make sure we had legal clarity. That's still going on as we speak. To be able to apply it, look, the business cases for it as incremental value are.\nStill to be proven, frankly. That's so on bitcoin or on blockchain. We have lots of patents. We've used it in the trade area and stuff where a lot of information's got to move with money and things like that. We still, in the end of the day, remember we'll move $3 to $4 trillion today, and all of it will be digital, you know, or 99% of it. You know, other than the cash out of the ATM and the checks written by consumers, which are going down 8% to 10% year-over-year and are half the checks written that they were four or five years ago, everything else in our company moves digital. What's the improved process, and then there's real time. That's also connected. We're trying to figure that out. It's not cautious or not.\nIt's just what is the business client demand? When we start to see it, we have built the capabilities, we are understanding what we do, and then we can roll it out. The questions we aren't seeing, you know, clients are knocking on the door and saying, please give me this right now. Got it.\n\nSteven Alexopoulos\n\nStock Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay.\nThanks for the call.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nYes, hi, good morning. Wanted to just refocus the conversation and just ask Brian, with the deregulatory momentum that seems to be taking place, how do you feel about when is the appropriate time to address that 130 basis point buffer? You know, granted the stress test has been quite volatile in the SCB result. You know, clearly there's reform to address that. I'm wondering if 130 basis points would still be an appropriate buffer, and you know, what you need to see to rethink that buffer.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nWe believe an appropriate buffer is 50 basis points, ±50 basis points. That's what we are running down to, you know, pushing down before. We always want that to be utilized, for lack of a better word, by the core businesses because that's what we're here for. We pay our dividends. We're basically using all the incremental capital to refer to shares, and then letting the businesses use up the excess capital to grow. At the high point, I think we were 12%. Now we're down to 11.5%. They're using it up. What we just did is increase the amount of which we have. We expect them to use that and expect us to move down to 50 basis points. Now remember, we got this debate between averaging and not averaging. We'll see it happen.\nThe SLR is really not relevant for us because, frankly, other ratios would catch us before the SLR. The G-SIB calibration is critically important because people are forgetting that that has to happen, because we're effectively using 2010, 2011, or 2012 data on the size of the economy in our company and other companies' relative size to judge how systemically important, or it was meant to be indexed. It hasn't been. The proposal was indexed a year ago or so. From then on, that wasn't really right because it skips all the run-up in size at the pandemic. You have to see more of this come together, expect us to work that capital down one way or the other way. We're always trying to grow the company, and that's what that extra capital there is, to grow the company.\nLoans, deposit loans, more interactions, more transactions. The balance sheet markets is growing, and they've done a good job returning on it. That's what we keep doing. Back up 50 basis points as a target buffers. We just got a change in the last few weeks. The change is still being debated about the implementation timing. We got to get the G-SIB thing figured out because if they don't index it, we'll have an increase coming at us in another year or so. All this we're working on, but at the end of the day is we just returned all the capital we earned back to the shareholders, and we'll continue to do that and more if the business continues to grow.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nJust my follow up question here, Brian, is are there businesses that you're prioritizing in terms of redeploying that capital to that perhaps where the profitability looks better under this regime? The $5.3 billion of stock that you bought back this quarter, would that be indicative of your appetite for the rest of the year?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nI think the answer on the size of buyback is absolutely, because we just did it. Obviously, think of our appetite.\nEvery business has an opportunity for growth. Some will have more RWA intensity, some will have less. If you notice, the RWAs in the industry have grown and ours have grown pretty rapidly. We all need to fine tune that. That's part due to the models and stuff that are being pushed around behind the scenes. Hopefully we get more rational discussion about it. Every business has the opportunity to grow. The most discreet decision we made was to put with Jim DeMare and team is to give them more capital and capacity to grow, and they've used that wisely. If you look across our businesses, that's the lowest return on allocated capital, so we have to be careful to get the returns.\nWe have to make sure that the wealth management business and the consumer business, which have very high returns on capital, are also growing. Everybody can grow. If they need the capital, they'll take it down. There's no issue. The issue is always how much expense you can deploy to grow more than it is how much capital to deploy.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nFinance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning. Two questions, one to follow up on what you were just talking about. I was wondering with relation to markets RWA. I thought in the past there had been no kind of ceiling on that that now is. Can you talk to how much RWA are you willing to allocate to the markets business.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nAs long as they can get the returns? That's the key because we got the dynamics of their return on allocated capital. We got the dynamics there, their impact on net interest income. Jim and the team have got to get the returns, and return on assets has to be moved towards 100 basis points and beyond. There's no theoretical ceiling. It's just the dynamics of how far they can go before they do it. We went from a $600 or $700 billion balance sheet to basically $1 trillion, and that will ebb and flow based on clients' activity. The G-SIB.\nBuffer calculation, you know, we're not worried about that. We've gone from basically 250 to 3, and it'll move up. We wouldn't worry about that because as they're deploying, they're actually getting enough return that it's absorbing the impact of the rest of the company. That's the other thing you always have to be careful of is if markets can cause a G-SIB trigger and everybody pays for it, we make sure that they can actually get the return. It justifies not only what goes into their business, but what the whole company experiences. That's why the calibration is critical.\nWe got to get these things all work together. The calibration of G-SIB is critical. The reality is that you've had a basic 20% growth in the capital requirements. There's no major change in risk for most of us across the last three or four years just by methodologies of G-SIB creep and RWA calculations behind the scenes where they're pushing us on the models and stuff like that.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nBetsy, we're not aware of any RWA ceiling. The global markets business, as you've seen, is just growing as the company grows, and we've just continued to invest there.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nFinance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, great. The follow up question is just on the question on how you are approaching your wind and solar investments with the tax.\nPlan that is going through.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYeah.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nFinance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHow are you thinking about that business, and how should we be anticipating how that will roll through your P&L?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYep. I read your report. I think it was pretty good in terms of laying out what the issues are. What we're anticipating is there's going to be a period here where our clients are still going to want to install wind and solar. We're obviously going to support that. Now they have to get them into production, and they have to get it all. They have to get construction started by a couple of different dates. You can think about it as between now and 2027. That's when you're going to see all of these things begin to slow and then stop. We happen to have, number one, an installed base of production tax credits, so that will stay with us.\nThose will begin to burn down over the course of the next eight years. That's the way I would think about that. The low-income housing tax credits aren't impacted, so we anticipate we'll continue to be involved with those. I would say we're likely to be involved in deals for the next couple of years, and then you'll start to see the portfolio come down in the course of 2028, all the way through 2033, and it'll just burn down gradually over time, Betsy.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nFinance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nAnd then the housing, does the housing investments increase to offset that wind and solar fade?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nWell, that's largely a question of the size of that market. If that market sort of grows with GDP, it may not increase in terms of the size that we do as a company because we're just supporting the clients that we're working with. If it were to grow significantly, then it could take some of that gap. I'm not sure that will happen.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nYes, I think the housing has been a relatively constant number, where the clean energy, the wind and solar in particular, is going to be intertemporal now because of the stuff that goes on and the effects downstream, etc.., like that. You know, the housing is pretty consistent. It's just a question, as Alastai, at how big the demand can be and how it's a competitive market. Other people go for it too. I wouldn't expect that to come close to absorbing that.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nFinance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, excellent. Thank you.\n\nChloe\n\nOperator, Bank of America\n\nWe'll move next to Chris McGratty with KBW. Your line is open.\n\nChristopher McGratty\n\nResearch Analyst, KBW\n\nOh, great. Good morning.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, Chris.\n\nChristopher McGratty\n\nResearch Analyst, KBW\n\nBrian, you've talked a lot about this responsible growth, and the credit's been tremendous over the years. In terms of the journey on the growth portion, I'm interested in your assessment of where you are versus where you desire to be. Maybe secondarily, a little bit more comments or color on the loan growth in the quarter, the conversations that you're having with borrowers, a degree of confidence. Thank you.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nI think we always are pushing our team to grow faster loan growth, faster in deposit growth, but faster than the economy grows, and outgrow the economy, and then turn that into strong profit. I think you've seen them do that. I think you have the commercial loan growth. Leave aside the markets, which you can look at, and that has elements to it which are specific to the clients that we work with that are financing pools of assets, and etc.. If you look in the core middle market, Wendy and the team have done a good job growing the core middle market business, even within nature of the, frankly, the commercial real estate flat to down. So she's grown, I think, 6% to 8% year-over-year.\nAbsent commercial real estate, the business bank area, the loan growth was okay over the years. We now have added a lot of capacity. That's up to $50 million revenue companies. We effectively doubled the size of Salesforce by converting some of the branch-based sales force into that group. They've started to grow the balances now. We'll see some growth there. It's a small portfolio, $13 billion. Small business generally, which is a much larger portfolio, is growing mid single digits or higher year-over-year. They've done a good job. We feel good about loan growth. You know, I think the key is that, you know, this customer demand and line usage is still down.\nYou know we've grown across the board, but we line usage moving to where it was more traditionally is 3 or 4 percentage points of usage, which is a percent or two of loan growth on top of it. We'd feel good about that, you know, just as customers get more used to the situation and do it. We feel good about the growth, and we're seeing every consumer category, I think, grew a little bit this quarter. We can probably push a little harder in some areas there, and the team works on that. You know, you got to be careful of the volatility of consumer credit when we still have unemployment predicted to go up in most of the surveys we look at. We're being careful there too.\n\nChristopher McGratty\n\nResearch Analyst, KBW\n\nGreat, thanks for that, Brian. Secondarily, some of your peers have talked about the willingness to look externally for uses of capital. I may have missed this in your earlier remarks, but is there any, aside from funding the balance sheet and some of your growth initiatives, is there anything within the franchise that you would be looking to perhaps allocate more capital externally? Thanks.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nYeah, well, I think if you're talking about acquisitions in the deposit side, that's not available to us, but in technology space, we bought some companies over the last several years, but they're going to be relatively small, small uses. We bought one in the medical payments area. We can bring it to our scale and work it through. You know, there's possibilities in that area, but you know, really it's organic growth.\nThe reality is because our huge deposit share for 30 years plus, we'd not have been allowed to buy another depository institution. That game's done. How we got to do it is organic expansion, and that's what we did in all the markets, and we're continuing that push. The expansion markets, we call them, and we're seeing success there. We'll continue that push, but that's more of a deployment of resources where we take them out of places and push them. We're down overall branches year-over-year, you can see that. In these new markets, we've grown, so it's more of an expense redeployment question and a human being redeployment question as we get the efficiencies, that it is a capital deployment question, frankly.\n\nChristopher McGratty\n\nResearch Analyst, KBW\n\nRight. Yeah, I was definitely referring to nonbank, so appreciate the color. Thanks, Brian.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is open.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nStock Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nHey, good morning everyone. Alastair, I know you don't want to give a hard target for NII for next year, I appreciate that. With the high jumping off point, and then you have a little more puts and takes than most, I guess you have potential headwinds from the Bisbee accretion rolling off. You got rate cuts embedded in the forward curve, loan growth and deposit growth are picking up, cash flow hedges are rolling off, asset repricing. How does it all, in your mind, how does it all fit together next year? Can you grow off that Q4 jumping off point in your mind, or just any thoughts would be great. The answer is yes.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nLook, the answer to that is yes because the company's built, as Brian said, for organic growth. As we continue to add clients, as we do more with the existing client base, that's when you see the loan growth and the deposit growth coming through. There's always headwinds in any given year. Our mentality will be we come off of Q4, how do we grow NII sequentially each quarter from there, and we're going to benefit again from that fixed rate asset repricing again next year. That acts as a tailwind. The first quarter is just a little bit different because of day count. In general, I think you should think about NII as at least our expectation is we're just going to keep growing it quarter after quarter.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nStock Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nOkay, that's great. Maybe just you had highlighted that balance sheet mix has changed a little bit and you're focused more on NII growth than NIM. I know you had historically or previously talked about a 220 to 230 longer. Is that different now, or how do you think about that longer term target?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nNo, it's not different. I just think, you know, any given quarter can be interesting, and this quarter was interesting because, number one, we had really high volumes in active markets. In a period like that, global markets clients are asking us for balance sheet. We're going to provide that, assuming it's well priced, and we felt like it was. We saw the global markets business take on more in the way of earning assets. That is sometimes NIY dilutive, but it can still be NII slightly positive. You've got a little bit of that going on. In commercial this quarter, we just took on some.\nI mentioned this in the speech, but we took on a couple of very large commercial deposits at the end of the quarter, and those are, you know, NIY dilutive but slightly NII positive. I think in the grand scheme this was just an interesting quarter where the NIY came in slightly differently, but the long term remains exactly the same. We're going to drive it back to that 220 to 230 with every available opportunity.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nStock Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nOkay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nOperator\n\nIt does appear that there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Brian for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nThank you again for spending time with us this morning. Leave you where we started. We saw organic client activity across the board. We're now seeing the second half benefits of the kick in, and we'll expect to get the kick in and NII pushing operating leverage back in the business. That will continue to be solid revenue growth and earnings per share. As we look forward, and as we talked about and showed you some examples, we're now seeing the augmented intelligence, artificial intelligence capacity starting to build in the company, which will add to our efficiency efforts going forward. Thank you for your time, and we look forward to talking next time.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful afternoon."

I will be standing by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Lee McIntyre.\n\nLee McIntyre\n\nCompany Representative, Bank of America\n\nGood morning. Thank you. Thank you for joining the call to review our first quarter results. Our earnings release documents are available on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. Those documents include the earnings presentation that we will make reference to during the call. First, our CEO Brian Moynihan will make some opening comments before Alistair Borthwick, our CFO, discusses the details of the quarter. Let me just remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause our actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials as well as our SEC filings available on the website.\nInformation about non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to US GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials on the website. With that, Brian, let's get started.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nThank you, Lee, and thank all of you, and good morning, and thank you for joining us. Given the recent events, we want to do a couple things at our time today. First, we want to provide a clear picture of how well the fundamentals of the company performed to produce another good quarter of earnings in Q1 2025. So I'm going to talk through a little of those highlights and I'm going to turn it over to Alistair for details on the quarter and some forward guidance.\nAnd second, given the market volatility and the concerns of potential changes in the economy and its outlook at the end of the quarterly presentation, we're going to give you some facts to set the context about the quality of our credit portfolios, our capital, and our liquidity as we may face periods of economic change and set that in the context of how we fared prior to past periods of economic stress. So let's get going on Slide two of the discussion this morning. Bank of America reported $7.4 billion in net income and $0.9 in EPS for Q1 2025. That's a solid start to 2025 and great work by our team.\nOn a year-over-year basis, we grew revenue by 6%, we grew net income at 11%, we grew earnings per share 18%, and we delivered more capital back to shareholders and we reduced shares in the aggregate by 3%. We produced an 89 basis points return on assets and a 14% return on tangible common equity in the first quarter. So let me hit on a few highlights that drove that performance. Net interest income grew 3% year-over-year is up from quarter four to the high end of our guidance range we gave you three months ago. We grew deposits for the seventh straight quarter. They reached nearly $2 trillion at quarter end and have now grown 8% from their mid-2023 low point. We grew commercial loans in nearly every line of business.\nThis is the second quarter in a row they've grown across the board. Holly O'Neill and our consumer team marked the 25th straight quarter of net new checking account growth. We saw annual flows to our consumer investments business of $22 billion over last 12 months. Our wealth management businesses led by Eric, Lindsay, and Katy Knox in the private bank together added 7,200 net new households in this quarter and saw net AUM flows of $24 billion in the quarter. Jim DeMare and the team recorded a 12th straight quarter of year-over-year sales and trading revenue growth and achieved a 16% return on allocated capital. We generated these results working from a strong balance sheet with over $200 billion in regulatory capital and nearly $1 trillion in liquidity. This allows us to provide strong support and solutions for our clients.\nTurning to slide 3 on organic growth, one of the keys to our earnings improvement has been our ability to consistently drive organic growth. Organic growth remains strong across the businesses as highlighted on slide three. I won't go through all the statistics and all the points on the page, but as you can see, the momentum has continued. I note the continued growth in net new checking, new households, new companies of commercial banking, and growth in our institutional markets business. Clients continue to see the value in our capabilities in connected businesses as a company.\nOur digital engagement and sales continue to expand across all our businesses. We saw more than 14 billion logins in 2024. Erica has now surpassed 2.7 billion interactions since its inception. Our CashPro app for our commercial customers has continued strong adoption and usage rates. As you can see, transactions sent through Zelle at Bank of America are not only three times the number of checks written by our Bank of America customers, but also 1.3 times the number of checks written plus the number of cash transactions taking money out of the ATMs. It's also worth noting that digitally enabled sales in our consumer product business across the board reach 65% of total sales. You can see these trends on digital in the slides. We show you each quarter on slides 26, 28, and 30 in the appendix and we commend those to you.\nAs you go to slide four, we showed you some of the highlights in economic activity. We provide some of the current spending data by our consumers of Bank of America. There's a lot that could potentially change given the uncertainty around the tariffs and other policies in the future path of the economy. In our communications with all of you, just as we've done during other stress periods, we want to relay to you those facts which we think give you some context. But before we do that, our research team, like many research teams led by Candace Browning, does not currently believe we'll see a recession in 2025. However, they've lowered their GDP growth rates for 2025 and continue to see no rate cuts during 2025. But expect as inflation gets under control, you may see them in the future, that is in 2026.\nGoing more to what our customer data shows, it shows that the money moving across all our consumer spending methods, debit and credit cards, ACH checks written, Zelle, et cetera, all that aggregate shows it grew about 4.4% pace in the first quarter 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024. As you look in the chart and look across it, you can note that consumer spending has been consistently growing year over year, but during last year it actually slowed a bit, especially in the summer and picked back up in the fall. That resulted in fourth quarter 2024 over the fourth quarter 2023 being about a 4% pace and that pace has continued.\nThat pace has also continued through the first part of April. We note that some retailers may say that their sales are slower, and others are picking up, and it really reflects a change in consumer spending behavior. But in the aggregate, the consumer keeps pushing money into the economy. As we look at our business side and what our business clients are telling you in the current setting, they remain profitable, liquid, and have strong results. They all could look ahead and worry about the same things that you hear reflected in your conversations with them also. So we continue to watch for signs of the environment actually changing, but we thought it would be good to share with you what we're actually seeing in our customer base at this moment.\nSo, in summary, for Bank of America for first quarter 2025, I want to thank the team for another strong quarter. We saw good organic client activity, we saw enjoyed good growth in revenue and earnings. We continue to invest in the future growth of our company. We managed the risk well that drove healthy returns for you, our shareholders, and we increased the capital delivered back to our shareholders. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Alistair to talk you through the quarter.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nThank you, Brian. I start on slide five of the earnings presentation to provide a little more context on the quarter, and as Brian noted, we generated $7.4 billion in net income or $0.90 per diluted share this quarter, and that represents good growth over both last quarter and the year earlier period. On slide six, we note some of the highlights of the quarter. Revenue of $27.5 billion on an FTE basis grew 6% from first quarter of 2024. Most revenue items showed improvement year over year. NII grew 3%, investment and brokerage fees rose 15% with both assets under management flows and market levels contributing nicely to the growth. This quarter's $5.6 billion in sales and trading revenue grew 9% from the year ago period.\nService charges grew 8% with particular strength in our Global Payment Solutions revenue. Card income improved 4%, and other income also improved, driven by gains mostly associated with leveraged finance positions, and these were positions that we disposed of during the quarter.\nNon-interest expense was $17.8 billion up from the fourth quarter driven by seasonally elevated payroll taxes, and markets revenue-related costs of processing and incentives. Litigation costs were also higher related to a recent decision in a long-running matter, with operating leverage this quarter as revenue grew 300 basis points faster than expense compared to Q1 2024. Provision expense for the quarter was $1.5 billion with asset quality remaining in great shape. Preferred dividends were $125 million less than first quarter of 2024 as we redeemed some preferreds over the past year, and we used some of our excess capital to reduce our outstanding shares 4% from the first quarter of last year. All of these things aided in EPS improving 18% year-over-year.\nLet's move to a discussion of the balance sheet using Slide seven, and you can see assets ended the quarter at $3.35 trillion. That's up $88 billion from the fourth quarter driven by higher levels of client activity in global markets. In addition, loans grew $15 billion in the quarter supported by a $24 billion increase in deposits. As deposit growth exceeded loan growth, we continued to add to our liquidity. Long-term debt increased $21 billion driven by funding needs to support the growth in client assets. Average global excess liquidity at $942 billion remained strong and up year-over-year. Shareholders' equity was flat with the fourth quarter around $296 billion, and within that we returned $6.5 billion of capital back to shareholders with $2 billion in common dividends and the repurchase of $4.5 billion in shares.\nIt's worth noting that year-over-year equity is up 2 billion and a $10 billion increase in common equity was partially offset by a 28% reduction in preferred stock.\nTangible book value per share of $27.12 rose 9% from first quarter 2024. Turning to regulatory capital on slide eight, our CET1 level increased to $201 billion and the CET1 ratio is 11.8%. This is down 11 basis points and remains well above our 10.7% requirement. You can see in the waterfall. We deployed capital in a number of ways this quarter. In addition to the increased amount of share repurchases, we allocated more capital to our global markets business and grew both consumer and commercial loans within the ending loan growth. It's worth noting we bought an $8 billion portfolio of residential mortgage loans that's both high in quality and allows good potential to expand relationships with customers beyond those mortgage loans. And we expect these loans to add just over $100 million in NII annually.\nSupplemental leverage ratio was 5.7% versus a minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves capacity for balance sheet growth. And our $468 billion of total loss-absorbing capital means our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements.\nAs you see on slide nine, we've now grown deposits for the seventh consecutive quarter on an average basis, and we're near $2 trillion on an ending basis. Typically, we see some downward pressure on deposits as we move from Q4 to Q1 as commercial clients use their cash to pay bonuses and taxes. This year we saw commercial deposits more stable as clients remain highly liquid. In addition, we remain disciplined on pricing as we pass through short rate declines and saw a 2024 basis points decline in rates paid in global banking. We saw continued stability around our consumer non interest bearing balances, and as interest rates moved lower in CDs and preferred deposits on our brokerage platform. We saw a three basis points decline in rates paid in consumer banking this quarter to 61 basis points.\nOverall rate paid moved from 194 basis points in Q4 to 179 basis points this quarter and were lower in every business segment.\nLet's turn to loans by looking at average balances on slide 10, and you can see loans in Q1 of $1.09 trillion improved 4% year-over-year, driven by 7% commercial loan growth excluding commercial real estate. That year-over-year growth was 9%. We noted a modest increase in revolver utilization during the quarter as clients navigate the current environment. Consumer loans grew modestly year-over-year, with linked quarter movement reflecting seasonal credit card paydowns and the $8 billion of residential loans we purchased this quarter and that I noted earlier. Those will come onto the balance sheet. Well, they came onto the end of the balance sheet at the end of the quarter, so they don't really impact averages this period and will begin to impact them next.\nLet's turn our focus to NII performance on slide 11, where, on a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q1 was $14.4 billion, and, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, NII was $14.6 billion. That's up 3% from the first quarter of last year. We finished at the higher end of our expected range, and NII grew $75 million on a fully taxable equivalent basis over Q4, even as we incurred approximately $250 million headwind from two fewer days of interest accrual. The improvement was driven by global markets activity as well as deposit favorability, loan growth, and fixed rate asset repricing, also benefited NII. With regard to interest rate sensitivity, on a dynamic deposit basis, we provide a 12-month change in NII for an instantaneous shift in the curve.\nThat means interest rates would have to move instantaneously another 100 basis points lower than the four cuts already expected and contemplated in the April 10 curve. On that basis, a 100 basis point decline would decrease NII over the next 12 months by $2.2 billion. And if rates went up 100 basis points again more than the forward curve, NII would benefit by roughly $1 billion.\nWith regard to a forward view of NII, given the uncertainty of announced tariffs, we've seen expectations for more cuts in interest rates and more variability now in the market expectations for economic growth. So let us provide a few thoughts for you using slide 12 to illustrate. In Q4 we provided our expectation that we could exit Q4 of 2025 with NII on a fully taxable equivalent basis in a range of $15.5 billion - $15.7 billion.\nThat included an acceleration of NII growth in the second half of the year. Our assumptions underlying the NII belief then included an interest rate curve which anticipated one rate cut in the middle of the year and modest loan and deposit growth. And while the interest rate environment has changed a little, our current expectation for the exit rate of NII in Q4 remains unchanged. Using first quarter 2025 as the base, the waterfall gives you some idea of our assumptions to bridge to our Q4 2025 expected exit rate. First, we pick up two additional days of interest, one in each of the next couple quarters. Fixed rate asset repricing also benefits our NII and it takes into account the impact of the current interest rate curve. There are three primary buckets for that benefit. Securities, mortgage loans, and cash flow hedges.\nSecurity paydowns are running about $8 billion - $9 billion a quarter. Mortgage loans are another $4 billion - $5 billion a quarter, and each gains a little more than 200 basis points as they're replaced. Cash flow swap repricing benefits are a little more staggered in their roll down and make up the rest of the benefit. Here we assume the early April interest rate curve, which reflects four cuts, and a couple are later in the year. So that will have some negative impact near term on our expected NII growth. But it improves as the funding costs more fully reflect those cuts. Best proxy for that impact is our asset sensitivity, which again assumes instantaneous rate reductions even below the rate cuts currently in the curve.\nWe provide our best estimate using the timing of those cuts, and at the same time, with lower rates, we would expect just a little more loan and deposit activity, and we estimate the NII impact of that growth would offset some of the interest rate impact from rates. We already saw modestly better deposit growth in Q1 than we expected. In addition, we believe our liability sensitive global markets business will also likely benefit NII more as we move through the year. And that obviously depends on the way clients choose to trade with us. Bottom line, our fourth quarter exit rate expectation for NII is unchanged at $15.5 billion - $15.7 billion from our previous expectation. And that means we're still expecting strong full year NII improvement this year of 6%-7%.\nOkay, let's turn to expense, and we'll use Slide 13 for the discussion. We reported a little less than $17.8 billion in expense this quarter, and that included roughly $500 million in seasonal elevation from payroll tax expense and some markets related revenue related costs. We also had higher litigation expense to $160 million driven by a recent decision in a long running matter. And remember, as you think about the expense increase from Q4, that quarter included a $300 million release of accruals for the FDIC Special Assessment expense. Compared to Q1 2024, it is up a little less than 3%, consistent with our full year 2025 growth expectations, and the increase reflects costs of higher sales and trading, and wealth management fees, and in the investments made to add more sales associates and to support increased technology and marketing costs.\nLet's move to credit and turn to slide 14 where our asset quality remains sound. Net charge offs were $1.45 billion, modestly down compared to Q4. This is the fifth consecutive quarter that net charge offs have hovered around $1.5 billion. The total net charge off ratio this quarter was 54 basis points, flat with Q4. Q1 provision expense was $1.5 billion and matched net charge offs. Consumer net charge offs were $1.1 billion, consistent with the past few quarters. Now 90% of our consumer net charge offs are driven by credit card, which highlights the importance of prudence in underwriting that portfolio. As we note on slide 22, on the commercial side we saw losses of $333 million, down modestly from Q4 near term. We don't expect much change in net charge offs, as you can see improvement in both early and late stage delinquencies from the fourth quarter.\nThat tells us that net charge-offs could even be a touch lower next quarter on the consumer side.\nOn slide 15, in addition to the improvement in consumer delinquency statistics, note the modest changes in other stats for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Okay, let's move to the various lines of business and some brief comments on their results starting on slide 16 with consumer banking. For clients consumer banking continues to deliver strong organic growth driven by high touch and high tech capabilities, convenience, and security for shareholders through NII in particular, this business is increasingly seeing benefits fall to the bottom line for its high quality deposit book with only 61 basis point rate paid on nearly $950 billion of deposits. In Q1 consumer banking generated $10.5 billion in revenue and $2.5 billion in net income.\nRevenue grew 3% from first quarter of 2024 as NII growth was complemented by fee improvement in card and service charges. Expenses rose 6% as we continued our business investment and worked through elevated compliance costs. The organic growth that Brian noted on slide three included nearly 250,000 net new checking accounts this quarter, another strong period of card openings, and strong investment account growth. Investment balances grew 9% to $498 billion with full year flows of $22 billion in market improvement.\nConsumer banking deposits continued to increase from their mid-August low. That was $928 billion and it's now at $972 billion on an ending basis. Looking at averages, deposits grew $5.2 billion from the fourth quarter to $948 billion, and our rate paid declined to 61 basis points. Finally, as you can see on the appendix, slide 26, digital adoption and engagement continued to improve, and customer experience scores rose to record levels, illustrating the appreciation of enhanced capabilities from these investments.\nMoving to wealth management on slide 17, the business had another strong quarter with a continued increase in banking product usage from our investing clients. The diversification of the revenue in this business continues to grow. The number of clients that have banking products with us continues to grow also and is now approaching 2/3 of the client base. Importantly, about 30% of our revenue remains in net interest income, which complements the fees earned in our advice-driven model, and those have also grown. Net income of $1 billion rose modestly from first quarter of 2024 as solid revenue growth was mostly offset by higher revenue-related costs, and continued investments. In Q1 we reported revenue of $6 billion growing 8% over the prior year led by 15% growth in asset management fees.\nExpense growth of 9% supported both the cost of the increase in fees and as well as investment in technology and the cost of hiring to add experienced advisors to the platform. In Merrill and the private bank, average loans were up 6% year over year. That was driven by growth in custom lending, securities-based lending, and a pickup in mortgage lending. Deposits were relatively stable compared to Q4, and our pricing discipline resulted in a 25 basis point decline in rates paid. Both Merrill and the private bank continue to see organic growth and produce strong assets under management flows of $79 billion over the past 12 months, which reflects a good mix of new client money, as well as existing clients putting money to work. We also want to draw your attention to the continued digital momentum that you'll find on slide 28. Our new accounts continue to be predominantly open digitally.\nOn slide 18 you see the global banking results and the loan and deposit gathering success of the team in the first quarter. Global Banking produced earnings of $1.9 billion, modestly lower than the year-ago quarter as lower credit costs from CRE office losses were more than offset by higher expense of investment in the business. Revenue of $6 billion was flat to the prior year as lower NII was offset by roughly $230 million, higher other income related to leveraged finance positions as well as higher treasury services revenue. Firmwide investment banking fees were $1.5 billion in Q1, similar to last year's first quarter. We maintained our number three investment banking fee position and looking forward we've got a healthy pipeline and our clients are simply waiting on more clarity on trade policy and the regulatory environment before committing to deals.\nExpenses increased 6% year-over-year, driven by continued investments in technology and operations to support clients. On the balance sheet, we saw good client activity. As I noted earlier, we saw good growth in commercial loans mitigated by decline in CRE loans, and total average global banking deposits are up 9% year-over-year, where we saw strong growth across all categories from corporate and commercial clients on the larger end to business banking on the lower end.\nSwitching to global markets on slide 19, I'll focus my comments on results excluding DVA as we normally do. As Brian said, we continued our streak of strong revenue and earnings performance, achieved operating leverage, and continued to deliver a good return on capital. In Q1 we earned $1.9 billion and that grew 8% year-over-year. Revenue again ex-DVA improved 10% from first quarter of 2024 on good sales and trading results and $230 million of other income on leveraged finance positions. Similar to global banking, focused on sales and trading. Ex-DVA revenue improved 9% year-over-year to $5.6 billion. Equities led the way this quarter growing 17% year-over-year while FICC grew 5%. Equities and FICC both benefited from increased client activity. Among the market volatility, year-over-year expenses were up 9% on revenue improvement and our continued investments in the business.\nOn slide 20, we show all other with a loss of $4 million in Q1, and the driver of the year-over-year improvement in expense and net income is the absence of the first quarter 2024 FDIC special assessment. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 9%, which reflects the discrete impact of share-based compensation awards. As a reminder, our tax rate remains well below our typical corporate tax rate driven by tax credits related to investments in renewable energy and affordable housing. Looking forward, as we said last quarter, we expect the tax rate for the full year 2025 to be in a range of 11%-13% excluding unusual items.\nSo let's shift gears to finish and we'll use slide 21. Over the last couple weeks investors have signaled concerns for the bank industry over potential changes in the economy and in light of that, we added the next few slides to illustrate how much stronger our risk profile and balance sheet are today for whatever economic outcome we might face.\nAnd let me offer three important takeaways as you see the next three slides. First, we have a vastly improved risk profile from previous periods of economic dislocation. Second, at the same time we strengthened the balance sheet by adding billions of capital and liquidity. Third, following 15 years of operating under Responsible Growth, our portfolio and our balance sheet are well prepared to support our clients' in various economic outcomes. Now, the left side of slide 21 highlights the shift in the loan portfolio to a more balanced mix of commercial and consumer, as well as a more geographically diverse mix. Our high quality commercial loan portfolio at this point is more than 90% investment grade or collateralized, and it also includes a more diversified geographic mix as you see at the bottom of the page.\nAt the top right you see the improved mix toward a more secured collateralized balance of our consumer book. The bottom right illustrates the nine-quarter loss rate and how our nine-quarter, so this isn't annualized, this is nine-quarter stress loss ratios fared in the Fed models and CCAR exams, and we compare quite favorably to peers in each of the past 12 years of exams.\nCCAR provides investors an annual independent view to analyze adverse impacts in the most severe circumstances. Just to recap if you went to the latest results from 2024, those scenarios include a drop of 6%-8% in real GDP from peak to trough. It includes a rapid increase in unemployment up to 10% and significant changes in inflation. It also assumes housing prices falling 35%. It assumes short rates basically go to zero and the 10 year goes to 1%. And it assumes bond spreads widen dramatically, commercial real estate prices decline 40%, and equity prices would drop by 50% together with significant weakness in international economies. It also assumes the portfolio size doesn't change from any management actions that we might take in that environment, and we obviously do quite well in that CCAR stressed environment. With that I'm going to stop. I'll turn it back to Brian for a couple thoughts to wrap Up.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nThanks, Alistair, and I'm on slide 22. On that slide, we highlight some of the key balance sheet or asset quality statistics of the company has faced important periods of economic disruption, and we compare those to the current status. On the left side of the columns, you can see that the fourth quarter of 2009 illustrates what the company looked like after a couple years in the financial crisis and after the acquisition of Merrill. Second column obviously is fourth quarter 2019, which represents what we look like heading into the pandemic. Now we show you what the company looks like today. We have a multifarious loan book across types of clients, geographies, and various asset classes that holds us in good stead.\nIn total, our consumer loans are down more than $200 billion, as home equity loans are down more than $125 billion and credit card loans, unsecured credit card loans, are down by more than $60 billion. This reflected a concentrated effort on us to focus on our relationship loans rather than loans as a product and deepen those relationships with the highest quality prime credit customers. Our wealth management business has doubled in size in those consumer categories, and the relative exposure to those borrowers and those loans, as various securities, are highly collateralized and the strength of the borrowers underneath them.\nIn the commercial area, in addition to the more geographic dispersion that Alastair discussed, you could also see that the construction, lending and land development exposures have been greatly reduced. At the same time, our equity is $93 billion and higher. At Bank of America we remain resolute about the strength of our balance sheet. We are well reserved for our portfolio and risk profile. On a weighted basis, including our model reserves, our discretionary reserves, and our judgmental reserves, it positions us at approximately 6% unemployment rate. The current reserve allocation on card is 7.4%, for example, against a charge-off rate of about 4.4%. When you go to slide 31, you can see some more statistics about our portfolios.\nExcuse me. On 23, you can see more statistics about our portfolios. Let's take a deeper look at those. Just a couple points on slide 23, you can see that in regards to mortgage between the first and second lien products today we have a total of about $260 billion. On average, our borrowers have FICO scores above 770 and average debt to income ratios of 35% for the residential mortgage product and 39% for the home equity product. Loan to values also leave us in strong equity positions being below 50%. For comparative purposes, we entered the financial crisis in early 2007 and you can see the exposures were more than $400 billion with average FICO scores were 50-60 points lower and higher LTVs. So $400 billion more imbalances lower credit scores and higher LTVs. So we've significantly repositioned those portfolios across the last several years.\nMoving through the other consumer loan types, you can see the high quality of the collateralized securities-based asset lending and auto portfolios. On consumer credit card, we have about $100 billion in outstandings with a current net charge-off ratio, as I said, about 4%. The FICO score of our average borrower is 777. In thinking about exposure borrowers less than a current FICO score of 660, we have about 12% exposure. Card is really our only consumer unsecured exposure in the portfolio. As a comparison, heading into the financial crisis in fourth quarter 2007, we had $150 billion in credit card balance, about 1.5 times our current balance of card loans. The average FICO score was 50 FICO points lower, and the unused lines of those books were much, much higher. This strong position allows us to better serve our clients.\nAnd in the times of stress, which may come ahead. According to our projections, Bank of America stands ready to support them as never before. Whether it's a commercial client which needs help to borrow and navigate the changing economy around the world, whether it's a commercial client needs to reposition their debt structure or move money to help participate in the economy, we'll be there for them. If it's a wealthy client who needs advice and counsel in rocky periods or loan to get them through, we're there for them. If consumers need access to cash or borrowing, we're also there for them. Bottom line, operating the company in this way allows us to stand tall in times of stress. And these slides highlight the importance of having done that across the last many years and the relative importance strength of our company compared to others. Thank you. Now we'll go to questions and answers. Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly at this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star two. We'll take our first question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHi. Good morning, Brian. Good morning. Alistair.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nGood morning.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nAppreciate you guys taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on capital management. Certainly encouraging to see the acceleration in the buyback towards that $4.5 billion level. At the same time, you're still running with more than 100 basis points of cushion, and was hoping you could speak to, given the uncertainty in the environment, what level of CET1 you're currently comfortable running with in terms of the ratio, and whether this $4.5 billion buyback level is something that we expect to be sustained over the near to medium term.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYep. So Steve, if you look at what we did this quarter, just take a look at slide eight in the earnings materials. You know, here's a quarter where we ended up earning $7 billion. And you know, it allowed us to step up the share buyback from $3.5 billion up to $4.5 billion in an environment where we also invested more RWAs in global markets and into higher loan balances. So not only did we grow the loans, I'll call them organically, but we also purchased a loan portfolio this quarter. So we're sort of growing into our capital at this point by investing in the business, and we still have some flexibility to increase the share buyback. So I don't think we have an ultimate destination in mind right now on CET1, recognizing that we don't have full clarity yet on all the aspects of capital.\nAnd we'd like to see that before we, before we determine it. But obviously, as you point out, we've got a lot of flexibility and we're more focused on just make sure that the CET1 is in a good place and then grow into the capital base that we have. And that's probably the best way to articulate it.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's great. For my follow up, just on the outlook for loan and deposit growth, you delivered better growth across both KPIs relative to peers. So maybe you could speak to what drove the strength in 1Q beyond the portfolio purchase you alluded to earlier, and just bigger picture, the outlook for commercial loan growth as tariffs and policy uncertainty have certainly raised concerns regarding weakening loan demand, weaker CapEx, what have you?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nSteven, just on the, I'll give you the broader thing and now so you can talk about some of the specifics you remember. Over the last several years we've been investing in basically building out more commercial bankers across the world, including build outs in Switzerland, the U.K., and things like that. We built more commercial loan officers in the United States in our global commercial banking business under Wendy and the team. We've grown more private bankers and more in a wealth management team under Merrill, what we call wealth management bankers support those teams.\nWe've grown them. So those investments are sort of kicking in on that sort of 20 mile marchway, just more of them, more of them, more of and that just keeps driving it through. So that's why you're seeing us sort of do better in the competition, just in linked quarter loan growth. When we look forward, you know, with all the things you described, the potential changes in economy, business views people draw in anticipation of tougher economic times. We'll see all that play out. But the real way that the real reason that we're driving our capabilities is more capacity and then making that honestly, also making that capacity more efficient, using some artificial intelligence machine learning to direct that calling capacity.\nAnd that's allowed us to take what we call new logos in the commercial business, adding new companies for the first time. And you're seeing that, having started a couple years ago, is now maturing into the balances, capability, and outstandings, which it takes a while to bring those clients in, get them underwritten, they renew once every couple years, get in the flow, et cetera. So those investments are paying off and we expect that to continue across the board.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's great, Coler, thanks so much for taking my questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to John McDonald with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nThank you. Hi, Good morning, guys. Thanks for the longer term perspective on the credit. I just wanted to follow up that on terms of the loan loss reserve, what were the dynamics of the setting of the reserve this quarter in terms of is there any change in weighting of scenarios for the tariffs and was it set with a 331 view or early April view?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nSo John, we said it all the way through the close, but normally we're focused on the data that we have on 331, and then we have the ability to layer on top after we model our reserves. We have the ability to layer on imprecision and judgmental on top of that. So we did this quarter the same way that we've done in other quarters. We went through and assessed using the Blue Chip Economic Indicators. So the consensus view of all of the various macro assumptions, that's sometimes different than others who use their own proprietary. We feel like the right answer is to use the Blue Chip consensus; it's more independent. And then we've got that as our baseline, and we've got four other scenarios around that. We've got upside and three downside.\nIn this particular quarter, already the Blue Chip Economic Indicators have moved down in terms of economic growth. So GDP lower in the baseline and a little higher on inflation. So that's reflected in the baseline before we even get to the weightings, and then weightings this quarter, those are unchanged for us. And by the time we then take that modeled answer and then layer on top of it, the Judgmental piece all the way through the close. We're reserved closer to an unemployment rate that's right around 6% in 2025, 2026. Just to give you some idea. So that should give you an idea. We feel like we're pretty well reserved at this point.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nHey, John, one of the things, you know, we've been looking a lot at sort of what happened because obviously CECL came in, the pandemic hit, sort of the buildup and things like that. But you know, as Alistair said, one of the hard concepts is the baseline that we use continues has moved negative over the last couple quarters, obviously due to the outlook here last couple months and continue to reflect that. But we have a strong reserve position with that when you add it all up at the 6% implied level. So we feel good.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nThanks. That's helpful. And then on expenses, you previously were looking for the full year expenses this year to be up 2%-3% over last year. How are you feeling about that? Is that still kind of your current thinking?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYes, that's still our current thinking, John. I mean, I think we said 2%-3% for the full year. We feel like we're on course there. It might be towards the higher end, but we just got to see what happens with fees over the course of this year.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGot it. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nGreat, Good morning. Maybe, Alastair, you were able to absorb four cuts this year in your assumptions and maintain the 4Q NII target, which is a good thing. As we think about the full impact of the four cuts felt in 2026 and potentially a few more, does that make it a little more difficult to reach that intermediate-term target NIM of 1.3% by the end of next year or the fact that. You're getting them out of the way this year is helpful. Just trying to think through that intermediate term target. Thanks.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nSo, Jim, first of all, that target's 2.3, not 1.3.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nI'm sorry. Yes.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah, you're letting us hook you up easy. We're aiming at 2.3% and we still feel like over the course of the next couple years that's the right answer for this year's NII. Those rate cuts, we got four of them in there, but a couple of them are later in the year. So it doesn't have a tremendous impact on 2025. It'll be a little bit of a headwind in 2026 if that in fact is the case. But again, we got a lot of time between then and there. I feel like last year at one point we thought there'd be one rate cut in the curve, then there was six, then we were back to one. So we got to see how the interest rate curve develops. But our management team's focus and goal has not changed.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nJim, one on the rate sensitivities. Remember those are instantaneous drops, and it takes time for the, you know, the fixed our debt portfolio, our debt issuance portfolio. Some of it's floating, some of it's fixed; it reprices over time. So if they come more over time, you can't quite equate it to the instantaneous drop type of things, if you got my point, because you have other dynamics which help. So you know, remember that long term most economists believe that with inflation coming back towards the target rate, you'd see the Fed funds rate ultimately get down to three, three and a half type of levels, which is more of a traditional normal. It's hard to say in the world we're in now level. So if that happens, we feel very comfortable.\nIf you look back historically, the earnings power of this company and the NIM percentages you've talked about with the Fed funds rate in that range pushing up 2.3 and beyond is strong.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nOkay. Yeah, makes sense. Just as a follow-up on just sort of the near-term April, we saw a big jump in volatility. Just Any? What are you seeing across your business segments, whether you've seen deposit flight to safety flows and the volatility in trading? Has that been good volatility, bad volatility? Just trying to get a little window into the near term. Thanks.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nWell, we've seen significant pickups in customer activity in global markets. So the environment there remains constructive. We have seen, I'd say, continued deposit sort of similar to what we would expect. We haven't seen anything like if you were to go back a couple years around regional banking crisis, nothing like that. It's been pretty regular way I would say. And we just keep driving the deposits day to day.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nAnd Jim, I mentioned it earlier, but just you didn't specifically ask about it. But what's interesting is you watch that consumer money flow spending. If you take a four-week average including up to the first 12 days of April, it's running at 5%, so it hasn't fallen off. You got to be careful just using two weeks because of where Easter fell this year versus last year, and all that stuff. But basically it's maintaining that pace. So the consumers are still solidly in the game. What they'll do next? Different question. But right now they're still solidly even to the first part of April.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nOkay, great. Thank You.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line open.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nHi. Thanks very much. So another good trading quarter for you guys. I'm curious when you benchmark yourself to the top tiers, you know, this is probably about a $3 billion difference to the biggest platforms. I'm just curious if you see those big gaps to peers, are those gaps that you're choosing to pursue? You mentioned you have the SLR room, you have a great equity franchise. I'm just curious on your approach toward, is it a capital thing? Is it a risk thing? I'm just curious on the high level thoughts. Thanks.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nI think, yep. Starting a number of years ago, this had been a relentless climb up a ladder and not overshooting and having to cut off so that, you know, three years a year over year growth, you know, consecutive quarters that other people don't do because there's more volatility. So Jim and the team have been basically building up. So what have we done? More capital. Probably over five or six years you have $300 billion more balance sheet capacity. Even over this quarter was $60 billion. So we keep adding capabilities, capacity. But remember the. And we've, you know, a relentless march, you know, fourth to third in categories, you know, third to second, this category keep moving up and just keep pursuing it in some areas like, you know, physical commodities. That's not a business we're heavily into.\nWe made a decision about that a number of years ago versus, you know, core fixed income where we're stronger and we've been gaining share. The idea is to keep gaining share but at a pace, for lack of a better term, in the business which has volatility in it. A pace that capitalizes that volume of revenue into the business and then grows from there as opposed to grabs it and gives it back and grabs it and gives it back. It's just the way that Jim and the team have driven it and they've done frankly a very good job doing it. So expect us to keep gaining share. We'll keep closing the gaps that you mentioned. It's getting closer to the third place gap.\nBut you know, in a given quarter, other people may shoot up a little higher because of this element or that element. Our job is just to be consistent across all the elements that we participate in and keep driving it. There's plenty of opportunity ahead, and it's not for lack of capital or lack of risk taking. They're taking more risk. The other major thing is the investment in systems here is a competitive moat, frankly, that the amount of work you have to do to get this all to work right on a worldwide basis. There's very few of us could start do it.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nI very much appreciate that. And similar to what John said, we definitely like to drill down on the extra detail around the credit book and history guide. I'm curious about right now when you talk about the reserving and you took now to give us the further drill down on the exposures, is it a traditional regular way we're managing towards or closer towards our higher likelihood of recession. Or have you gone through? And assessed the loan book from exposures to this shifting tariff and tax environment. That's bringing the higher attention? I hope that the question is clear. I'm just, I'm more talking about the why now and what's driving the increased attention.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America",
    "content2": "Well, the why now of why we put the extra disclosure is just to remind people, you know, we actually if you look back Glenn, we did a lot of this around 2020 because of the same discussion came up and then in 2022 or 2023 there was the same discussion about we're heading into recessions, consumers are going to spend down their money, the consumers quit. Turned out not to be true frankly in a 2022-2023 timeframe the consumer held in. So if you look, you know we always are testing everything on a continuous basis in a trading book stress test but on a quarterly basis across the things. If you think about all the different ways the economy can get knocked into recession or potential recession or lower growth.\nRemember the whole world is predicting a lot lower growth this year than last year. That's not new, that's just all the Street, our economist, et cetera, so that the growth is slowing down from a 3% growth rate the third quarter of last year. You have to 1ish type of numbers, are a little bit less than 1 this year in the Blue Chip in the first quarter. So over two quarters a pretty good drop. So that's all embedded in it.\nBut why we're trying to give you reassurances or a look at the in depth is because it's a source of strength for us, and we've been working at that hard to ensure that as we go through a crisis and we've had a couple bumps in the road as we go through a more traditional economic downturn, we will be in great shape, and we test that every quarter in lots of different ways. But if you sit there and say, what happens if tariffs happen? This happens. This happens. It's going to result in either GDP negative growth, higher inflation, which may then cause GDP negative growth, higher unemployment, et cetera. All those are the factors we actually test in granular detail. So it's not necessarily how you get there; it's the outcome of getting there. The GDP falloff, housing price falloff, unemployment levels. That's what we do.\nAnd we wanted to make sure we were positioned at the end of the day, that we could serve our clients well and not have to be pulling back. And so that's where the underwriting discipline of the last decade holds you in good stead if in fact we do enter a recession in the future.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nThanks for all that Brian.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHey, Brian, hearing this call and. It sounds like it could have been the Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. You know, loans are growing, deposits are growing, credit's fine, consumer spending slowing, but still growing. You're buying back more stock. I'm just trying to reconcile the $7 trillion of lost stock market wealth with comments from you. Sounds like you're not blinking. By the way, I don't think you're alone. It just seems more upbeat relative to what the stock market's done. I'm trying to reconcile those two things. What am I missing? Or what are you seeing? Or at what point do you say, hey, wait a minute, this is really might be a bigger problem?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nI think, Mike, you're laying out the difference between is and could and might and should in future. Right? So what we're trying to do is make sure people see what is going on today. And like you said, for the. And that's why you actually split the two pieces of the presentation. For the first quarter, everything you said is true. Loans, deposits, credit's good. Charge offs went down. Delinquencies are down at the end of the quarter versus fourth quarter. You're looking at all that and saying, okay, that's what we did. Then if we look forward, you know, our economists, your economists, I'm sure, are all predicting a slowdown in growth.\nAnd the core question will be when all these different policies and stuff come together in response to the policies by, you know, other trading partners, to the tariff policies, by the policies on deregulation, working for that, the tax bill which comes out. All that will mix together and come to an outcome. And our job is to have position the company well and take advantage of opportunities while that outcome hasn't happened yet. And when it comes to being a good position. And that's why this latter part of this was geared towards showing you the strength of the credit portfolios and other things. At the end of the day, you and I know that the real risk in a balance sheet of a bank is going to be its credit posture heading into a general recession.\nOur colleagues have raised their probability of recession, lowered their growth, as have the Blue Chips. But even if you look at the people who redid it, it's a very slight recession, and we should fare well in that, but we just don't. Nobody has a perfect crystal ball, whatever the right word is for the future. But we're positioned our company for everything. But we don't want people to lose sight of the strong performance of this company and our team in the first quarter 2025.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nLet me take the other side of that. I thought the idea was to make it easier to do business with deregulation, and you can see the nominations people, and then you get the policies. If that narrative plays out, how do you think it'll be easier to do business at Bank of America and with your customers as it relates to deregulation?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nI think the new administration has made it clear that they're going to reduce the regulatory burden along two dimensions. Dimension one is, I think, less new regulations and getting other regulations off the books or refining them based on the view that the pendulum is going too far, now talking about bank regulations, but it's actually more broad. The second way is actually reduce the size of the federal administration that brings, you know, the regulatory inquiries and things like that. So we're seeing, you know, some relief. We look forward to seeing more relief as the nominees get in a position and the policy outlines can be then drilled throughout the teams. But, you know, it's critically important that we get this rebalance. We want to run a company that is going to be well capitalized, great liquidity, fair to consumers, et cetera. Mike.\nBut sometimes the regulation gets in the way of that and way overshot the issues, and we look forward to having it come back in the middle. And just take all the debate about Treasury trading. The SLR requires us to hold capital at a level against riskless assets, Treasuries, and cash. That doesn't make a lot of sense. And we've been saying that for a long time, and we expect now we've heard it said that there'll be relief in that, that will help us provide liquidity to our clients both in good times and times of stress. But you know that you remember our cash and our government guaranteed securities and government issued securities is $1.2 trillion on our balance sheet right now, Mike.\nSo think about that in terms of, and capitalizing that under the SLR, you know, 5% or whatever it is. And that's a big number, you know, and none of that has any risk attached to you, as you well know. And so that's one thing. The second thing we saw it again this quarter on some of the expenses is the operational cost to deal with, you know, the regulatory push that happened that we tried to talk the last set of administrators into. You're going way too far and you've gone past the substance into form, you know, is a cost that we're going to see come out of the system and ought to be reinvested in helping our customers and clients grow.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nShort follow-up: the $1.2 trillion in cash in government, where would that be? Kind of in a more ideal world, and the operating costs, how much of that could potentially be saved? Even if you want to give some estimate to the industry, just order of magnitude.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nYes. I'm not sure it would be tremendously different by hundreds of billions of dollars, but I'd say a few hundred billion of it's pure size that we all added to meet a bunch of metrics that I'm not sure as important as people may think they are, you know, and that's proved out. So think of that as our long-term debt posture being up higher, et cetera. So you know, our job is to, you know, we got $2 trillion deposits, $1 trillion of loans, we need to extract the value of that deposit. You know, our size ought to be more generated by that question and less about. Well, we want you to just add stuff because we're not sure that the Treasury, the market for repo of asset-backed securities will be available in a time of stress or even Treasuries.\nAnd so therefore you have to hold more capital and more term funding against those, are the things which change. So you probably see it most in our long-term debt footprint coming down relative size and, and our sheer size coming down, I don't know, $150 billion maybe. I think Alastair would probably be a good guess if we've grown really just fluffed up the balance sheet to make metrics that are not that important look good.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you. Good morning. Understanding that there's a lot of potential moving pieces in the regulatory agenda or deregulatory agenda. I did notice that at the end of the year, your G-SIB score would indicate that if you didn't take down your exposure this year, you would have a higher G-SIB surcharge by January first 2027. From what I understand, all else being equal. I'm just wondering, Brian, Alastair, if your plans are to reduce this exposure or the metrics. Look, you know, our ROTCE is 13.9% and improving. So, you know, crossing is not going to be a big deal because of the PP&R and return power that we see going forward.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nSo I think that relates back to. I think it was Glenn's question about the markets business, if I remember who asked it. You know, at the end of the day, most of what drives that change is the markets business. There are other factors, obviously, Erika, but the big factors, the markets business, and if they're out there getting market share and getting the return on that, we'll keep growing through that. That's in effect why we have gone up the chunk we've gone up. Now go back to sort of Mike's point and frankly, I think embedding your question, think about the facts that the G-SIB calculations at the time they were set, I think it was off of 2012 data or something like that, 2012 data. The idea, and it's right in the rules, was that they should be indexed so that our relative position, Bank of America, relative position to the industry and the economy.\nWe ought to be able to grow. We've had a nominal economy growth of 30% in the last since the pandemic to now, just sheer size growth, of which there is no adjustment in the G-SIB calculations for that. It was in the statute. It hasn't been implemented. You've heard in some of the even discussion by the Fed that they would index a lot of. One of the proposals was from sort of now forward, which then skips all the growth. Our belief is it should be indexed, you know, more fairly as designed in the statute because our relative size hasn't grown even though our balance sheet's grown to the economy or to the industry. So why are we more G-SIB sized than we were before? So I think that's the two sides of trade. Yes, we'd let.\nIf the market business can get the returns and grow and do it in a way that sticks to the ribs, Jim, and the team will grow and that will probably push our G-SIB, but back up and think about the reality of it. You know, you're now looking at Bank of America and our peers circa 2014-2015 off of 2012 data, if I remember the exact date. Think about the sheer size of the U.S. economy probably, you know, 50%-60% bigger, and we have not indexed anything for this. Therefore, we're shrinking our banking size relative to the economy for the same without kind of a logic behind it. That's what we've been pushing about.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it. I'll follow up offline. Just wanted to squeeze my second question in. Follow up on the Net Interest Income outlook for fourth quarter. You helped us with the exit points on both Balance Sheet and Net Interest Margin in the last call. If I recall. It was flat to fourth quarter levels in 2024, and I think a 2.05-2.10 net interest margin. Are those points still valid in terms of what's underneath the surface of that 4Q 2025 exit? NII obviously, the balance sheet is bigger because of markets in the first quarter.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYep, I think you've captured it, Erika. You're exactly right. We're comfortable with that.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank You.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. I just want to follow up on the concept of growing into the capital. Slide eight here has a really good walk on the capital and the puts and takes, and I guess I want to hone in on the RWA growth and just think about that going forward. Obviously there's some increase in 1Q from seasonal stuff in markets, but maybe it won't be as much going forward and the loan growth might pick up a little bit. But what I'm getting at is it's not that clear to me that you're going to use all the capital that you're generating and the excess from organic growth. It does feel like the buybacks at some point will be at a pretty robust pace. So anyway, long story, one question just to summarize, like talk about the capital consumption in a little more detail from organic growth and the interplay buyback. Thanks.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nMatt. I think you sort of answered your own question in the question because you could see that a $16 billion RWA increase in a quarter where markets tends to be bigger just because the nature of it. So that's on $1.7 trillion. So less than 1% growth in RWA and the earnings growth through. So we will always, always, always deploy capital into the businesses at whatever they need to grow the businesses with the right returns, that's a given. In fact, the efficiency of our RWA deployment is something we work on all the time. And that's why you can see you have the growth in size relative to RWA. And we think we have room to go on. This is always less than the overall growth in the loans and deposits. And so we'll continue to work that efficiencies. But you've got exactly right.\nThe capital goes to deploy to support the business. It's going at a much lower rate than the business's demands for that are much lower than the capital accumulation. Then we turn around and say, what do we do with it? Well, you have a common dividend, obviously, and then the rest goes to buybacks. You saw us step that up this quarter, as Alistair said earlier, to $4.5 billion. This, meaning the first quarter.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, and then that's helpful. And then just separately, that all other fee line on a consolidated basis was pretty close to break even versus normally a loss because of some of your tax credits. Is that just some lumpy items like loan sale gains or marks given some of the things that we saw in the marketplace this quarter or Q1, Q2?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYeah, no, you got that mostly right. The other income line this quarter, as in every quarter, it's generally most impacted by what's going on with our tax credit activity. And often it depends on the timing of the completion of really long dated projects. Could be solar, could be wind farms, could be housing. So in any given quarter there can be some timing there where we catch up in later quarters. But in this particular quarter, in addition to that, we've got.\nThe leverage finance positions that we refer to, we'd written those down in prior quarters, so when we sold them this period for a gain, that accounts for a reasonable amount of the delta. And then the only other thing you just got to remember is we had that legal settlement pretty long-dated. One got that cleaned up, little bit of Visa B cleaned up this quarter. So there's some one-timers that offset that, but it's probably worth about $0.03 this quarter just to give you some idea.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, all right, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning. How are you doing?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thanks. Betsy, how are you?\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Great quarter. I did have two quick questions. One was on Brian. Earlier in the call, we talked about how some of the commercial loan growth was being generated by the investments you've been making, in particular one of the areas, international. So I just wanted to, with this tariff overhang that we have going forward, how do you think about that investment spend in the international markets? Do you step it up? Do you pull it back? Is it an opportunity? Is it a threat, a risk? Just wanted to understand that angle from you. Thank you.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nSo I think a lot of that's to be played out. But we would continue to invest where we see the opportunities, and where we see opportunity outside the United States is with the teams that we have that have been in these countries: Japan, since the day after World War II ended, India for 65+ years, Australia for 60+ years, and the European countries for many years. We're deeply embedded in those countries. And the idea was we basically are coming from pure multinational largest companies and those national champions and taking them around the world and taking companies from outside that particular country into those countries.\nWe will then. We're now moving down a notch in size, strong family-owned business in the production supply chains for business. We understand. I don't think that will change dramatically the product, the goods, and products start to be produced. And so we'll continue to work with. We're watching our clients and helping try to figure out what this all means to them in terms of supply chain alignment and things like that. So I think it may ebb and flow. But remember when you then take the other side of where the investment is in the United States, you know, that's where it's just a larger factor in terms of the overall commercial business, meaning small business.\nWe're the largest small business lender in the United States by quite a bit. Those loans are growing, selling them a small business meaning FDIC loans under a million, which we both have in our consumer business, in our business banking area, and then middle market largest, you know, one of the largest lenders in the United States, and then large corporate. So, because of the diversity of our company, we'll see what might not be as possible in a place due to the dynamics you're describing may be more possible in a place like Georgia. So we'll keep playing this out.\nBut the goal was to have relationship manager investments on a relentless pace to keep adding our team that's dedicated towards handling client relationships, and then frankly making more efficient by the use of machine learning, now AI, to make them more and more efficient and also where to call, who to call on the prospect lists we have. We're seeing that take hold. That's where you're seeing these logos just build up in new client acquisitions.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, thank you. That was my second question. On the small business side, can you help us understand what you're seeing today from small business? I know you are, as you mentioned, the largest small business lender, and you've had significant loan growth over the past several years in small business, way ahead of peers. And so you're the closest to these folks in our world. And I would love to understand how they are thinking about investing in this environment with the tariff overhang. Thanks.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nBetsy, they're just trying to figure it out. And so they see the policies along multiple deregulations, the tariff policy, immigration policies, et cetera, and they look at all of it and say in tax policy. And so they, they're trying to figure out how it affects their business in the end of the day today they're producing the goods and the goods are going out in the stream and being sold. But they're trying to figure out how, how that relates to it. And there's, you know, the concerns I think that were interesting is for a while it was inflation obviously coming through last year when that was a discussion, then it interestingly flipped to labor again, which was a little bit unique in that they're trying to make sure they get the qualified employees they need to operate.\nBut if you look about it, you know, they're basically sanguine on the current environment, but they're worried, they're worried about how this will affect their businesses and where they should invest. And I think that's slowing down some of their decision path right now because they're trying to figure out if my goods and services, will I be able to pass through the price, do I need to change my business plans in terms of growth, should I buy that piece of, of equipment? That's why line usage has been relatively muted still and we continue to try to grow it. Now there's areas which in our small business growth which are sort of recession resistant, which is like in health care we have a big business lending to docs, veterinarians, and other people involved.\nIn practice, those things tend to have less impact by the issues at the moment because their services business and things like that. So I think it depends on the business, depends on location, depends on whether in services or whether in goods. But right now, if they look at the last quarter, just like we're going to look at, it looks pretty strong, then they're going to sit there and say read the papers and see all the things coming at them and saying should I slow down? My decisioning that I think is the worry because once they talk themselves into slowing down, it'll be a while until they get restarted. Right now, I think it's more thoughts and then worries, and they've got to see this settle in, and when it settles in, then they know how to run their business. But right now it's very unsettling for them.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Ken Usdin with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nGood morning. Thank you again for the interest income outlook slide. The waterfall I wanted to ask on the fixed rate asset repricing bucket, can you help us understand how much is rolling off each quarter in the HTM securities and mortgage loan books and what you're getting from that? And then also as we get closer to that second half benefit on the cash flow hedges, what type of pickups are you imagining in terms of like new fixed rate vs receive rate vs what's rolling off? Thank You.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nSo Ken, on held-to-maturity. If you look back over the last 14 quarters, it sort of been around $8 billion - $9 billion a quarter. It depends a little on the seasonality as we go through the year. So $8 billion this quarter, but maybe $9 billion next quarter. And normally when those are rolling off, we're picking up 200-225 basis points just to give you some idea. So that's that bucket around residential mortgages. Let's say we're originating $5 billion a quarter. Typically we're picking up a couple hundred basis points, sometimes more on those just to pay. Depends on prevailing market rates. So think about that being $5 billion at a couple hundred basis points or more. And then the cash flow swaps, we'll talk more about those as we go into the second half.\nBut you can think about that as being something where we're probably picking up 150 basis points or so. It just depends on any given quarter. So we'll give you a little more guidance as we get closer.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay, great. And then second question. You guys did another great job getting deposit costs down 20 basis points for the second straight quarter. As you contemplate this growth that you're seeing and continuing, how do you think about, you know, just how much you can continue to reduce rates paid relative to, you know, how you're seeing just the overall cost of funding. Thanks.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYes. I don't think we'll have any change in our philosophy there. We felt like when it comes to the commercial and the wealth clients in particular, where they have interest bearing balances, we just pass through the cuts. And then as it relates to the consumer book, we've got an awful lot of non interest bearing there. Obviously, so really you're focused there on the piece that's in the CDs and then the preferred deposits, and there again we tend to pass that through as it comes through. So. So it's trickier obviously in consumer where we're paying 61 basis points on $950 billion. But even there, just because we still have some CDs outstanding and we still have some preferred, we were able to take that down last quarter and look to do that again in the future.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nThanks, Alistair.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our last question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nHi Brian. Hi Alistair.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nHi There.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nYou guys did a very good job in giving us the details about what it looked like back in 2009 versus today on slide 22. If we move up to slide 21, you can see the consumer loan portfolio has obviously been de-risked as you pointed out. What I'd like to ask a question about is the commercial loan portfolio, particularly the growth. Can you guys share with us some of the confidence you have that we're not going to see some issues here? Particularly you look at the dark blue non-U.S. commercial has grown very, very strongly over this time period. What can you share with us about the risk in this portfolio relative to maybe 2009?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYeah, so I'll start, Gerard. I'd say we felt like over time, as we've become a more global and international company than maybe we were in 2007, it was important for us to diversify the loan book outside of just the U.S., and it was appropriate because we've got to support clients who are multinationals in the United States operating around the world and multinationals around the world who also operate and sell into the United States and other places. So that's natural. I think we've kind of supported that over time. That's been a big part of our growth over a 15-year period. Now in terms of commercial, if you look at the loan growth overall, I'd say we're pretty diversified in the way we look at that.\nSo all lines of business grew last quarter. So that's small business banking. It's business banking. It's the commercial bank ex-CRE. It's the global corporate investment bank. It's global markets and it's wealth in terms of their commercial exposure. So a little bit of it is diversification in all lines of business. And then, if you looked at the book itself, for the most part, as we talked about, it's secured. It's investment grade.\nWe always think about good client selection. It's the sort of people who can make it through any environment. That's where we're investing and partnering, and we've had virtually no charge-offs. So then when you turn to like the global markets business that again, very diversified, all assets, all client types across things like asset banks, mortgage warehouse, credit financing, and subscription. So we feel like this book is in very good shape. We feel like they're the right clients, and then for our teams, it's just about driving the relationship deepening to make sure that we're seeing benefit not just in the loan portfolio, but in the other things we do across the platform.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nVery good, very insightful. Thank you. And then as a follow up, Alistair, you guys mentioned that the credit card charge-off ratio was a seasonally higher number at just over 4%. And when we go back to first quarter 2024 and 2023, obviously the charge-off levels were lower. Especially with the unemployment rate remaining as low as it has over the last couple of years. Is the higher level due to some of that FICO score inflation we've read about during the pandemic? What do you guys account for the number being where it is today versus the last couple of first quarters of each of those prior years? Considering that the unemployment rate, for example, has not gone up that much.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nYeah, I think I'd flip it around the other way, Gerard, that with all the stimulus and all the, you know, after the pandemic wage growth for inflation, the stimulus that came in just sheer cash, you saw these things drop to levels that we knew wouldn't, you know, wouldn't hold. Right. Meaning charge-off rates in the card went way down. And all you see now is it sort of normalized around where it was in a very good credit period for our company in the 2019 pre-pandemic type of era.\nSo that's just normalization. I wouldn't overread that. It's a comparative period. So if you look relative to 2019, 2018, you'd see that those charge-off rates running 3.5-ish ± percent or similar to we have now. So we feel good about it. You know, important thing is, you know, if you look at stressing that portfolio like we do, you know, you can see that the, you know, the losses that are projected, whether it's in the CCAR process or own internal stress test, you know, if you take it, take it across nine quarters, it doesn't come. It's closer to honestly the charge-off rate we actually underwrote to prior to the financial crisis.\nWe underwrote to like a 5.5% charge-off rate in normal times, and then it would go up from there. So it's a much more core book driven at a very strong performance through crisis. So I think, I just, I think it's just normalizing more to where, you know, where it was in the relatively good credit times in 2019 rather than any significant movement. In fact, we said that as we came through last year over and over again; people kept doubting it. What you've seen is delinquency actually have fallen, and it's flattened out in terms of the billion-dollar charge-off leveling cards.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nGot it. Thank you, Brian.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nOkay, well, thank you. I think that's all our questions. I just wanted to think about the three. Two or three things. One, thanks to the team for another good quarter. Thank you. And thank you all for participating in our call. Number two, as I said earlier, the story of the first quarter is a strong operating performance, growth in organic client activity, growth in revenue and earnings, managed expenses well, and over a period of time we continue to make investments to position the company for the future. On the other hand, we gave you the latter part of this presentation to show you our multifarious loan book and how that diversity of types of clients, collateral types, and geographies, and all that, holds us in good stead, as not only by our own internal models, but also by the comparison of stress tests.\nIn addition, we talked about how we're well reserved heading into whatever may be in front of us. So our job is to serve our clients in all times and that's what we plan to do. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful afternoon."

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Lee McEntire. You may begin.\n\nLee McEntire\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Bank of America\n\nGood morning. Thank you. Welcome. Thank you for coming to the call to discuss our fourth quarter results. Our earnings release documents are available in the investor relations section of the bankofamerica.com website, and they include the earnings presentation that we'll make reference to during this call. I hope everyone had a chance to review the documents. Our CEO, Brian Moynihan, will make some opening comments before Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, discusses the details of the quarter. Let me just remind you before we start that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and the assumptions that are subject to risk and uncertainties. Factors that may cause our actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in the earnings materials and the SEC filings available on our website.\nInformation about our Non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to US GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials that are available on the website. So with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nSo good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin today, I just want to express our deep concern for our community's clients and teammates impacted by the California wildfires. Our top priority, of course, is ensuring the safety and welfare of our team and helping our clients and customers. Our imperturbable market president, Raul Anaya, is leading our team out there. We have teams on the ground assisting in any way we can and are monitoring the situation to extend support and resources. So far, we have activated our client assistance program, donated $1 million in disaster relief to the American Red Cross, and additional contributions to the LA Food Bank, and the LA Chamber of Commerce small business efforts. With that, let's turn to earnings starting on page two of the presentation. This morning, we reported $6.7 billion in net income.\nThat is $0.82 in EPS for Q4. That was a solid finish to another good year at Bank of America. We grew revenue on a year-over-year basis in every category in Q4. We saw good loan and deposit growth. And Alastair's going to walk you through some of the details of the quarter in a moment, but I want to thank our team for another great year. For the full year of 2024, we generated $102 billion of revenue and reported net income of $27.1 billion, EPS of $3.21. We produced 83 basis points return on assets and 13% return on tangible common equity. We generated these results working from a strong balance sheet that allowed us to support clients, and the economy has continued to grow. The economy appears to be now settled into a 2% to 3% GDP-type growth environment.\nIt has healthy employment levels and a resilient consumer. The tenacity of the American consumer can be seen in our data. So far, in the first two weeks in January, they're spending money at a 4% to 5% clip over last year, similar to what they did in the fourth quarter. On our business side, the clients are profitable, they're liquid, and seeing good productivity. We ended the year with $953 billion of liquidity. We also ended with $201 billion of regulatory CET1 capital and a CET1 ratio of 11.9%, leaving us nearly 115 basis points of excess capital as we begin 2025. For Bank of America, the year was characterized by a few important highlights that played out as expected and were consistent with our communications to you throughout the year.\nFirst, we saw net interest income bottom out at $13.9 billion on an FTE basis in Q2 2024. We ended the year with Q4 2024 on the same FTE basis at $14.5 billion. Then that was a bit better than we expected. This obviously provides a great starting point for 2025, and based on the assumptions Alastair is going to discuss a little later, we should report record NII in 2025. So how did we do that? We drove organic growth in all the businesses, and that we have highlighted on slide three. We saw continued growth in net new checking, new households, new companies, and commercial banking growth in our institutional markets business. This organic activity enabled us to grow loans and deposits at a pace we believe is to be ahead of our industry average and our peers.\nA key for us, obviously, is the growth in our deposit franchise. If you look at slide four, you can see we've now grown deposits for six consecutive quarters. In the most recent quarter, we saw growth in consumer balances and stability around non-interest-bearing balances across all the businesses. We continued to price in a disciplined manner, and rates paid moved lower this quarter across the board. Overall rate paid on deposits moved from 210 basis points in the third quarter to 194 basis points this quarter, and we're lower in the fourth quarter, and we're lower in every business segment. On the loan side, consumer loans grew in every category linked quarter.\nCommercial loan demand continued to build off the strength we saw in the third quarter of 2024, and commercial loans grew 5% year-over-year for the fourth quarter at a much faster annualized pace when comparing the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2024. So back to slide three. In our wealth management business, we added 24,000 new households in 2024. We ended the year with $6 trillion in total client balances that we managed for people in America across our global wealth and consumer businesses. Our consumer investments team, what we call Merrill Edge, crossed a new milestone this quarter and now sits in excess of $518 billion in balances. Investment banking gained share of industry revenue in 2024. Our sales and trading team put up the 11th straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth and achieved a new full-year record of nearly $19 billion in revenue.\nAsset quality stabilized and remained strong with net charge loss declining modestly from third quarter. Early in the year, we highlighted that our expectation on consumer credit is that they would stabilize to normal level, and on commercial office losses, they would trend down during the year. We saw both those trends continue into quarter four. On the expense side, we continue to invest in our franchise. Even though spending increases in brand, people, and technology, and strong fee growth, which drove incentive and transaction processing costs higher, we managed to create operating leverage in the fourth quarter. Our digitalization and engagement expanded across all our businesses. We saw more than 14 billion logins to our digital platforms in 2024. Our Erica capability surpassed 2.5 billion interactions from its inception, and our CashPro app surpassed $1 trillion in payments made through the app in 2024.\nIt's also worth noting that digital sales in our consumer product areas crossed 60% in Q4 again. You can see all these trends in our industry-leading digital disclosure on slides 26, 28, and 30 in the appendix. All of this success and balance sheet strength allowed us to deliver more capital back to our shareholders. We returned $21 billion of capital to shareholders in 2024, which was 75% more than 2023 and included an 8% increase in the common dividend. So in summary, for both Q4 and for the year, we enjoyed good profitability. We drove healthy returns. We saw good organic client activity across all the businesses. We continued to manage the risk well and increased the capital delivered back to our shareholders. And we positioned ourselves well for growth in 2025.\nI want to again thank my team for continuing to drive another year of responsible growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Alastair.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nThank you, Brian. I'm going to start on slide five of the earnings presentation because it'll provide just a little more context on the quarter. For the fourth quarter, as Brian noted, we reported $6.7 billion in net income or $0.82 per share. Before we talk about comparisons between periods, I just need to remind you that our fourth quarter 2023 GAAP net income number included two notable items. In the fourth quarter of 2023, first, we recorded $2.1 billion of pre-tax expense for the special assessment by the FDIC to the industry to recover losses from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. That reduced EPS last year by $0.20.\nSecond, we recorded a negative pre-tax impact to our market-making revenue of approximately $1.6 billion related to the cessation of BSBY as an alternative rate, and that reduced earnings per share last year by $0.15. So when you adjust for the large FDIC assessment and the BSBY cessation charge, Q4 2023 net income was $5.9 billion or $0.70 per share. On Slide 6, we note some of the highlights of the quarter, and we reported revenue of $25.5 billion on a fully taxable equivalent basis, up 15% from Q4 2023. If you exclude the Q4 2023 BSBY cessation charge, our revenues grew 8% year-over-year. As Brian said, all the revenue items are showing improvement year-over-year. NII grew 3%. Investment banking grew 44%.\nThis quarter, our $4 billion of sales and trading revenue marked a fourth quarter record, and it grew 10% from the year-ago period. Investment and brokerage fees rose 21%, with both assets under management flows and market levels contributing nicely to the growth. Our card income and service charges grew 7%. Non-interest expense was $16.8 billion and was up when adjusted for the FDIC special assessment, driven by incentives paid for the strong revenue growth, as Brian noted, and the related activity costs that come with that. Expense also included additional investments in people, technology, and brand, with some major partnerships announced recently. It included what we expect to be the peak in quarterly costs associated with enhancing our compliance costs and controls. The good news is we created operating leverage in the quarter.\nProvision expense for the quarter was $1.5 billion and was consistent with the previous two quarters. Lastly, returns in the fourth quarter were 80 basis points of ROA and 13% return on tangible common equity. Turning to the balance sheet on slide seven, we ended the quarter at $3.26 trillion of total assets, down $63 billion from the third quarter, driven by seasonally lower levels of client activity in global markets, while loans across the businesses grew $20 billion in the quarter. Otherwise, in the quarter, the investments of our excess liquidity saw a $9 billion reduction in hold-to-maturity securities. At the same time, the combination of shorter-term liquidity investments of cash and available-for-sale securities increased $28 billion. On the funding side, total deposits grew $35 billion on an ending basis as both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing grew.\nLong-term debt fell $14 billion, driven by net redemptions and valuations, and global markets funding declined in line with assets. Liquidity remains strong with $953 billion of global liquidity sources. That is up modestly compared to the third quarter, even as we paid down some debt and retired some preferreds. Shareholders' equity was flat at around $295 billion. Within all of that, we returned $5.5 billion of capital back to shareholders, with $2 billion in common dividends paid, and the repurchase of $3.5 billion in shares this quarter. Tangible book value per share of $26.58 rose 9% from the fourth quarter last year. Turning to regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $201 billion, and the CET1 ratio rose to 11.9%, remaining well above our new 10.7% requirement. Risk-weighted assets increased modestly as increases in loans were mostly offset by lower RWA supporting our global markets client activity.\nOur supplementary leverage ratio was 5.9% versus a minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves some capacity for balance sheet growth. Our $460 billion of total loss-absorbing capital means our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. Let's turn to slide 8. We can go a little deeper on loans by looking at average balances. Loans in Q4 of $1.08 trillion improved 3% year-over-year, driven by solid commercial loan growth. Overall, commercial loans grew 5% year-over-year. Importantly, this included an 8% drop in commercial real estate loans. Commercial loans excluding commercial real estate grew 7% year-over-year, and consumer loans grew modestly both linked quarter and year-over-year. As Brian said, on a linked quarter basis, every category of consumer lending grew, and you can see that at the bottom of slide 8.\nIf we turn our focus to NII performance and use slide nine, regarding NII on a GAAP non-fully taxable equivalent basis, NII in Q4 was $14.4 billion. On a fully taxable equivalent basis, NII was $14.5 billion. Several quarters ago, we signaled our expectation that NII would trough in the second quarter of 2024 and begin to grow from there. This represents now our second quarter of NII growth. We expect that growth to continue in 2025. In fact, if you look at the two quarters after the inflection point, NII is already growing at a 5% rate. Fourth quarter NII on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased by $399 million from the third quarter, driven by a number of factors. First, it was led by improvement in deposits across the businesses.\nEven as deposit balances increased linked quarter, our interest expense on those deposits declined by $600 million. Loan growth and fixed-rate asset repricing also benefited us again this quarter. With regard to a forward view, interest rate expectations continue to drive volatility and predictability, but will provide some thoughts for future NII. We expect to start the year in Q1 with NII modestly higher than Q4. Remember that Q1 has two fewer days of interest, and that's roughly the equivalent of about $250 million of NII equivalent. So even with that, we expect to grow modestly. Now, we expect that growth to increase through the year to the point where it could be 6% to 7% higher in 2025 than 2024.\nWe expect to exit the year at least a billion higher in the fourth quarter, and that would put us in a range of $15.5 billion to 15.7 billion on a fully taxable equivalent basis. And that's obviously significantly higher than the Q2 2024 trough of $13.9 billion. I have to note the following assumptions. First, we assume that the current forward curve materializes. And while the interest rate curve has changed significantly over a fairly short period of time, as of 10 January 2024, the curve was expecting only one rate cut in 2025 that may come in May or June. Based on our more recent growth experience, we're assuming loan and deposit growth in 2025 that's higher than 2024 and more consistent with growth in a 2% to 3% GDP environment.\nThe other elements of anticipated growth in NII expected are the benefits of asset repricing as fixed-rate securities, loans, and swaps roll off, and those get repriced at higher rates. Those themes all remain consistent with our prior conversations with you in the last several earnings calls. With regard to interest rate sensitivity, on a dynamic deposit basis, we provide a 12-month change in NII for an instantaneous shift in the curve above or below the forward curve. On that basis, a 100 basis point increase would benefit NII by roughly $1 billion, while a decrease of 100 basis points would decrease NII over the next 12 months by $2.3 billion. Lastly, note that our slide showing the trended investment of excess deposits is in our appendix. It's on page 21.\nDeposit levels grew to $870 billion over loans at the end of Q4, and that's an incredible source of value for shareholders. $649 billion, or 54% of our excess liquidity, is now in short-dated cash and available for sale securities. The longer-dated, lower-yielding hold-to-maturity book continues to roll off, and we continue to reinvest in higher-yielding assets. Okay, let's now turn to expense, and we'll use slide 10 for the discussion. We reported $16.8 billion in expense this quarter, and the fourth quarter of 2023 included the large FDIC special assessment charge, and excluding that, expense increased. The increased expense from prior periods was driven by a number of factors and was partially offset by a roughly $300 million release of prior-period accruals for the FDIC special assessment. Let's talk about the drivers of the expense.\nFirst, in regard to revenue, our markets-related businesses of investment banking, investment and brokerage, and sales and trading, those were up 20% year-over-year. Incentives for the firm were up 15% versus the fourth quarter of 2023, and were in large part related to these markets-related revenue streams. On investments that we made, we added bankers and advisors across most of our businesses in 2024, and we also increased investments in our brand with significant sponsorships like The Masters and FIFA, to name a few. And we increased our investments around technology as well as financial centers. This quarter alone, we added 17 financial centers, with nine of those in our new expansion markets. We're a growth company, and we continue to invest in our future.\nAs far as headcount goes, we've managed our headcount carefully, and we've held it fairly flat through the four quarters of 2024 at around 213,000 people. Lastly, we incurred additional costs to accelerate work on compliance and controls. As you likely saw in late December, the OCC issued a compliance consent order to Bank of America, and that's a result of exams done more than a year ago. This order is about correcting or enhancing certain deficiencies in some aspects of our processes that existed at the time. The order doesn't limit any of our growth plans, and the order acknowledges we began taking corrective actions before the order was announced. As a result of the work in process, we increased our resources substantially in H2 2024, and those costs are already embedded in our quarterly run rate.\nOkay, let's go back to expense and how to think about a forward view. First, most importantly, we remain focused on growing the company and driving operating leverage. Second, we expect the first quarter to include some normal seasonal elevation, and we believe this amount will be roughly $600 to 700 million, primarily for payroll tax expense. We think $17.6 billion is a good number to expect for Q1 before seasonally declining in Q2. That's all part of our expectation that expense should be roughly 2% to 3% higher in 2025 compared to 2024. Let's now move to credit and turn to slide 11, where you can see net charge-offs of a little less than $1.5 billion, improving modestly compared to Q3. That's the fourth quarter now that net charge-offs are around $1.5 billion.\nWe've seen consumer losses in a pretty stable range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion over those past few quarters. On the commercial side, we saw losses of $359 million, which is down from the third quarter, driven by the continued decline in commercial real estate office losses. The net charge-off ratio this quarter was 54 basis points, down 4 basis points from the third quarter. We don't see overall net charge-offs or the related ratio changing much in 2025. Without much change in current GDP or the employment environment, we expect the net charge-off ratio to be in a range of 50 to 60 basis points of loans for 2025. Q4 provision expense was $90 million lower than Q3 at $1.5 billion, as reserve levels remained constant.\nAs it relates to reserve levels, on a weighted basis, we're reserved for an unemployment rate a little below 5% by the end of 2025, and that compares to the most recent 4.1% rate reported. On slide 12, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both consumer and commercial portfolios, and there's nothing really noteworthy here that I want to highlight on this page. Let's move to the various lines of business, starting on slide 13 with consumer banking. A business made nearly $11 billion, or 40% of the company's earnings in 2024. In the fourth quarter, consumer banking generated $10.6 billion in revenue and $2.8 billion in net income. Both grew modestly from the fourth quarter of 2023, as fee improvement for card and service charges is now being complemented by the growth in NII.\nConsumer banking continued to deliver strong organic growth with high-quality accounts and engaged clients, and they achieved a new record of client experience scores in December. The organic growth activity noted on slide three includes more than 200,000 net new checking accounts, which now takes us to six years' worth of quarter-after-quarter growth. And we show another strong period of card openings and investment account growth. Investment balances grew 22% to $518 billion, with full-year flows of $25 billion and market improvement throughout the year. Expense rose 8% as we continued investments in our business. The biggest story in consumer this quarter is deposits, because these are the most valuable deposits in the franchise. And in the last six months, we believe we've seen the floor begin to form after several periods of slowing decline.\nConsumer banking deposits appear to have bottomed in mid-August at around $928 billion and ended the year at $952 billion on an ending basis. Looking at averages, you can see then that deposits grew $4 billion from the third quarter to $942 billion, all while our rate paid declined to 64 basis points. Finally, as you can see in the appendix, page 26, digital adoption and engagement continued to improve, and customer satisfaction scores rose to record levels, illustrating our clients' appreciation of enhanced capabilities from these investments. On slide 14, we move to wealth management, where the business had a very profitable year, generating $4.2 billion in earnings from nearly $23 billion in revenue. In 2024, our Merrill Lynch and private bank advisors added another 24,000 net new relationships.\nThe professionalism of these teams earned them numerous best-in-class industry rankings, as you can see on slide 27 in the appendix. With a continued increase in banking product usage from our investing clients, the diversity of revenue in the wealth business continues to improve. The number of GWIM clients that now have banking products with us continues to grow, and at this point, it represents more than 60% of our clients. Importantly, about 30% of our revenue remains in net interest income, which complements the fees earned in our advice model, and those have also grown. Net income rose 15% from the fourth quarter of 2023 to nearly $1.2 billion. In the fourth quarter, we reported revenue of $6 billion, growing 15% over the prior year and led by 23% growth in asset management fees.\nWhile expenses were up year-over-year, they grew slower than revenue, creating the operating leverage in the business. The business had a 26% pre-tax margin and generated a strong return on capital of 25%. Average loans were up 4%, driven by growth in custom lending, securities-based lending, and a pickup in mortgage lending. Deposits grew 2% from Q3, and the teams were quite disciplined on pricing of those deposits. Both Merrill and the private bank continued to see strong organic growth, and that helped to produce excellent assets under management flows of $79 billion this year, reflecting a good mix of new client money as well as existing clients putting money to work. We also want to draw your attention to the continued digital momentum that you'll find on slide 28, because, for example, 3/4 of Merrill bank and brokerage accounts were open digitally this quarter.\nSlide 15 shows the global banking results, and this business generated $8.1 billion, or 30% of the company's earnings in 2024, and it continues to be the most efficient business in the company at less than 50% efficiency ratio. The business saw a nice rebound in investment banking fees in 2024, which we expect to continue in 2025. In Q4, global banking produced earnings of $2.1 billion. Pre-tax pre-provision results were flat year-over-year, as improved investment banking fees offset lower NII, and higher expense. The total earnings were down 13% year-over-year, driven by higher provision expense that came as a result of prior-period reserve release. Investment banking fees were $1.7 billion in Q4, growing 44% year-over-year. This was led by mergers and acquisitions. We also saw strength across debt capital markets fees, mostly in leverage finance, and in equity capital markets fees.\nWe finished the year strong, maintaining our number three investment banking fee position. Q4 saw strong momentum as the election results provided a lift to sentiment for a more pro-business climate and expectations for more deals to be completed. Expense in this business increased 6% year-over-year, driven by the 13% growth in non-interest income and continued investments in people and technology. The balance sheet saw good client activity, and it was muted somewhat by the strength of the US dollar. Year-over-year flatness in global banking loans includes this foreign exchange impact and the $6 billion decline in commercial real estate from paydowns. Otherwise, loans in global banking were up 2%. Deposits have been growing for many quarters now with our commercial and corporate clients. Total global banking deposits are now up 10% year-over-year, reaching a new record.\nSo we're seeing strong growth across all the categories from our corporate and commercial clients, all the way from the larger end to business banking on the lower end. We also saw 10% growth in our international deposits. Turning to global markets on slide 16, I want to focus my comments on results, excluding DVA, as we normally do. Our team continued their impressive streak of strong revenue and earnings performance. They achieved operating leverage, and they continued to deliver a good return on capital. For the year, record sales and trading results of nearly $19 billion grew 7% from 2023, and they've been growing consistently now on a year-over-year basis for almost three years. This led to $5.7 billion in full-year profits and represents more than 20% of the company's full-year results. In the fourth quarter, earnings of $955 million grew 30% year-over-year.\nRevenue, and again, this is ex-DVA, improved 15% from the fourth quarter of 2023, as both sales and trading, and investment banking fees improved nicely year-over-year. Focusing on sales and trading ex-DVA, revenue improved 10% year-over-year to $4.1 billion. This is the first time we've recorded more than $4 billion in our Q4 results, and it included Q4 records for both FICC and equities. FICC grew 13%, while equities improved 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. FICC benefited from tighter credit spreads, as well as increased volatility in interest rates, while equities benefited from increased activity around the US election. Year-over-year expenses were up 7% on revenue improvement and our continued investment in the business. And then on slide 17, you can see all other with a loss of $407 million in the fourth quarter.\nWe spoke earlier about the Q4 2023 charges for BSBY and the FDIC special assessment charge. Their reversal impacts the comparisons on revenue, expense, and net income in this segment. Otherwise, there really isn't anything significant to report here. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 6%, and excluding discrete items in the tax credits related to investments in renewable energy and affordable housing, the effective tax rate would have been approximately 26%. Looking forward, we expect the tax rate for 2025 to be in a range of 11 to 13%, and this just includes our expectation for higher expected earnings in 2025 and relatively stable tax credits. Finally, this quarter, on page 18, we thought it was important to summarize some of the guidance points we talked through this morning, and we hope you find this page helpful.\nSo in summary, we're looking for strong growth in NII, and we'll look to both continue important investments in the franchise and drive operating leverage as we grow throughout the year. We aren't expecting much movement around credit based on a pretty solid economic outlook, and we remain with a very strong balance sheet with excess capital that we can deploy to grow the business and deliver back to shareholders as appropriate. So with that, I'll stop there. I'll thank everybody, and we'll open it up for Q&A.\n\nOperator 4\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press the star and one on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star two. And we'll take our first question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHi, good morning, Brian. Good morning, Alastair.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nMorning.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nSo I wanted to start off, Alastair, with maybe unpacking some of the drivers of the NII growth in 2025. Now, how much of the build that you're guiding to is attributable to loan growth versus some rate or repricing tailwinds, runoff of legacy swaps, what have you? And does that acceleration in NII you cited for the second half continue into 2026, given some of those tailwinds should remain in place beyond 2025?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nWell, first of all, I admire you asking about 2026. I'm always reluctant to talk about the back half of 2025, so I'll leave 2026 for another time. But we don't have a whole lot new, Steven, relative to what we've talked about in the prior quarters. We're obviously pointing right now to deposit growth in particular because it's beginning to get back to something more normal. There was a period there where deposit balances were declining as people got back to something more normal in their accounts. But we're highlighting here, consumer found its floor in August, wealth found its floor in July, and that's giving some support then as we grow deposits. That's helping us with the NII growth. But that hasn't changed. It's just that now we've got successive quarters of growth that we can actually point to.\nThe loan growth that you asked about is interesting in that there were several quarters there where we were bouncing around flattish on loans. In Q2, we added $9 billion of loans. In Q3, we added $19 billion. In Q4, we added $20 billion. So the loan growth has picked up a little bit. We can sort of see a little more optimism with clients, a little more activity, a little more demand from clients for loan growth. So those two things, a little more confidence around deposit growth, a little more confidence around loan growth, those obviously compound through the course of the year, so that will help us in the back half of 2025. And then, as you pointed out, we're still a beneficiary of the fixed asset repricing.\nThat comes from some of the old loans that are on our books that come off in 2025 when we reprice. And then we've got some cash flow swaps that also will mature through the course of the year. So that's what leads us to this idea of we think the NII growth will accelerate to 6% to 7% for the full year. So a little bit of it, a little bit faster in the back half of the year, we kind of just see that, but that's what gives us the confidence on NII.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's great, Alastair. And maybe a follow-up for Brian. Just at a recent conference, you spoke about the expectation of delivering 200 basis points of sustainable operating leverage, laying out an algorithm where revenues grow 4% to 5%, expenses grow 2% to 3%. What gives you confidence in that ability to deliver that level of top-line growth on a sustainable basis? Just want to unpack that a little bit further.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nSo I think what gives us confidence is we have periods with stable rate environments, a stable economy growing at a slower rate than it is now, and having produced that for five years in a row, I think it was, by quarters or something like that. So it's not something we haven't done. But if you think about the current environment, what's driving is different. Our revenue growth is going at twice that rate plus, and the expense growth is growing close to that number. But when you get the higher growth rates, especially where it's coming from, wealth management business, market-based businesses, investment banking, it attaches a higher sort of instantaneous expense, and yet it still produces even a little bit of operating leverage at a higher growth rate, a good after-tax, a good EPS result, a good net operating income result.\nSo there's different times, different models. This is a model where the revenue is growing faster than it might grow all the time in more normalized environments. But the businesses coming from are those businesses which have the quickest move relative to expense. I'll give you an example of that. If you normalize last year's expense and think about our expectations from 2023 to 2024, and you look at the growth rate, a big part of the growth rate and expense, about 45% to 50% of it, is the incentives to the wealth management teammates, which is a good thing. And so that means revenue is growing, and we're taking about half of that in. And if you look at the other pieces added to that. So, Steven, it was simply put, we did it before. We know we can do it.\nYou can see the underlying setup, and you see NII kick in, the consumer business, which is more incrementally profitable because NII. You see that kick in, and you see the expense base there flattening out. You see the revenue base of the company broaden out. You'll see that we'll get back to the operating leverage that we expected, albeit it may be a little slower year-over-year growth rate, unless you're going to tell me the market's going to go up 25, 30% every year and drive the wealth management. When that slows down to a more normal growth rate, that'll slow down its expense growth rate also. Therefore, you'll see the opening up at that level. So it's not something we make up.\nIt's something we put in our operating principles, and it's something we have done a lot of quarters, but we have to sort of get the stability in the relative business position.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's great, Colour. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nAnd, Steve, the easiest thing to think about is headcount. The other day, our costs were all people, and that's been relatively stable, and that'll start to flow through because during the course of last year, we basically kept the headcount relatively stable. We had some offbeat expenses that we had to deal with, but now we're sort of settling into that 213,000 level of people with a takeout on stuff through operating excellence and a putting in on stuff into client coverage, expanding our pipes to draw more marketing, more client coverage, more technology investment. So we always are shifting expenses, and that's how we make that operating leverage happen.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nNo, it's a really good point. Thanks for the additional headcount nugget, Brian. Much appreciated.\n\nOperator 4\n\nWe'll move next to John McDonald with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nHi, good morning. Wanted to ask as a first question, just to follow up to Steve's NII questioning. Alastair, is the deposit growth in the model that you've laid out for the year being used to pay down more expensive funding? You've talked about the ability to kind of self-fund balance sheet growth. And then also, is there any sense of the yield pickup you get on the swap rolloff and replacement that you could give us kind of a ballpark on?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nJohn, before Alastair starts that, welcome back from the cold to be able to be back in coverage and covering our company. And it's always good to know that you're going to consistently ask about NII, but I'll turn it to Alastair to give you the question.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nThanks, Brian. Got to be typecast.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nThere you go. So I think your first question was, if we get the deposit growth we anticipate, do we think we'll use some of that to pay off some of the higher-cost liabilities on the balance sheet? The answer is yes. That's consistent with what we said in prior calls. We've done that. If you look at the other institutional CDs, you'll see they came down by another $7 billion this quarter. So as we grow the really high-quality parts of the deposit franchise, it allows us to take those down. And that's one of the things that's going to help grow net interest yield on an ongoing basis. It's not NII accretive necessarily, but it helps us with net interest yield. So that remains a part of the strategy, John. You'll see that continue.\nAs it relates to the cash flow swaps and how those reprice, no, we typically don't lay out the table of what we've got on and how it reprices over time, but it is embedded in our guidance. So each quarter, when I give you guidance for the next quarter, that will incorporate what we know is coming off on the cash flow swaps and how that does. The other fixed-rate assets, you can kind of see in our supplemental information just based on the originations of Resi Mortgage, the originations of auto loans. Every time, obviously, we're booking new residential mortgage, an old residential mortgage is coming off, we're picking up 250 basis points every time there. So you can see that happening each time you pick up the supplemental. We just don't tend to disclose the cash flow swaps.\nSo I will do that for you each quarter as we go through the year.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay. Just to switch topics, so Brian doesn't make fun of me.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nThat's all right. That's all right, John. Just kidding.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nNow, in terms of capital, how are you thinking about the CET1 target and the buffer that feels appropriate in this environment? And how does that play into your thinking on buybacks?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nSo I think we bought $3.5 billion this quarter. We'd expect to continue to step back to highest levels. We earned the money. We paid a dividend. We invest in the growth of the business, and then we use the rest of buyback stock. That was $3.5 billion in the past couple of quarters. So at this earnings rate, that seems a level that makes sense. We're 11.9 with a, we think at a 10.7 requirement, a buffer of 11.50, that's 11.2. Obviously, there's going to be some sort of changes in the capital rules, and we'll have to settle it after we see that.\nWe hope some relief in the volatility of the CCAR outcomes because remember that last year we jumped quite a bit without a lot of correlation to the actual risk of the company and stuff. Hopefully, we'll see that settle back in.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay. Does that leave you towards a mid-teens ROTCE target, Brian, as NIM normalizes and capital normalizes?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nYeah. I think the capital normalization will be more sort of holding that capital growth through it and not have to retain more capital for growth, frankly, if there's math that helps us favor it. But the NIM is probably more critical to move the yield from sub-2% this quarter, 2% this quarter to 2.10% plus at the end of Q4, and then moving from there. That, as you know, all that flows the bottom lines and will continue to drive the ROTCE back up. If you look back in the areas where there was any front-end, Fed funds was 2%. We were running a couple hundred basis points more. It's the huge zero-interest deposit base, especially in consumer and low-interest deposit base that provides a lot of leverage. So that'll be a driver.\nThe capital return would help some, but I think that'll be more complex based on all the different rules and what happens.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator 4\n\nWe'll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nHi. Thanks very much. I have a relative question on trading. I know how impossible it is to predict really the environments, but you took share in investment banking, and you've invested and gotten benefits from that. You have invested in trading. So maybe it's a weird question because you just put up record revenues in FICC and equities, as you mentioned. But when we see good environments like this, some companies tend to really blow out numbers. You guys have zero loss days. You don't tend to blow, blow out numbers. Is that a comment about gaps in the business mix that you'd like to invest more and fill in? Is that a comment about risk tolerance? I'm just curious how to think about it on a relative basis.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nI think you have to back up. Jim DeMare and the team are driving the business 11 straight quarters of year-over-year growth. Frankly, I'm not sure any other company comes close to matching that. So other people have more volatile up and down in your prospecting, but over the course of time, we just want us to keep walking up the ladder. And they've done a great job of doing that, continuing to drive the business. In fact, if you look at year-over-year comparisons, because your point was obviously something we asked ourselves when we looked at the last 48 hours here, 24 hours, basically a lot of people in the same range as opposed to fourth quarter, where some people's last year's fourth quarter was down a lot from the prior years. Ours was more stable.\nI think last year's fourth quarter was one of the highest fourth quarters we ever had. Then we put another 10% plus growth on top of it. Think of us as being that business that just is imperturbable, just keeps calmly growing forward and driving itself up without having maybe some of that more traditional trading house up and down, not because we're not good at it. They're very good at it. Not because they aren't getting share because frankly, if you look at the last three, four years, they continue to gain share. It's just we have a little less volatility in principal activity on a given day.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nOkay. I appreciate that. This might be a simple follow-up, but on your comments when talking about credit and reserves, your reserve for unemployment a little below 5%. We're at 4.1% now. I think that's the way this cycle has played out. I think that's typical B of A conservative. I think that's the accounting. But I guess my question is, your reserves will be fine. Your P&L will be fine. But if that plays out, does that completely change how we're thinking about the pickup in consumer spending, overall loan growth, things like that? Because we're talking about just the next four quarters.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nYeah. This is where you got, Glenn, you got to kind of get away from reserve-setting methodologies versus what we really believe is from our research team. And your research, your research team, your economics research team would tell you. Our core assumption is the GDP grows in the low twos this year. The unemployment stays between 4.1, and I think maybe gets up to 4.3 or something like that. So this is literally a weighting of a base case, which would match that in an adverse case and some other cases just in the way we build methodologies for the reserves because you're reserving for uncertain future, and that's how it has it. So don't take it as a thought that we really believe we're going to see 4.8% unemployment in the next four quarters. And so hopefully that answers it.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nThat's all I wanted to get out. I appreciate that. Yeah. Thanks. I'm good.\n\nOperator 4\n\nWe'll move next to Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYes. Hi. Good afternoon. About to be good afternoon. My first question just as a follow-up, Brian, I think I heard you say in response to John's question that you think the exit rate net interest margin will be 2.1%, I think, in Q4 2025. I just wanted to confirm that I heard that correctly. Underneath that, Alastair, could you talk about the repricing or down deposit beta dynamics that you would assume to get to that net interest margin?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nYes. So the simple answer is you've stated what I stated to John, but I'll let Alastair answer the second part of the question.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nSo generally, Erika, we're obviously following the Fed rate cuts, just repricing things accordingly. There are, I think, two things going on right now that are interesting. The first one is, generally speaking, in the commercial businesses with the higher-end deposits, we're typically following the rate cuts and just going down 25 basis points. Obviously, at the other extreme, on the non-interest bearing, there's nothing we can do with that. It's already non-interest bearing. But we're following the Fed cuts. We're moving the rates with discipline accordingly. And then the second thing that's going on is there was some rotation going on over the course of the past two years where there have been a lot of things going from non-interest bearing into interest bearing across the different parts of our businesses. That has slowed significantly. So you look at, for example, consumer non-interest bearing.\nThat seems to have bottomed out in February of last year. The non-interest-bearing balances are growing now again. That rotation is slowing also. Both of those things are factoring into our guidance.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nYeah. So Erika, if you look at the interesting part that's gone on in the last couple of quarters just from a deposit behavior, if you look at our accounts that were here prior to the pandemic to now, you saw a run-up, and then you saw a little depletion, and it's basically stabilized at a level. But if you looked at it in the aggregate, all the depletion is actually driven by the highest balance accounts, like 250, 500 average balances, million. And the others are still multiples of where they were before. That's been going on, and they've been growing. And they're growing 9% year over year in the lower balance accounts as people make more money and store more cash and have cash flow.\nSo if you think about what had happened, our average balance accounts: it was around 7,000, went up to 11,000, and now it's basically stable at 9,000 checking accounts. And that's kind of, then you can grow out from there. That is very valuable because checking is either zero or very low interest. And so it's where the growth we see coming as the deposits grow in consumer that helps produce, irrespective of the market dynamics of the higher-at-the-market price deposits, where you see the impact of the deposit franchise coming through. So consumer being down a basis point quarter to quarter doesn't sound like a lot. But you got to remember a lot of their stuff; it doesn't really price, but are they growing that stuff? And each $10 billion of growth in that area is very, very important to us.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it. That's very helpful. And just as a follow-up, both you and Alastair have, over the course of 2024, started introducing the concept of a normalized net interest margin of 2.3% with a neutral rate maybe around 4%. Can B of A get there more quickly, particularly given the deposit dynamics that you mentioned, Brian? I guess I'm trying to we're just trying to figure out you guys did introduce the concept of normalized NIM. So I'm not trying to seek out guidance in terms of 26 or 27 or whatever, but you had had to have told us that for a reason. And I'm just wondering if the forward curve or what the dynamics are that would lay out the path to achieve that over the medium term.",
    "content2": "Brian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nIf the Fed funds rate stays higher, we'll get there faster. It's simple because that's obvious because of the sheer volume of low interest. So if we were sitting here in October, I think when we were talking about that, the amount of rate cuts was still, I don't know how many more, three or four more than we've had so far. Now we're down to one. So as it stays at a higher nominal rate, you'll see this adjustment come through. There are two caveats there. One is we're carrying a larger markets balance sheet, which by definition is a little less robust in that area. And then secondly, we're carrying a lot of excess liquidity just because we're running that down, as Alastair said. So during the build-up during the pandemic, we built up a lot of term financing and running off.\nSo all that will help us, but it will go faster than we'd otherwise say mid-last year to now just because the nominal rate environment stays higher.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator 4\n\nWe'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi. So you kind of upped your NII guide the next several quarters. This was the first question asked. So how much is short rate? How much is long rate? But most importantly, how much of this is a little bit more steepness in the yield curve? And what part of the yield curve is most important for that? And what's the sensitivity? For every 10 basis points of additional steepness, that adds how much to NII or something along those lines? Thanks.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nSo Mike, it's still the short end that drives probably 90% of the sensitivity around NII. Because if you think about it, we just don't have enough fixed-rate assets repricing to really drive NII. In any given quarter, you've got a few billion of resi mortgage, a few billion of CVL repricing. Let's call that 10 to 12. You've got 8 to 10 billion of hold-to-maturity securities repricing. But that's in the context of a $3.3 trillion balance sheet. So it's still the short end that drives most of the NII. So when Brian says, obviously, we're helped by the fact that there might be two or three rate cuts less than there were previously, that's obviously helpful. But the big thing is always for us in terms of year-over-year growth, it's always about deposit growth and loan growth.\nThe fixed-rate asset repricing is, it turbocharges it a little bit at the margin, but it's about deposit and loan growth. Those are the important ones. Getting back to growth now in each of our businesses gives us a stronger foundation leading into 2025 than we had this year when we still had, at the beginning of the year, consumer coming down, wealth coming down. Now that they found a floor, it's slightly different.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nGot it. And then a big-picture question, Brian, with the new incoming administration and a different tone as it relates to bank regulation. In fact, the incoming Treasury Secretary said he would like to reinvigorate banks. So if you were talking to them and maybe they're listening, what would you like to see changed as it relates to bank regulation? And then a specific question. I know it's going to be tough. If you give me any sense, it'd be great. But your CET1 ratio, if you didn't have gold plating, if you had a level playing field, if you took out some of the extraneous operating risk penalty, how much would your CET1 ratio increase in that sort of world? Thanks.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nSo Mike, I think your second question brings up the places our industry, our company have been advocating heavily is that we've had a little bit of a situation from pre-pandemic to post-pandemic where you've seen required capital go up nominally 10%, 15%, 20%, and not a big change in the risk of the companies. And that's just all this mathematics behind all the accounting, right? And so we're saying, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa. We aren't indexing the GSIB, so therefore our relative size economy isn't growing as fast as it was intended to be indexed on that basis, isn't there?\" You've had, as you said, sort of an accretion of sort of methodologies that keep pulling more in, including the stress test volatility that we've all pointed out to them.\nAnd then the last point you make, it is if you look at this concept of Basel III making an equivalent around the world is completely off in a different world because we're using advanced, excuse me. The rest of the world's using advanced. We're using standardized, gold-plated, whatever you want to talk about. It's just apples and oranges. And so I would never think that we'd go if we ever got to Europe, our numbers would be probably a lot, lot higher, but that's not going to happen because just we're going to have we as a society will have a more conservatively capitalized industry. So I think it's simply put, if they were to take into account our clear statement, our clear advocacy as an industry about indexing GSIB, take the volatility out of CCAR, how can it change so much in the relatively same scenario?\nAlso behind the scenes, all the changes in accounting, not accounting, but accounting for risk, you're increasing capital requirements without an explicit decision to do so. We think that that would be worth probably 100 basis points or so if you really sat back and thought about it. How do you get there? Mike, think about our volatility in CCAR outcomes. I think we went up by, I don't know, 50, 70 basis points last year, whatever it was. The risk in the company didn't change. As a matter of fact, it probably went down, honestly. So that's what we're working on. We want to see that.\nAnd then in the day-to-day supervision, we just want to see people focused on safety and soundness, and good management, and making sure the regulatory agencies cooperate on things like BSA and AML, and things that everybody's all over the place, and the industry's trying to sort it out in the middle. And we've given them precise points to look at, and we'll see what happens.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAll right. Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator 4\n\nWe'll move next to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.\n\nJames Mitchell\n\nSenior Analyst, Seaport Research Partners\n\nHey. Good afternoon. Maybe just dialing in on the deposit growth. You clearly have been outperforming the peer group, but maybe just want to focus on consumer for a second. You generated 1.1 million of net new checking accounts, which seems best among peers. I think that's showing up in better consumer deposit growth in four Qs. So what do you think you're doing differently that's generating that kind of consistent success in adding new accounts?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nLook, at the end of the day, our brand is best received in terms of our scores. Our customer service capabilities are scoring at the highest they've ever come. The fairness of our account structures, the transparency, the digital capabilities, it's just winning in the market. It's in a billion net new checking accounts, and not 92%, 90%, whatever they are, our primary. They start with an average balance of $2,000 to 3,000. They moved to $6,000, 7,000 over the course of six months. This is just a great job done by Dean Athanasia, Aron Levine, and Holly O'Neill that run this business for us. Just continue to drive it. Then, on top of that, we've layered in ways with various business lines to help generate accounts.\nSo our work we do with companies to offer our best products and services as a benefit to their employees helps us generate some extra growth. Our ability to do business around college campuses, which is not huge for this quarter's growth, but because we're generating the amount of openings at twice the rate of young people exist in society for our customers five years ago, five years later the people are out working, and they're great customers. So it's a whole bunch of things. It's relentless and sustainable. Yet we still have lots of ways to grow. We weren't in, we just entered a lot of markets over the last five years: Denver, Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Milwaukee now, Lexington, etc. That's one way.\nIf you think about in wealth management, teammates, Katy Knox, Lindsay, and Eric do a great job there, but we have a lot of room to go where we continue to outfit those clients with a full range of services at Bank of America. Even Merrill Edge has a lot going on there. There's a fair amount of deposits that come from our Merrill Edge originations, which are 300,000 accounts year over year. Those are all $100,000 starting accounts, not 3,000.\n\nJames Mitchell\n\nSenior Analyst, Seaport Research Partners\n\nRight. That all makes sense. Then maybe pivoting on the expense side, the guidance of 2% to 3% growth, it's kind of a pretty decent step down from what we saw in the back half of the year. So what areas do you see sort of slowing on the expense side given your optimism on organic growth? How do you kind of decelerate the expense growth in 2025?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nI think three key things. One is if we get the year-over-year growth in the markets-related businesses in the high double digits or 20% growth, that expense guidance might be a little tight, but again, you would cheer for that. So this is assuming a 5% to 6% growth in the S&P type of numbers. So that takes some of the growth pressure off. The aggregate numbers are locked in at a high level and growing from there. And then the second thing is, frankly, just getting a lot of this work behind us and some remediation, look-backs, and things are all completed and behind us. And then third is just keeping the headcount and continuing to focus on OpEx and generating capabilities.\nSo as we stepped into some of these national brand campaigns around some of the major properties we've affiliated with, most recently yesterday, US Soccer, including the men's and women's teams, FIFA, The Masters. These are all things we're paying for by just driving other efficiencies. So from a company that for years had gone down in expenses, the idea of growing 2 to 3 is not that hard a concept, albeit the growth in the back half of this year was a bit driven by the incentive explosion that happened because of the explosion of markets. When they took off, our teammates did a great job of capturing revenue and incentives went.\n\nJames Mitchell\n\nSenior Analyst, Seaport Research Partners\n\nOkay. Yeah. No, that's fair. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator 4\n\nWe'll move next to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. I have two separate questions. First one with expenses. Just want to clarify to the last question, Brian, what you said. So what are you assuming for incentive comp in 2025 in your guidance? Is it flat year on year? Are you assuming some increase? Any color on that?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nIt would grow with the markets and stuff, but we have other efficiencies that offset some of that growth.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Second one, I guess I can't leave you disappointed. Given you and Alastair love NII, so let me ask a little nitty question on that. BSBY hedges, since those started to accrete this quarter, how much was the benefit this quarter? And what is the cadence of that as we look out over 2025?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nSo we think about the BSBY accreting back into the P&L kind of like the same way we do with the other cash flow swaps, Vivek. So I'd say a couple hundred this quarter. And then when we give you the guidance with all the cash flow swaps, it's all included in there. So when I say that we think this year Q1 should be up modestly, that is after the $250 million of day-count adjustment, and it's including deposit growth, loan growth, and all the cash flow swap activity.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. So that $200 million, that probably, given that it's $1.6 billion to be recovered over a couple of years, that should continue at this pace all through 2025 then, right? At least that particular item?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYeah. I would continue most of it will take place in 2025. It sort of burns back into the P&L. And then there'll be a little bit in 2026 and a tiny bit in 2027.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nSorry if I may, another one. Brian, to your comment on capital, you said you want to keep a 50 basis point buffer. Your CET1 of 11.9, 50 basis point 11.2. Is there a plan to go down to the 11.2 at some point and therefore step up your buybacks? Or what's the thinking there?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nI wouldn't assume that we're going to take it down through a lot of buybacks in your modeling. It's going to be there to support growth. But Vivek, the simple answer is we've got to get a set of rules that quit moving around on us. And once we get them, then we can give you better guidance on that. Because it's just hard to estimate when you could have more excess if they did what we as industry expect them to do, and then we'd have a different conversation. Right now, we'll probably grow part of that away through the good work of our team in terms of loan growth and the markets business. We continue to invest in that business. So don't expect us to deplete that ratio down quickly.\nBut I'm holding my right to change that if we get the capital levels straightened out of the new rules.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nMakes sense. Thanks.\n\nOperator 4\n\nOur next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question here towards the end. Just if there was some relief on capital, are there areas that you would incrementally lean into? Obviously, without knowing all the rules, it's hard to know for sure. But just are there areas that you're like, \"If we had that extra 100 basis points or if it's 50 or 150, you would do a little bit more in some areas than you have been?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nYeah. None of our businesses are constrained because of capital. So if the consumer team had more credit card loan growth that was based on what they think the right risk balances and getting paid for it, etc., that's gone on. You saw us just grow balances last quarter of the auto loans or whatever. And so I think I don't see that. Wealth management, obviously, not much of an RWA user in a lot of ways. And then the real question is, in the global banking business, again, if they're getting strong loan growth, there's nothing that we're slowing them down. In the markets business, we continue to drive the capital up. Being the lowest return on equity business we have, we have to be a little careful that we don't do it. But Jim and the team have done a great job.\nBasically, their balance sheet's $300 billion larger than it was four or five years ago. And they've grown. We've grown through the GSIBs, as you know, from two and a half to three. And we'll keep probably growing through those. And that will use some. But it's not like we'd say you can't have it because of capital. It's really just running the company and keeping a balance in the overall management of the risk and where we want to take risk and how we do it. And then, frankly, they come up with business plans that we've never had to say we don't have enough capital to do that. That's not the issue.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nAnd I guess, though, depending on how the capital rules are tweaked, it could make some businesses just more profitable, right? So even though you have enough capital to put to those businesses, if the returns aren't making your hurdles, maybe it could with some tweaks. And I've heard some of your peers talk about equity prime brokerage as one area that could have higher returns if capital requirements are reduced. And again, we don't know exactly how it's going to play out, but do you envision any kind of changes to how you evaluate businesses? Thank you.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nYeah. I think it won't change how we evaluate businesses because regulatory capital is only one of the ways we look at it. We look at the risk and sort of market-based capital and other things. But it could take the sort of, for lack of a better term, a little bit of the penalty to some of these businesses down some. But you also have to remember the ROA and the mix of businesses. And there's another side to this because we have 6% tangible common equity, and we've got to produce returns on that. And low ROA businesses affect that. So there are things that will favor it under regulatory capital but not favor it under sort of market-based disciplines. So we work through all that.\nI don't expect to see change in how we do it, but also don't think that any of our businesses are constrained because we're not having capital. So if Jim and the team have a chance to go prime brokerage and make it work in our company, we could have other businesses which have very high ROAs to make up for it. And some other companies, it'd be more important for them because they don't have those other businesses in relative size to the markets business.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Thank you, Paul. Thank you. That was helpful.\n\nOperator 4\n\nWe'll move next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nHi, Brian. Hi, Alastair.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nHi, Gerard.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nBrian, hey, we've talked about this in the past and also with you, Alastair. Obviously, credit quality for you and your peers is very strong. In view of the rate cycle we just came through, where we went from 0% to +5% at the short end of the curve and really never saw a surge in charge-offs due to rates going up that much, when you guys look at credit quality, is it due to better underwriting standards or sticking to your underwriting standards, or is it your customers themselves? Because we all went through the pandemic, are just much stronger balance sheets, more resilient. What would you account for so far that this credit cycle has been fairly benign for you and your peers?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYeah. Look, it's definitely been benign. I think one thing that hasn't changed is our underwriting strategy, our standards, our risk appetite, our client selection. Those really haven't changed, Gerard. But I think you're right. Look, things are obviously different in 2019. 2019, we didn't have this rate structure. So that's a little bit harder at the margin for the consumer. At the same time, consumers are stronger. I mean, we can see that in the deposit balances. We can see it right now in the consumer spending in the 3% to 4% range. We can see it in the balances being elevated over five years ago. We can see it in the unemployment level, the income level, home prices, wealth effect. So look, 2019 was freakishly low in terms of a historical norm. But things have settled in here.\nWe sort of said a year ago we thought they would plateau right around where we are. We're glad to see three or four quarters now of some stability. It feels pretty good on the consumer side. It feels very good still on the commercial side. So that's why we're sort of laying out our expectation is, unless there's a big change in the economy, we think we're going to be around in this 50 to 60 basis points over the course of the next year or so.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nVery good. Then as a follow-up, I share your optimism on the outlook for the economy and many of your peers in the capital markets business. I think many investors do. What are the risks? I mean, when you guys sit down at night and everything's going well, what do you talk about as what curveballs do we have to watch out for? Is it a rate environment that changes quickly without anybody really expecting it? Is it complacency? What are some of the risks that you guys think about?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nWell, you have wars and hopefully a resolution of one that's just happening as we speak. But we have wars. You have trade wars, etc., that bothers. You have the availability of resources around the world, whether it's physical resources or human resources to do work. It shortages that because unemployment rates in a lot of countries are pretty low. And so can you get the productivity to keep growing the economy? And all the usual things. But if you think about it, Gerard, just to be clear, we've seen a 15-year run from after the pandemic, excuse me, after the global financial crisis or more, year run where you've seen constantly improving credit statistics that then interrupted in the pandemic a little bit. And then because the stimulus dropped down again and now it's back to normal. But that's a long-term trend. So it's not complacency.\nIt's just that how much leverage is building up in the system that there'll be difficulties with either at the household level, at the company level. Then a lot of it's outside the banking system. We worry about that and how it reverberates into the banking system because just leverage that exists out there that higher levels than we traditionally have given in the banking system still will affect us. That means if people can't carry it, there'll be restructurings of companies, bankruptcies, and things like that, which are going on today, but they're going on a level which is very manageable. We worry about all those things, the federal debt levels, and the pinch that will come out of state and federal spending if they need to slow down the growth. All those things are factors which we think about.\nThe way we manage the company is to run it so that given those events, we can continue to operate. That's why the stress testing, quite frankly, is a good thing because it makes you think about the Pareto horribles happening, even though they don't happen, and make sure that you are positioned to survive them. If you said to the question Alastair answered, one of the big impacts across time here in the banking industry is because the top 30 institutions are doing stress testing, which assumes that you're wrong in your underwriting. The economy goes from 4% unemployment to 10% unemployment overnight. Think about the impact of that on bringing the underwriting narrower so that you can afford the capital that you have to hold for that outcome, even though that outcome hasn't occurred. That's going across a big portion of the banking industry.\nSo I just think it's more fundamentally structured, but leverage is going to be the issue. It always is. And you're always trying to find the P. Where's excess leverage and how do you make sure you're avoiding it?\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nNo, that's very helpful. Thank you. And Alastair, I liked your comment about when you were talking about the 17 financial centers that you're a growth company. Hopefully, that'll be reflected in the PE shortly.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nWell, there's plenty of room on the PE multiple, but I'll let you work on that, Gerard. You work on the E part.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nOkay. Fair enough. Thank you, gentlemen.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator 1\n\nWe'll take our final question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking my question. So Brian, here's the question. Small business optimism is up, and you've got a flat curve at the front end. And so I'm kind of wondering how that feeds into C&I demand. And I'm wondering what your conversations with not only small business, mid-business, corporates, it'd be really interesting to hear how you think they're preparing for this change. Thank you.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nSure. Betsy, so small business, small, medium-sized businesses, so in our business banking category, so we have small business, business bank, and we have global commercial banking, think middle market. Across that environment, the draw rates on lines of credit stuff are still much lower than they were in a pre-pandemic and things like that. And to your point, the higher interest rate environment affects them most quickly and importantly because they use lines of credit to do things: buy a piece of equipment, hire some more people when the payroll dynamics of that, whatever it is. And they might permanently finance that, but immediately they use lines. And the draw rates 400 basis points over where it normally runs, so to speak, which means that they're drawing at less rate. And that probably means they're doing a little less. And so we haven't seen that move a lot.\nThat's to come in terms of loan growth, as Alastair mentioned earlier. But their optimism has changed. And you saw that. And that's really around the other things when you talk to our small business customers, and we made these points to people in Washington, is the regulation, the impact. It's hard to do business, hard to get things done. The rules coming out, they don't have the big staffs that we do and other companies do that can deal with all that. And so it all confuses. It slows them down. It makes them hesitate. Their belief is that that's changed. And that's why you see the optimism come up. And then we got to translate that optimism into activity. And then you'll see the loan growth come.\nBut I think it was, it's a quick change, and it's based on their view of how easy it will be for them to get things done, both at a state and federal level.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. I'm just looking at you. Bank of America is one of the few that actually has small business loan growth year on year. I know a lot of that came a couple of quarters ago. With this very sharp increase in small business optimism, I would think that could potentially be something you could benefit from.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nNo, no question. So but the real dollar volume of benefit's going to be the small business loans, I think, have been growing quarter after quarter, year over year for a good chunk of time now. We feel good about that. The dollar volume change in the middle market business from a little more drawing on the lines consistent with what people have done before is a lot of loan balances. There's $200 billion of balances in that business. It doesn't take a lot to kick it up.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nRight. I got that. Yeah.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nSo I think, look, we're the largest lender to small business, and those customers tell us they're optimistic and they see forward. The issues were I couldn't get enough people, and that's something we got to be careful of. The regulations were hurting me. Then the interest rates. The interest rates coming down a little bit helps them. The other two, the strong belief is that'll be more readily available.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nSuper. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator 4\n\nIt does appear that there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Brian for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nSure. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We finished 2024 with good momentum as we enter 2025. The economy is resilient and healthy. The consumers continue to spend at a solid and healthy rate. The employment levels are strong. The asset quality we can see is very good. Our loans have now grown for several quarters in a row here. Deposits have grown for six straight quarters. The rate environment continues to be constructive. And then the added value in the last couple of quarters of the fee businesses have come on strong given the extra market activity. All that sets us up well for 2025. Thank you for your support. We look forward to talking to you next time.\n\nOperator 1\n\nThis does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful afternoon."

Before I begin today, I just want to reflect a second on the horrible events this weekend. We at Bank of America are clear that there's no place for political violence in our great country, and we continue to wish the former President Trump a speedy recovery, and our thoughts, of course, go out to the victims, their families, and others impacted by this terrible event.\nWith that, let's turn our attention to the results for Q2 2024 at Bank of America Corporation. This quarter we achieved success in a number of areas, underscoring the benefits of our diversity and the dedication of our team to deliver responsible growth. Our organic growth engine continues to add customers and activity to all our businesses. Even as we see the drop in net interest income this quarter, I'm starting on slide two. Our net income for the quarter was $6.9 billion after tax or $0.83 in diluted EPS attesting to the balance in our franchise. The earnings were split evenly, half in our consumer and Global Wealth and Investment Management businesses which serve people and the other half in our institutional focused business, Global Banking and Global Markets.\nWe grew revenue from Q2 2023 as improvement in noninterest income overcame the decline in net interest income. Fees grew 6% year over year and represented 46% of total revenue in the quarter. Our strong fee performance was led by a 14% improvement in asset management fees in our wealth management businesses. We grew investment banking fees 29% year over year and saw sales and trading revenue increase 7%. Global Markets had its ninth consecutive quarter of year over year growth in sales and trading revenue, a good job by Jimmy DeMare and the team. Card and service charge revenue also grew by 6% year over year in our consumer business. Much of this fee growth is a result of our intensity around organic growth and is.\nA testament to the diversity.\nOf our operating model.\nNow on to slide three. Organic growth has been driven by several key factors. First, we focus on our customers. We continue to place them at the center of everything we do. Consumer led the way in delivering solid organic growth with high quality accounts and engaged clients. For the 22nd consecutive quarter, we had a significant net new consumer checking accounts. We expanded our customer base and our market share. Specifically, we added 278,000 net new checking accounts this quarter, which brings our first six months of 2024 to more than 500,000. In wealth management, we added another 6,100 new relationships this quarter in our commercial businesses. We added thousands of small businesses and hundreds of commercial banking relationships. This has led to now managing $5.7 trillion in client balances, loans, deposits, and investments across the consumer and wealth management client segments.\nIn those areas we saw flows of $58 billion in the past four quarters. Our emphasis on personalized financial solutions and superior customer service has strengthened customer loyalty, attracted new clients across all our businesses. Our focus on providing liquidity and risk management solutions to our institutional clients positions to continue to gain more share of the wallet as well. Second, we continue to deliver innovative digital solutions. One of the primary contributors of both attracting, retaining customers to our platforms is our digital banking capabilities for our clients across all the businesses. Our fully integrated consumer banking investment app drives the utility for our customers across their investment and consumer accounts. Our use of stats are strong proof points. Our second language capabilities in our consumer businesses further enhance our customers' capabilities.\nYou can see the continued digital growth in the slides on pages 26, 28, and 30 in the appendix. A couple highlights. Our consumer mobile banking app now serves more than 47 million active users. They logged in 3.5 billion times this quarter. We also continue to see more sales through use of our digital properties. Digital sales represented 53% of our total sales in the past quarter. In our consumer businesses, 23 million consumers are now using Zelle. They send money on Zelle at nearly two and a half times the rate they write checks, and in fact more Zelle transactions take place than a combination of customer ATM transaction and cash withdrawals at teller. Simply put, Zelle has become the dominant way to move money in our wealth management business.\nWe are seeing more banking accounts being opened to complement the investment business those clients do with us. Importantly, these clients are also recognizing the ease of our digital banking capability. 75% of our new accounts and our Merrill teammates were open digitally. 87% of our global banking clients also are digitally active. We have innovated and significantly streamlined service requests by enabling clients to directly initiate and track transaction inquiries within our CashPro platform using AI to accomplish that. Third, we continue to make core strategic investments in our businesses. We're not complacent with the success you see on this page. We continue to strategically invest in our core businesses. A few examples. While we have the leading retail deposit share in America, we continue to invest and have opened 11 new financial centers this quarter in the first half of the year and renovated another 243.\nThis is investment in both our expansion markets and our growth markets and wealth management. We continue to invest in our Advisor development program. It's grown to 2,300 teammates, allowing us to continuously add more than teammates to our 18,000 strong best-in-class financial advisory force across all wealth management businesses. We're also adding teams of experienced advisors strategically in areas across the country. In our banking teams, we continue to add our regional investment to our regional investment banking team. We now have more than 200 regional bankers across the country to better serve our commercial clients, and they complement our industry coverage to our corporate clients in our Global Markets business. We continue to extend balance sheet to our clients, adding expertise and talent to continue to lead our market share improvements seen over the last several years.\nWe also have increased our technology initiatives and expect to spend nearly $4 billion on technology initiatives this year. We have focused projects around artificial intelligence enhancements of both clients and our teammates. A recent example of our use of AI is our Advisor and Client Insights tool. We've delivered more than 6 million insights year to date to our financial advisors, providing them proactive reasons to engage their clients.\nAI has moved from cost savings ideas to enhancing the quality of our customer interactions. Fourth, organic growth is driving integrated flows across our business. We invest heavily in each line of business that compete in the markets based on their particular customer segment. But important, we also invest across our lines of business to knit them together and gain market share in the local markets. It's a differentiated advantage for us, our banking leadership position across our businesses, and our nationwide franchise. For example, we leverage our franchise by connecting business customers with management teams. Our teams across all our businesses have made four million referrals to other businesses in the first six months of this year. Next, we drive efficiency and effectiveness, and that's through our Operational Excellence platform.\nWe continue to invest heavily in the future of our franchise and growth while we also have to manage expenses day to day. Our focus on Operational Excellence has enabled us to hold our expense growth up to 2% year over year, well below the inflation rates. We continue to work to achieve operating leverage as NII stabilizes and begins to grow again. As you look at it and Alastair will explain later, a fair portion of the year over year increase in expense is due to formulaic incentives of wealth management due to the fee growth in that business. And last, our capital strength allows us to deliver for all our stakeholders. Our capital remains strong as we held our CET1 ratio at 11.9% this quarter. We grew loans, increased our share repurchases to $3.5 billion, and paid $1.9 billion in dividends.\nAverage diluted shares dropped below eight billion shares outstanding. In addition, we also announced our intent to increase our quarterly dividend 8% upon board approval. Note that 11.9% CET1 ratio remain a solid excess capital position both above the current regulatory requirements and the increased requirement to 10.7% beginning in October as a result of the recent CCAR exam.\nLet's.\nTurn to slide four. A couple things to note here. First, we've noted for several quarters that the second quarter NII would be the trough in this rate cycle. We expect NII to grow in the third quarter, and fourth quarter this year. Alastair is going to provide you some points in detail about the path forward. One important contributor to that change is the deposit behaviors of our customers. On slide four you'll note that average deposits grew 2% year over year and increased modestly by quarter. The second quarter in reality is typically a heavy outflow quarter. We have a lot of customers who.\nPay a lot of taxes in that quarter.\nQuarter-over-quarter increases in rates paid continue to slow again this quarter across all businesses except for wealth management, and we show you that on this page. Slide four, by line of business. While wealth business deposit rates have moved higher with continued rotation, we expect those rates to begin to stabilize and the rate of quarterly change decrease going forward. Turning to slide five, in previous calls many of you asked questions or commented upon the question about consumer net charge-offs and when would they stabilize in the second half of 2024. That expectation we have remains unchanged as well. This quarter's net charge-offs were 59 bps, and for context.\nThis is a stabilization of the rate. I was just reminded, prior to this quarter, I have to go all the way back to 2014 to see a charge-off rate of that high, and that's near when we were still emerging from the financial crisis. On slide four, we highlight the 30 and 90-day+ credit card delinquency trends, which show delinquencies have plateaued for the second consecutive quarter. This should lead to stabilized net credit losses in credit card in the second half of the year. At the bottom of the page, note a couple facts. First, on the payment rates. This is the rate of pay down on balances a given month remain 20% above index to the pre-pandemic levels even while our card customers have plenty of capacity to borrow and importantly because of our relationship-based businesses.\nLook at the right-hand slide at the bottom of page five. There you can see our deposit investment balances of our customers who also have a card list remain 25% above their pre-pandemic levels illustrating continue to help these customers. So as you think about consumer credit, the charge-offs drive it, have flattened out in terms of delinquencies, and we expect them to improve in the second half. Regarding commercial real estate, our usual CRE credit exposure slide is included in our Appendix. We continue to aggressively work through our loans. In our modest CRE office portfolio, we saw a decrease in all the categories, a decrease in reservable criticized loans, a decrease in NPLs, and a decrease in net charge-offs.\nThis supports our previous expectation that net charge-offs in the second half of 2024 will be lower than the first half of 2024.\nOur second quarter performance highlights Bank of America's ability to generate strong sustainable growth through a combination of customer centric strategies, innovation, strategic investments, and a commitment to strong balance of risk and reward. We call that responsible growth. We're confident that focused approach will continue to drive long-term success and create value for you, our shareholders. Now I will turn to Alistair for additional results.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nThank you, Brian, and I'm going to start on slide six of the earnings presentation. I'll touch on more highlights noted on slide six as we work through the material. I just want to say up front that we delivered strong returns with return on average assets of 85 bps and a return on tangible common equity of nearly 14%. So let's move to the balance sheet on slide seven where you can see we ended the quarter at $3.26 trillion of total assets, relatively unchanged from the first quarter, and not much to note here apart from a mixed shift of lower securities balances, mostly offset by an increase in reverse repo, modest loan growth, as well as global markets client activity.\nOn the funding side, deposits declined $36 billion on an ending basis, reflecting typical seasonal customer payments of income taxes, and as Brian noted, average deposits were still modestly higher. Liquidity remains strong with $909 billion of global liquidity sources that was flat compared to the first quarter. Shareholders equity was also flat compared to Q1 as earnings were offset by $5.4 billion in capital distributed to shareholders and a $1.9 billion redemption of preferred stock, and $5.4 billion of capital distributions included $1.9 billion in common dividends and the repurchase of $3.5 billion in shares.\nAOCI improved modestly in the quarter, and tangible book value per share of $25.37 rose 9% from Q2 of last year. In terms of regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $198 billion, and the CET1 ratio was stable at 11.9%. This 11.9% ratio remained well above our current 10% requirement as well as our new 10.7% requirement as of 1st October 2024. Risk-weighted assets increased modestly, and that was driven by lending activity. Our supplemental leverage ratio was 6% versus our minimum requirement of 5%. That leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. Our $468 billion of TLAC means our total loss-absorbing capital ratio remains comfortably above our requirements.\nBrian already covered deposit trends, so let's turn the balance sheet focus to loans and we'll look at average balances on slide eight. You can see average loans in Q2 of $1.051 trillion. They improved 1% year over year driven by 5% credit card growth and modest commercial growth. The modest improvement in overall commercial loans included a 2% increase in our domestic commercial loans and leases, partially offset by a 4% decline in commercial real estate. Middle market lending saw an uptick in the quarter and we saw good demand in our wealth businesses from custom lending. These areas of growth were largely offset by continued paydowns from our larger corporate clients on interest rate sentiment. Consumer growth was driven by credit card borrowing and while home lending balances were flattish, originations picked up a bit this quarter.\nLastly, and on a positive note, loan spreads continued to widen as we turn our focus then to NII performance and slide nine. Note that we move the slide we typically use to talk about excess deposits to the Appendix on slide 22. So you can see that there our excess deposit levels above loans remained high at $850 billion and continue to be a good source of value for shareholders. 52% of our excess liquidity is now in short-dated cash and available-for-sale securities. The longer-dated lower-yielding hold-to-maturity book continues to roll off and we reinvested again this quarter in higher-yielding assets. The blended yield of cash and securities continued to improve in the quarter and is now 160 bps above our deposit rate paid. Regarding NII on a GAAP.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nTo all locations on hold. Please remain online. We're experiencing a technical difficulty. Please remain online. You'll hear music for just a moment.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nThis now includes three interest rate cuts starting in September, another in November, and one more in December. The waterfall shows an estimated impact of those rate cuts to our quarterly NII.\nThe next couple categories are a result of natural management of interest rate risk in a balance sheet mixed with fixed rate assets and variable rate assets. Our balance sheet is split roughly half and half. We take in liquidity from customers that we use to fund our assets, and then we store excess liquidity in cash and securities. We have fixed assets that mature and pay down, and those supply cash that then gets put back to work on the balance sheet and reprices over time, and we have two basic categories of fixed assets that mature and pay off. Those are securities and loans. On securities, you can see we've got about $10 billion a quarter of cash coming off of our securities portfolio, and again roughly 300 bps of improvement on those assets when we put that money back on the balance sheet.\nOn loans. Between Resi Mortgage and auto, we've got another roughly $10 billion which reprices with a little last yield improvement in the securities. Between the securities and loans, we expect the fixed rate asset repricing adds about $300 million to our quarterly rate of NII as we get to Q4.\nOn the variable rate asset side, and to protect from down moves in rates, we hedge some of that with cash flow swaps. And those typically roll off in any given quarter and get replaced over time. So included in the cash flow hedges is an impact of cessation of BSBY as an alternative rate. If you recall, we took a charge in Q4 2023; it was $1.6 billion. And we said that would come back to us through time. And beginning in November we start to see the benefit coming back into NII, and in Q4 that's about $200 million. That Q4 partial quarter benefit will grow by a slightly smaller sequential NII benefit in Q1 2025, and then it begins to taper off heading into 2026.\nIn addition, we've got about $150 billion of receive fixed cash flow hedges protecting us from short rate moves moving forward. Most are hedging floating rate commercial loans, and the cost of those hedges is reported as contra revenue in commercial loan interest income. These hedges have a weighted average life of just over two years, and they've got an average fixed rate of approximately 250 bps. So starting in H2 2025, we begin to get some additional NII tailwind because the cash flow hedges with lower fixed rate legs where we receive those will begin to roll off and will likely replace those at higher current market rates at the time.\nThe actual size of the tailwind we'll get from the expiration of those swaps will obviously be highly dependent on the level and the shape of the yield curve at the time of those maturities, and that stretches out over the course of the next four years. Okay, a couple other points to make. You'll note we don't expect much movement around our modestly liability sensitive global markets NII activity. And lastly, our forward view has an expectation of low single digit growth in loans. Low single digit growth in deposits with continued slowing of rate paid movement through the back half of 2024, and you can see our expectation of the combined impact here as well. This last element is the one that has the most potential variability and obviously will depend upon actual deposit and loan growth, pricing, and rotation.\nOkay, let's turn to expense, and we'll use slide 11 for the discussion. We reported $16.3 billion of expense this quarter, and that's more than $900 million lower than Q1, which included $700 million for the FDIC Special Assessment. Not including the FDIC assessment, expenses were lower than Q1 by $229 million, driven by seasonally lower payroll tax expenses compared to Q2 2023. We're up less than 2%, and that increase is equal to the incentives paid for improved fee revenue. Incentives for our GWIM business alone are up $200 million year over year. That's obviously an expense we're happy to pay when we have a 14% improvement in fees for assets under management.\nOur second quarter headcount number included welcoming a diverse class of nearly 2,000 summer interns we hope will join us over the course of the next year or two upon their graduation. Absent those interns, our headcount fell by nearly 2,000 in the third quarter. We expect to add approximately 2,500 college graduates for full time, and that's from more than 120,000 applications received, showing that we remain an employer of choice for talented young people. Expense levels for the rest of 2024 are expected to bounce around this second quarter level given the higher fee revenue and investments made for growth. Let's now move to credit, and we'll turn to slide 12. There was little change in our asset quality metrics this quarter. Provision expense was $1.5 billion. That was $189 million higher than Q1, driven by a smaller reserve release in Q2.\nNet charge-offs of $1.5 billion were little changed, with a small increase in credit card mostly offset by lower commercial real estate office charge-offs on a weighted basis. We remain reserved for an unemployment rate of nearly 5% by the end of 2025, compared to the most recent 4.1% rate reported. The net charge-off ratio was 59 bps, largely unchanged for Q1.\nOn slide 13, we highlight more credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs increased by a modest $31 million versus the first quarter from the flow-through of higher late-stage credit card delinquencies from Q1, highlighting the change in direction of delinquencies. Consumer 90-day+ delinquencies declined in Q2 by $57 million. Commercial net charge-offs were relatively flat as lower commercial real estate losses were mostly offset by a small increase in other commercial loans. Our office losses went from $304 million in Q1 to $226 million in Q2. Other commercial real estate loan losses were simply one hotel. Okay, let's move to the various lines of business and some brief comments on their results, and I'll start on slide 14 with consumer banking.\nFor the quarter, consumer earned $2.6 billion on continued strong organic growth, and reported earnings declined 9% year over year as revenue declined from lower deposit balances compared to the second quarter of last year. Customer activity showed another strong quarter, net new checking growth, another strong checking and card openings, and investment balances for consumer clients, which climbed 23% year over year. We had a new record $476 billion that included 12 months of strong flows at $38 billion in addition to market appreciation over the time. As noted earlier, loans grew nicely year over year from credit cards as well as small business, where we remain the industry leader. The team held expense flat year over year, reflecting good work with continued business investments for growth offset by the Operational Excellence.\nWork to improve processes and move more of our transactions to digital, and as you can see in the appendix, page 26, digital adoption and engagement continue to improve, and customer satisfaction scores remain near record levels, illustrating customer appreciation of our enhanced capabilities due to our continuous investment.\nMoving to wealth management on slide 15, we produced good results, and those included good organic client activity, market favorability, and strong AUM flows. This quarter also saw good lending results. Our comprehensive suite of investment and advisory services, coupled with our commitment to personalized wealth management, planning, and solutions, has enabled us to meet the diverse needs and aspirations of our clients. Net income rose 5% from the second quarter of last year to a little more than $1 billion. In Q2, we reported revenue of $5.6 billion, growing 6% over the prior year. As Brian noted, strong 14% growth and fee revenue from investment brokerage services overcame the NII headwind. Expense growth reflects the fee growth and other investments for future.\nThe business had a 25% margin and it generated a strong return on capital of more than 22%. Average loans were up 2% year over year, driven by strong growth we're seeing in custom lending and a pickup in mortgage lending. Both Merrill and the Private Bank continue to see good organic growth, and they produce strong assets under management flows of $58 billion since last year's second quarter, which reflects a mix of new client money as well as existing clients putting more of their money to work. I also want to highlight the continued digital momentum in this business, and you can find that on slide 28.\nOn slide 16, we turn to global banking results, and here the business produced earnings of $2.1 billion, down 20% year over year, as improved investment banking fees, and treasury services revenue were overcome by lower net interest income and higher provision expense. Revenue declined 6% driven by the impact of interest rates and deposit rotation. The diversified revenue across products and regions reflects the strength of our global banking franchise. In our GTS business, fees for managing the cash of clients offsets a lot of the NII pressure from higher rates, and clients are accessing the capital markets for their capital needs instead of borrowing. Investment banking had a strong quarter, growing fees 29% year over year to nearly $1.6 billion, led by debt capital markets fees mostly in leverage finance, and investment grade, and we finished the quarter strong maintaining our number three investment banking fee position globally.\nA solid start to 2024 has left us in a good position with top three rankings now in North America, Latin America, and EMEA and number six in APAC, and we're seeing strong performance in important industry groups as well. An increase in provision expense from last year was driven by the commercial real estate net charge-offs I discussed earlier, and expense increased 3% year over year, including continued investment in the business.\nSwitching to global markets. On slide 17, I'll focus my comments on results excluding DVA as I normally do. The team had another terrific quarter as we generated good revenue growth, achieved operating leverage, and continued to deliver a solid return on capital. Earnings of $1.4 billion grew 19% year over year, and return on average allocated capital was 13%. Revenue, and again this is ex DVA, improved 10% from Q2 2023, focusing on sales and trading. Ex-DVA revenue improved 7% year over year to $4.7 billion, and that's the highest second quarter in over a decade. FICC was down 1% while equities increased 20% compared to Q2 2023. FICC revenues remain strong, and versus Q2 2023, they were modestly lower, driven by a weaker macro trading quarter in FX and rates, and that was largely offset by better commodities and mortgage trading.\nEquities was driven by strong trading results in derivatives and cash equities year over year. Expenses were up 4% on revenue improvement and continued investment in the business. Finally, on slide 18, all other shows a loss of $4.3 billion. That was little changed year over year as lower expense was offset by lower provision costs as a result of reserve changes. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 9%. Excluding discrete items and the tax credits related to investments in renewable energy, and affordable housing, the effective tax rate would have been 25%. With that, I think we'll stop there and we'll jump into questions.\n\nLee McEntire\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Bank of America\n\nHi, Alastair. Brian. I did hear some feedback that maybe the audio from the call got interrupted for a moment. So at the point at which it got interrupted, I just want to reiterate a couple of points that Alastair was making.\nIf you go back to slide nine, where I think we lost the audio was where we started beginning a discussion about the performance from Q1 to Q2 of net interest income.\nThat was driven by higher funding costs and the rotation of deposits seeking higher yield alternatives. While higher, again, in Q2, both the rotation and the rate pay increases did continue to slow down. On slide 10, I think the only points that I would make that Alastair began to discuss there was we are just reiterating our expectation that quarter two would be the bottom for the NII in the rate cycle that we have been in and our trajectory remains the same. The belief that our NII will begin to rise in Q3 compared to Q2 and then rise again in Q4. We provided the range of expectations that Alastair covered. We expect Q4 NII to be around the $14.5 billion level, ±. That would be approximately 4% to 5% higher than this quarter's NII.\nHe began that discussion by making sure that, you know, that we pick up an extra day of net interest income in the Q3, providing about $125 million of additional NII that also carries through into Q4. You see that on the slide. It also assumes that the current forward curve will materialize. That said, that interest rate cuts will start in September. We will expect another one in November and December in the curve. The waterfall includes an estimated impact of those rates to quarterly net interest income. So then we started the discussion. He began the discussion on the fixed asset repricing, which then I think is where the audio picked back up again. We're happy to answer some questions on that. I know you'll have questions, but just wanted to recover those points for you.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one now on your telephone keypad. Again, that is star one to ask a question. We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr of Evercore.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nHi, thanks very much. Hello there. Definitely appreciate slide 10 a lot. I know you would have given us a 2025 NII guide if you wanted to give us one. So feel free to give that if you want. But that's not my question. My question is given all the pieces of the puzzle that you gave us.\nExpectations for modest loan and deposit growth and slowing.\nDeposit-seeking behavior, if you get that 4% pickup from Q2 to Q4 this year that you're expecting.\nRight now, or at least recently, consensus had NII looking flattish with that Q4 number, and that doesn't make a lot of sense given all the pieces. So maybe if you can just comment directionally if you don't want to give the number of. Does it make sense to you that we'd collectively be expecting flat NII with your higher Q4 number?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nSo Glenn, you're right. We're probably not going to give guidance around 2025 for all the reasons that you would expect. What we're trying to do here is reinforce further on what we've been saying from the beginning of the year. And that is we think Q2 is the trough and we believe from this point we're in a good position to grow. Now, when you look at some of the elements of this bridge, you'll draw your own conclusions with respect to fixed-rate asset pricing is going to persist for some period of time.\nYou'll be able to draw your own conclusions. But I just want to point out we've been pretty clear on our guidance for Q1 and Q2. We've always felt like this would be the trough. We feel like Q3 and Q4 are likely to be better. You can see our work here. We've laid it all out.\nNothing's really changed in terms of that. And the most important thing I think for everybody here is we feel like 2024 is a really foundational year. It's this twist period where we just got to get through the last of the deposit rotation and we're establishing a foundation for growth from here. So that's what we're trying to convey.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nMaybe I could just ask a follow up on.\nOn deposits within the business.\nYou have four trillion client assets. I'm curious if you break out the split between brokerage and advisory accounts?\nDo you hear me? Okay. I'm hearing tons of feedback. Sorry. Okay, sorry. Okay, so for the $4 trillion in client assets. Great. $4 trillion in client assets in wealth. I'm curious if you give us the split between brokerage and advisory. And the reason I'm asking is I'm curious how you've been handling rate paid on cash and advisory accounts, and whether we should expect any behavioral changes following the recent Wells Fargo's news. Thanks a lot. Sorry for the feedback.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nLook, I'm not sure that distinction would be the distinction I look to. We price.\nWe've gone through a massive change in cash infused in the economy and withdrawn now under monetary policy. So as we stabilize, our instructions to our team are to grow our deposit base a little bit faster economy. That means you have to price across the board to achieve that. And what if you look at the slide four or five where I showed you sort of the change? What you see is the wealth management business takes a little bit longer because those clients have more investment cash with us. Not what you're thinking. Investment cash just in their money. How they think about cash that they don't need for daily cash flow and they move that around, that largely is over. And if you look in the last four or six weeks, we're seeing those deposits in that business bounce around the $280-odd billion level.\nNot a lot of movement. It'll keep moving in and out depending on customers paying down income taxes, you know, taking more risk in the market, and all those things. But the deposit pricing changes that we made to ensure that they were at a platform they could grow, having been as high as $350 billion down to $280 billion, were made in the quarter and all through the P&L.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nOkay, so.\nOn the advisory. Thanks.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nNext question.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nWe'll take our next question from James Mitchell of Seaport Global.\n\nJames Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Seaport Global\n\nHey, good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up and I don't mean to beat a dead horse on NII, but can you just help us think through the puts and takes on NII. You have rate cuts at the end of the year. Forward curve implies more next year as that cumulative impact starts to hit next year. I guess what gives you confidence that this is sort of the trough? What are all the puts and takes that we should think about and how we model the NII for next year when we think about the forward curve and that impact.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nJim, I think this bridge probably is all the right inputs for any given year. I mean, we've chosen to do it for 2024. We've always resisted going out too far for the very simple reason that there's so many variables, and they start to multiply with one another. If you think about even the rate cut one here, we're using the three cuts, September, November, December. If I did this as of Wednesday of last week, there would have been two. Earlier in the year there were six. So since we don't know what that path looks like, it's very challenging then to provide guidance for 2025 at this stage. What we're laying out here is these are the component parts. We're going to get some benefit from fixed rate asset pricing over time.\nWe're going to get some benefit in the immediate term from the BSBY cessation that's leading back into the P&L. As that rolls off, we'll get benefit from cash flow hedges repricing, and then we use the forward curve same as you do for the rate cuts. We benefit a little bit from global markets liability sensitivity. And then that final piece is the piece that we're trying to drive in terms of organic growth. We're trying to drive this loan growth; we're trying to drive the deposit growth. And as Brian pointed out, it's been a pretty unusual period in history where we've had an enormous change in the rate structure, in the fiscal stimulus, and the effects now fading away to something more normal.\nBut that last box will come down to your assumptions versus our assumptions, and we will update you as we go through the next couple quarters, and we'll give you a better sense towards the end of the year.\n\nJames Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Seaport Global\n\nOkay, that's all fair. Maybe just on the growth piece, maybe deposits seemed to have bottomed for you guys in the Q2 of last year. You've had good growth. I think Brian pointed out even with the tax headwind this quarter you grew sequentially. Good performance but still pretty modest. How are you thinking about the growth trajectory from here? I guess, as we think about, does it accelerate with rate cuts in your view? What are the dynamics? Are you thinking about returning to the historical kind of mid single digit deposit growth within B of A in the industry?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nWell, I think Brian covered slide four. That top left chart gives a sense for what's going on with the growth. It's average growth over time there. We've had four quarters in a row, so we feel good about that. But Q2 does tend to be a slower quarter just with all the tax payments.\nSo we think deposits will do better over time, particularly as we get past peak Fed funds. We feel like the pricing and rotation, you can sort of see it in our numbers, they're slowing. So we're getting towards the end there. We're getting towards the end of QT. So we're not quite finished on all of those things yet. I'd be careful about getting too excited about deposit growth. But we feel like we're, we're doing okay so far. We just got to keep driving that.\n\nJames Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Seaport Global\n\nOkay, thanks for taking my questions.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nWe'll take our next question from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. I'll start with a simple question. You mentioned loan spreads have improved. Why is that? Where is that? Expect that to continue.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nLoan spreads have improved for us, Mike, over the course of the past. I think it's now eight or nine quarters. It's primarily in the commercial businesses, and it's largely because we have to price the balance sheet for the returns that our shareholders expect. And that's true, I think, for the industry. We've been quite purposeful in that regard. So we've tried to balance price, spread, and growth over the course of time, but it's primarily a commercial phenomenon at this point.\nI would expect that to continue for the foreseeable future. It's a competitive environment. We've got to see.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay, you gave us slide 10. A lot of details there. You talked about.\nThe September rate cut, the fixed asset repricing securities, repricing loans, repricing mortgage and auto loans maturing, November receive fixed cash flows, a whole litany of stuff. But I think when you put it all together, what it's led to is a net interest margin of only 1.93%.\nIn fact, I think your yield on your assets is below Fed funds right now. So would you agree that you're under earning with that NIM of 1.93%? And I know I've asked this question before, but you always have to mark to market what is a normal NIM? I mean, you were 2.5% in 2017, you were 3% in 2004. Now, I know the composition's changed and everything, but what's normal NIM and what do you think is a normal return on tangible common equity through the cycle? Thanks.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nSo I'd say right now, in terms of the 193, we feel like we are under. We feel like that number is going to go up over time. It'll go up as net interest income goes up. But additionally, I think the balance sheet is likely to stay kind of flattish here. So the numerator is going to grow. The denominator is going to stay pretty tight here. So we think we're under earning there. We think through a cycle we've got to get back to a more normal number like 230ish over time; that takes a while. It's a grind, quarter after quarter. So that's where we're headed. And in terms of return on allocated capital, right now we're right around that 14%. We want to be 15% and higher for our shareholder.\nA lot of it is because we've accrued an awful lot of capital over the time.\nOver the course of time, in advance of any potential capital changes. The other final thing I'll just remind you is we're a little different than some of the regional banks in that we've got an enormous Global Markets business and that obviously makes an impact on the headline NIM number.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay, and then I wasn't clear. You said net charge-offs the second half should be less than the first half. And I wasn't sure if that related to CRE or I wasn't sure what?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nCharge-off, Mike.\nThat was me. Basically what I'm saying is he plateaued in terms of the delinquencies, which means the second half is pretty well determined, as you know, because it's just a march from 3.690 to 1.80, and it'll be. The charge-off rate will be flattish. We're kind of back to normal at 3.80 or so. We underwrite to actually have a higher charge-off rate, quite frankly than that, than tolerance. But that 3.80 is kind of where we see it since 3.80%.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay, so credit card charge-offs should flatten or decline in the second half relative to the first half.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nExactly. Remember, if you think about all the charge-offs, that's the dominant part of it on the consumer side by a lot. Then the commercial, we spoke to the question of CRE office which has been dropped quarter to quarter. We expect the second half to be better off.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nWe'll take our next question from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nGood morning Steve.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGuys. So wanted to ask, just on building on some of the NIM questions from earlier, a lot of it's been focused on asset repricing, both loans and securities. I was hoping you could speak to the opportunity to potentially optimize some of your higher cost funding. And just given multiple sources of NIM improvement, looking beyond 2024, how should we think about the pace of NIM build as we. I know it's a longer timeline to get to the 230 to 240, but just how to think about the expectations around the NIM trajectory beyond 2024?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nWell, your first point is a question of, you know, can we pay down some of the higher cost securities? The answer to that is yes. That would be an expectation of ours. As part of this, we've got some shorter dated CDs that can roll off. We can replace those or not. We have shorter dated debt. We've taken our long term debt footprint down as we've continued to build the strength of the company. So there's a lot of different ways. It doesn't have to be securities reinvestment, it can be paying down higher cost.\nLiabilities as well. So we've got a lot of different ways that we can use the reinvestment, if you like, around the fixed rate. And then, what was the second? The second question was over what, really.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nSet the NIMs trajectory beyond 2024.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYeah. So look, we're obviously on it right now. We feel like this is the trough. We're going to build it from here. We'll make meaningful strides through 2025. That's where we're.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's great. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nWe'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning.\nYes. Another question on NII, Alastair. I did, I think, hear you correctly when you said that as you go into H2 2025, there's going to be incremental benefits coming from swap roll-offs?\nDid I hear that right?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYeah, that's correct. H2 2025. So as we get closer, we'll be able to give you some kind of bridge like this that allows you to see what that looks like. But it's just, it's a year out right now.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, for sure. But I'm just wondering, is there anything. I guess what I just would like to understand a little better is how the SWOT book is impacting slide 10. And then is it gradual into H2 2025?\nOr is it a switch on in Q3? Just understand how the slide comes playing into those things.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYeah. So the part that's important for slide 10 around the second half of this year is just the BSBY piece.\nIt's not from cash flow swaps. Any cash flow swaps, we have that roll off in the course of the next 12 months. Really. They're all kind of current coupon-ish because anything that we did there was to do with Libor cessation or whatever. So they all got recoupons. So I wouldn't worry about that in the second half and onwards. Some of the older, longer dated things, they've got the lower coupons so that's when the BSBY number over time will disappear. But in H2 2025, the cash flow number will begin to appear. And we'll give you a sense for what that looks like over time. Time, Betsy.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, got it.\nOn the far right-hand side of slide 10, you've got the.\nYellow box, $50 million to $200 million.\nCould you just give us a sense as to what's the inputs to the?\n50 versus the 200 just so we can be able to track it as we go through the rest of the next two quarters?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America",
    "content2": "Yeah, we're essentially using four variables. We're thinking what will the loan growth be, what will the deposit growth look like, what will be the rotation between non interest bearing and interest bearing, and what will be any pricing changes we need to make. Then the rotation and pricing are pretty closely interlinked. You could even call them the same thing. If you use more conservative numbers, you get towards the lower end. If you use slightly more constructive numbers, you get towards the higher. I think the point we're trying to convey is this last part. This yellow box is always the unknowable at the beginning of the quarter where we're projecting the pieces in the green. We kind of feel like we know what those look like. That's pretty predictable. At this point we've got a little more certainty around that.\nSo the teams, we got 213,000 people who are working really hard to try and make that dotted yellow box the higher end. But obviously it depends on our assumptions and it depends on our actions.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nSuper, thank you so much for the caller.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nWe'll take our next question from Erika Najarian of UBS.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHi, good morning. Just my first question is trying to square, you know, what you're telling us on the net interest income trajectory and the setup versus your disclosure. So you know out there, you told us about, as a response to Glenn's question, the benefit from fixed asset repricing cash flow hedges repricing in H2 2025. And when I look at table 40 from your Q in both a parallel shift and a steepener scenario down 100 is negative to net interest income. Is it? Because this is a 12 month look and like you pointed out, in H2 2025 you have underwater cash flow hedges that are rolling off. In other words, as we go through 2025, do you get less asset sensitive? And additionally, what is the notional on those cash flow hedges that you're talking about?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYeah, so the asset sensitivity that we disclose is meant to give a sense for what happens if nothing changes. It's totally static. So that's one difference.\nNumber two, it's off of the futures curve. So it's 100 above whatever or below whatever the futures curve is. So I think it's a really helpful thing for sort of short term moves and rates, like, take for example that orange box on page 10. It's helpful for something like that, but it's less helpful in terms of a predictor of where 2025 NII would be because there's still so many other inputs. Erika, over time.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nJust what's the notional of the cash flow hedges that you're referring to?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nOver time? I'd say about $150 billion.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHow much of that starts rolling off in H2 2025?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nWell, I think about it like this. You can almost think about it like it's like $10 billion or so every quarter quarter. It's just that the ones that roll off for the first 12 months, they're all kind of term coupons, so they won't really have any impact once you get into the second half of 2025, they're a little bit lower rated. So that's when you begin to get some benefit there. And then I think probably Lee can give you more of the details following.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGot it. If I could just slide in one more question on the normalized NIM 2.3 and 2.4, clearly is much higher than where you are now. Alastair, you mentioned we should assume a flattish balance sheet, but I think I had conversations with the company before in that half of that path between 1.9-ish to 2.3 to 2.4 has to do with balance sheet efficiency. I'm wondering if you could carry out the balance sheet efficiency and keep your balance sheet flattish. In other words, obviously what the market is going to do is take your earning assets, take today and apply 2.35 and say okay, over time, whether it's 2026 or 2027, this is what B of A can earn under a normalized curve. I'm wondering if that's the right math to do or should we expect some shrinkage of the balance sheet?\nIf you can, that's part of the path to Q3, Q4.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYeah. I think what will happen is.\nThe underlying growth of the company will still be there, but we have some things that we know, just like Steve asked that question. Is there any higher rate, shorter dated stuff you'd like to pay off? Yes, there will be over time. So I think we've got some ability to almost like self fund the first 100, 150 billion of growth in terms of earning assets. So that's why we're saying that will keep the denominator down while we're growing the numerator.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nWe'll take our next question from Kenneth Usdin of Jefferies.\n\nKenneth Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning.\nHey Alastair, I just wanted to ask you a little bit more on the securities portfolio side because you also have 180 billion or so of pay fixed swaps on the AFS book. So we know about the AFS HTM maturity schedule, but how do you look at that AFS book, you know, how much are those pay fixed swaps currently in the money, and kind of like how you're just thinking about that side of the portfolio as well. Thanks.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYeah. Just remember those are received fixed. So remember that there. Remember that is when we put the AFS in our portfolio; it's so that we've got a group of securities that are sitting there. They're typically Treasuries. We swap them to floating so that they look like they're cash as far as we're concerned. We don't have to worry about impact into regulatory capital flowing through. And they just view to us they just look like cash equivalents. So that's how we think about it.\nKen.\n\nKenneth Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nOkay. And then how do you manage that going forward with regards to like the rate forecast? Do those come off as the securities book matures or?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nWell, it's less of an interest rate call for us. It's more of going back to this concept of we've got $1.9 trillion of deposits.\nWe've got 1.05 trillion of loans. We've got 850 billion of excess. When the excess comes in, we can do a variety of different bonds. We'd love to put it in loans, but that's always our first. That's our first love. But in the absence of that, we're going to put it in cash, or we're going to put it in available for sale, probably swap to floating for the most part.\nWe can choose to put things in hold-to-maturity if we choose to. But obviously right now we feel like we want hold-to-maturity just continuing to pay down. That's what's been happening over the course of the past 11 quarters. We're just going to keep going with that. No particular changes to our philosophy around available-for-sale.\n\nKenneth Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nOkay. And a quick one on expenses. I believe you said that costs are kind of hanging here around the 16.3 that was reported. And so just kind of any color on puts and takes here. Just, you know, is that better kind of revenue-related comp against your ongoing efficiencies? And just how do you think about longer-term expense growth? Again, thank you.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nSure. Ken. You know, I think honestly the second quarter is sort of emblematic. If you think about last year's second quarter and this year's second quarter, we went up by 300 billion. 300 million. Excuse me. As Alastair said, 200 was just wealth management incentive comp, and the other growth was really other incentive comp. So the idea, the pressures we face now are really more due to fee growth in the businesses which typically have a tighter correlation between fees and expenses and incentive comp related to those fees. So that Alastair said that's a good expense growth. It's what you want. It does grow, and it grows at a good rate. Headcount has basically been bounced around relatively flat. We're 212 this quarter, even adding a bunch of summer teammates.\nWe were 215 last year this quarter quarter the same summer teammates included. So managing headcount, redeploying people, we have the cleanup stuff going on, we have the new initiatives going on, freeing up work and moving it over. So we feel good about managing the company, and that's against inflation rate and wages that are 3.5% going on inflation and all the services we buy in the third party markets, obviously, that the world experiences. So we feel good about how we're managing expenses. The key is pretty simple as you all the revenue side equation that.\nAlistair has been talking about and your colleagues on NI stuff is that lifts and expenses stay relatively flat. You start moving towards positive operating leverage. We're -1% or something like that this quarter, kind of hanging in there. We'll expect that to go back to the five-year track we had all the way up until the pandemic hit and things got thrown aside.\n\nKenneth Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThanks, Brian.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nWe'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nHi Brian. Hi Alastair.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nHi there.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nBrian.\nYou talked, and Alistair, both of you talked about the excess deposits. I think it was slide 22 you pointed to. Can you share with us as you go forward and assuming the Federal Reserve does cut interest rates? I know you put, I think, three Fed funds rate cuts in your slide 10. But as we go out into the end of 2025, the forward curve is calling for obviously more rate cuts. Could you tell us how you expect to price your deposits as rates continue to fall with this excess deposit level? Can you be more aggressive in lowering your deposit costs?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nI think that's very business- and, more importantly, customer-specific use.\nSo we think of.\nOur deposit strategies in the context of how our customers utilize our services. And so, if you think about the parts that price up in Global Banking or the investment-related cash and the consumer business and wealth management, that'll come back down as rates come because it's short-term equivalents come down some. It's absolutely mechanical because it's actually priced to meet a money market fund equivalent. That'll happen. And so yes, I think if you think about us being all in, if you look on that slide at 203 bps, there'll be some pickup as rates come down in those higher things, the zero interest.\nBalance accounts or low interest checking, they don't really move because there's zero interest or low interest. So they'll be kind of static but they're still extremely valuable in the current context. So when you think of all the consumer, I think 60-odd bps or so, and that's driven by the fact that we have 40-odd million transactional primary checking accounts that is growing at a million a year multiple years in a row, 900,000, a million a year that are maturing from $3,000 up to $7,000 or $8,000 in balances as people mature the relationship with us. That's where the tremendous value of the deposit base of this company goes.\nSo if you think about $1.91 trillion having grown $100 billion almost from the trough, you think about it growing 1/4 multiple quarters in a row, you think about even as we look now, July, the balance is above that amount. Those are good dynamics. So we think about it, but it'll move. But remember, part of our deposit pricing is never going to move because of zero.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nRight, right.\nNo doubt. Those are the golden deposits.\nOne other question on slide 10, and also I think if I recall your first quarter Q1, you guys indicated you were asset sensitive. I would assume that this slide 10 also shows that with the three rate cuts, Alastair, what would it take to move to a more neutral position on the balance sheet or even a liability sensitive position should the Fed really get.\nInto a rate cutting environment?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYeah, so this shows that we're asset sensitive. That's why the red box obviously is bigger than the green box. It's the market consensus that's liability sensitive. So we're still asset sensitive. Gerard, what it would take for us is either we could have a lot more rotation.\nInto interest-bearing or we could buy some short-dated duration fixed rate. So those are the two alternatives. And if you look at the course of time, if you were to go back to our Qs over time, you'd see that they become less and less rate sensitive over time. We've really narrowed the corridor of whether rates go up by 100 or down by 100. What could that outcome look like? Narrowed that pretty substantially over time because we're trying to lock in rates here, recognizing that NII is up $4 billion or $5 billion over the course of the past several years per quarter.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nYeah. The last thing I'd say, Gerard, for a person who's been around this business as many years as you have, this has been a very abnormal rate environment for the last 15 years or so. And if you get to where you have a more fed funds rate three and a half which is what our experts predict, it sort of stops out at the ability to bring that sensitivity tighter and tighter is there because you actually have room to move down without hitting zero floors and stuff. So there's stability.\nTime periods in which the rate environment doesn't flip around. And then, secondly, a higher nominal rate environment allow you to manage that outcome, because part of the other outcome for us is just as the rate structure is nominally very low, is the zero floors kick in, and that creates an amount of sensitivity that over time will go away if rate structure is higher. That makes sense to you?\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nYeah, no, it does.\nThank you.\nJust Brian or Alistair, one last quick question. I noticed in slide 25 your home equity loan balances actually increased. I think that's the first time in maybe over two or three years. Was there a new program or what are you seeing that drives that, and should that or can that continue as we go forward into 2025?\nThank you.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nYeah, I think it just reflects that the people have locked in low rate loans and now that they want to borrow it's an expensive move because they've got a fixed rate mortgage loan and they've got a home equity sitting on top of it. Why wouldn't they use it? I'd like it if it was only two years. It's been four or five years since that balance went from $30 billion and started declining. So it's good to see. I'll note at the bottom of that page, if you look at year over year mortgage production, you have $5.7 billion and $5.9 billion, and you look at home equity line production which is new originations in the boxes. Solid. But it is nice to finally see that the actual balances have stabilized and we'll see they're kind of flattish, they're not really growing.\nBut it's nice to see them not just keep coming down, and hopefully they'll start to be utilized. Our expectation would be they will be as consumers over time want to take out part of the equity in our home at a rate that is reasonable but doesn't require to refinance the whole first.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nGreat.\nThank you again, Brian.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nWe'll take our next question from Vivek Juneja of J.P. Morgan.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, thanks for the question. Just a little color on non-interest-bearing deposits. When you look at on an average basis, the decline has clearly slowed sharply. Period end was down at a faster rate. Is that just the noise around end of Q1 or what are you seeing as you look sort of month by month? Is that truly slowing and talk to it a little bit by customer segment if you can please?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYeah, I think Vivek, you're catching two things. First one is it is slowing, that rotation slowing, and we would expect that because at the end of the day this is mostly cash in motion. It's transactional accounts. That's why it's not interest bearing. And the answer why it's a little different this quarter is because of the seasonality of tax payments. If anyone has a big tax payment due, they frequently just allow it to. They may pull it out of their brokerage account, put it into their non interest bearing, and then they're wiring it out from there. So that's again an example of money in motion. But that's what's going on this quarter.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nA quick one: Vis-à-vis derivative gains, did that. Did you have anything in your equity derivatives trading revenues this quarter?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nNothing to highlight, nothing to note. That's a position we sold years ago. Anything that's happened with Visa we just unwind on the balance sheet. We've recycled it so it shouldn't have any impact to revenue.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nWe'll take a question from Matthew O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nMorning Matt.\n\nMatthew O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning.\nHow are you guys thinking about kind of targeted capital levels going forward? Obviously we're still waiting for final rules. Maybe there's a little more volatility in your SCB than you would have thought, but you still got a nice buffer. Then I guess one last piece. I was thinking of the remixing of the balance sheet that's been commented kind of throughout this call over time probably causes a little creep in RWAs, right? Like loans higher than securities so lots of excess capital, but some puts and takes. How are you thinking about it between now and when we get final guidelines?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nFirst off, I think.\nWe always want to use the capital to grow the business. So if we need to use it to support RWA growth for loans or something, that's a good outcome and that's.\nWhat we want to do first.\nSecond, we maintain 11.9% quarter to quarter with little bit RWA increase. I think that would be sort of emblematic.\nAnd we bought $3.5 billion, paid out $1.9 billion dividends. So you expect that kind of to continue on in terms of that basic idea of we don't need a lot of capital to grow because the RWA demands are met with a fairly straightforward amount. We're earning a nice amount of dollars and we'll deploy it back in the dividend and the buybacks.\nWe'll.\nOur job is to maintain a 50 bps type of management buffer to whatever the requirements are. The volatility.\nWell, there's a whole different discussion on that in terms of the wisdom of that. But the reality is the volatility is absorbable because you have time to plan into it and get done within the range that we've seen. So whether we agree with the volatility or not, we've easily absorbed it, and the new rules coming out, we'll see what happens and we'll adjust. But just because, basically, a requirement of 10.7 under the new SCB +50s, 11.2 maybe get a little tighter if you feel you got great insight to what happens next year. And then I think the finalization of Basel III will come through, and we'll see what that is and see how that all correlates to the various aspects.\nBut we feel good about where we are and expect that all current earnings are basically available to support the growth we're talking about in the current economic environment. That's relatively modest need, but really the rest of it just goes plowing back to you.\n\nMatthew O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, and then just to summarize that, I mean, do you think about bringing down the 119 to 112 in the near term or just make the obvious like wait, that's a little bit more?\nTheoretically and wait for the capital rules to play out.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nI think we just need to see how the next 60, 90, 120 days play out here. A lot of discussion about the timing of a RE proposal or not, et cetera. So we have a lot of flexibility, but we continue to focus on shareholder value creation with that. But I think we're in a critical spot for the industry in terms of learning the outcome of a lot of these things over the next short period of time here.\n\nMatthew O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThat concludes our question and answer session for the day. I'd be happy to return the call to Brian Moynihan for closing comments.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nThank you, operator. Thank all of you for joining us today. Obviously, a lot of focus on NII, and we gave you the slide 10 to give you the bridge. Alastair answered a lot of questions. Lee's here to answer it. The key is to understand what's driving that, which is deposit performance, which has stabilized and starting to grow for like six quarters in a row now. Loan growth very low, and it looks very low. But just staying positive, those are going to drive the value of this franchise, and that's going to organic growth by our customers. That's coupled with strong fee performance this quarter in terms of wealth management fees, investment banking fees, consumer fees, even growing global payment services fees, and, of course, the great work done by our markets team.\nSo that level of flattish expenses give us a chance to start driving, operating, and leverage again in the company, and that generates a lot of earnings, a lot of excess capital, and we put that back in your hands. So thank you for your time and attention.\nWe look forward to talking next quarter.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThis does conclude today's Bank of America earnings announcement. You may now disconnect your lines, and everyone have a great day.\nOnce again, today's Bank of America earnings announcement has concluded. You may now disconnect."

Welcome, and thank you for joining the call to review our Q1 results. Our earnings release documents are available on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. That includes the earnings presentation that we will be referring to during the call. I trust that everyone's had a chance to review the documents. I'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments before Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, discusses the details of the quarter. Before they begin, let me just remind you we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nFactors that may cause our actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials, our SEC filings that are available on our website. Information about non-GAAP financial measures, including the reconciliations to US GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials that are available on the website. So with that, I'll turn the call over to you, Brian. Thanks.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nThank you, Lee. Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us. I am starting on Slide two of the earnings presentation. We once again delivered a strong set of results in Q1. We reported net income of $6.7 billion after tax and EPS of $0.76. This included the additional expense accrual for the industry's special assessment by the FDIC to recover losses from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. This lowered our Q1 EPS by $0.07. Excluding that expense, net income was $7.2 billion and EPS of $0.83 per share in Q1. Alastair's going to walk you through the details of the quarter momentarily, but first, let me give you a few thoughts on our performance.\nWe delivered good improvement in our fee-based business, driven both by continued organic growth and good market conditions. Investment banking saw a nice rebound this quarter. We delivered nearly $1.6 billion in investment banking fees and grew 35% from Q1 2023. Matthew Koder and the team have done a great job delivering market share growth. In addition, our results reflect the benefits of investments made in our middle market investment banking teams and dual coverage teams. Matthew has utilized his hiring power wisely to grow our middle market team from 15 bankers in 2018 across a dozen cities to more than 200 bankers in twice as many cities today.\nBoth groups work with our commercial bankers and wealth management advisors in those cities to deliver for our clients. Investment and brokerage services revenue across Merrill and the Private Bank grew 11% year-over-year in Q1 to nearly $3.6 billion. Continued investments in our advisor training programs and digital delivery for our clients, as well as positive market, helped us deliver strong revenue. Asset under management flows were $25 billion in the quarter. Sales and trading, excluding DVA, delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue improvement. At $5.2 billion, this is the highest Q1 result in over a decade. We have allocated more balance sheet invested in talent to build on our strengths of the last five years in this business.\nThose investments, plus the intensity of the teams under Jimmy DeMare's leadership, have resulted in good momentum and market share improvement. From a balance sheet perspective, we entered the quarter expecting modest moves in loan growth and a decline in deposits. That was our expectations. What we actually delivered was growth in ending deposits of more than $20 billion. Ending loans were down modestly due to the expected credit card seasonality. Otherwise, loans were pretty stable. This balance sheet performance, along with our continued pricing discipline, allowed us to deliver better than expected NII performance.\nWe told you last quarter that we expected NII to decline from the Q4 of 2023 to the Q1 of 2024, a decline of about $100 to 200 million. We actually reported today NII of $14.2 billion. That was $100 million higher than Q4, exceeding our guidance. We continued to deliver strong expense management. Year-over-year expenses, adjusted for the FDIC assessment, were up a little less than 2%. That compares to a 4%+ inflation rate. We also continued to invest in our company while managing those expenses. We had several categories of stronger fee-based revenue in the Q1 of this year.\nThis drove higher formulaic compensation and processing costs of the increased activity. Fees and commissions were up 10% year-over-year. We are happy to pay for that revenue and deliver margins to the bottom line because of it. So how did we do all that and hold expenses under the inflation rate? Well, we remained focused on three primary drivers of Bank of America. First, our operational excellence platform continues to deliver and improve processes. These savings from that growth help fund the future growth in the company and lower the risk. Second, we managed headcount as we eliminated work. Recall we noted an expectation in January of last year that our headcount would be down throughout the year.\nOur headcount at the end of Q1 2024 is down by more than 4,700 people from the Q1 2023. It declined 650 people just from the end of 2023. The digitization activity is also driving ongoing expense cost savings, customer retention, and market share improvement, driving across all three factors. It also supports the ever-increasing volumes of client activity with little increased cost. I would highlight our continued capital strength with Common Equity Tier 1 capital of $197 billion. That amount of capital is $31 billion over the current regulatory minimums for our company.\nThat capital has allowed us to both support our clients and return $4.4 billion to shareholders this quarter in share repurchases and dividends. Let me highlight a few points on organic growth before I pass over to Alastair. Now I'm turning to Slide three. You can see Slide three, the highlights of the Q1 success of organic activity across the businesses. We continued to invest and enhance our digital platforms.\nWe provide our customers with convenient and secure banking experiences. By leveraging our technology and continuous investment in that technology and putting customers at the center of everything we do, we have successfully deepened our relationships and expanded our customer base across all our businesses. In consumer, we had 245,000 net new checking accounts this quarter. This completes 21 straight quarters of net additions. Dean Athanasia, Aron Levine, and Holly O'Neill helped drive that business for us and continue to perform well, driving strong performance across our consumer franchise.\nThese checking balances continue to drive the performance of our consumer deposits. These checking additions are important for many other reasons. On average, 68% of our deposit balances have been with us for more than 10 years. 92% of the customer checking accounts are primary checking accounts in the household, meaning that they're the core operating account for the household for their financial lives. So when we onboard a client, we start a long-term valuable relationship. About 60% of our checking accounts customers use a debit card. On average, they do about 400 transactions per year on that card.\nThe new checking accounts have traditionally opened savings accounts about 25% of the time within a few months of opening that checking account. At opening, a new checking account, on average, brings about $4,000 in balances below our averages. But that continues to grow, and within a year, it's two times that amount. Likewise, when we open a new savings account, it, on average, brings about $7,000 in balances. This also deepens the buy about two times during the year.\nInvestment relationships and credit card account openings continue to be strong in the Q1 as well. And while we believe some of these statistics are best in class, rest assured there are plenty of opportunities for further growth in our franchise and our company. As we think about our global wealth team led by Eric Schimpf, Lindsay Hans, and Katy Knox, that team added 7,300 net new wealth relationships at the Merrill and the Private Bank. Our advisors opened 29,000 new bank accounts in the quarter with our customers, deepening the relationships.\nMore than 60% of our investing clients in Merrill and 90% of our private banking clients now have a core banking relationship with us. In addition, across our wealth spectrum, we saw $60 billion in total flows over the last year. As you can see on the slide, we now manage more than $5.6 trillion in total client balances across loans, deposits, and investments in consumer and wealth management. When we moved to global banking, we added more new relationships in this quarter than we did in last year's first quarter. We also increased the number of solutions per relationship with pre-existing clients.\nJust like in our consumer business, we have seen good growth in customers seeking the benefits of both our physical and our online capabilities and also the care of our talented relationship managers who provide financing solutions and advice for our clients with global needs. A couple of other points I'd make on our digital success. Erica, our virtual banking assistant, reached a key milestone of more than 2 billion interactions since its introduction about six years ago. It took four years to reach 1 billion interactions.\nIt took just 18 months to reach the second billion. In August, we extended Erica's reach and launched Erica in our global treasury services business in CashPro. Erica has resolved 43% of the CashPro chat inquiries automatedly, demonstrating more and more clients are able to self-solve. This is a great example of best practices being shared across the scale of our company. Second, as an example of our digital success, Zelle continues to grow. It wasn't long ago that we noted that the number of Zelle transactions in a quarter had surpassed the numbers of checks written.\nShortly after that, Zelle transactions reached two times the number of checks written. This quarter, Zelle transactions has now passed the combined number of checks written, plus the amount of cash withdrawals from tellers and from ATMs. That is a rapid adoption and represents continued cost savings, convenience, and security for the customers. These stats and others are included in our quarterly acronym for our digital banking progress. That's included in slides 22 and 24. I encourage you to read them. They show our market-leading efforts representing billions of dollars of our investment over the years.\nWe are continuing to drive growth with expense growth under control. This solid earnings result achieved this quarter is a testament to the dedication and talent of our 212,000 people who work here and deliver for our customers every day. I thank them for another great quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to Alastair.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nThank you, Brian. I'm going to start on slide four of the earnings presentation. So Brian covered much of the income statement highlights, and he noted the difference in our reported results and the results adjusted for the FDIC assessment. I'm not going to repeat that. I just add that we delivered strong returns. On a reported basis, our return on average assets was 83 basis points, and return on tangible common equity was 12.7%. And when adjusted for the FDIC assessment, our efficiency ratio was 64%, ROA at 89 basis points, and ROTCE at 14%. Let's move to the balance sheet on Slide five, where we ended the quarter at $3.27 trillion of total assets, up $94 billion from the Q4.\nThe bulk of that increase was in global markets to support seasonally elevated levels of client activity. Outside of the global markets activity, we'd highlight both the $23 billion growth in deposits and the $20 billion decline in cash levels. So with that increase in liquidity, you'll also note that debt securities increased $39 billion, which included an $8 billion decline in held-to-maturity securities and a $47 billion increase in AFS securities. And those are mostly hedged US Treasuries added with yields effectively at cash rates. At $313 billion, our absolute cash levels remain higher than required. Liquidity remains strong with $909 billion of global liquidity sources, and that's up $12 billion from the Q4 and remains $333 billion above our pre-pandemic Q4 2019 level.\nShareholders' equity increased $1.9 billion from the Q4 earnings as they were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders. And AOCI was little changed in the quarter. During the quarter, we paid out $1.9 billion in common dividends, and we bought back $2.5 billion in shares, which more than offset our employee awards. As part of those share awards in the Q1, we announced our seventh consecutive year of sharing success compensation awards, covering more than 95% of our associates and further aligning their interest with shareholders. Tangible book value per share of $24.79 is up 9% year-over-year.\nLooking at regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $197 billion from 31 December , and the CET1 ratio was stable at 11.8% and remained well above our current 10% requirement. We also remain quite well positioned against the current proposed capital rules, as our CET1 level is also above the 10% requirement, even when we include estimated RWA inflation from those new proposed rules. Risk-weighted assets increased modestly, driven by client activity in global markets, and our supplemental leverage ratio was 6% compared to a minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves capacity for balance sheet growth. At $475 billion of total loss-absorbing capital, our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements.\nLet's turn our balance sheet focus to loans by looking at the average balances on Slide six. Average loans in the Q1 of $1.048 trillion were flat compared to the Q4, and they improved 1% year-over-year, as solid credit card growth was partially offset by declines in securities-based lending. Commercial loans grew modestly year-over-year. We experienced modest improvement in revolver utilization, and commercial lending in the Q1, and that's being offset for the most part by paydowns as larger client financing solutions are being met through capital markets access.\nLastly, on a positive note, loan spreads continued to widen. Moving to deposits, we'll stay focused on averages on Slide seven. Relative to pre-pandemic Q4, 2019, average deposits are still up 35%. Every line of business remains well above their pre-pandemic levels, and consumer is up 32%, with checking up 38%, driven by net new checking accounts added, as Brian noted earlier. Linked quarter total average deposits remained steady at more than $1.9 trillion. The total rate paid on consumer deposits in the quarter was 55 basis points. While the rate increased 9 basis points from the Q4, the pace of increases continues to slow. The mix of low-rate and high-quality transactional accounts keeps the rate paid low.\nWealth management and global banking also saw a slowdown in the increases in their rate paid and slowdown in the rotation out of non-interest-bearing accounts in the Q1. Focusing for a moment on ending deposits and movement from the Q4, this quarter we delivered good deposit growth. Total deposits grew $23 billion, and they're now $100 billion above their trough in mid-May of 2023. Consumer banking deposits saw growth in both consumer interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing. Global banking continued their more normal pattern of deposits seen for the past five quarters and up more than $30 billion over the last year.\nDeposit growth exceeded loan growth for the third straight quarter, and our excess of deposits over loans expanded to $897 billion. That's nearly two times the $450 billion we had pre-pandemic. You can see that on the upper left-hand side of Slide eight. We continue to have a mix of cash, available-for-sale securities, and held-to-maturity securities. This quarter, our combination of cash and AFS is now 52% of the total $1.2 trillion noted on this page. You'll also notice the continued change in mix of the shorter-term portfolio as we again lower cash and increase AFS securities that are mostly hedged and have similar yields to the cash.\nNote also the held-to-maturity book continues to decline from paydowns. In total, the held-to-maturity book is now down $96 billion from its peak, and it consists of about $122 billion in treasuries, about $458 billion in mortgage-backed securities, and $7 billion of other securities. Lastly, the blended cash and securities yield of 360 basis points continued to rise and remained about 168 basis points above the rate we pay for deposits. The replacement of lower-earning assets into higher-yielding assets continues to provide an ongoing benefit to NII. Let's turn our focus to NII performance using slide nine, where you can see on a fully tax-equivalent basis, NII was $14.2 billion. Good deposit growth provided a strong start to the year for NII.\nAnd as Brian noted, NII of $14.2 billion increased by $100 million from the Q4. Now, that compares to our expectation and guidance of a decline of $100 to 200 million, and that would have resulted in NII this quarter of $13.9 or 14 billion. So we did quite a bit better than we had originally expected. The improvement in quarterly NII in Q1 compared to Q4 2023 included the benefits of higher-yielding assets and improvement in global markets NII, partially offset by higher deposit costs and one less day in Q1 than Q4 2023.\nDeposit balance activity more generally also aided in the beat versus our expectations. As we look forward for Q2, we expect some modest impact of lower deposits in wealth management as clients make their seasonal income tax payments. We expect global markets NII to decline mostly seasonally a little bit as well. We expect Q2 NII could approach $14 billion on an FTE basis. Further, we continue to expect that Q2 will be the low point for NII, and we expect the back half of 2024 to grow.\nCompared to our guidance last quarter, we're obviously growing off a larger base of NII after having outperformed in the Q1. With regard to that forward view, let me just note a few other caveats. It includes our assumption that interest rates in the forward curve at the end of the quarter materialize. At the end of Q1, there were still three cuts expected this year starting in June. Our forward view also includes an expectation of low single-digit loan growth and some moderate growth in deposits as we move into the back half of 2024. Given our recent deposit and loan performance, we continue to feel good about these assumptions.\nTurning to asset sensitivity and focused on a forward yield curve basis, our sensitivity to the ±100 basis points parallel shifts in the forward curve at 31 March remains well balanced. Okay, let's turn to expenses, and we'll use Slide 10 for that discussion, where we reported $17.2 billion in expenses this quarter, including the FDIC assessment. Adjusted for the assessment, expenses were $16.5 billion.\nThe increase over the fourth quarter included a little more than $400 million in seasonal payroll tax expense, as well as higher revenue-related costs, and to a lesser extent, annual merit increases and other annual awards like sharing success awards provided this quarter. The $16.5 billion was just a little above our forecast for Q1, which we made last quarter. The increase is driven by better-than-expected fee revenue across wealth management, investment banking, and sales and trading. As Brian said, that's a trade-off we're more than happy to make, bringing more earnings to the bottom line.\nWhile expense is up almost 2% from last year, we simply remind you inflation is up by more than 4%, and we've increased our investment, and we're paying for the revenue growth. So we think it represents good work by our teams. As we look forward in Q2, we expect a decline from the Q1 level, as we typically see about two-thirds of the Q1 elevated payroll tax expense come back out. The remainder of the year, expense is expected to trend down. Continued digital engagement savings and operational excellence initiatives should help us offset other cost increases for people, and technology through the back half of the year.\nTurning to credit on Slide 11, provision expense was $1.3 billion in the Q1, and that included $179 million of reserve release due to a modestly improved macro-environmental outlook as the baseline consensus expectations improved from the Q4. On a weighted basis, we remain reserved for an unemployment rate of nearly 5% by the end of 2025, compared to the most recent actual 3.8% rate. Net charge-offs of $1.5 billion increased $306 million from the Q4, driven by continued credit card seasoning and commercial real estate office exposures, as swift revaluations from current appraisals and resolutions drove higher charge-offs.\nThe net charge-off ratio was 58 basis points, a 13 basis point increase from the Q4. On slide 12, we show you the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs increased $115 million versus the Q4 from the flow-through of higher late-stage credit card delinquencies. We included a credit card delinquency Slide number 28 in our appendix. We're encouraged by the trend of delinquencies because the late-stage increases slowed and early-stage delinquencies improved as well. That leads us to believe we should begin to see consumer net charge-offs start to level out over the next quarter or so.\nAll of this is still well within our risk appetite and our expectations, and it's consistent with the normalization of credit we've discussed with you in prior calls. Commercial net charge-offs increased $191 million versus the Q4, driven by commercial real estate losses in office exposures. And on office losses this quarter, we recorded charge-offs on 16 office loans. Four were a result of sales activity, i.e., final resolution. Seven were from losses that we expect on exposures that are in the process of expected resolution in the course of the next 90 days.\nAnd the rest we took as a result of refreshed valuations. We're using a continuous and thorough loan-by-loan analysis, and we're quick to recognize impacts in the commercial real estate office space through our risk ratings. And that's resulted in several downgrades in the last few quarters.\nAs a result of these quick actions and our downgrades in categorization, we've also refreshed the valuation of our reservable criticized properties, and we've taken appropriate reserves and charge-offs in the process. Roughly one-third of our office exposure is now categorized as reservable criticized. Importantly, the pace of the increase in reservable criticized exposures has slowed each quarter since Q2 of last year. We believe the losses on these office properties have been front-loaded and largely reserved.\nWe expect the losses to move lower in Q2, and we expect a notable decline in H2 of the year when compared to H1 of this year, absent any material change in expected real estate prices. In the appendix on Slide 29, we've included a current view of our commercial real estate and office portfolio metrics as we usually do. Okay, let's turn to the various lines of business and offer some brief comments on their results, starting on Slide 13 with consumer banking. For the quarter, consumer banking earned $2.7 billion on continued strong organic growth. The reported earnings declined 15% year-over-year as revenue declined from lower deposit balances compared to Q1 2023. Credit card loss normalization also caused year-over-year provision expense to increase.\nAs Brian noted, customer activity showed another strong quarter of net new checking growth, another strong period of card openings, and investment balances for consumer clients, which climbed 29% year-over-year to a record $456 billion. That included market appreciation and also very strong full-year flows of $44 billion. As noted earlier, loans grew nicely year-over-year from credit card, as well as small business, where we remain the industry leader.\nExpenses were flat year-over-year, fighting off inflation, merit increases, higher minimum wages, and new and renovated financial centers and technology investments. So holding expense flat reflected very good work by the consumer team. As you can see on the Appendix, page 20, digital adoption and engagement continued to improve, reaching a record of 3.4 billion digital logins in the quarter, and it showed good year-over-year improvement. Customer satisfaction scores at near-record levels illustrate the continued appreciation of the enhanced capabilities we provide. Moving to wealth management on Slide 14, we produced good results, and that included good organic client activity, market favorability, and strong flows.\nOur comprehensive suite of investment and advisory services, coupled with a commitment to personalized wealth management planning and solutions, has enabled us to meet the diverse needs and aspirations of our clients. In Q1, we reported record revenue of $5.6 billion and a little more than $1 billion in net income. That net income rose 10% from Q1 2023. The business generated positive operating leverage and grew revenue faster than expense while improving the pre-tax margin year-over-year. While overall average loans were down year-over-year, driven by the securities-based lending, it's worth noting the strong growth we're seeing in custom lending. Ending loans in the wealth management custom loan book are up 6% year-over-year.\nAs Brian noted earlier, both Merrill and the private bank continue to see strong organic growth and produce good assets under management flows of more than $60 billion since Q1 2023, which reflects a good mix of new client money as well as existing clients putting money to work. Expense growth here matched the revenue growth, otherwise fighting off higher investment costs and inflation. Let me also highlight the continued digital momentum here. As an example, Merrill has 86% of its clients now engaging with us digitally, and 80% utilizing e-delivery. 76% of their eligible accounts are now open digitally.\nSo the cost for us to open is half, and the customer cycle times are improved greatly. On Slide 15, you see global banking results, and the business produced earnings of just less than $2 billion, down 22% year-over-year, as improved investment banking fees and treasury services revenue were overcome by lower net interest income and higher provision expense. Revenue declined 4%, driven by the impact of interest rates and deposit rotation to interest-bearing, and that impacted NII.\nThe diversification of our revenue across products and regions continues to reflect the strength of this platform, and GTS and investment banking fees are good examples. In our global treasury services business, some of the NII pressure from higher rates on deposits is offset by the fees paid for moving and managing the cash of clients, and that continues to grow with existing clients as well as with new client generation. As Brian noted, investment banking had a strong quarter, and at 1.6 billion in investment banking fees, this quarter was the strongest quarter in seven years, absent the pandemic 2020 and 2021 periods.\nAn increase in provision expense included the commercial real estate net charge-offs I discussed earlier, as well as a larger reserve release in the prior year period. Expense increased 2% year-over-year, including the 35% lift in investment banking fees from Q1 2023. Switching to global markets on Slide 16, we'll focus our comments on results excluding DVA, as we normally do. The team had another terrific quarter with $1.8 billion in earnings, growing 7% year-over-year. Revenue improved 6% from the Q1 of 2023, and return on average allocated capital was 16%. Focusing on sales and trading ex DVA, revenue improved 2% year-over-year to $5.2 billion, which is the highest Q1 result in over a decade.\nFICC was down 4%, while equities increased 15% compared to the Q1 of 2023. The decline in the FICC revenues versus the Q1 was driven by a weaker macro trading quarter that was partially offset by better mortgage trading results. Equities was driven by strong trading results in derivatives, and year-over-year expenses were up 4% on continued investment in the business.\nFinally, on Slide 17, all other shows a loss of $700 million, driven by the FDIC assessment. Revenue declined year-over-year, reflecting higher investment tax credit deals, and expense adjusted for the FDIC assessment was down $113 million, driven by lower unemployment processing costs. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 8%, and excluding the FDIC assessment and other discrete items, it would have been 9%. Further excluding tax credits related to investments in renewable energy and affordable housing, our effective tax rate would have been 26%. Thank you, and with that, we'll jump into Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one now on your telephone keypad. To withdraw yourself from the queue, you may press the pound key. We'll take our first question from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, Steven.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nSo maybe just to start off with a question on capital management, just given the strength of your excess capital position, but maybe still some uncertainty around Basel III endgame and where the proposal could ultimately shake out, was hoping you could just speak to where you're comfortable running on CET1. When can we expect that you'll return to 100%+ type payout?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nI think you should expect that we'll run a cushion. Whatever rules come out and when they come out and get clarity, we'll expect to run the requirements +50 basis points, up to 100 basis points of excess, and anything above that will be either used to continue to grow the company. If needed or not, it'll be returned. And so we're just, as all of us are, waiting for the finalization of these rules. Right now, we're sitting on $30 billion under the old rules. We have enough under the new rules as previously proposed, but obviously, they're talking about changing them. So you should expect clarity on that.\nWhat you'd also expect is, as we think about it, beginning now, you're basically at the point where you're sitting on the capital. There's a very modest need to build a cushion to the rules that's proposed, and any change would be more favorable, that I assume. So expect us to continue to return capital at a fairly strong rate as we move through Q2 and beyond and the rules become clarified.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat color, Brian. And for my follow-up, just on the NII commentary, Alastair, it sounds like you're still assuming some modest deposit growth in the back half as part of that NII trajectory, that recovery off the trough in Q2. Just given your deposit balances increased $500 billion since COVID, I know some of that's going to be a function of share gains, but as we prepare for some QT-driven outflows, how are you handicapping the risk of deposit attrition, and how does that impact the NII guidance if you can frame any sort of sensitivity, recognizing many of those tend to be hot money or higher-cost deposits?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYeah. So first thing I would just say, Steven, is we've been up against Q2 now for the last couple of years. So the deposits are beginning to settle in now. And if we were to go back to, if you take, for example, consumer, if you were to go back to pre-pandemic and think about what long-term sustainable growth rates look like for consumer, if you just extended that through from the Q4 of 2019 to today, given that the economy is 30% larger, we kind of feel like consumer is approaching that floor.\nSo we're still in this belief that Q2 is going to be Q3, maybe the turning point for consumer. You can see that slowing now. The rest of our business, if you look at the exhibit we put together on deposits, if you look at that bottom left chart on wealth, you'll see it slowed and grew this quarter. And then in global banking on the right-hand side of that page, they're kind of back to pre-pandemic growth rates. They're up 7% year-over-year.\nSo we're seeing some structure now in the deposit base. Even with QT over the course of the past year, our deposits are up $100 billion. So it has been a point of conviction of ours that as we get towards Q2, we should see the consumer side begin to stabilize. That's what's driving our conviction that NII will go up in Q3 and Q4. We're in that transition period right now.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat colo. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Well, thanks for the outlook for NII and consumer charge-off, but once again, I go back to efficiency. And you highlight the 2 billion Erica interactions, the last billion in the last 18 months. You mentioned Zelle transactions; now double the check transactions are more than checks plus cash withdrawals from ATMs plus cash withdrawals from tellers. So for all the great tech work, the efficiency ratio improved 66% to 64% quarter over quarter, but I know you're still not happy with that 64%. So as you see the NII decline in sight, and as you have this tech evolution continuing, when do you think you can get below a 60% efficiency ratio? What's your outlook for that? Because I'm just reconciling the numbers that we look at with all the progress you're making internally. Thanks.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nYeah, Mike, I think as NII sort of moves along the path Alastair mentioned, all that sort of flows through because there's no more activity attached, as you're pointing out, and we continue to reduce the marginal expense of that activity because largely that's consumer wealth management and global banking, which don't add lots more clients and stuff and lots more activity, even though the numbers go up, it's out of efficiency. So that continues to improve our efficiency ratio. As you also well know, when the revenue growth is coming through the wealth management business, which by definition, because of the way the compensation process works, has a lowest efficiency ratio in the company, that's a good thing because it grows and we get good profitability growth out of it, but we're fighting that trend.\nAs one of the largest wealth management businesses in the world, if not, it's a higher percentage of our revenues and our expense base. So we're continuing to drive it down. We're at 64. You'd expect that to improve as the deposit balance has stabilized for many quarters now and starting to grow. The rate paid has really flattened out sequentially by quarter, and the yield of the portfolio and the yield of the assets continues to grow. So we feel good about how it's going. Our focus is really on deploying expenses and operating leverage, and as we get through the twist in NII, you should start to see us return to that again, and that will then obviously drive down the efficiency ratio.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nSo what are you thinking about expense growth for the rest of the year or next year? For a while there, you're trying, and I get it. Inflation has gone up quite a bit, but what are your thoughts about expense growth looking ahead?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nWell, last year, remember, Mike, we told you we thought we could drive expense down every quarter. We believe this year the expense will trend down over the course of this year. And obviously, Q1's inflated a little bit with just payroll tax and some of the revenue seasonality, but underneath that, there's pretty significant revenue strength. So I think that probably costs us $100 million or so this quarter. I think we probably are looking, if this environment continues, we're looking at another $100 million per quarter going forward, but to Brian's point, it's the good expense that comes with revenue growth over time. That's really the only change, I'd say, with respect to how we think about the expense picture.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from John McDonald of Autonomous Research.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst of Large-cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Wanted to follow up on the helpful deposit commentary, Alastair. So you mentioned the consumer. You're thinking that'll stabilize in the back half of the year on deposits. Wondering what your mixed shift expectations are. Earlier this year, you kind of thought that those customers that had moved for rate-seeking already had. And just wondering if higher rates for longer could put some pressure on rate-seeking behavior again and what you're baking in in terms of mixed shift from non-interest bearing into interest bearing in your outlook and your planning?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nYeah, John, I think if you look at seven, you can see sort of the mix in the left-hand corner. Remember that one of the things we all have to be careful about is in the Global Banking area, the way the fees are paid and earnings credit messes up the simplicity of non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing, so it's complex. But if you look at the quarters coming across from Q1 2023 through Q1 2024, you can see that you're seeing the rate of change slow dramatically and kind of settle in. So a lot of the money has moved. If you look at the seven-day average for consumer, go all the way back to the early part of October, it's been relatively stable at $950 billion, $960 billion.\nSo we're just getting through the tax seasons and the ins and outs and the wealth management business, consumer, people paying taxes out on the wealthier side and receiving benefits on the tax refund side. So as we stabilize in that, we expect it to grow. We don't expect a massive change in how the deposits are structured from what's in money markets, what's in savings, what's in checking, what's in that. It's really slowed down and been relatively stable. So things bump around, but it's all very good value.\nEven the highest paid balances in the wealth management business are good value for the company. But if you look at what really drives the value, it's the $950-odd billion in checking balances. You can see on page 7, the core checking balances. That's what drives it.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst of Large-cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nYeah. So you're still feeling, Brian, like the bulk of people that have kind of moved on rate-seeking behavior likely have done so?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nYeah. If you look on the consumer business and you think about tracking those deposit accounts from pre-pandemic to now, which is one thing we've talked about for different purposes, but if you look at where all the deposit balances, if people with lower average balances are still multiples of where they're pre-pandemic, people in the higher balances are actually lower because obviously they were sitting on cash when the pandemic and accumulated more cash, and when rates came up, they moved it. And all in that gives you what you see in consumer, which is, in the end of the day, a couple hundred billion dollars over where it was pre-pandemic.\nBut the people have moved, and you're seeing it month to month relatively stable as we track that every month. And on both sides, frankly, the lower average balance accounts from pre-pandemic are basically bouncing around at the same level right now, not going down, not going up. And the higher ones are stable, but they are down 15% to 20 for people with a half million, a million-dollar balances, largely because they moved it in the market. So we feel it's stabilized. There'll be ins and outs, and we'll see it play out, but it's extremely valuable no matter how you look at it.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst of Large-cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay. And maybe as a quick follow-up for Alastair, it's nice to see the core NIM, the net interest yield X markets inflect positively this quarter. Is that sustainable, do you feel like? And what are some of the fixed asset reprice dynamics that are tailwinds beyond the $10 billion per quarter on securities in terms of loans and swaps that'll come due over the next year or two and help the NIM a bit? Could you talk a little bit about that?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nSure. We've talked about the fact that the net interest yield obviously this quarter benefits from the NII growth, so you're getting in the numerator. But we inflated the denominator in terms of the average earning assets last year as we just made the balance sheet more liquid. So that's going to allow us to continue, as the deposits grow, to grow the net interest income over time without necessarily growing the other earning assets.\nSo Q2 will have a little more of a challenge, but going forward, I expect all the NII improvement in Q3 and Q4 to drop into that net interest yield. And part of the thing supporting that, John, as you pointed out, is we do have loans repricing. Because we've got loans coming off the balance sheet, we're booking new loans at higher rates. So that's one element. The second element is we've got securities that we're reinvesting underneath all this too. So obviously, we're sweeping the hold-to-maturity paydowns and reinvesting those at much higher rates. And then third, the teams have been working hard at repricing the balance sheet broadly for things like loans. And I believe we've now had seven quarters in a row of improving loan pricing. So we just got to keep grinding away at that.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst of Large-cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nGood morning.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nSo thanks very much for taking the question. I guess I just wanted to follow up on the conversation you're just having. And Alastair, I know that, look, your NII guide improved this quarter due to Q1 results being better than what you had anticipated a quarter ago. My question is on the H2 2024 improvement. I get that it's going to be an improvement from first half, right? That's basically the base that you're looking at. I'm wondering how you're thinking about the NII trajectory on a year. I believe NII is down about 3% year-on-year in Q1. Should we anticipate that that is kind of stable pace throughout the year, or that reduces as well when we're talking about H2 2024? If you could just give us a sense of year-on-year, that'd be helpful. Thanks.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nBetsy, before Alastair answers your question, it's good to have you back, and we wish you good luck with everything. So Alastair, why don't you hit that?\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOh, thanks so much, Brian. Really appreciate that.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nIt's good to have you. So I guess a couple of things. The first thing is we haven't changed our perspective in terms of this idea of Q2 being the low point and the trough for the year. We haven't changed our point of view on growing in terms of Q3 and Q4. I think the important thing we're trying to convey is because of the continued stability in pricing rotation and because of this continued stability in deposits, we feel like that extra couple hundred million in Q1 is something that should flow through in Q2, Q3, and Q4.\nAnd then there'll be a second dynamic to watch for as well, Betsy, which is if we have less rate cuts, we're going to benefit from that. We won't necessarily benefit a lot in Q2 because there isn't enough cuts or time in Q2. But I think by the time we get to Q3 and Q4, we'll know more about the rate structure at that point, and we'll be able to tell you more about what we expect for the growth in the back half of the year. But we're reasonably optimistic there.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nSuper. That's perfect. Thank you. Then just one follow-up is on the AOCI. So we all know that HTM is a portfolio that you're in runoff on, I guess, if that's fair to say, that the balances are pulling off. And this quarter, we did have a backup in the long end of the curve. Your AOCI really didn't flex that much. And part of my question is, is that a function of how the securities book is comprised? And you've been shifting towards treasuries, and that's reducing this risk as the back end of the curve increases. I just wanted to understand how that's trajectory in your mind because it is a concern that people raise. And what I saw today suggests that it's much less of a concern than it had been a year ago, say, for example. Would you agree with that or?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYes. I mean, we've deliberately worked on that over time, but we've always, I think, had a pretty good program of hedging the fixed-rate securities in the AFS book so that they're swapped. And that means that if rates go up, we obviously benefit from that. It doesn't necessarily hurt us in terms of AOCI. So most all of the treasuries that you see in our portfolio are swapped. So I would expect very little in the way of AOCI impact there.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Glenn Schorr of Evercore.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nPerfect lead into this question. On Friday, you talk about AFS securities mostly hedged with interest rate swaps and the duration of less than a half a year. I know the Fed forward curve keeps not being correct, but at some point, it's going to be correct and rates are going to come in. My question is, what do you do about that? How much do you think about extending duration and managing your swaps a little differently as we eventually, you know, I mean, at this time, transition to a different rate backdrop?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYep. So Glenn, I mean, ultimately, we'll use the same philosophy and strategy that we do to this point. We are in, obviously, a very good position where we have substantial deposits in excess of loans. That's what creates this excess in the top left of page eight. And it's what allows us to put everything to work in the top right. The balance that we try to strike, you can sort of see in left-hand side; we're trying to make sure that that cash and securities yield compared to deposit rate paid performs in any environment.\nSo in an environment like this one where there's an awful lot going on with rates, we feel like if you look at that spread, I think it was one basis point different quarter-over-quarter. So we're trying to make sure that we lock in the value, monetize the deposits regardless of whatever rate environment turns out to be. And we feel like we're pretty balanced now. We've got a pretty good balance of short-dated, long-dated, fixed, and floating that should allow us to perform whether rates go up or down from here. One final thing I'll just say, and I think you know this. I hear you. Underneath all of this, obviously, we've got some securities repricing. And to the point, I think it was John asked earlier, we've got the loans repricing as well. And all of that gives a little bit of underlying resilience to this.\n\nGlenn Schorr",
    "content2": "Senior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nYep. I get that. I guess you have a lot of flexibility should you decide to turn. Just one follow-up. We talked deposits to debt. You had a smidgen of year-on-year loan growth, mostly in cards, I think. But I know how we got here, but it's a weird environment to see really strong economy and up markets and yet no loan growth.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYep.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nIs this just any way you slice it, we have to go through another year or two of super low loan growth? Or are there any leading indicators that would lead you to believe we can get back to a little bit more normal BofA loan growth and not have to wait two years for it?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYep. Well, I think we're probably getting closer now because remember, in the big macro, we're in that transition period where post-pandemic the economy is sort of recovering and rates are settling in and it's changing people's behaviors. So we've actually got pretty good credit card growth. And that's just offset by the fact that, for example, with securities-based lending at rates that are 5% higher, people are doing less of it. Or in commercial, we've got some loan growth, but the revolver utilization is still suppressed because revolver costs a lot more. So as the Fed has raised rates, it's changed some of the borrowing patterns of our clients.\nBut that's not going to last forever. Because as you point out, if the economy powers through at 3%, 3.5%, whatever it ends up being, loan growth is going to catch up to that over time. So for right now, we're in that transition period, but we're anticipating that loan growth will pick up at some point in the future, but it's not an enormous part of our NII guide at this point.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nJust remember that the capital markets opened up and a lot of the larger clients accessed them as they, frankly, have gotten used to the higher rate structure and need to refinance. If you look across the businesses, you've got the commercial one, but if you look across the commercial businesses in the middle market and business banking, the segment up to 50 million in revenue companies and up to 2.5 billion, they actually saw progress in loan growth. It was really in the high-end global corporate investment banking business where you saw sort of paydowns and bring that down. That phenomenon is one that occurs from time to time.\nIt's probably stabilized now, and we'll see it play out. But we are fighting for loan growth. And frankly, line usage stabilized and is better than it's been for the last few quarters in terms of trend. And so again, that all speaks to people feeling fine, but they're not quite as aggressive as they would be when you read the economic statistics. And that's one of the great debates that you can read about in the paper every day.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nThank you both for all that.\n\nOperator\n\nTake our next question from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. So obviously, there's been a lot of questions on net interest income and a lot of good color. I guess just when you put it all together, when you think about the higher-for-longer environment, obviously, it's good on the reinvestments. You're trying to match the deposits like you talked about. But how would you just boil it down? Your rate disclosure still shows $3 billion kind of exposure to either side. Is stable rates for a couple of years, is that good? Or does that accelerate the deposit repricing or just boil that down? Thanks.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nSure. Well, I'd say generally speaking, higher-for-longer is probably better for banks as a general statement. The question will become, why are rates higher? What's going on in the economy? Are we talking about inflation? Is it under control? Is it coming down? Right now, that appears to be the case. So that's obviously a good place. And the Fed's in a good place because they appear to have a real rate that's high enough to make sure that inflation stays in a good place. Things can change, Matt. So an awful lot will depend upon just the why for rates.\nBut generally speaking, if it's just because it's taken a little while longer for the inflation to nudge down before the next set of cuts, that's probably a good environment for us. I would expect us to perform relatively better than we've disclosed so far. And then you're asking a second question, which is around what does the sensitivity look like to ±100? We've tried to just make sure that we continue to stay balanced. If anything, that corridor of ±100 has gotten narrower and narrower over time as we're trying to lock in NII that's $4 or 5 billion higher per quarter today than it was three years ago and just make sure that the shareholder benefits from that through the course of time. So let me see how the environment plays out.\nIt's only been a quarter since we were last here talking about six cuts. Now it's three. So we just have to watch this play out and stay patient.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Fair enough. That's helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nHead of Bank Research Team and Senior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks very much. Good morning. A real breakout quarter for the IB fee line. And just wondering a couple of things within that. One, there was a bit of a back and forth from some of the other banks about whether or not DCM was pulled forward a little bit from future. I wonder what you think about that. But more broadly, just you guys have done a good job taking share. What ending do you think you are in terms of not so much just green shoots, but in terms of where that incremental productivity is in terms of getting that IB line to a more permanent higher level? Thanks.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nSo I think about it. If you go back and sort of the period prior to the run-up in the couple of years after the pandemic, you've had sort of mid-billion and a half-ish type of numbers a quarter. We think we're fundamentally stronger in a market position, as you said. So we feel very good about the work Matthew and the team have done. And as we look at it, we believe that they'll continue to gain share. And I think this is a more normalized level. And whether it's pulled forward or not, we'll find out.\nBut it's a more normalized level given those dynamics, and one we should be able to build off, especially, as I said earlier, the penetration in the middle market side of our business, whether those clients working up our wealth management in the markets generally, plus working across the globe. And we've done better work internationally. So we feel good everything the team's done. The combination of the corporate and investment banking is very strong. So we don't think this is an unusually high-water mark, and we should be able to build from here.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nHead of Bank Research Team and Senior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Got it. And then one question about Wealth Management and just client choices in terms of where they're sitting relative to earning NII or earning fees. Where do you sense that the kind of cash versus fully invested is in terms of the Wealth Management brokerage business? Could that turn to the better or turn to the worse depending on how that mixed answer goes? Thanks.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nWell, Wealth Management, I think Lindsay, Katy, and Eric highlight for us regularly just the elevated levels of cash that our clients have. A lot of that is on us, and you can see that in our deposit chart. But there's a lot that we've captured in the investment area too, where a lot of their flows are coming into maybe it's money market funds, maybe the short-dated treasuries. But there's a lot of cash at this point. So that would tell you it's supporting the ability to see continued assets under management flows going forward, depending on how, obviously, the stock market shakes out over time. But we're all struck by just the sheer amount of cash on the sidelines at this point.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nHead of Bank Research Team and Senior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Got it. All right. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOnce again, that is star one if you would like to ask a question. One moment while we queue. Once again, that is star one. We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Bank Equity Strategy, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi, Alastair. Hi, Brian.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nHi, Gerard.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Bank Equity Strategy, RBC Capital Markets\n\nAlastair.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nHow are you?\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Bank Equity Strategy, RBC Capital Markets\n\nAlastair, coming back to that Slide eight, which is obviously quite impressive on deposits, particularly the upper left-hand graph you presented. When you go back to maybe 2014 or 2015 and take a look at the deposit levels of your company from, let's say, 2015 to 2019, you just didn't have the growth that you experienced from the end of 2019 through today. Can you guys share with us what drove this meaningful increase in not only excess deposits, but all deposits?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nI think, Gerard, so you've been around long enough to understand some of those dynamics. So as we moved through the post-financial crisis, we had, in terms of that chart, if you looked at it, you had a lot of loans that we ran off because they weren't core loans anymore and kind of troughed out the $900 billion level and then grew out from there. And in 2015, that's where we started driving responsible growth. It was a call to grow now that we pushed out a lot of stuff in the financial crisis and got it behind us. So the loans then started picking up. But if you remember back then, I think we had almost $300 billion, if I remember right.\nAnd if you looked at the slide on loans and the non-line-of-business loans are $200 billion or something like that, and it's down to $10 billion. So think about that dimension. So as we ran that down and could grow, we could overcome it. And so then on the growth on the loan side, it's driven by discipline where we want to play on the card businesses, getting it positioned right. And now we could start to push from there, whether it's on a home equity business, on the auto loan business. And on the commercial side, we had less issues after the financial crisis in commercial. But kind of getting through all that, it was getting to the credit quality we wanted.\nAnd a source of great growth for us from 2010 and beyond has been we've probably gone from, I don't know, $20 to 30 billion of outstanding loans in the international part of Matthew's business in GCIB to almost $100 billion type of numbers. So our expansion of our international capabilities and done with great credit work by Geoff Greener and a team and Bruce Thompson and team. So put all that together, that's alongside. On the deposit side, it really started with a focus that began really in the middle of the financial crisis and beyond where we said, \"We're going to go for core checking accounts and consumer primary checking accounts, drive customer satisfaction, drive organic growth, and not care about the number of sales as much as the net growth and net sales.\"\nAnd as the team, Dean and Tong, over time, and then Aron and Holly now have continued to push that, adding a million-ish net new checking accounts, all core, we've gone from 60% core to 92%. We've gone from customer satisfaction to the highest levels ever in the mid-80s, top two box, etc., etc. Attrition down to lowest ever, Preferred Rewards kicked in. And all that has led to higher and higher balance retention per account, and then also more accounts. And so we've probably grown in the consumer from, I think, around $300 billion at the beginning of 2010, 2011 to now at $900 billion. Now there's economic growth and the economy grows, but that's way outsized.\nAnd that's what's driven the real value of the deposit franchise. And then Wealth Management, again, after Merrill putting it together and then driving that core aspects between the team there has kept us up to $300 billion. That's from $200 billion and something pre-pandemic and probably less than that. I think it was $200 billion at the time of the merger. So all these things are just part of it. And the GTS business investments that have driven those products.\nSo that spread is high and growing again, which is kind of counterintuitive to the narrative that even one of your colleagues mentioned earlier, which is, \"Leave aside all the quantitative tightening, all the interest rate, and all the stuff that's supposed to happen.\" Quarter-after-quarter, we're now growing the amount of deposits over the top of the loans. And the loans hopefully will kick back in and grow a little faster. But they still won't use a lot of those balances up. And so we feel very good about that position. And those deposits, as you can see on the bottom of page eight, on the left-hand side, all in cost, there's 193 basis points against the Fed funds rate, 5.5. And the rate of change in those deposit prices have flattened out to be very modest quarter-to-quarter.\nThat's just a tremendous leverage for the company.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Bank Equity Strategy, RBC Capital Markets\n\nVery helpful, Brian. Thank you. Maybe as a follow-up, I think, Alastair, you pointed to that your CET1 ratios is Basel III endgame when it was originally proposed. You're very comfortable with it. Can you guys share with us what's the latest? We all read about the watering down of Basel III endgame. Do you guys have a sense when we may actually see a final proposal? Could it get kicked into next year, possibly?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nLook, we don't have an update on the timing yet, Gerard. We're in the same place you are. We're kind of waiting for the rules to come out. We're still listening for updates from the Fed chair and the vice chair. We'll wait till we see those come out.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nBut the key is to remember that we're sitting, even under the current interpretation we told you earlier on without any modifications, we're sitting on enough CET1 nominal amount, 197 billion, that exceeds what we need for the increase in RWA under the current version of the rules that propose. Anything that changes in that would be positive, Gerard. So we don't need to retain capital to meet those standards. We don't. So we're off and running.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Bank Equity Strategy, RBC Capital Markets\n\nAppreciate it, Brian. Thank you. Both of you.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nAll right, Lee, one more question? Okay. Sorry.\n\nOperator\n\nYep. We'll take that question from Jim Mitchell of Seaport Global.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, Jim.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nOh, hey. Hey, good morning. Good morning. Sorry. Maybe just one last follow-up on that last question from Gerard. If Basel III is reduced, as Powell has suggested, is it with limited loan growth just more likely to be put towards buybacks? Or do you see opportunities beyond just loan growth, whether it's growing the trading balance sheet or other opportunities to deploy that capital to drive growth? Just curious how you deploy that.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nWell, number one, our primary interest is to use the capital to support our customer businesses. So you've seen that happen in the markets business. As we said, it was one of the best quarters in a decade, Q1s. That is a multi-year process of building up not only the balance sheet and capital committed to business, but importantly, also the investment systems, technology, and risk management, and other things. They continue to make money almost every trading day over the last several years. So that's where we'd like to use it, supporting that business, supporting the loan business, and supporting all the businesses.\nThe reality is, outside of the capital markets business, then you go to the loan growth. And that, in the kind of loan growth in mid-single digits, that doesn't eat a lot of the capital up. So then it's just there to be returned. And so we got two basic phenomena. One is we storehoused a bunch of capital. If you think about the last few years between the changes in CCAR a few years ago that changed the capital dimension, then the proposed rules, and then now whatever happens with them. So they were sort of sitting in the pandemic before that. We were sitting on a fair amount of capital. That should be released over time here. And then secondly, the question will be what those rules are going forward. And then third would be what he needs to support the business, which, again, that's our primary responsibility.\nBut generally, that is a modest amount of capital. So most of our desire is to really deploy more expenses and technology investments. And we've gone from $3 to 3.8 billion in annual technology investments across the last couple of years, more branches. But that's more of an expense question than a capital question, Jim.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nRight. Right. Okay. Thanks a lot.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nAll right. I think that's all, Lee. Correct? Okay. Why don't we wrap it up here? Thank you for your time and attention. This quarter marks another quarter of strong organic growth across every business that's continued this quarter. Good fees and what we call fees and commissions in the wealth management business, investment banking, and trading. NII continues to outperform what we told you last quarter for the Q1r. We rolled that into Q2, and we expect continued performance in that as we go through the trough and meet the higher second half of the year.\nWe continue to manage expenses well under the inflation rate. We start with strong capital, liquidity, and a strong balance sheet. Our team did a great job this quarter, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude the Bank of America earnings announcement. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day. The Bank of America earnings announcement has concluded. You may now disconnect your lines. The Bank of America earnings announcement has concluded. You may now disconnect. The Bank of America earnings announcement has concluded. You may disconnect."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's call will be recorded [Operator Instructions]\nIt is now my pleasure to turn today's conference over to Lee McEntire, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nE. Lee McEntire\n\nSVP of IR, Bank of America Corporation\n\nGood morning. Thank you. Welcome, and thank you for joining the call to review the third quarter results. As usual, our earnings release documents are available on the Investor Relations section of bankofamerica.com website, and it includes the earnings presentation that we will be referring to during the call. I trust everybody's had a chance to review the documents.\nI'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments, before Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, discusses the details of the quarter. Before we do that, let me just remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to some non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nFactors that may cause our actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed and our earnings materials as well as the SEC filings available on our website. Information about non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP can also be found in our earnings materials that are on the website.\nSo with that, Brian, I'll turn the call over to you.\n\nBrian Thomas Moynihan\n\nChairman & CEO, Bank of America Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As usual, we're starting on Slide 2. Our third quarter here at Bank of America was another strong quarter. We delivered $7.8 billion in net income. That is a 10% growth over the year ago third quarter. And for the first 9 months of the year, we have earned $23.4 billion, an increase of 15% over 2022.\nWe grew clients and accounts organically and at a strong pace across all our businesses. Our operating leverage was about flat. We improved our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio by nearly 30 basis points in the quarter to a level of 11.9% against a current minimum of 9.5%. We saw an increase in our deposits, and we maintained our strong pricing discipline.\nWe continue to maintain $859 billion in global liquidity sources. We also delivered a good return for you, our shareholders, with a return on tangible common equity of over 15% and a 1% return on assets.\nJust a quick note of what we see in the economy. Our team of economists predicts a soft landing, with a trough in the middle of next year. We see that in our customer data, our 37 million checking customers, we see their spending slowing down. You can see that on Slide 34. The third quarter was up about 4% over last year's third quarter.\nEarlier this year, that would have been more of a 10% increase year-over-year. And for the entire year 2022, it increased 10% and round numbers over '21. This 4% level is consistent with the spending we saw in the pre-pandemic period from 2016 to 2019. That is consistent with the low inflation, lower growth economy. As we moved into October, the spending is holding at that 4% level. So growing, but growing at a basis more consistent with low growth economy.\nNow let me turn to Slide 3. We provide various highlights, and Alastair is going to cover a lot of this. Our team continues to focus on driving organic growth, driving digital progress and operational excellence, which keeps us focused on operating leverage. A few words on organic growth as we flip to Slide 4.\nEvery business segment had organic growth. In Consumer, in quarter 3, we opened more than 200,000 net new checking accounts this quarter alone. We also opened another 1 million credit card accounts. We have 10% more investment accounts this year, third quarter, than we did last year. In small business, we have seen 35 straight quarters of net new checking account growth. We've also seen good small business loan growth, and our loans were up 14% from last year.\nThat was -- in this quarter, our small business teammates extended $2.8 billion in credit to small business in America alone. In Global Wealth, we added nearly 7,000 net new relationships to the Merrill and Private Banking franchise. And our advisers opened more than 35,000 new bank accounts for the third consecutive quarter, fulfilling both investing and banking needs for those clients. We also increased our number of advisers. In the past year, across the wealth spectrum in GWIM and in Consumer Investments, they have combined to gather $87 billion in total net flows.\nIn our Global Banking team, we added clients and increased the number of products per relationship. Year-to-date, we've added 1,900 new commercial and business banking clients. That is more than we added in the full year last year. Even while activity is low, the Investment Banking team continues to hold its #3 position. In the Global Markets, we continue to see performance to establish new records for our firm. I'm going to cover that in a little more detail in a moment.\nAs you can move to Slide 5, you can see the digital adoption engagement and volumes continue to increase. We lead the industry in digital banking and continue to provide the best-in-class disclosures. You can find those disclosures by line of business in the appendix on Slides 26, 29 and 31. We also continue to receive top accolades from third parties around these capabilities. Most important, these capabilities are valued by our clients and customers, and allow us to grow with great expense leverage. Let me give you a few examples.\nOur Consumer Merrill clients logged into our Consumer Banking app a record 3.2 billion times this quarter. Even at the scale and stage of maturity of this operation, logins were up double digits from the year prior. Customer use of Erica continue to expectations with almost 19 million users, up 16% in the past 12 months. CashPro app sign-ins with our business clients are up more than 40%. And we recently added the Erica functionality to CashPro to help corporate clients benefit from that artificial intelligence.\nLikewise, the users continues to grow. Zelle transaction levels are up more than 25% from last year, and Zelle is becoming a meaningful way our customers move money. In fact, customers now send money with Zelle at twice the rate they write checks. We're nearing a period where the Zelle transactions sent will exceed the combination of checks written and ATM withdrawal transactions.\nAs you move across the lines of business on this slide, the story is the same. All these capabilities help us deliver faster, safer and more efficiently, and all of it gets strong customer client feedback. When you put that together, that helps us drive operating leverage, and you can see that on Slide 6.\nWe have a strong record of driving operating leverage in our company. We drove operating leverage every quarter for nearly 5 years before the pandemic. And then again, more recently, we've had an 8-quarter streak leading in this quarter. We acknowledge to you this last quarter, the operating leverage is going to be tough for a few quarters as we navigate through the trough of net interest income.\nBut as you can see on Slide 6, we managed to grow our revenue year-over-year faster than expense in dollar terms this quarter, even though the percentage change is basically flat. Now in January, we told you we managed our headcount down to help make sure we got our expenses in line. Over the course of 2023, we've seen, moving from 2022, a great resignation to a current level of a record low attrition in our company. All that meant the team had to work harder to manage that headcount down.\nThey did it. Our headcount is now down over 7,000 FTEs for a peak in January, even with the addition of 2,500 college grads this fall. As a result, you've seen an expense decline from $16.2 billion in quarter 1 and to $16 billion in quarter 2, to $15.8 billion this quarter. And by the way, we've done this without special charges or large layoffs.\nExpense will decline again in the fourth quarter, excluding any FDIC special assessment of course. We expect to report $15.6 billion in expenses in 4Q. Now interestingly, debt is up only around 1% from fourth quarter of last year. This is a stronger expense guidance than we thought we could do earlier in the year and sets us up nicely for next year.\nShifting gears, let's focus on the balance sheet. Slide 7 shows the breakout of deposit trends on a weekly ending basis across the third quarter. We gave you this chart last quarter also. In the upper left hand, you can see the trend of total deposits. We ended quarter 3 at $1.88 trillion, up from quarter 2 and better-than-industry results. What you should also note is the cost of these deposits. Our team has rewarded customers with higher rates for their investment or cash, reinitiate deposit growth and grown share with, all with superior mix and cost.\nYou'll note that we're now paying 155 basis points all-in for deposits, which is up 31 basis points from last quarter. Best that you remember 2 things when you think about the deposits. The rate remains low relative to many because of the transactional nature of our deposit relationships, with $565 billion in noninterest-bearing deposits. And you can see in the upper right alone, in low interest in [indiscernible], there's $504 billion in Consumer. We remember the importance of the spread against the quarter's average Fed funds rate.\nThis positions us very advantaged compared to past cycles because the transactional accounts in the current cycle are a much higher mix of Bank of America's deposits. I would also add that while we maintain discipline and deposit price and we pay competitive rates to customers with excess cash seeing higher yields across all the businesses, if rates fall, those particular products will see the rates come down also.\nDropping into the business trends. In Consumer, if you look at the top right chart, you saw a $22 billion decline. Note the difference in the movement through the quarter between the balance of load and no interest checking accounts and higher-yielding nonchecking accounts. You could also see the low levels of our more rate-sensitive balance in Consumer investments in CD balances broken out. In total, [ $982 billion ] in Consumer deposits. In Consumer alone, this is $250 billion more than we had pre pandemic.\nThe total rate paid on Consumer deposits in the quarter was 34 basis points. It remains very low, driven by the high percentage of transactional high-quality transaction accounts. Most of the quarter's rate increase is concentrated in CDs and Consumer investment deposits were about -- which are about 13% of the deposits.\nTurning to Wealth Management, balances were flat. We saw a slowing in the previous quarterly trend of clients moving money from lower-yielding sweep accounts into higher-yielding preferred deposits and off-balance sheet products ones. Balances were down by $7 billion and replaced by new account generation and deepening. At the bottom right, note the Global Banking deposits grew $2 billion and have hovered around $500 million for the past 6 quarters. These are generally the transaction deposits of our commercial customers use to manage their cash flows. Noninterest-bearing deposits were 37% of deposits at the end of the quarter.\nSticking with the balance sheet but moving to capital, let me give you a few thoughts on the proposed capital rules. As you are well aware, our banking industry in the United States is the most highly capitalized the most profitable banking group in the world. It's a source of strength for our country and its economy. Stress tests over -- are now over a dozen years old, using ever-increasing harsher test scenarios have proven that capital is sufficient.\nBanks have proven to be a part of the solution during the more recent COVID pandemic and the banking disruption in March this year. We add to our capital and reduce our lending capacity to American Business consumers, and those trade-offs are being debated. But as far as the rules are concerned, there are many parts of the rules that our industry doesn't agree with because of double accounts or increased trading and market risk. And we're talking to those proposals of working, and we're hopeful they'll change.\nBut in any event, they may not. If they don't, how will they affect us? If you go to Slide 8, you can show the expected impact as we interpret those proposed rules. This assumes that they're proposed today without any changes. The proposed rules would inflate our risk-weighted assets by about 20%. So if I apply the inflation against this quarter's RWA of $1.6 trillion, that means, if nothing else changes in the rules, we'd end up with about $320 billion more risk-weighted assets.\nThe biggest increase in RWA would be a couple of hundred dollars in operational RWA. The next biggest category would be Divya fourfold increase in the RWA against nonpublicly traded equity exposures. In our case, that really is mostly about the tax-advantaged investments in solar and wind.\nLooking at capital held against the inflated RWA on the right side of the slide, I'd remind you today that our minimum capital requirement is to hold 9.5% in on Common Equity Tier 1. But based on our G-SIB charges, that were going to come in effect on January 1, 2024, we moved to 10%. So I'm going to use that as a requirement. Holding 10% today means $163 billion, that we finished the third quarter with $194 billion. So today, we have more than $30 billion excess capital.\nNow let's assume the proposed changes going through in full. The proposed changes are phased in from '25 -- the middle '25 to '28 under the current proposal. When those are fully phased in, as we used to call Basel fully phased in, if you remember, we would have a need for $195 billion of total capital. Now if you look on the upper right-hand side of the page, you'll see that we're today we're at $194 billion.\nSo we hold the required capital today. And of course, we'd have to build a buffer to that throughout the implementation period. But if you look at the bottom of the page, you see just in the last 9 quarters the kind of capital generation this company has. Once we understand the rules, we'll of course have a chance to optimize our balance sheet and appropriately priced assets to improve the return on tangible common equity.\nNow before I turn it over to Alastair, I just wanted to highlight one business that we talked about over the many years. That's our Global Markets business. Global Markets represent 17% of the company's year-to-date earnings and it's one of the top capital markets platforms in the world. It's one 'of a handful of firms that can do what is due, providing advice and execution in every major market around the world.\nJimmy DeMare and the in the business asked us for additional investment around 4 years ago, and they've grown this business with an intensity that clients are appreciate and reward us with more of their business. This has produced strong revenue growth. We've grown the balance sheet here but have done it efficiently. That's allowed us to grow sales and trading revenue over the past 12 months consistently, and now stands 32% higher than the average of the 5 years leading into the pandemic investment in the business.\nAnd through effective cost management, we also generated 11% to 12% returns on capital. This exceeds our cost of capital even as we continue to allocate more capital to the business. Returns, by and large, if combined with the Global Banking business, that many show the businesses combined and take -- because our corporate clients also take advantage of these industry-leading capabilities.\nWith that, let me turn over the call to Alastair to walk through the quarter. Alastair?\n\nAlastair M. Borthwick\n\nPresident of Global Commercial Banking, Bank of America Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian. And on Slide 10, we present the summary income statement. I'm not going to spend a lot of time here because Brian touched on this and the highlights that we show on Slide 3. For the quarter, we generated $7.8 billion in net income, resulting in $0.90 per diluted share. Both of those are up the double digits from the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year revenue growth of 3% was led by improvement in net interest income, coupled with a strong 8% increase in sales and trading results, and that excludes DVA, and a 4% increase in investment in brokerage revenue driven by our management businesses.\nExpense for the quarter of $15.8 billion included good discipline from our team, which allowed us to reduce costs from the [ second ] quarter, even as we continue our planned investments for marketing technology and physical presence build-outs, including financial center openings and renovations. Asset quality remains stellar, and provision expense for the quarter was $1.2 billion. That consisted of $931 million of net charge-offs and $303 million of reserve build.\nProvision expense reflects the continued trend in charge-offs toward pre-pandemic level and remains below historical levels. Our charge-off rate was 35 basis points, that's 2 basis points higher than the second quarter, and still below the 39 basis points we saw in the fourth quarter of '19. And as a reminder, that 2019 was a multi-decade low. 30-day delinquencies also remained below their fourth quarter '19 level.\nLastly, our tax rate this quarter was 4%, driven mostly by higher-than-expected volume of investment tax credit, or ITC, deals for the rest of the year. And we can expect other income in Q4 reflect seasonally higher renewables investment losses when these projects get placed into service.\nOkay. Let's turn to the balance sheet, that's on Slide 11. And you can see it ended the quarter at $3.2 trillion, up $31 billion from the second quarter. So not a lot to note here. The driver of the increase was a $34 billion increase in available for held securities. With cash levels so high, we chose to reduce the cash and just put some of the money into short-term T-bills this quarter, and those are essentially the same rate as cash. Our cash remains high at $352 billion.\nIn addition to the cash level change, we saw another $11 billion decline in hold to maturity securities as those securities matured and paid down. And as Brian noted, global excess liquidity sources remained strong at $159 billion, that's down very modestly from the second quarter, and still remains approximately $280 billion above our pre-pandemic fourth quarter '19 level.\nShareholders' equity increased $4 billion from the second quarter as earnings were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders. During the quarter, we paid out $1.9 billion in common dividends and we bought back $1 billion in shares to offset our employee awards. AOCI was $1.1 billion lower, reflecting both a modest decline in the value of AFS securities, modestly impacting CET1 as well as a small change in cash flow hedges, which doesn't impact the regulatory capital. Tangible book value per share is up 12% year-over-year.\nTurning to regulatory capital. our CET1 level improved to $194 billion from June 30, and our CET1 ratio improved 30 basis points to 11.9%. It's well above our current 9.5% requirement, as Brian noted. Risk-weighted assets declined mildly as loans and Global Markets RWA both moved lower. Our supplemental leverage ratio was 62% versus a minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves capacity for balance sheet growth and our AC ratio remains well above our requirements. LCR ratios remain well above minimums for BAC metrics and stronger at the bank level.\nLet's now focus on loans by looking at average balances on Slide 12. And loan growth slowed this quarter as a decline in demand for commercial borrowing more than offset our credit card growth. So we saw that lower commercial demand in lower revolver utilization among higher funding costs. And commercial balances were also impacted by term loan repayments to borrowers accessing other capital market solutions.\nFocusing for a moment on average deposits and using Slide 13. Given Brian's earlier comments, I'd just note the comparisons. Relative to pre-pandemic fourth quarter '19, average deposits are up 33%. Consumer is up 36%, with Consumer Checking up 45%. And you can see the other segment comparisons on the page.\nTurning to Slide 14. Let's extend the conversation we can have over the course of the past couple of quarters around management of our excess liquidity. This slide serves as a reminder of the size of our high-quality deposit book, the magnitude of deposits we have in excess of those needed to fund loans and the way we've extracted the value of that excess to deliver value back to our shareholders. The excess of deposits needed to fund loans increased from $420 billion pre-pandemic to a peak of $1.1 trillion in the fall of 2021. And as you can see, it remains high at $835 billion today.\nThat $1.1 trillion of excess liquidity has always included a balanced mix of cash available for sale securities and securities we hold to maturity. In late 2020 and into 2021, we concluded that additional stimulus was going to remain in client accounts for an extended period, and we increased the hold to maturity securities portion so we could lock in value from those deposits. And we made these investments given the core nature of our customers' deposits.\nNote the split of the shorter-term investments in cash and available-for-sale securities, and then the term hold to maturity securities. And I just draw your attention to just how much cash we have above the actual level we need to run the company. On the available for sale, we would just note the duration is less than 6 months as it's mostly all short-term treasuries. And the combination of the cash and available-for-sale securities represents about 47% of the total noted on this page in the third quarter of '23 to give us the balance we're looking for.\nAnd if we look at the hold-to-maturity book, it had grown from $190 billion pre-pandemic, peaking 2 years ago, and now falling to just over $600 billion currently. That $600 billion consists of about $122 billion in treasuries. Those will mature in a little more than 6 years, and about $474 million in mortgage-backed securities and a few billion Other. Hold to maturity securities peaked at $683 billion, and we're now down $80 billion from the peak and $11 billion in last quarter. That $80 billion decline from peak was all driven by the reduction of mortgages from $555 billion to $474 billion.\nWith less loan funding needs over the past several quarters, the proceeds from security paydowns have been deployed into higher-yielding cash, and this mix shift has been happening at about a 300 basis point split benefit for these assets. Given the increased cash rates, the combined cash and security yield has risen now to more than 3%. It's up more than 200 basis points since the peak size of the portfolio in the third quarter of '21, and it's risen faster than the rate paid on deposits. In fact, today, it's 178 basis points above what we pay for deposits.\nAnd remember also, we have $1 trillion of loans that are largely in floating rate, in addition. From a valuation perspective, we did experience a decline in the valuation of the hold-to-maturity book this quarter, and that's in the context of mortgage rates reaching a 2-decade high. Comparing the valuation change to the year ago period, it worsened $15 billion. And over that same time period, we grew regulatory capital by $19 billion and hold global liquidity sources in excess of $850 billion.\n[indiscernible], as we move to Slide 15, I'll make one final comment here, which is the improved NII over this investment period. The net interest income, excluding Global Markets, which we disclose each quarter, troughed in Q3 '20 at $9.1 billion, that compares to $13.9 billion in the third quarter of '23 or $4.7 billion higher every quarter on a quarterly basis, and that gives a sense of the entire [indiscernible] together.\nOkay. Let's now turn our focus to NII performance over the past quarter, and we'll talk about the path forward, and I'm going to use Slide 15 for that. On last quarter's call, we guided to expect Q3 NII to be about $14.2 billion to $14.3 billion on an FTE basis. Our third quarter performance turned out to be better than our guidance. And on an FTE basis, NII was $14.5 billion this quarter. We expect Q4 will be around $14 billion fully taxable equivalent, and that increases our full year guidance for NII in 2023 versus 2022 to 9% growth per year.\nWe believe NII will hover around this expected fourth quarter $14 billion level, plus or minus in the first half of next year, and then we anticipate modest growth in the half of 2024. By the time we get to the fourth quarter of 2024, we believe we can see NII up low single digits compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The good news is we believe NII will likely trough around the fourth quarter level of $14 billion and begin to grow again in the middle of [indiscernible].\nI'd note a few caveats around that forward view I just provided. It includes an assumption that interest rates in the forward curve materialize and it includes rate cuts for the second half of 2024. It also includes an expectation of modest loan and deposit growth has moved into the second half of 2024.\nFocusing again on this quarter, $14.5 billion NII was an increase of nearly $700 million from the third quarter of '22, or 4%, while our net interest yield improved 5 basis points to 2.11%. The year-over-year improvement was driven by higher interest rates and partially offset by lower deposit balances. On a linked-quarter comparison, NII improved $239 million from Q2, that comes from the benefit of an extra day of interest, a rate hike and higher global markets NII, partially offset by increased deposit pricing. And the net interest yield improved 5 basis points.\nTurning to asset sensitivity and focused on a forward yield curve basis, the plus 100 basis point parallel shift at September 30 was $3.1 billion of expected NII benefit over the next 12 months from our banking book. And that expects -- or that assumes no expected change in balance sheet levels or mix relative to our baseline forecast, and 95% of the sensitivity is driven by short rates. The 100 basis point down rate scenario was $3.3 billion.\nOkay. Let's turn to expense, and we'll use Slide 16 for the discussion. We previously highlighted that we guided you to a trend of sequential declines in our expense each quarter this year, and we achieved that in Q3 with our expense down $200 million to $15.8 billion. Additionally, we expect the fourth quarter to go down another couple of hundred million to $15.6 billion, excluding any FDIC special assessment.\nThat would mean our fourth quarter expense of $15.6 billion, compared to the fourth quarter of '22, would be up by only $100 million or less than 1%. And we're proud of that work by the team, especially considering our regular FDIC insurance expense alone increased by $125 million quarterly starting in the first quarter of this year. So without that, we would be flat year-over-year in Q4.\nThe decline this quarter from the second was driven by the reduction in litigation expense and lower headcount, offset somewhat by investments in inflationary costs. Our headcount is down near 2,800 from the second quarter to 213,000. And that includes the addition of 2,500-or-so full-time campus hires we brought into the company. So that's good work by the team after we peaked at 218,000 in January month end. And you see the movement here across the past year at the bottom left of the slide.\nAs we look forward to next quarter, we'd add $1.9 billion of expense for the proposed notice of special assessment from the FDIC as a possibility. Absent that, we'd expect our fourth quarter $15.6 billion expense target to more fully benefit from the third quarter headcount reductions, and that will allow expense to continue the decline experienced throughout the year so far. All of that is going to set us up well for next year.\nLet's now turn to credit, and we'll turn to Slide 17. Net charge-offs of $931 million increased $62 million from the second quarter. The increase is driven by credit card losses as higher late-stage delinquencies flow through to charge-offs. For context, the credit card net charge-off rate rose 12 basis points to 2.72% in Q3, and it remains below the 3.03% pre-pandemic rate in the fourth quarter of '19. Provision expense was $1.2 billion in Q3, and that included $103 million reserve build. It reflects a macroeconomic outlook that on a weighted basis continues to include an unemployment rate that rises to north of 5% during 2024.\nOn Slide 18, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and our Commercial portfolios. And on Consumer, we just note that we continue to see the asset quality metrics come off the bottom. And for the most part, they remain below historical averages. 30 and 90 consumer delinquencies still remain below the fourth quarter of 2019, as an example. Commercial net charge-offs declined from the second quarter, driven mostly by a reduction in office write-downs.\nAnd as a reminder, our CRE credit exposure represents 7% of total loans, and that includes office exposure, which represents less than 2% of our loans. We've been very intentional around client selection and portfolio concentration and deal structure over many years, and that's helped us to mitigate risk in this portfolio. We continue to believe that the portfolio is well positioned and adequately reserved against the current conditions.\nAnd in the appendix, we've included a current view of our commercial real estate and office portfolio stats we provided last quarter. We've also included the historical perspective of our loan book derisking and our net charge-offs, and you can see all of those on Slides 36, 37, 38 and 39.\nOkay. Let's move on to the various lines of business and their results. And I'm going to start on Slide 19 with Consumer Banking. For the quarter, Consumer earned $2.9 billion on good organic revenue growth and delivered its 10th consecutive quarter of operating leverage, while we continue to invest for the future. Note that the top line revenue grew 6%, while expense rose 3%.\nReported earnings declined 7% year-over-year given credit costs continue to return to pre-pandemic level. And we believe this understates the underlying success of the business in driving revenue and managing costs, because PPNR grew 9% year-over-year. Much of this success is driven by the pace of organic growth of checking and card accounts, as well as investment accounts and balances, as Brian noted earlier. And expense reflects the continued investments by the business for their future growth.\nMoving to Wealth Management on Slide 20. We produced good results, and we earned a little more than $1 billion. These results are down from last year, due to a decline in AI from higher deposit costs, which more than offset higher fees from asset management. While lower this quarter, NII of $1.8 billion derives from a world-class banking offering, and it provides good balance in our revenue stream and a competitive advantage in the business for us.\nAs Brian noted, both Merrill and the Private Bank continued to see strong organic growth, and they produced solid assets and management flows of $44 billion since the third quarter of last year, reflecting good mix of new client money as well as our existing clients putting their money to work. Expense reflects continued investments in the business as we add financial advisers and capabilities from technology investments.\nOn Slide 21, you see the Global Banking results. And this business produced very strong results with earnings of $2.6 billion, driven by 11% year-over-year growth in revenue to $6.2 billion. Coupled with good expense management, the business has produced solid operating leverage. Our GTS, or Global Treasury Services, business has been robust. We've also seen a steady volume of solar and wind investment projects this quarter, and our investment banking business is performing well in a sluggish environment.\nYear-over-year revenue growth also benefited from the absence of marks taken on leverage loans in the prior year ago period. The company's overall investment banking fees were $1.2 billion in Q3, growing modestly over the prior year, despite a pool that was down nearly 20%. And we held on to #3 position given our performance. Provision expense reflected a reserve release of $139 million as certain troubled industries and credits outside of commercial real estate continue to have improved outlooks, [ 66% ] year-over-year, reflecting our continued investments in this business.\nSwitching to Global Markets on Slide 22. The team had another strong quarter, with earnings growing to $1.3 billion driven by revenue growth of 10%, and I'm referring to results excluding DVA as we normally do. The continued themes of inflation, geopolitical tensions and central banks changing monetary policies around the globe have continued to impact both bond and equity markets. And as a result, it was a quarter where we saw strong performance in our FICC businesses, as well as a record third quarter in equities.\nFocusing on sales and trading, ex DVA, revenue improved 8% year-over-year to $4.4 billion. FICC improved 6% and equities improved 10% compared to the third quarter of last year. And at $1.7 billion, that's a record third quarter for our equities teammates. Year-over-year expense increased 7%, primarily driven by investments for people and technology.\nFinally, on Slide 13 (sic) [ Slide 23 ], All Other shows a profit of $89 million. So revenue improved from the second quarter, driven by the absence of prior period debt security sale losses and available for sale securities, and partially offset by higher operating losses on tax credit investments in wind, solar and affordable housing. As I mentioned earlier, our effective tax rate in the quarter was 4%, and that reflects a higher-than-expected volume of investment tax credits in which the value of the deals are recognized upfront. We also had a small discrete benefit to tax expense from a state tax law change.\nExcluding renewable investments and any other discrete tax benefits, our tax rate would be 25%. And as we wrap up 2023, we expect our full year tax rate, excluding discrete and special items, such as the FDIC special assessment, we expect that full year tax rate should end up in the 9% to 10% range.\nSo to summarize, we grew our earnings double digit year-over-year. We reported NII that was above our expectations, and we increased our full year expectations. We've managed costs aligned with our guidance and brought expenses down in every quarter so far this year, and we expect to do that again in the fourth quarter. We earned more than 15% return on tangible common equity. We returned $2.9 billion in capital back to shareholders, including a 9% dividend increase. And we built 30 basis points of CET1, positioning us well for the proposed capital rules.\nSo all in all, it was a strong quarter. It was one where our teams executed well against responsible growth. And with that, David, I think we'll open it up for the Q&A session.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the program over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nE. Lee McEntire\n\nSVP of IR, Bank of America Corporation\n\nThank you, Katherine. Good morning. Welcome, and thank you for joining the call to review our second quarter results. I trust everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release documents. They're available on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website and includes the earnings presentation that we'll be referring to during the call. I'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments before Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, discusses the details of the quarter.\nBefore I do that, let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. The forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause the actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and SEC filings that are available on the website. Information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials that are available on the website.\nSo with that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to you, Brian. Thanks.\n\nBrian Thomas Moynihan\n\nChairman & CEO, Bank of America Corporation\n\nThanks, Lee, and good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us. I'm starting on Slide 2 of the earnings presentation. This morning, Bank of America reported 1 of the best quarters and 1 of the best first halves of net income in the company's history. Our results this quarter once again include solid performance on things we can control by delivering organic growth and operating leverage. We did that in an economy that remains healthy, that had a slowing rate of growth. It was also a quarter that included volatility from the debate about the debt ceiling, continuation of Central Bank monetary tightening action and a slowing in consumer spending and slowing inflation. As you look at it now, our customer spending patterns are now more consistent with the pre-pandemic lower growth, lower inflation economy.\nBefore Alastair takes the details, let me summarize Bank of America's quarter 2 performance. On Slide 2, you can see the highlights. We earned $7.4 billion after tax and grew earnings per share 21% over the second quarter of 2022. All business segments performed well. I thank all my teammates for doing so. We grew clients and accounts organically and at a strong pace. We delivered our eighth straight quarter of operating leverage, led by 11% year-over-year revenue growth. We further strengthened our balance sheet, improving our common equity Tier 1 ratio more than 110 basis points year-over-year to 11.6%.\nAnd we have $867 billion in global liquidity sources. We also produced strong returns for our shareholders with a return on tangible common equity of 15.5%, continuing a streak of many quarters at that level or above. While our business has performed well this quarter, I would particularly highlight our Global Markets and sales and trading team and our investment banking teams. Both have appeared to outperform their industry peers. Investments made over the past couple of years in Global Markets capabilities under Jimmy DeMare's leadership as well as Matthew Koder's leadership in the global corporate investment banking area allow us to improve our market shares for both of these fee pools. I'd also note the strong contribution by our middle market clients to that and our teammates there led by Wendy Stewart.\nI'd also like to touch a few additional points before turning the call over to Alastair. These points will help illustrate continued investment in the franchise and work we do to drive growth. Let's start with the organic growth slide on Page 3. And on that page, we highlight some of the important elements of organic growth. You can see evidence in every business segment as you look at the page. In consumer, in quarter 2, we opened 157,000 net new checking accounts. Consumers now had 18 straight quarters of positive net new checking account growth. Now these are core primary checking accounts across the board, allowing our tremendous deposit franchise to continue to prosper and take market share.\nWhile the progress here made [ pier inch meal, ] over the last 3 years, we've grown our core customers and consumer checking account customers from 33 million to 36 million. We opened another 1 million-plus credit card accounts this quarter and have 10% more investment accounts this year than we did last year in the consumer business. Consumer investment business balances reached a new high of $387 billion, aided by a 30% increase in new funded consumer investment accounts year-over-year and frankly, moving our money from our depositors into the market as they've done so.\nIn Global Wealth, we added 12,000 net new relationships in Merrill and the private bank, and our advisers opened more than 36,000 new banking relationships in the quarter, showing a strong differentiation in our model of fulfilling both investment and banking [ tester ] clients. In the past 90 days, we added 190 experienced advisers to our sales force in addition to digital capabilities to help us deliver at scale. In Global Banking, we added clients to increase the number of solutions per relationship. Over the past 3 years, we've added net new relationship managers and increased our client-facing headcount by nearly 10%. We've also improved our tools for prospect colleagues through investments in technology, and it's benefiting our ability to add customers to improve our solutions for existing clients. Year-to-date, we've added over 1,000 new commercial and business banking clients across the United States, which is the same number we added in the full year of last year. Again, operationalizing that ability to do this at scale increases our speed of onboarding these clients.\nIn our Global Markets area, we saw 1 of the highest second quarters for sales and trading in our history. It's another quarter of good organic growth. To achieve that growth while managing our expense trajectory, which Alastair is going to cover, requires an inherent efficiency progress from digital and other applied technology across all our units. Digital superiority is key to our operating dynamics. First, it produces a great customer experience, resulting to strong customer retention and strong customer scores. Second, it ensures our position as a lead transactional bank for our customers, whether they're consumers, companies or investors. Third, it preserves a strong deposit balance as a good pricing due to the core nature of transactional deposits. And last, but importantly, it leads to efficiency.\nSo how are we doing on digital progress? You can see that on Slide 4, first, with the consumer. In consumer, we now have 46 million active users that are digitally engaged with our digital platform and are logging over 1 billion times a month. And even with this scale, the stage and maturity of log-ins is up double digits from last year. Customer use of Erica continues to beat expectations. This was an early application of natural language processing and artificial intelligence that we build in our company that continues to learn about it with additional use. Interactions with Erica rose 35% in just the past year and now has crossed over 1.5 billion client interactions in the first 5 years of introduction. As there's a lot of questions about our artificial intelligence out there, but 1 can [Indiscernible] together a series of systems. We have to build a system in this highly regulated, high customer-focused business, and Erica is 1 such application you can see its impact.\nLikewise, Zelle hasn't slowed down either. The number of people using Zelle grew 19% this past year. Remember, these aren't new functionalities at this point. They've been around for years, but they continue to grow very strong growth rates, showing customer desire and acceptance to the activities. You can see the digital sales continue to grow. We continue to have both great high-tech and high-touch options. As part of that, we've added 310 new financial centers since 2019. And by the end of this year, we have refurbished every 1 of our existing centers in our company. We plan on opening 50 more centers a year for the next few years, which includes an expansion in 9 new markets we announced a few years ago -- a few weeks ago, excuse me.\nOur entrance to these markets is enhanced by digital and leads to strong success. Just to give you a point of reference, for all the expansion markets over the last several years, for branches open a year or more in those expansion markets, our average deposit balances per those branch are $160 million in each branch. If you go to the Wealth Management digital on Slide 5, you can see that they continue to be the most digitally engaged clients in our company. Our advisers have led the way in driving a personal-driven advice model supplemented by our digital tools. You can see the client adoption rate of 83% in Merrill and 92% in the private bank. 78% have embraced digital delivery as a tool of service, providing more convenience for them and our advisers.\nErica and Zelle also continues expanding in these client sets. A new program we announced just a few quarters ago has generated 20,000 digital leads to 7,000 advisers. It's called Advisor Match, matching our clients with advisers of their choice. On Slide 6, you can see [Audio gap] that was driven by continued strong organic growth and operating leverage in a volatile economic environment. Alastair is going to talk to you about a bit more strength we see ahead in our net interest income for the balance of the year, and that provides a better start as we think about 2024. You're going to hear our expectations for the quarterly decline in expenses in the following quarters for the rest of '23, even as we keep investing. And you'll hear about the resilience of credit and strong trajectory of capital. This all positions us well to continue both our streams on organic growth and operating leverage.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Alastair.\n\nAlastair M. Borthwick\n\nPresident of Global Commercial Banking, Bank of America Corporation\n\nThank you, Brian. And on Slide 8, we list the more detailed highlights of the quarter. And then Slide 9 presents a summary income statement. So I'm going to refer to both of those. For the quarter, we generated $7.4 billion in net income, and that resulted in $0.88 per diluted share. Our year-over-year revenue growth of 11% was led by a 14% improvement in net interest income, coupled with a strong 10% increase in sales and trading results ex-DVA. Revenue was strong, and it included a few headwinds, and I thought I'd go through those headwinds first. We had lower service charges from both higher earnings credit rates on deposits for commercial clients. And the policy changes we announced in late 2021 to lower our insufficient fund and overdraft fees for our consumer customers.\nThe good news on the consumer piece is year-over-year comparisons get a bit easier starting next quarter as the third quarter of '22 reflects the full first quarter of these changes. Second, we had lower asset management and brokerage fees as a result of the lower equity and fixed income market levels and market uncertainty that impacted transactional volumes compared to a year-ago quarter. Third, we had a net DVA loss of $102 million this quarter compared to a gain in DVA of $158 million in the second quarter a year ago. We also recorded roughly $200 million in securities losses as we closed out some available-for-sale security positions and their related hedges, and we put the proceeds in cash.\nLastly, and just as a reminder, our tax rate benefits from ESG investments. And those are somewhat offset by operating losses on the ESG investments, which show up in other income. So this quarter, our tax rate is a little bit lower. And the operating losses are a little bit higher from volume of these deals. So you have to be careful in analyzing the lower tax rate without considering the operating losses. And that in turn, often offsets what would have been higher revenue elsewhere.\nOur tax rate for the full year is expected to benefit by 15% as a result of the ESG investment tax credit deals. And absent these credits, our effective tax rate would still be roughly 25%, and we continue to expect a tax rate of 10% to 11% for the rest of 2023. Expense for the quarter of $16 billion included roughly $276 million in litigation expense, which was pushed higher this quarter by the agreements announced last week with the OCC and the CFPB on consumer matters. Asset quality remains solid, and provision expense for the quarter was $1.1 billion, consisting of $869 million in net charge-offs and $256 million in reserve build. The provision expense reflects the continued trend in charge-offs toward pre-pandemic levels, and it's still below historical levels. The charge-off rate was 33 basis points, and that's only 1 basis point higher than the first quarter and still remains well below the 39 basis points that we last saw in Q4 of 2019. And remember, 2019 was a multi-decade low.\nI'd also use Slide 9 just to highlight returns, and you can see we generated 15.5% return on tangible common equity and 94 basis points return on assets.\nLet's turn to the balance sheet, starting with Slide 10, and you can see our balance sheet ended the quarter at $3.1 trillion, declining $72 billion from the first quarter. A $33 billion or 1.7% reduction in deposits closely matched a $41 billion decline in securities balances through paydowns from the hold to maturity and sales of available-for-sale securities. Securities are now down $177 billion from a quarter to '22. Cash levels remained high at $374 billion and loans grew $5 billion. As Brian noted, our liquidity remained strong with $867 billion of liquidity, up modestly from the first quarter of '23, and still remains nearly $300 billion above our pre-pandemic fourth quarter '19 level.\nShareholders' equity increased 3 billion from the first quarter as earnings were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders. AOCI decreased by 2 billion, driven by derivatives valuation, and AFS securities values were little changed. So there's little change in the AOCI component that impacts regulatory capital. Tangible book value is up 10% per share year-over-year.\nDuring the quarter, we also paid out $1.8 billion in common dividends, and we bought back $550 million in shares to offset our employee awards. And last week, we announced the intent to increase our dividend by 9% beginning in the third quarter.\nTurning to regulatory capital. Our CET1 level improved to $190 billion from March 31, and the ratio of CET1 improved more than 20 basis points to 11.6%, once again, adding to the buffer over our 10.4% current requirement, while our risk-weighted assets increased modestly in the quarter. Also noteworthy, on July 3, we initiated dialogue with the Fed to better understand our CCAR exam results, and we remain in discussions today with no news to update as of now. In the past 12 months, we've improved our CET1 ratio by more than 110 basis points, and we've done that while supporting clients for loan demand and returned $11.3 billion in dividends and share repurchases to shareholders. Our supplemental leverage ratio was 6% versus our minimum requirement at 5%, and that leaves us plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. Finally, the TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements.\nSo let's now focus on loans by looking at average balances. You can see those on Slide 11. And there, you can see average loans grew 3% year-over-year. The drivers of loan growth are much the same. Consumer credit card growth is strong, and then commercial loans grew 4%. The credit card growth reflects increased marketing, enhanced offers and higher levels of account openings over time. And on commercial, we saw a little bit of a slowdown in this quarter, driven by higher pay downs from borrowers and weaker customer demand as opposed to any credit availability from us. We are still open for business for loans.\nWhile loan growth has slowed, it's generally remained still ahead of GDP, and commercial client conversations remain solid as our clients seem to be waiting for some of the economic uncertainty to lift before borrowing further. Slide 12 shows the breakout of deposit trends. That's on a weekly ending basis across the last 2 quarters, and it's the same chart that we provided last quarter. In the upper left, you see the trend of total deposits. We ended the second quarter at $1.88 trillion, down 1.7%, with several elements of our deposits seeming to find stability. Given the normal tax seasonality impacts on deposit balances in Q2 and the monetary policy actions, we believe this is a good result.\nI want to use the other 3 charts on the page to illustrate the different trends across the last quarter and more specifically in each line of business. In consumer, looking at the top-right chart, you see the difference in the movement through the quarter between the balances of low to no interest checking accounts and the higher-yielding nonchecking accounts. Here, you can also see the low levels of our more rate-sensitive balances in consumer investments and CD balances, and they're both broken out here. In total, we've got still more than $1 trillion in high-quality consumer deposits, which remains $274 billion above pre-pandemic levels.\nIn the second quarter, that decline in consumer deposits was driven by higher debt payments, higher spend and seasonal tax activity and some nonchecking balances that rotated from deposits into brokerage accounts. We did see some competitive pressure this quarter within about roughly $40 billion of CDs as some of the financial institutions pushed prices higher. And at this point, with deposits far exceeding our loans, we've not yet felt the need to chase deposits with rate. Broadly speaking, average deposit balances of our consumers remain at multiples of their pre-pandemic level, especially in the lower end of our customer base. Total rate paid on consumer deposits in the quarter rose to 22 basis points and remains low relative to Fed funds, driven by the high mix of quality transactional accounts. Most of this quarter's 10 basis point rate increase remains concentrated in those CDs and consumer investment deposits. And together, those represent only 11% of our consumer deposits.\nTurning to Wealth Management. This business is also impacted by tax payments and normally shows the most relative rate movement because these clients tend to have the most excess cash. The previous quarter's trend of clients moving money from lower-yielding sweep accounts into higher-yielding preferred deposits and moving off balance sheet on to other parts of the platform seemed to stabilize this quarter. And our sweep balances were more modestly down at $72 billion. At the bottom right, note the Global Banking deposit stability. We ended the second quarter at $493 billion, down $3 billion from the first quarter. We've now been in this $490 billion to $500 billion range for the past several quarters. And these are generally the transactional deposits of our commercial customers that they use to manage their cash flows. And while the overall balances have been stable, we've continued to see a shift towards interest-bearing as the Fed raised rates 1 more time during the quarter before pausing in June.\nNoninterest-bearing deposits were 40% of their deposits at the end of the quarter. Focusing for a moment on average deposits using Slide 13, I really only have 1 additional point to make. While you've seen the modest downtick in deposits for the past several quarters as the Fed has removed some accommodation, we just want to note that deposits remain 33% above fourth quarter 2019 pre-pandemic period. And as you look at the page, every segment relative to pre-pandemic is up at least 15%. Consumers up 40%, consumer checking is up more than 50%, and as noted, Global Banking has been right around $500 billion for the past 5 quarters, and it remains 31% above pre-pandemic.\nSo let's move to Slide 14. And we'll continue the conversation that we began last quarter around management of excess deposits above loans. In the top left, note the balances in the second quarter of each year since the pandemic began. The excess of deposits needed to fund loans increased from $500 billion pre-pandemic to a peak of $1.1 trillion in the fall of 2021. And as you can see, it remains high at the end of June at $826 billion. In the top right, note that the amount of cash and securities held has increased gross time, in line with the excess deposit trend. And you'll also note the mix shift over time. This excess of deposits over loans has been held in a balanced manner across the period shown, with roughly 50% fixed, longer-dated held-to-maturity securities, and the rest has been held in shorter-dated available-for-sale securities and cash. Cash and the shorter day-to-day FS securities combined was $516 billion at the end of the quarter. And cash, at $375 billion, is more than twice what we held pre-pandemic, and you should expect to see that come down over time. We made these investments given the mix and transactional nature of our customers' deposits, particularly given the excess deposits built.\nNote also in the bottom left chart, the combined cash and securities yields continued to expand this quarter and remain meaningfully lighter than the overall deposit rate paid. That's a result of 2 things. Securities book has seen a steady decline since the fall of 2021 when we stopped adding to it. With less loan funding needs, proceeds from security pay downs have been deployed into higher-yielding cash. And through this action and the increased cash rates, the combined cash and security yield has risen further and faster than deposit rates. Deposits at the end of the quarter were paying 124 basis points, while our blend of cash and securities has increased to 319 basis points. So over the past year, the deposit cost has risen by 118 basis points, and the cash and securities yield has improved by 164 basis points. And as a reminder, this slide focuses on banking book because our Global Markets balance sheet has remained largely market-funded.\nFinally, 1 last 1 last very important point that I want to make is on the improved NII of our banking book. The NII, excluding Global Markets, which we disclose each quarter, troughed in the third quarter of 2020 at $9.1 billion, and that compares to $14 billion in the second quarter of 2023. So almost $5 billion higher on a quarter basis, $20 billion per year. That's led to a stronger capital position, even as we returned capital to shareholders and supplied capital to our customers in the form of loans and other financing capital. And then more specifically on the hold-to-maturity book, the balance of that portfolio declined again $10 billion from the first quarter. It's down $69 billion since we stopped adding to the book in the third quarter of '21. The market valuation on our hold-to-maturity book, which is in a negative position, worsened $7 billion since March 31, 2023, driven by a 54 basis point increase in mortgage rates.\nThe OCI impact from the valuation of our hedged AFS book modestly improved this quarter. Let's turn to Slide 15, and we can focus on net interest income. On a GAAP or non-FTE basis, NII in the second quarter was $14.2 billion. And the fully tax equivalent NII number was $14.3 billion. So I'm going to focus on that fully tax equivalent. Here, NII increased $1.7 billion from the second quarter of '22, or 14%, while our net interest yield improved 20 basis points to 2.06%. This improvement has been driven by rates, which includes securities premium amortization, partially offset by global markets activity and $137 billion of lower average deposit balances. Average loan growth during the period of $32 billion also aided the year-over-year NII improvement.\nTurning to a linked quarter discussion. NII of $14.3 billion is down $289 million or 2% from the first quarter, and that's driven primarily by the continued impact of lower deposit balances and mix shift into interest-bearing, partially offset by 1 additional day of interest in the period. Global Markets NII increased during the quarter. The net interest yield fell 14 basis points in the quarter, driven by a larger average balance sheet due to the cash position we chose and some higher funding costs. This quarter's compression, we believe, was just a little anomalous, driven by our decision late first quarter to position the balance sheet around higher cash levels.\nTurning to asset sensitivity and focusing on a forward yield curve basis, a plus 100 basis point parallel shift at June 30 was unchanged from March 31, '23 at $3.3 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months from our banking book, and that assumes no expected change in balance sheet levels or mix relative to our baseline forecast. And 95% of the sensitivity remains driven by short rates. The 100 basis point down rate scenario was unchanged at negative $3.6 billion.\nLet me give you a few thoughts on NII as we look forward. We still believe NII for the full year will be a little above $57 billion, which would be up more than 8% from full year 2022. And this could include third quarter at approximately the same level as second quarter. So I think 14.2, 14.3. And then fourth quarter, somewhere around $14 billion. That's a slightly better viewpoint than we had last quarter for the third and fourth quarter, with a little more stability closer to the second quarter level and therefore, provides a better start point for 2024.\nSo let's talk through the caveats around our NII comments. First, it assumes that interest rates in the forward curve materialize and an expectation of modest loan growth driven by credit card. On deposits, we're expecting modestly lower balances, led by consumer, and we expect continued modest deposit mix shifts from Global Banking deposits into interest-bearing. The past few months have provided us a little more positive outlook around NII, given the apparent stabilization of some elements of deposits as well as better pricing. And now we'll see how the rest of the year plays out.\nOkay. Let's turn to expense, and we'll use Slide 16 for that discussion. Second quarter expenses were $16 billion. That was down $200 million from the first quarter. And as I mentioned, the second quarter included $276 million of litigation expense. In addition, we also saw a little higher revenue-related expense driven by our sales and trading results. Those higher costs were more than offset by the absence of the first quarter seasonal elevation of payroll taxes and savings from a reduction in overall full-time head count. Now, excluding the 2,500 or so summer interns that we welcomed into our offices over the summer months, our full-time head count was down roughly 4,000 from the first quarter start point to 213,000. That's some good work after peaking at 218,000 in January. Our summer interns will leave us in the third quarter, and hopefully, many will return as full-time associates next summer. And at the same time in Q3, we welcomed back about 2,600 new full-time hires as college grads, many of whom interned with us last summer. And that's a very diverse class of associates who are excited to join the company.\nAs we look forward to next quarter, we would expect the third quarter expense to more fully benefit from the second quarter headcount reduction, even as we remain in a mode of modest hiring for client-facing positions. Additionally, the proposed notice of special assessment from the FDIC to recover losses from the failures of Silicon Valley and Signature Banks could add $1.9 billion expense for us, $1.5 billion after tax. And we just remain unsure at this point of timing to record that expense.\nLet's now move to credit, and we'll turn to Slide 17. Net charge-offs of $869 million increased $62 million from the first quarter, and the increase was driven by credit card losses as higher late-stage delinquencies flowed through to charge-offs. For context, the credit card net charge-off rate was 2.6% in Q2 and remains well below the 3.03% pre-pandemic rate in the fourth quarter of '19. Provision expense was $1.1 billion in Q2, and that included a $256 million further reserve build. That's driven by loan growth, particularly in credit card, and it reflects a macroeconomic outlook that on a weighted basis continues to include an unemployment rate that rises to north of 5% in 2024.\nOn Slide 18, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. On consumer, we note we continue to see asset quality metrics come off the bottom and they remain below historical averages. Overall, commercial net charge-offs were flat from the first quarter. And within commercial, we saw a decrease in C&I losses that was offset by an increase in charge-offs related to commercial real estate office exposures.\nAs a reminder, commercial real estate office credit exposure represents less than 2% of our total loans. And this is an area where we've been quite intentional around our client selection, portfolio concentration and deal structure over many years. And as a result, we've seen NPLs and realized losses that are quite low for this portfolio. In the second quarter, we experienced $17 million in charge-offs on office exposure to write down a handful of properties where the LTV has deteriorated. Our charge-offs on office exposures were $15 million in the first quarter. We pulled forward some of the office portfolio stats provided last quarter in a slide in our appendix for you. And we continue to believe that the portfolio is well positioned and adequately reserved against the current conditions.\nMoving to the various lines of business and their results, starting on Slide 19 with Consumer Banking. For the quarter, Consumer earned $2.9 billion on good organic revenue growth and delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of strong operating leverage, while we continue to invest in our future. Note that top line revenue grew 15%, while expense rose 10%. These segment results include the bulk of the impact of the cost of the regulatory agreements from last week. Our reported earnings were strong in both periods at $2.9 billion. It understates the success of the business because the prior year included reserve releases, while we built reserves this quarter for card growth.\nPPNR grew 21% year-over-year, even with the added cost of the agreements. And the revenue growth overcame a decline in service charges that I noted earlier. Much of this success is driven by the pace of organic growth of checking and cardigans, as well as investment accounts and balances, as Brian noted earlier. In addition to the litigation noted, expense reflects the continued business investments for growth. And as you think about this business, remember, much of the company's minimum wage hikes and the midyear increased salary and wage moves in 2022 impact consumer banking the most. And that therefore, impacts the year-over-year comparisons.\nMoving to Wealth Management on Slide 20. We produced good results, earning a little less than $1 billion. These results were down from last year as asset management and brokerage fees felt the negative impact of lower equity, lower fixed income markets and some market uncertainty impacting transactional volume. Those fees were complemented by the revenue from a sizable banking business, and that remains an advantage for us. As Brian noted earlier, both Merrill and the Private Bank continued to see strong organic growth and produced solid client flows of $83 billion since the third -- since the second quarter of '22. Our assets under management flows of $14 billion reflect a good mix of new client money as well as existing clients putting money to work. Expenses reflect lower revenue-related incentives and also reflect continued investments in the business as we add financial advisers.\nOn Slide 21, you see the Global Banking results. And this business produced very strong results with earnings of $2.7 billion, driven by 29% growth in revenue to $6.5 billion. Coupled with good expense management, this business produced strong operating leverage. Our Global Transaction Services business has been robust. We've also seen a higher volume of solar and wind investment projects this quarter, and our investment banking business is performing well in a sluggish environment. Year-over-year revenue growth also benefited from the absence of marks taken on leverage loans in the prior year period. [ We ] saw modest loan growth on average year-over-year, and link quarter, the utilization rates declined. And more generally, we saw lower levels of demand. As we noted earlier, the deposit flows have stabilized in the $490 billion to $500 billion range over the past several quarters, reflecting the benefits of our strong client relationships. The company's overall investment banking fees were $1.2 billion in the second quarter, growing 7% over the prior year and 4% linked quarter, a good performance in a sluggish environment that saw fee pools down 20% year-over-year.\nProvision expense declined year-over-year as we built more reserve in the prior year. Expense was held relatively flat year-over-year, even as we drove strategic investments in the business, including relationship management hiring and technology costs. And additionally, comparisons benefit from the absence of elevated expense for some regulatory matters in the second quarter of '22.\nSwitching to Global Markets on Slide 22. The team had another strong quarter, with earnings growing to $1.2 billion, driven by revenue growth of 14%. And I'm referring to results excluding DVA, as we normally do. The continued themes of inflation, geopolitical tensions and central banks changing monetary policies around the globe, along with this quarter's debt ceiling concerns, continue to impact both the bond and equity markets. As a result, it was a quarter where we saw strong performance in both our macro and micro trading businesses. The investments made in the business over the past 2 years continue to produce favorable results. Year-over-year revenue growth benefited from strong sales and trading results and the absence of marks on leveraged finance positions last year.\nFocusing on sales and trading, ex-DVA revenue improved 10% year-over-year to $4.4 billion. FIC improved 18%, while equities was down 2% compared to the second quarter of '22. Year-over-year, expense increased 8%, primarily driven by investments in the business and revenue-related costs, partially offset by the absence of regulatory matters in the second quarter of '22.\nFinally, on Slide 23, all other shows a loss of $182 million. Revenue included $197 million of losses on security sales and increased volume of solar and wind investment operating losses that create the tax credits for the company. As a result of the increased solar and wind tax deal volume and their associated related operating losses, our effective tax rate in the quarter was lower at 8%. But excluding ESG and any other discrete tax benefits, our tax rate would have been 26%. So with that, let's stop there, and we'll open it up for Q&A.",

We know it's a busy day for.\nAll of you as usual.\nOur earnings release documents are available on the investor relations section of the bankofamerica.com website and they include the earnings presentation that we will be referring to during this call. I trust everybody's had a chance to review the documents. I'll first turn the call over to our CEO Brian Moynihan for some opening comments before Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, discusses the details of the quarter. Let me just remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause our actual results to materially differ from those expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and the SEC filings that are available on our website.\nInformation about our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to US GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials and our website. So with that I'll turn the call over to you. Brian, thank you very much.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nThank you and happy New Year to everyone. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. I'm starting on slide two of the earnings presentation here at Bank of America. Our teammates finished 2023 with a solid fourth quarter. Reported EPS was $0.35. But that included two notable items that Alastair will describe in more detail. Adjusted for those two items, net income was $5.9 billion after tax, or $0.70 per share. Before Alastair covers Q4 results, I want to take a moment and briefly review the 2023 full year results. Our team at Bank of America delivered strong profits for shareholders across a challenging year, navigating a slowing economy, geopolitical tensions, bank failures, and the impact of a rate hike of historic speed. We began the year with a pessimistic aura as economists predicted a mild recession within the year.\nInstead, 2023 showcased economic resilience led by US consumers despite higher interest rates. We ended 2023 with economists projecting the Fed has successfully steered the US economy to a soft landing. In regards to the economy during 2023, we consistently made a few points regarding what we were seeing in our customer data here at Bank of America. First, the year-over-year growth rate and spending from the beginning of 2023 started declining, and it went from in the early part of 2023 over the early part of 2022 from a 9 to 10% growth rate to this quarter's 4 to 5% growth rate. And that's where it stands here early in 2024. You can see that on slide 29 in the appendix. That growth rate 4 to 5% is more consistent with the 2% GDP environment and a lower inflation environment.\nSecond, the point we've made is that our consumer deposit balances at Bank of America remain 30% higher than pre-pandemic. We saw the deposit balance of consumer accounts move lower this quarter, but are now seeing more differentiation and behavior in the lower average balance size accounts. The balances in there still remain at multiples of pre-pandemic levels. Nearly three years past the last stimulus, they are modestly declining. The deposit outflows you've seen in consumer have largely been driven by the higher balance accounts who move their excess balances into the markets to seek higher yields. We capture those with our leading wealth platform. Third, the consumers of Bank of America have had access to credit and are borrowing responsibly. Their balance sheets are generally in good shape and while impacted by higher rates, remember many of them have fixed rate mortgages and remain employed.\nThey've shown great resilience.\nLet's move to discussion of full year 2023 earnings. We reported net income of $26.5 billion after tax, which includes $2.8 billion after tax for notable Q4 items adjusted. For those items, the adjusted net income was $29.3 billion after tax, earnings per share were $3.42, and that grew 7% over 2022. On that adjusted basis, we generated a 90 basis points return on assets and a 15% return on tangible common equity. The year 2023 was characterized by record organic customer activity, record digital customer engagement levels, and satisfaction scores. Strong but slowing NII during the course of the year, strong sales and trading up 7% year-over-year. Operating leverage reflected good expense discipline, solid asset quality, and a strong capital and liquidity position. All of this was helped by the years of Bank of America's assiduous dedication to responsible growth.\nThis helped us bring our headcount and expense down every quarter during 2023, in line with what we told you to expect early this year. Early last year, adjusted full year revenue grew 5% on the back of 9% NII improvement and strong asset management fees, sales, and trading results. We achieved 170 basis points of operating leverage in 2023 as heightened quarterly expense levels were driven lower throughout the year even as the investments in growth continued. Net charge-offs moved higher through the year from the historic lows, but they still compare very favorably against historic averages. One last point worth noting is the level of deposits. If you think back as we ended 2022 and entered 2023, the great debate was how much the pandemic surge in deposits would dissipate.\nBut looking today, we ended 2023 with $1.924 trillion of deposits, only $7 billion less than we had at year-end 2022 and 4% higher than the trough in May of this year.\nThe total average deposits Q4 remained 35% higher than they did in Q4 2019. This has been tremendous work by our teams to drive our industry-leading market share, actually outperforming the industry across the four-year period and again this year. While the economy appears to continue to normalize and rates continue to have some volatility, one thing that remains important is driving that organic growth. This client activity sticks to the ribs is what we want to spend a moment as I wrap up on slide three. We highlight some of the successes in organic activity in our results for the year. Bank of America team is a powerful engine that's fueling results across all our businesses. I want to note a couple of examples to try and connect the importance to our financials. It's easy to use the consumer business as example.\nConsumer, we added 600,000 net new checking accounts during the year 2023. The fourth quarter of 2023 represents the 20th straight quarter of net addition of checking accounts. The quality is what drives the checking account balances. On average, 67% of the deposit balances have been with us. For customers have been with us for more than 10 years. 92% of the consumer checking accounts are primary, meaning the core client household account. 60% of our checking accounts use their debit card. They average 400 transactions per account each year, showing how engaged they are. They have traditionally opened savings accounts 20% to 25% of the time within a few months of opening their checking accounts. Thinking about those new accounts at opening, those new checking accounts opened last year bring in about $4,000 of balances. Then they deepen over the next subsequent months to two times that amount.\nNew savings accounts come with those accounts starting with about 8,000, then doubling over time from the total new checking accounts we opened just in 2023. Those customers have opened nearly half a million credit card accounts with us so far in 2023. Historically, we've seen on average these customers more than double those card balances within a year. Those card accounts on average have spent about 7,000 per year, of which a portion will carry a balance. Now there's always additional opportunity to further serve our clients and to continue to meet them where they are. In addition to the industry-leading digital platforms that we have, we have opened 50 new financial centers in 2023. More than half of those were in our expansion markets. We've expanded our presence during 2023 in 10 markets including our latest opening in Omaha.\nIn our global wealth management team, we added more than 40,000 net new relationships across Merrill and the private bank. Our advisors opened 150,000 new banking accounts for wealth management clients, showing the completeness of the relationship approach. The average Merrill account is over a million dollars at opening. The average private bank account is multiples of that as you can see on the slide. We now manage $5.4 trillion of client balances across loans, deposits, and investments of our consumer clients, both consumer and GWA. We saw $84 billion of flows into those accounts last year as we switched to global banking. On the lower left-hand side of the slide, we added clients increase the number of products per relationship. Just like in consumer, we have seen good growth in customers seeking the benefits of our physical and digital capabilities.\nBut most importantly, our talented relationship managers who provide financing solutions, treasury services, and strategic advice for clients with local and global needs. We added roughly 2,500 new commercial and business banking clients this year. That is more than twice what we added in 2022. We look forward to continue to drive with those, grow with those clients in 2024 and add even more. This capitalizes on a multi-year build of our relationship management team in the global banking businesses, especially in product expansion, also especially in the global transaction services area and mid-market investment banking. As we think about Global Markets, we continue to see strong performance from our team with 7% year-over-year revenue growth, the strongest we've had in many years. We see digital tools our customers have access to across the board, helping us enable this activity at lower cost.\nOur NOMA Digital Banking slides are once again included for your reference on pages 21, 24, and 26. In summary, this was a good quarter. We delivered our third quarter of expense declines. We saw NI outperform what we expected when we talked to you on the last earnings call. We continue to manage well through the transition and the rate structure. We saw deposits grow this quarter, and we look forward with a strong capital base, strong liquidity, and growing loans and deposits to a great 2024. I want to thank my teammates for what they did for us in 2023, and we all know we're off to a nice start for 2024. With that, I'll turn it over to. Alastair.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nThank you, Brian. I'm going to start on slide 4 of the earnings presentation to provide just a little more context on the summary income statement and the highlights for the fourth quarter. As Brian noted, we reported $3.1 billion in net income or $0.35 per diluted share. That GAAP net income number included two notable items. First, we recorded $2.1 billion of pre-tax expense. That's $0.20 after-tax earnings per share for the special assessment by the FDIC to recover losses from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Second, on 15 November 2023, Bloomberg announced that they would discontinue publishing the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index rate after 15 November 2024, and many commercial loans in the industry had BSBY as a reference rate prior to SOFR becoming industry standard.\nAs noted in an 8-K we filed earlier this week, we came to a conclusion in early January that BSBY cessation would not get the same accounting treatment allowed under LIBOR cessation, and therefore cash flow hedges of BSBY indexed products related to BSBY cash flows forecast to occur after 15 November 2024 would need to be moved out of OCI and into earnings in the Q4 2023 financials. As a result of the accounting interpretation, we recorded a negative pre-tax impact to our market-making revenue of approximately $1.6 billion. I just want to reinforce that's an accounting impact; it's not an economic change to the contracts, and we'll see an offset to this over time through higher NII, mostly occurring in 2025 and 2026 after BSBY ceases in November 2024.\nThe accounting lowered CET1 by 8 basis points during the quarter and we will recapture that in the next two or three years. Adjusted for the FDIC assessment and the Baselization related impact, Q4 net income was $5.9 billion or $0.70 per share.\nOn slide 5, we show the highlights of the quarter, and we reported revenue of $22.1 billion on an FTE basis. Excluding the BSBY cessation impact, adjusted revenue was $23.7 billion and declined 4% driven by net interest income. Fourth quarter revenue is a tough year-over-year comparison as NII peaked in Q4 2022 at $14.8 billion before slowly moving lower over 2023. Outside of NII, we saw good growth in treasury service fees and wealth management fees, and those were offset by higher tax-advantaged investment deal activity creating higher operating losses, and the more tax credits associated with them and recognized across periods.\nExpense for the quarter of $17.7 billion included the $2.1 billion FDIC charge, so excluding that charge, adjusted expense was $15.6 billion and consistent with our prior guidance that allowed us to invest for growth, as well as use good expense discipline to eliminate work and reduce headcount, and on an adjusted basis. This then is the third quarter of sequential expense decline this year. Provision expense for the quarter was $1.1 billion. That consisted of $1.0 billion in net charge-offs and a modest reserve release reflecting the improved macroeconomic outlook. Net charge-offs reflect the continued trend in consumer and commercial charge-offs towards more normalized levels, as well as higher commercial real estate office losses.\nLastly, our income tax expense this quarter was a modest benefit as credits from tax-advantaged investment deals offset the tax expense on the lower earnings in Q4 driven by the notable charges.\nLet's review the balance sheet on slide 6, and you'll see we ended the quarter at $3.2 trillion of total assets, up $27 billion from the third quarter.\nI'd highlight here both the $39 billion growth in deposits and a decline in cash on balance sheet of $19 billion. Overall, you'll note that debt securities increased $92 billion, and that included a $9 billion decline in hold-to-maturity securities and $100 billion increase in available-for-sale securities, reflecting short-term investment of liquidity from all of these activities. We continue to put money into very short-term T bills and hedged treasury notes this quarter, and those are essentially earning the same rate as cash, and you can see our absolute cash levels remain quite high. As Brian noted, liquidity remains strong with $897 billion of global excess liquidity sources. That was up $38 billion from Q3 2023, and it remained $321 billion above our pre-pandemic level in Q4 2019.\nShareholders equity increased $5 billion from the third quarter as earnings and AOCI improvement were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders. The AOCI'd $4 billion reflecting both the previously mentioned BSBY-related reclassification into fourth quarter earnings and other AOCI improvements. This included some improvements in other cash flow hedges which don't impact regulatory capital driven by a decline in long-end rates. During the quarter we paid out $1.9 billion in common dividends, and we bought back $800 million in shares which more than offset our employee awards. Tangible book value per share is up 3% linked-quarter and 12% year-over-year. Turning to the regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $195 billion from 30 September while the CET1 ratio declined 9 basis points to 11.8% and remains well above our current 10% requirement as of 1 January 2024.\nWe also remain well positioned against the proposed capital rules as our current CET1 level matches our 10% minimum against anticipated RWA inflation from the proposed rules. Risk-weighted assets increased $19 billion on loan growth, and growth in global markets RWA, and our supplemental leverage ratio was 6.1% versus the minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth, and our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above requirements.\nSo let's focus on loans by looking at the average balances on Slide 7, and you can see loan growth improved this quarter as we saw improvement in both credit card and commercial borrowing, offset by declines in commercial real estate and securities-based lending. The commercial growth reflects good demand overall and was muted only at quarter-end by companies paying down commercial balances as they finalized their year-end financial positions. Lastly, on a positive note, we've seen loan spreads continue to widen given some of the capital pressures from proposed rules on the banking industry, and this combined with investment in relationship managers we've added over the past few years has positioned us to take market share and improve spreads.\nMoving to deposits, I'll stay focused on averages on slide 8, and the trends of ending balances saw growth in global banking and wealth management, and declines in consumer. Relative to the pre-pandemic Q4 2019 period, average deposits are still up 35%. Every line of business remains well above their pre-pandemic levels. Consumers up 33% with checking up 40% driven by the net new checking accounts added that Brian noted earlier. On a more recent performance basis, deposits grew $29 billion or 6% from Q3 on an annualized basis. The only business that saw a decline in deposits linked quarter was consumer, and here we saw a decline of $21 billion. This linked quarter decline slowed from the Q3 change, and in total we have $959 billion in high-quality consumer deposits, which remains $239 billion above pre-pandemic levels.\nThe total rate paid on consumer deposits in the quarter was 47 basis points, and this remains very low, driven by the high mix of quality transactional accounts. Most of this quarter's rate increase remained concentrated in CDs and consumer investment deposits, which together only represent 15% of the consumer deposits. Turning to wealth management, balances on an end-of-period basis improved modestly, and we continue to experience a slowing of the trend of clients moving money from lower-yielding sweep accounts into higher-yielding preferred deposits and off-balance-sheet. Our sweep balances were down $4 billion and were replaced by new account generation and deepening global banking. Deposits grew $23 billion, moving nicely above the $500 billion level that we've experienced over the course of the past six quarters. These deposits are generally transactional deposits of our commercial customers.\nThey're the ones they use to manage their cash flows, and non-interest-bearing deposits were about 33% of deposits at the end of the quarter.\nNow when we turn to excess deposit levels on slide 9, you can see deposit growth exceeded loan growth this quarter, and that expanded our excess of deposits above loans from Q3 to about $0.9 trillion, which is well above the $0.5 trillion we had pre-pandemic. You can see that in the upper left of slide 9, which is where we've used and shown you how we think about managing excess liquidity. We continue to have a balanced mix of cash, available-for-sale securities, and held-to-maturity securities. And this quarter the combination of the cash and the AFS securities now represent 51% of the total $1.2 trillion noted on this page. You'll also notice the change in mix of the shorter-term portfolio as we began to lower cash and increase available-for-sale securities, buying mostly short-dated T-bills with similar yields.\nYou can note also the hold-to-maturity book continued to decline from paydowns and maturities pulling to par. In total, the hold-to-maturity book moved below $600 billion this quarter. It's now down $89 billion from its peak, and it consists of about $122 billion in Treasuries and about $465 billion in mortgage-backed securities along with a few billion others. Also note that the blended cash and securities yield continued to rise and remained about 170 basis points above the rate we pay for deposits.\nThe replacement of these lower earning assets into higher-yielding assets continues to provide an ongoing benefit and support to NII from a valuation perspective. Given the reduced balance and the longer-term interest rate reductions we've seen in the Q4, we experienced an improvement of more than $30 billion in the valuation of the hold-to-maturity securities.\nSo let's turn our focus to NII performance using slide 10. A strong finish to the year helped us report $57.5 billion in NII on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the full year of 2023. That's up 9% compared to 2022. On an FTE basis, we reported $14.1 billion in NII, which was modestly better than we told you to expect last quarter, driven by modestly better deposit growth. The $14.1 billion was a decline of $400 million from the third quarter, driven by the unfavorable impacts of deposits and related pricing, and lower global markets NII, partially offset by higher rates benefiting asset yields.\nAs we look forward, given that we've got one last day of interest in Q1 and that's worth about $125 to 150 million and given the rate curve shift, we believe Q1 will be somewhere between $100 and 200 lower than Q4. It could move a touch lower in Q2, and then we believe it should begin to grow sequentially in H2 2024. Very consistent with our prior guidance with regard to the forward view I just provided. Let me note a few other caveats. It would include an assumption that interest rates in the forward curve materialize, and the forward curve today has six cuts compared to last quarter when we had three cuts in the 2024 curve. It's bouncing around a little and shifted in the past quarter.\nThe forward view also includes our expectation of low to mid single-digit loan growth and some moderate growth in deposits as we move into the back half of 2024, given our recent deposit and loan performance. We continue to feel good about these assumptions.\nBefore moving away, it's worth noting our net interest yield declined 14 basis points to 197 basis points, and that's driven by the decline in NII as well as higher average earning assets reflecting prior period builds cash and cash-like securities.\nTurning to asset sensitivity and focusing on a forward yield curve basis, the plus 100 basis points parallel shift at 31 December was $3.5 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months coming from our banking book, and that assumes no expected change in balance sheet levels or mix relative to our baseline forecast. 93% of that sensitivity is driven by short rates. The 100 basis points down scenario is $3.1 billion.\nLet's turn to expense, and we'll use slide 11 for the discussion. We reported $15.6 billion in adjusted expense this quarter, which excludes the FDIC assessment. This was in line with our projection from last quarter and down $199 million from the third quarter, driven by reductions in headcount earlier in the year and seasonally lower revenue-related expense. These reductions outpaced the continued investments that we're making to drive growth. Our average headcount was down from third quarter to 213,000 people, and that's good work. After peaking at 218,000 last January, we lowered our headcount through the year by 5,000 and did so without taking an outsized severance charge as we used attrition to lower our headcount along the way. One more point to acknowledge the good work of our teams on expense. Q4 2023 adjusted expense of $15.6 billion is only $94 million higher than Q4 2022.\nJust remember, we began 2023 with a $125 million lift in quarterly FDIC expense. Through some good operational excellence work and otherwise, we've managed through all of the additional costs of investments in new tech initiatives and merit and financial center openings, as well as some stronger revenue and higher marketing costs. As we look forward to next quarter, we expect to see the more typical Q1 seasonal elevation in expense of $700 to 800 million compared to Q4, so we believe expense will be around $16.4 billion in the first quarter. That includes elevated payroll tax expense and the expected costs of higher revenue in both sales and trading, and wealth management as well as merit cost increases.\nAs we move through 2024, we expect the quarterly expense to decline from Q1, reflecting a drop in the elevated payroll tax expense, and revenue changes as well as some additional operational excellence initiative work. Continued digital transformation and adoption is also going to help us as we go through the year.\nLet's now turn to credit. I'll use slide 12 for that. Provision expense was $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, and it included an $88 million reserve release due to a modestly improved macroeconomic environment. On a weighted basis, we're reserved for an unemployment rate of nearly 5% by the end of 2024 compared to the most recent 3.7% rate. Reported net charge-offs of $1.2 billion increased $261 million from the third quarter, and the net charge-off ratio was 45 basis points, a 10 basis point increase from the third quarter.\nOn Slide 13, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. The overall increase in net charge-offs was driven by three things. First, $104 million of the increase was driven by credit card losses, which continued to normalize as higher late-stage delinquencies flowed through to charge-offs. Second, $65 million of the increase was driven by a broad range of smaller commercial and industrial losses, which were mostly previously reserved and monitored for the past couple of quarters. And lastly, $76 million of the increase was driven by commercial real estate losses primarily due to office, also mostly reserved.\nIn the appendix, we've included a current view of our commercial real estate and office portfolio stats provided last quarter, and we've also included the historical perspective of our loan book de-risking and long-term trend of our consumer and commercial net charge-offs, and you can see those on slides 30 to 33.\nLet's move on to the various lines of business and their results, and I'll start on Slide 14 with Consumer Banking. For the quarter, Consumer earned $2.8 billion on continued good organic growth and despite their good client activity, it's difficult to outrun the earnings impact of higher rates on deposit costs while the credit is also normalizing. So reported earnings declined 23% year-over-year as top line revenue declined 4% while expense rose 3%, and the credit costs rose. Customer activity showed another strong quarter of net new checking growth, another strong period of card opening, and investment balances for consumer clients which climbed $105 billion over the past year to a record $424 billion. Our full year flows were $49 billion as accounts grew 10% in the past 12 months. Loan growth was led by credit card, and that broke above $100 billion this quarter.\nDeposit decline slowed in the quarter with continued strong discipline around pricing, and our expense reflects continued business investments for growth. And as you can also see on the Appendix, page 21, digital engagement continued to improve and showed good year-over-year improvement as customers enjoy the continuation of enhanced capabilities.\nMoving to wealth management on slide 15, we produce good results earning a little more than $1 billion after adding 40,000 net new relationships in Merrill and the private bank this year. These results were down from last year as a decline in NII from higher deposit costs still catching up from the interest rate hikes more than offset higher fees from asset management driven by higher market levels and assets under management flows. As Brian noted earlier, both Merrill and the private bank continued to see strong organic growth and produced solid assets under management flows of $52 billion since Q4 2022, which reflects a good mix of new client money as well as existing clients putting their money to work. Expenses reflect continued investments in the business and revenue related costs. On slide 16, you see the global banking results.\nThe business produced strong results with earnings of $2.5 billion, as a decline from peak levels of NII was offset by lower provision expense, leaving earnings down 3% year-over-year. Revenue declined 8%, driven by the NII. Our global treasury services business remained robust with strong business from existing clients, as well as good new client generation. In addition, we continue to see a steady volume of solar and wind investment projects this quarter, and our investment banking business continued to perform well in a sluggish environment year-over-year. Revenue growth also benefited from lower marks on leveraged loan positions.\nThe company's overall investment banking fees were $1.1 billion in Q4, that grew 7% over the prior year despite a fee pool that was down 8%, and for the year we held on to the number 3 position overall given that performance in the component parts. We ended the year number 1 in investment grade, number 2 in leveraged finance, number 4 in equity capital markets, and number 4 in mergers and acquisitions. The diversification of the revenue across products and regions reflects the growing strength of our platform, and a good example of that is our focus on the equity capital markets blocks business, where we finished number 1 in the United States for the first time since 1998, and in EMEA we were also number 1 for blocks provision.\nExpense reflected a reserve release of $399 million, and that comes from an improved macroeconomic outlook as well as realized charge-offs better. As noted before, expense decreased 2% year-over-year as continued investments in the business were more than offset by reductions in other operating costs. Switching to global markets on slide 17, the team had another strong quarter with earnings growing 13% year-over-year to $736 million driven by revenue growth of 4%. We refer to results excluding DVA as we normally do. Good results in sales and trading, and comparatively lower marks on leveraged loan positions drove the year-over-year performance. Focusing on the sales and trading ex DVA revenue improved 1% year-over-year to $3.8 billion, which is a new fourth quarter record for the firm.\nFICC was down 6% from a record quarter while equities increased 12% compared to Q4 2022, and the FICC revenues were down versus that record fourth quarter level with higher revenues in mortgages and municipality trading. Equities was driven by improved trading performance in derivatives, and our expense was up 3% on continued investment in the business. Finally, on Slide 18, All Others shows a loss of $3.8 billion as the two notable items highlighted earlier negatively impacted net income by $2.8 billion. In that segment, revenue adjusted for the $1.6 billion BSBY cessation was flat year-over-year, and expense adjusted for the $2.1 billion FDIC assessment was down a couple hundred million driven by lower litigation and lower unemployment processing costs. I noted earlier, we reported a modest tax benefit this quarter.\nThe tax credits from tax-advantaged investment deals throughout the year, including their benefits in the fourth quarter, exceeded taxes on reported earnings. Because we had the two notable items that lowered results this quarter. For the full year, our tax rate was a little more than 6%. And excluding the impacts of BSBY cessation, FDIC, and the other discrete tax benefits, that rate was 10%. And further, excluding our investment tax credits, our tax rate would have been 25%. So thank you. And with that we'll launch into the Q and A. Please.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press Star 1 now on your telephone keypad. To withdraw yourself from the queue, you may press the pound key. Once again, that is Star 1. We'll take our first question from Jim Mitchell of Seaport Global.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\nAlastair, maybe on the NII trajectory that you're talking about, sort of down a little bit in the first half and then start to stabilize in the second half. You're building in six cuts.\nBut a lot of those cuts are.\nStarting in sort of Q2 and beyond. Given your asset sensitivity, why would we expect NII to stabilize? Is that just sort of expected growth and deposits and loans? Just kind of help us think through your assumptions on the NII for 2024?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYes. Well, I think Jim, going back to last quarter, I don't think our views have changed a great deal. So our guidance isn't changing much either in that regard. If anything, Q4 deposits were a little better than we expected. So I think you see, we sort of thought this quarter might be around $14 billion. It was a little better than that. So that's obviously a good starting point. Now when we look forward off of that slightly higher number. If you think about Q1, I'm thinking about it in terms of a day count that might be $150 million, let's say. So from where we are, that's going to get us to somewhere between $13,914. It's going to be in that kind of a range. Q2 we see going down just a little bit more.\nThat's a little bit of deposit seasonality in Q1 and a little bit of just catch up on rate paid and some rotation. But at that point we see growing in the back half of the year, and that's largely yes, deposits growing, it's loans growing a little bit. It's some restriking of the securities that come off the balance sheet, and it's restriking some of the loans that come off the balance sheet. So it's all of those things. You're right. You know, when we got together last quarter we thought there might be three rate cuts. Now it's up to six. So that's obviously that's a little harder, but the deposit picture has been a little better. So no particular change at this point.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nOkay, that's fair.\nMaybe just as a follow-up, just on loan growth.\nWhat do you think? We all see the card growth, but outside of that it's been pretty muted. We're looking at rate cuts. Maybe that's a little bit better for demand. How do you think, what are you seeing on the commercial side in terms of demand and what changes the dynamic?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nWell, I mean you look back, if you look at our loan growth in the materials, it's been a pretty slow loan growth environment.\nI think what's going on underneath it is, obviously, you've got the economic activity offsetting that a little bit is lower revolver utilization. You can sort of see why, with rates being much higher, it's a little more expensive to borrow revolver. So as corporate cash balances have come up and deposits have come up, that's just a natural headwind that's beginning to fade. So we kind of feel like the loan growth ought to be low single digits.\nNormally, we think about it as kind of GDP plus just a little bit of market share. So in a low GDP environment, that's sort of what we're expecting for loans this year. Then we'll just need to see how the rate structure develops.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global\n\nOkay, all fair, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Erika Najarian of UBS.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nMs. Najarian, please check your mute switch. Your line is open.\nHi. Sorry. Rookie move. I apologize for that. Alastair, if you could. Thank you for giving us more detail about how your NII trajectory is going to be for the rest of the year. I'm wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color on what you're expecting for deposit repricing and perhaps for V of A specifically, perhaps the liability mix in the second half of the year. So if you expect deposit growth to come back, I think a big question that the market has is what is the repricing power to the downside that these banks have as the Fed cuts rates. So I think that would be really good color for the market to have.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYep. Okay. So first of all, if I go back over the trajectory of deposits through the course of 2020.\nWe troughed at 1845 and we ended at 1925. So underneath, there's $80 billion of growth in deposits since May. So that obviously informs our perspective around how we think about deposit gathering at this stage.\nThat feels to us like it's a supportive environment of our NII forecast. Second, obviously, over the course of this year, there's been a move towards more interest bearing, and that actually helps us in the event that we start seeing Fed cuts, because that's obviously going to allow us to take those rates down. So, look, we're going to see a little bit of rotation, I think, here in Q1 and Q2. I think we'll likely see a little bit of deposit pricing lag. But the last Fed hike at this point was July. So there's been an awful lot of time at this point for deposit pricing to shake out. We won't be immune from anything. We have to compete for deposits along with everyone else. But combine all of those things, and that's where we get our confidence.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it. Just to clarify.\nHow we should think about the full year, the $16.4 billion in Q1 2024 expenses and a quarterly decline from there. You know, does that pretty much square with what you've said in the past for expenses of up 1% to 2% year-over-year? And would that number include an assumption that investment banking activity returns in force in 2024?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nYes. So we, if you think about it pre-pandemic, we reached the point where we'd taken expenses down a place where we said we'd kind of grow at sort of half the rate of inflation, et cetera. So you're right, what we're thinking now is roughly $100 million in the fourth quarter of last year's fourth quarter. And if you think about that as.\nYou look at the personnel side of it, it's up a little higher, the non-personnel down a little lower. We got the rise in Q1 expenses and then we start going down each quarter again. So if you think about $100 to 200 million of sort of.\nInflationary growth over the quarters this year, you get between 64 and 64 and a half. And you know, most of the firms out there we look at are sort of in that range, and we feel comfortable with that. But that sort of allows us the room to use our good operational excellence, take out expenses, and replace them with things like revenue related expenses that we've seen. And we see that pattern reemerge. Now as we got stability past the pandemic and past the great resignation and all the inflation that occurred in that, in the 2021 2022 timeframe, we now stabilize back to that ability to produce sequential declines in quarters during the year, year-over-year growth of inflationary 1% to 2% levels. And that gets you in that low 64s.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you, Brian.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from John McDonald of Autonomous Research.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nHi, Alastair. Brian. Alastair, I wanted to go back on the NII, and maybe you could help us. It's so hard for us to square the NII outlook with the rate sensitivity disclosure that you have in the slide with 100 basis points parallel shift down is $3.1 billion. Maybe just. Is there some caveats about how in the real world it doesn't play out like the disclosures? You know, we've already seen rates come down on the long end, almost 100 basis points. So I guess it just. Where's that $3.1 billion headwind in your number? Because it's very impressive obviously to be able to kind of keep it flat despite that using the forward curve.\nThanks.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYeah, well, I mean, I think that the main thing is, number one, it obviously assumes a parallel shift instantly.\nThe rate cuts that are in the forward projections. The earliest one comes in March, for example, so you're not going to see a full year's worth of rate cuts all in the space of the first day or so. It doesn't work out that way. So, John, I think the way to start would be just use what we've disclosed, which is that 3.1, you can see what we say in terms of how much of that is the short end. And then I just take that number and use that as the beginning point. And just keep in mind we still see some deposit growth, some loan growth, and some securities and loan repricing that offsets all that.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay, okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just on top of that, trading NII or the Global Markets NII, is that likely to be a headwind or a tailwind in 2024 versus 2023? Do you have any visibility on that?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYeah, well, look, if you look at global markets in any given quarter, it moves around just based on the customer behavior. Over the long arc, if you look over the course of the past two or three years, it's liability sensitive. I'd expect if you see rate cuts that'll benefit global markets NII just a little bit. You can almost, like, if you think about just retracing the steps of what they've conceded in NII, you'd sort of expect to get that back over time.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay, so maybe that could grow a bit.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nJohn, this quarter was a drop. Q3, Q4, a pretty good amount. And so, and that's partly due to the Q4 being lower activity, just lower inventory carry and things like that. That reversed itself. And we're off to a good start so far in the Q1 here. And the balance sheet moves back up. So there's a little bit of quarter to quarter linkage, Q3 to Q4, typically.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay, got it. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHi.\nJust another follow-up on NII. I guess if you take the Fed dot plot, maybe there's just three rate cuts. If you take that instead of the six.\nHow would you think about NII change?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nWell, I think if we got the three rather than the six, Mike, we'd do modestly better. You know, I think, let me put it this way, if we hadn't seen the three more.\nSince last quarter, we might have a higher guide because we've come off of a base with better deposit gathering in Q4, so we're starting in a better place. Those two things have sort of evened themselves out. Obviously, if it pushes out later, that's a good thing for us.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nBrian, Alastair, you always talk about the information advantage you have by just being in the flow of so much of the US economy.\nWhat do you think, I mean, is this just not relying? I know you'd like relying on your research group, Brian, and what their economic forecast is. What do you guys think as far as are we going into a recession the second half this year? Does the Fed need to cut six times? Are you seeing that? Where are you seeing the most softness, I guess is the question.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nI think our research team has rate cuts in next year and has a soft landing as you referenced, Mike. That's it. As you see the customers today, as I said earlier, the year-to-year spending growth in the fourth quarter versus last year's fourth quarter or in the first quarter so far versus the first part of last year is a 4% to 5% rate and movement of money. That was across $4 trillion plus out of the consumer accounts and Bank of America into the economy. That 4% to 5% is similar to what it was in 2017, 2018, 2019 when the Fed rose, took rates up, inflation was under control, and the economy was growing at 2%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%.\nThe spending level should sustain that economy, albeit our core prediction is it's slowing down from a higher growth rate in the third quarter, 4.5, whatever it was, down to 1% or something like that in the first couple quarters next year. We see the consumer activity indicating that they're still in the game, they're still spending money. Where they spend, it's a little different. More in services and going out in restaurants and experiences, and less on goods at retail. They're employed. If you look at the estimates by any of you, any of your economists, the unemployment rate projected is really a modest deterioration from here, most of them in the core base case, our reserves actually set at almost a 5% unemployment rate by the end of this year, to give you a sense. That's good news. They're using their credit responsibly.\nMuch is made of, you know, higher credit card balances. On the size of the economy and the size, you know, people are forgetting that, you know, the economy is a lot bigger than it was in 2019 because of the inflation and everything. As a percentage, we do not see any stress there. We see a normalization at credit. They are working, they are getting paid, they have balances in their accounts, they have access to credit, they have locked in good rates on their mortgages, and they are employed. We feel it is good. We think the soft landing is a core thesis, and our internal data supports what our research team sees, and they get, you know, they see it also through our institute.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nJust as far as controlling what you can control in terms of expenses and head caps, tech investments, and maybe throw in AI as part of that, what sort of extra efficiencies can you achieve through AI, tech, and other initiatives? You squeezed a lot out over the last decade plus, what's left to go.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America",
    "content2": "Yeah, there's always more to go. I think we've got lined up, if you take what we're doing this year and next year, meaning 2024, 2025, and enrolled in 2026, it's a couple billion dollars plus, which helps us to the dynamic Eric was talking about avoiding.\nGrowth in expenses, keeping below inflation. Because you think of us as rolling that expense taken out back into good things. This year will be, I think, $3.8 billion on technology initiatives. That's up from 2021 to 2022 by $500 million or more, and then sort of flattish 2022 to 2023. They're being applied in different ways. We added relationship managers corporation across the board. We keep opening the branches. We're largely through the rehab of the branches that we're keeping. These are all spending to grow. That's what you're seeing. Net new checking accounts, 600,000 for the year. That's 20 straight quarters. Net checking account growth. All good core accounts flows into the asset management business. $80 billion or more in our Merrill Edge program. The advertising has driven the business. We have 10% more customers.\nThose customers, which is 300,000 to 400,000 customers added in the last 12 months, bring an average opening balance of $80,000 to $100,000. To give you a sense, they're not small accounts. That's good. We're just investing. There's a thousand levers. None of them are simple. Even this year, when we said we got to get the headcount growth back in alliance after the great resignation in 2022 and we had to hire fast, we went from 218,000 people in January down to 212,900 at the end of the year. In that, we're rolling over teammates from one business to another business where we need help, retraining people, and reskilling people. As AI comes in, and to the extent that we can deploy it, deploy it wisely, it'll allow us to redeploy people.\nEven with our very low turnover rate, which is 7% for year 2023 and actually down from 12% in year 2022, and I think 6% in the fourth quarter, we still can manage headcount down just by not hiring people because that gives an opportunity. We hired 15,000 people this year, so we hire. We can always hire a little less if we see the efficiencies coming through and redeploy the people we have.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. Just thoughts on capital allocation from here, Brian. I think there were some, and sorry if I missed it in the beginning, but I think there was some media coverage about you guys or you talked about leading into markets with capital. I don't know if there's any way to kind of size that, and then just broadly speaking, like how you allocate capital from here or buyback levels and all that stuff. Thanks.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nYeah, I'm not sure of the media report, but at the end of the day, Jim DeMare and team have done a great job deploying capital and growing market share in the sales and trading business. They're up 7% year-over-year in revenue. FICC was up 11% for the year. Equity was down a little bit, down a percent or so. That's a great job. $17.6 billion of revenue, highest by a lot over the last few years. Think about it, in the 2019 time frame, we were $13 billion in revenues. They fundamentally moved up. That was deploying more balance sheet. You got a little bit more capital inherently, but not a lot to not take a lot of risk. They made money every trading day in 2023 again, I think.\nThey do a great job of serving the clients. Don't think there's a big capital, you know, a massive amount of capital. They get the capital they need. You know, they have the balance sheet and the risk appetite they need. We're continuing to put money towards that business because they've proven to be successful. We gave them the balance sheet a few years ago and they were able to deploy more broadly. You know, we pay out the dividend, we then have a bunch of capital. Today, we meet the standards as best, as Alastair said, we could divine from the rule. We'll see what the final rule looks like when it comes out. Right now, the $194 billion of CET1 is the level of notional CET1. We have to meet the RWA inflation.\nI'm not saying it's a good rule, I'm just saying we make the math work. From now on, we can basically deploy capital to the dividend payment, a couple billion dollars a quarter, and then everything above that will go to support business growth if we have it. Build a little bit of cushion. We need to build over some period of time to meet these new rules if they come through. Then share buybacks, which we bought $800 million or so last quarter, and you'd expect that to keep ticking up.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, that's helpful. You did mention that trading or markets is off to a good start so far this year. Obviously just a handful of days, but any color around that? More broadly speaking, as we think about the overall wallet, like obviously banking is depressed, but how would you frame the market trading wallet? Do we use 2023 as a jumping off point and grow it by some kind of long-term trend or any way to kind of frame that in terms of a base case?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Yeah, it's too early for us to predict what the quarter will look like. We'll get a much better feel for that four, five, six weeks from now. I think you can use the 2023 numbers as a baseline starting point, and then the first quarter.\nI just applied sort of a typical kind of seasonality. Q1 tends to be a very good quarter for us, Q4 less so just with the client activity, and then just recognize that we're starting from a Q4 record. That's the only thing I would consider.\nOkay, thank you very much.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nYou mentioned investment banking. Matthew and the team exceeded what we thought in the quarter and seemed to perform at better industry and actually were up a little bit year-over-year. There's a full pipeline. The question is sort of when is the clarity. You're seeing some stuff get done, and with stability in rates, you'd expect that to kick back up. We typically are running about $1.5 billion before the added activity because of the rate falling in pandemic a quarter. We're now $1.2 billion. You expect it to move back in those levels. We are actually been gaining share over the last few quarters as the market's gone down around us. We held our relative position, grew it.\nI think Matthew and the team is in good shape, and this middle market execution has added a lot of throughput to the team and is building up over time.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Glenn Schorr of Evercore.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHello there.\nGood morning. First question is on the deposits. I like the path that we've seen in terms of all the stimulus comes, all the deposits come in, you get some spending, you get some migration.\nGet some rich people buying Treasuries. Great to see the stability in the fourth quarter and hear your comments about 2024 for deposits is a little encouraging. We'd always want more, but it's a little encouraged. My question is to be 35% higher and for Q1 2019 is what I would call a lot more growth than a normal period of time would be with the up and down. Is that a good thing or is that a risk? Maybe the answer lies within how much of those excess deposits are sitting in all these new accounts that you've opened versus just cash from sitting around in existing clients that may be waiting to be deployed. I hope that question is clear.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nGlenn, you're making me head deja vu because basically I think you would have asked this question Q1 2023 too, on a theory that this was all going to run off. When we looked at it, we always said, you know, we had grown sort of in the period at the time of pandemic, at sort of 4% or 5% a year in terms of deposit growth. If you strung that line out, we're still above that line, let's just say that. Now we're turning and growing. As Alastair said, we dropped in the middle of the year. We've outgrown what our sort of implied growth rate would have been against size, et cetera. We feel good about that. It's all core. If you look at the underlying dynamics, think about the different clients we have.\nIf you start with the wealth manager clients discreetly and GWIM, you know, those balances came down, are bouncing around $300, $290, $300 billion on a given day, and they've been relatively stable now for, I don't know, five, six months. I think if you look at the wholesale banking, what's happened is they came, you know, they shot up, came down after the pandemic, and then they've been growing back, and they're actually stronger because just the activity is picked up in a stabilization of line usage as shows that the environment around their borrowing and cash is more consistent. You know, that's, that's been good. If you look at consumer, that's what we were saying earlier.\nIf you think about consumer, where you see, if you take the people who had accounts with us, their balances in all their deposit accounts pre-pandemic to now, if you look at people who had in consumer, not in wealth management, you know, $50,000, $100,000, $250,000, a million dollars in collective balances pre-pandemic, they are down 20%. They moved the money they are going to move. For wealth management and consumer, largely people who are going to move money out to get rate have done that. There is, you know, it is still bouncing around a little bit in consumer. Yeah, they are $950 billion more or less on a given day. It is, you know, stabilized and been relatively consistent for the last year, four, six, eight weeks. That has got to settle in, and then you grow out from there.\nWhat that's really telling you is they kind of move the money they're going to move mostly.\nBecause.\nThey did it and you don't get that money twice. You move the chunk in these higher-end consumer balances. They moved 20% of their balances over into GET and money market funds, which we captured, and other things. They don't have it to move again because that was accumulated balances that they had in a zero interest rate environment, pre-pandemic, plus whatever other things they got. If you look at slide 8, you can see the deposit slides laid out by not as interest bearing and interest bearing, but you know, the key is that consumer was $700 billion going into the pandemic, sits at $950 billion today. If you look at the checking, it's still up $140 billion, and that's kind of bouncing around. You can see it's moved down a little bit, but that's really the high piece.\nPeople with high-end checking balances that have moved it into the market.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThat's all good and more than I was looking for. I appreciate it. Quick follow up on reserves. Now as you mentioned, just one back.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nLook at the consumer banking page, it's 47 basis points all in, and it was six, you know, four, six quarters ago. That's all driven by the CDs. You know, we don't have a lot of CDs and some of the high-end money market pricing. The point is, if it was going to be moved, think about that, you know, so the money that's moved is moved, and we pay higher rates for very high balances and stuff like that, especially in like the Merrill platform. A lot of that dynamic is for the system right now, for lack of a better term.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThat was great. Good comment. I appreciate that. Quickly on reserves, with a pretty solid economy, resilient US consumer, your NPLs are down, you have.\nA lot of reserves.\nThe question is what are the signposts that you or we should be looking for to know when you've added enough, when we are stable enough point in time, and you actually start funding charge offs from reserves and not adding. Thanks.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nI think we're getting pretty close now because things are beginning to stabilize. They're beginning to normalize the whole. You know, this is a period of transition for the economy, and it's a period of transition for our clients too. A lot of them are dealing with higher interest rates, and they're just beginning to moderate and change their spending behaviors. We've seen a trend over the course of the past few quarters. It's pretty predictable around the consumer side. You can see that in our disclosures. I think it's slide 12 and 13, but that's going to bounce around over the course of the next couple quarters. Now that we're back towards 2018, 2019 levels, it's going to settle in, we think, in the first half of this year. On the commercial side, the asset quality remains really in a very good position.\nWe happen to have a couple of names that popped up this quarter, but to your point, we were pretty fully reserved against them. That wasn't a surprise to us. We've seen those for the course of the past six months. We think we're getting close there. Glenn, and obviously the closer we get to a soft landing, the better we're going to feel about that.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nGlenn, as you think about it, when you said reserves, remember because under CECL stuff, we've always got sort of the lifetime reserve methodology, which we're all still getting clear now. We've operated under it for a few years. You know, this quarter we actually had commercial reserves come down to pay for the charge-offs on specifically prior period reserved properties or loans. That happened, and you saw some of that. Be careful on the consumer side because basically, you know, the pay-as-you-go side, the consumer side is still building up to a nominal amount of charge-offs consistent with where it was in 2018-2019. If you look at card in 2018-2019, the charge-off rate across the eight quarters ranged from a low of 2.90% and a higher 3.26%. We're at 3.07% today, but we're $6 billion, $8 billion higher balances.\nYou've got to be careful with the nominal amount to get that right. If you go look at it more broadly, the company, we had 45 basis points this quarter in the range in those eight quarters of 34 to 43. What's different is the CRE piece of that and the charge off. You know, the reserve loans and all the classic factors you look at are very strong. The reserve has set itself with basically half the reserve driven by the adverse case scenarios to give you a sense versus the base case, and then some judgmental on top of that. You know, as it becomes clear that we're in a soft landing, to Alastair's point, there's less allocation to those scenarios. We always will make some.\nWhen you put all that together and weighted, it has unemployment pushing up in the high fours, and you look at unemployment today, it's nowhere close to that, and there's no prediction to get there in a base case. That's what will start to ease up on the general reserving. Remember on card, it's a bit of pay as you go. We were running around 6% reserves. We're up to 7% against card now. There might be a little bit coming back, but not that I'd rather have the growth to stop that up down to 6% in cards than give them back to reserves.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThat's great color. Thank you for all that.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Ken Usden of Jefferies.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks. Good afternoon. Just a technical clarification on that. BSBY $1.6 billion.\nSo I presume that you start to get that back mid-quarter Q4 next year, given the 15 November 2024 termination. And then does it just run out ratably? Just wondering over what exact period of time you get that $1.6 billion.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nHey, Ken, happy New Year. It's this year's 2024, so.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nCorrect.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nSorry, Ken. Yes, you got it right. We'll get some of it back at the back end of 2024. We'll get a little bit in the fourth quarter, and then I'd say we get most of it back in 2025, most of the remainder back in 2026. That's the easiest way to think about it.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nOkay, so it's a little. So is it straight line or is it a little bit front load? Like, I just want to get just a straight line divided by. Or is it has a little bit of like a tail?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nNo, it's got a little more in 2025 than 2026.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nOkay, okay, I got it. Just one question. Can you just remind us of brokerage fees this quarter? [They] felt the impact, I think you said it, of the soft averages from this quarter, and so I think should we expect to see just from the markets bounce that we saw in the fourth quarter that to play well into the first quarter starting points from the management fees perspective?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYes, I think you should expect our global markets performance to continue right now. I mean, obviously there's a pretty constructive environment for the markets business at this point. I don't think anything's changed there. There's a lot of client repositioning going on. So yes, I think the fourth quarter is sort of the right number to start with. And then you just got to, I think, adjust for the fact that obviously you've got a step up in their activity in Q1 now, if you're. I don't know if I misinterpreted. If you're talking about the wealth management.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nYes.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nThose fees are obviously just going to work on the monthly lag based on where the markets go over time. So obviously the markets are elevated right now and that should portend well for the future.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nThat's what I was getting at. Thank you. Right, just confirming that we didn't see the benefit yet. That comes further based on the averages and how that will play for. But we're presuming the market hangs in there.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nCorrect. That tends to be a lag by a month or so. So you'll see that in Q1.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nOkay, got it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Ryan Kenny of Morgan Stanley.\n\nRyan Kenny\n\nVice President of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question. Just following up on a few questions ago on the commercial credit side. So the commercial net charge-offs did roughly double sequentially, and you mentioned that there were a few customers that popped up. Should we interpret that to mean that the pace of deterioration decelerates and it was just a one-off, or is there anything else going on under the hood there?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nYeah. So I don't think. Let me put it this way. I think it's too early to conclude that it's anything other than just a momentary spike up. But if you look at that chart, essentially what's going on is two things. First, we've got a little bit of office, and that's going to bounce around over the course of time. It just takes a while to resolve that portfolio. It's pretty small for us.\nObviously we feel like we're doing all the right things with it. But that was a little elevated this quarter relative to the prior three. And then more broadly in commercial, there were a couple other things that took place this quarter. Again, we were pretty fully reserved against them. So we sort of saw those coming. Asset quality generally in commercial remains in a very, very good place outside of the office sector. And you can again see that in terms of look at our reserves, our criticized assets that declined this quarter. So I don't think there's any change there. The issue is just that we're starting with such small numbers in commercial that anything appears like a spike.\n\nRyan Kenny\n\nVice President of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. And just one more clarifying question on NII. So in this scenario with the six rate cuts, can you help us understand how you expect the deposit mix to migrate, and specifically with the migration from NIB to IP deposits grind to a halt or is there any scenario where NIB deposits actually start growing again?\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nWell, I think what we're trying to describe is a sense that we're getting towards the tail end of this now, partly because we're now six months away from the last time that the Fed raised rates, and then partly because if we do have rate cuts, it's going to start to disincentivize people moving out of.\nNon-interest-bearing. So that's what we're describing over the course of time. We've got to see how that develops through the course of the year.\n\nRyan Kenny\n\nVice President of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our final question from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, Co-head of Global Financials Research, and Large Cap Bank Analyst, RBC\n\nHi Brian. Hi Alastair.\nThank you.\nYou guys have obviously done a very good job in the consumer banking area with digital banking, and I frame that for you guys in this question. We hear a lot about AI and what it could do for the banking industry. When you look out over the next three to five years and you invest in AI to improve efficiencies, could it have a similar impact what digital banking did for consumer banking pre-iPhone to where we are today in your business? Or is it going to be more like blockchain where there's a lot of discussion about the future of blockchain but we don't hear much about that anymore. Do you guys have a view on what AI could be for your business over the next three to five years?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nI agree with you. I'm not sure that there's a relevant comparison to blockchain, but let's just focus on AI. If you look at 21, you can see the digital movement. One of the things in the digital movement you see is Erica in the lower left-hand page, lower left-hand chart on page 21, Gerard, and you can see that in the fourth quarter, the 170 million interactions with Erica were people effectively answered one question, another 2 million people from last year to this year using it on a basis, 16 up to 18 million people using unique users. That's just an example, and that's AI in an early stage. We built that starting 10 years ago. It operates on our data, uses natural language processing. We have to keep updating that for the way people use words, that process.\nBut think 170 million phone calls, walks into branches, emails, et cetera, where that inquiry would have to go through another place. And it's able to clients to do things. And so we think that there's vast promise for AI, and we're deploying in places a lot of internal stuff. We help employees work better, work faster. We're doing it. We have it in our coding shop. There's coders using it to continue to improve their effectiveness in learning. But it's still there, still the care that has to be taken on data, usage, models, and accountability. All that stuff is still high. So we're using for things that are a little easier, and we think it has great promise. It's just going to, you know, I'd say it's going to be more similar to digital.\nWhat the pace will be will be a little bit of how far it can go before you start to run into difficulties applying it effectively. But it plays off the same thing that we've done in digital, Erica, and other things. We brought Erica over the commercial side now so that.\nCashPro uses Erica to answer questions. We're seeing the uses of that grow, and you can see the customers can interface and be comfortable with it, and that's good. So it will have tremendous help as it's applied in more and more ways. We are still trying here and seeing if it really works, how much benefit it generates. Can it be controlled under the model? The model outputs control and also the things. But we've had algorithmic machine learning type models all over our company for years. And so the billions we've spent literally over the last 10 years on data cleanliness data or getting the data in the right place, making sure it's dependable and the models operate at either that aren't these open autonomous natural language models, but are models that are machine learning models that we've seen great promise.\nThat's partly how we operate the company now, basically on the same dollar amount of expenses we had in 2015 or 2016, to give you a sense. So yes, it's been digitization, but it's also been using more of that. So it's got. We have high hopes for it. We just have to make sure it does a great job for the customer.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, Co-head of Global Financials Research, and Large Cap Bank Analyst, RBC\n\nVery good. And as a follow-up, we've been reading and seeing a lot of information about the private credit markets making inroads. And we know the shadow banking industry has been around for a long time, our entire careers. What are you guys seeing today? Is it more competitive against the Apollos and Blackstones in lending? And then, second, there are also, I'm assuming, customers. So how do you balance servicing them, but at the same time they could be a direct competitor in the lending markets?\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nWell, that's, that's all the issues that we got to balance on a given day, but. And we can originate loans into their platforms, and there are lots of things we can do. So we continue to work for that. I think, to take it more broadly. You know, my colleagues and I have made clear that the strictures around our industry, the methodology operating, and the openness and ability to operate outside has led to the mortgage business largely being done outside the industry, and most other asset classes, lack of a better term, being outside the industry, and the private lending is just another case of that. And I think we're very competitive, we do a great job. And we have $0.5 trillion of consumer, excuse me, commercial loans outstanding, we have hundreds of billions of dollars of mid-sized companies, et cetera.\nSo we think there's a way that we can do this with our clients and help them and help us. A lot of them are asking, can you help us originate loans? I think there's still a question ahead of whether the policy of having more things going on in the bank industry is a good policy. Of course we in the banking industry don't think it's a good policy because the reality I think inherent in part of your question was when these companies bounce around because of economic stress or interest for them as an operator, the banking system has a workout methodology, not a liquidation methodology or trading methodology. And that served American enterprise very well. And so I think we have to be careful and see how it affects the economy that way.\nAnd those are issues that were true pre-pandemic and have become more acute. So we feel we'll be competitive no matter what. Nothing scares us. We've got a great team and they do a great job. But it's endemic of the issue that if you keep pushing too much capital, regulation stuff will find its way outside the system. And that doesn't mean the risk has changed, it just means it moved from purview of the regulators. And that's one of the points we make. But on the other hand, we are working with those enterprises to help us be a combined effective competitor.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, Co-head of Global Financials Research, and Large Cap Bank Analyst, RBC\n\nVery good, Brian. I appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude our question and answer session. I'd be happy to return the call to Mr. Brian Moynihan for closing comments.\n\nBrian Moynihan\n\nCEO, Bank of America\n\nHappy New Year to everyone. Thank you for all the time today and on a very busy day with lots of us reporting. As we summarize, fourth quarter was a good quarter and another strong year for our company, driven by organic growth from all our customer segments. Our digital capabilities continue to grow, our deposits and loans grew. That's good news. Our NII continues to exceed what we tell you each quarter in terms of what we think is going to happen, which is good news. We gave you new guidance, which we plan to hit. Our capital markets activity remains good on both the investment banking side and the sales trading side. But, and importantly, to get the value of that revenue, we have to have good expense management. You saw us during the course of the year take headcount down from 218,000 to 212,900.\nYou saw us take the expense down sequentially. Sets us up good for next year. And with all that, our capital and asset quality remains strong, as does our liquidity. So thank you and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's Bank of America earnings announcement. You may now disconnect your lines, and everyone have a great day.\n\nAlastair Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America\n\nSam.\nSa.\nSa."

(Operator Instructions) Please note this call will be recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead.\n\nE. Lee McEntire\n\nHead of IR, Bank of America Corporation\n\nThank you. Good morning. Welcome. Thank you for joining the call to review the fourth quarter results. I know it's a busy day with lots of banks reporting and we appreciate your interest. I trust everybody has had a chance to review our earnings release documents. They're available, including the earnings presentation that we'll be referring to during the call, on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website.\nI'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments and then ask Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, to cover some other elements of the quarter.\nBefore I turn the call over to Brian, let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nFactors that may cause actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and SEC filings available on our website. Information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials that are available on the website.\nSo with that, take it away, Brian.\n\nBrian Thomas Moynihan\n\nChairman & CEO, Bank of America Corporation\n\nThank you, Lee, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. I am starting on Slide 2 of the earnings presentation. During the fourth quarter of 2022, our team once again delivered responsible growth for our shareholders. We reported $7.1 billion of net income after tax or $0.85 per diluted share. We grew revenue 11% year-over-year and delivered our sixth straight quarter of operating leverage. And again, we delivered a strong 16% return on tangible common equity.\nIf you move to Slide 3, we list the highlights of the quarter, which have been pretty consistent throughout the year. We drove good organic customer activity and saw significant increases in net interest income, which all helped drive operating leverage. Revenue increased year-over-year 11%. It was led by a 29% improvement in net interest income, coupled with a strong 27% growth in sales and trading results by Jimmy DeMare and the team. This growth will exceed the impacts of lower investment banking fees and the impact of bond and equity market valuations on asset management fees in our wealth management business. The positive contributions of NII and sales and trading were also enough to overcome a decline in service charges driven by the fully implemented changes in NSF and overdraft fees in our consumer business.\nImportantly, we improved our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio by 25 basis in quarter 4 to 11.2%, and we achieved that without changing our business strategies. We're well above our both -- our current 10.4% minimum CET1 requirement and above the requirement that we'll have beginning next year in January of 10.9%.\nWe added to our buffer of both growing loans and reducing outstanding shares in the quarter. On a year-over-year comparative basis, both net income and EPS are up modestly with strong operating leverage more than offsetting higher provision expense. The higher provision expense is driven primarily by reserve builds this quarter, a result of loan growth in our portfolios and also our conservative waiting in our reserve setting methodology, which I'll touch on later.\nLast year, we had large reserve releases. Net charge-offs increased this quarter, but asset quality remains strong. Charge-offs are well above both the beginning of the pandemic as well as longer-term historical levels. And again, I'll touch on this in a few pages. All that being said, the simple way to think about it is pretax, pre-provision income, which neutralizes these reserve actions, grew 23% year-over-year.\nLet's turn to Slide 4. Slide 4 shows the year-over-year annualized results. And quarter 4 results were a nice finish to a successful year in which we produced $27.5 billion in net income on 7% revenue growth and a 4% operating leverage. While the year was strong, full year earnings declined as a result of loan loss reserve actions. For the full year of 2022, again, we built about $370 million reserves. And by contrast, last year, in '21, we released $6.8 billion of reserves. Isolating those changes, again, you'll see that PPNR grew a strong 14% over 2021. As I said earlier, the themes were characterized by good organic customer activity, strong NII and always helped by years of responsible growth.\nSlide 5 highlights some of the attributes of organic growth for the quarter and the year. This, plus the slides that we include each earnings materials in our appendix, would show digital trends and organic growth highlights across all the businesses. Our investments over the past several years in our people, tools and resources for our customers and our teammates as well as renovating our facilities have allowed us to continue to enhance the customer experience to record high levels and fuel organic growth. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we added 195,000 net new checking accounts, bringing the total for the year to more than 1 million. This is twice the rate of addition that we had in 2019 in periods before the pandemic.\nThis net growth has led to 10% increase in our customer checking accounts since the pandemic while keeping that 92% of our accounts are primary checking accounts of the household, and the average opening balance, not the average balance, but the average opening balance of these new accounts is over $5,000.\nWe also produced more than 1 million new credit cards, the sixth consecutive quarter of doing that, bringing us back to levels that we generate pre-pandemic. Credit quality, you can see on Appendix Slides 28, for consumer remains very high in new originations. Verified digital users grew to 56 million with 73% of our consumer households fully digitally active. We have more than 1 billion log-ins to our digital platforms each month, and that's been going on for some time now. Digital sales are also growing, and they now represent half of our sales in the consumer business. Erica, our virtual digital system, is now handling 145 million interactions this past quarter and has passed 1 billion interactions since its introduction just a few years ago. This saves a lot of work for our team.\nWhen you move to the GWIM business, the wealth management business, our advisers grew by 800 in the second half of the year. Our team added 28,000 net new households across Merrill and the Private Bank in 2022. We experienced solid net flows despite the turbulence of markets. By the way, during 2022, our average Merrill household opened with balances of $1.6 million to get very high-quality account openings.\nOn flows, when confined across all our investment platforms in our consumer wealth management business, we saw $125 billion of net client flows this year. Additionally, we continue to see increased activity around both investments in our GWIM business and our banking products. Diversified bank element added a strong differentiator for us as a company. It also supports the healthy pretax margin. This helped the GWIM business deliver strong operating leverage for the year, and they grew net revenue and net income to records.\nIn our Global Banking business, we saw solid loan production and growing use of our digital platform throughout the year and added new clients to our portfolio. As you well know, the overall investment banking fee pool was down. However, we continue to deepen and expand client relationships with our build-out of commercial bankers. Our global treasury services business also grew revenue 38% year-over-year as a result of both rates as well as fees for service on cash management.\nIn Global Markets, we had our highest fourth quarter sales and trading performance on record, growing 27% from last year ex-DVA. This was led by a strong performance in our macro FICC businesses, where we made continuous investments in the past 18 months. Equities had a record quarter 4 performance as well.\nLet's move to Slide 6 and talk about operating leverage. As I've said to you for many years, one of the primary goals of this company, which is an important part of our shareholder return model, has been to drive operating leverage. Those efforts, including investments made for the future, coupled with revenue growth, produced 18 straight quarters of operating leverage, as you can see, leading up to the pandemic.\nBeginning last year, in the third quarter of '21 -- 2021, I told you that we now started achieving operating leverage and got back on streak, 6 M or 6 quarters of operating leverage despite all the things that are going on out there, and the team continues to drive towards that for 2023.\nSo I thought I'd spend a few minutes on a discussion of topics that's been important to, as we've talked about, investors over the last couple of months, deposits and credit. So let's go to Slide 7. First, on deposits. There are several factors impacting deposits as our industry works through and the economy works through an impressive period, a surge in deposits from the pandemic-related stimulus, the impact of monetary -- unprecedented monetary easing, impact of high inflation and then the reversal of that with unprecedented pace and size of rate hikes and monetary tightening.\nBut on a year-on-year basis, average deposits of $1.93 trillion are down 5%. This reflects the market trends, and in fact, it reflects high tax payments to the governments in quarter 2 2022. In addition, as we move forward through 2022, customers with excess cash, investment-oriented cash, saw yield as rates increase for money market funds, direct treasuries and other products.\nIt's probably more relevant to discuss the more near-term trends. Comparing third quarter of '22 to fourth quarter of '22, average deposits were down 1.9%. Noninterest-bearing deposits are down 8%, while interest-bearing deposits are up 2%. The mix shift is especially pronounced in treasury services in the Global Banking business. Corporate treasurers manage $500 billion of deposits they have with us. The impact of their activities has a change in the mix.\nOn the personal side, you can see the checking account balances floating down a little bit from core expenses and spending while more affluent customers put money into higher-yielding deposits in the market. We do manage all these products differentially. And the discussion of deposits by business segment you can see on Slide 8, and we'll talk through that.\nSo this breaks down our deposits in a more near-term trend. In the upper left, you can see the full year across -- for the whole company going across the page in the upper left-hand chart. We also put in the rate hikes that you can see. On the chart, you can see the heavy tax payment outflows in the second quarter. Then we saw the acceleration of rate hikes and deposits to move to products seeking yield in certain customer segments.\nBut in large part, what you've seen over the course of the quarter 4 has been stabilization and more normal client activity. Simply put, we ended quarter 4 of '22 with $1.93 trillion in deposits, roughly the overall level as we ended in quarter 3 ending deposit balances.\nSo let's look at those differentiated by business. In consumer, looking at the upper right chart, we show the difference between the movement through the quarter between the balance of low to no interest checking accounts to somewhat higher-yielding nonchecking accounts, money market and saving accounts and a limited portion of CDs.\nAcross the quarter, we saw a $24 billion decline in total, down 2%. We have seen small declines in customers' continued higher levels of spending, pay down debt and also move money to the brokerage accounts even in this business. Higher wages have offset this. While we saw a decline in quarter 4 deposits in consumer, correspondingly, we also saw brokerage levels of consumer investments increased $11 billion, capturing a good portion of those deposits.\nIn general, think of these consumer deposits as being very sticky of $1 trillion. That stickiness, along with net checking account growth, reflect the recognition and the value proposition of a relationship transactional account with our company. It also has -- it reflects industry-leading digital capabilities we offer and the convenience of a nationwide franchise.\nIt also reflects that the customers in our mass market segments have fewer excess cash investment style cash balances. 56% of the $1 trillion in consumer deposits remain in low and no interest checking accounts. And because of all that, overall rate paid in this segment remains low at 6 basis points.\nIn wealth management, which you can see at the bottom left of the chart, more than $300 billion of deposits became more stable across the fourth quarter. They also -- here, you also witnessed a shift to higher-yielding preferred deposits, as you can see on the labels, from lower-yielding transaction deposits as these customers have more excess cash and move them to seek higher yields.\nEarly in the quarter, we saw modest declines in balances, but November's rate hikes began to slow and the probability of future rate hikes became less. People had moved their money, and we saw an uptick in balances as we move through the quarter. This reflects the seasonal inflows that happened in the fourth quarter for wealth management clients.\nAt the bottom right chart, you can see the most dynamic part of this equation. Our Global Banking deposit movement moves across $500 billion in customer deposits. The shift here is what drives the mix total for the company. It's pretty typical with the exception that it happened very quickly in quarter 4 driven by the pace of rate hikes.\nIn a rising rate environment, where a company's operational funds are more expensive, we anticipate these changes, particularly in the high liquidity environments as clients use both cash inventory yield, pay down debt or manage their cash for investment yield. We have seen the mix of Global Banking interest-bearing deposits move from 35% last quarter to 45% in quarter 4. And obviously, we're paying higher rates on those deposits to retain them.\nCustomer pricing here is customer -- on a customer-to-customer basis based on the depth of relationship, the product usage and many other factors. So overall deposit rates paid as a percent of Fed funds increases are still very favorable to last cycle, even as rates are rising much faster than last cycle. I would note, [belt] to the last cycle, that the Fed increases have been rapid and we'd expect to pay higher rates as we continue to move through the end of the interest rate cycle.\nSo just remember, while we're paying more for deposits, we also get that on our asset side. That is simply why the NII, net interest income, is up 29% from quarter 4 2022 versus quarter 4 2021.\nNow let's move to the second topic I want to touch on specifically, which is credit. And this begins on Slide 9. First, it is an intellectible truth that our asset quality of our customers remains very healthy. On the other hand, it's impossible to gainsay that the net charge-offs are moving to prepandemic levels. So in the fourth quarter, we saw net charge-offs of $689 million increased $169 million from quarter 3. The increase was driven by both higher commercial and credit card losses. As these charts show, they're still very low in the overall context.\nIn commercial, we had a few of older company-specific loans but not related or not predictive of any broad trends in the portfolio. These were already reserved for in prior periods, and based on our methodologies, went through charge-off in quarter 4.\nCredit card charge-offs increased in quarter 4 as a result of the flow-through of modest increase in last quarter's late-stage delinquencies. This should continue as we transition off the historic lows in delinquencies to still very low prepandemic levels.\nProvision expense was $1.1 billion in quarter 4. In addition to higher charge-off, provision included roughly $400 million reserve build. This was higher than quarter 3, reflecting good credit card and other loan growth combined with the reserve setting scenario. So let's just stop on the reserve setting scenario.\nOur scenario -- our baseline scenario contemplates a mild recession. That's the base case of the economic assumptions in the blue chip and other methods we use. But we also add to that a downside scenario. And what this results in is 95% of our reserve methodologies weighted towards a recessionary environment in 2023. That includes higher expectations of inflation leading to depressed GDP and higher unemployment expectations.\nThis scenario is more conservative than last quarter's scenario. Now to be clear, just to give you a sense of how that scenario plays out, it contemplates a rapid rise in unemployment to peak at 5.5% early this year in 2023 and remain at 5% or above all the way through the end of '24, obviously, much more conservative than the economic estimates that are out there. We included again the updated slides in the appendix on Pages 36 and 37 to highlight differences in our credit portfolios between pre-financial pre-pandemic and current status. We also, again, gave you the new origination statistics for consumer credit on Page 28.\nThe work the team has done on responsible growth continues to show strong results. From an outsider's view, you don't have to look any further in the Fed stress test results. We've had the lowest net charge-offs for peer banks in 10 of the last 11 stress tests.\nOn Slides 10 to 12, we included some longer-term perspective. We showed long-term trends for commercial net charge-offs, total consumer charge-off rates, and more specifically, credit card charge-off rates. This compares those ratios to pre-financial crisis, during the recovery after the financial crisis, pre-pandemic and then through the pandemic.\nSo that gives you a long-term perspective, which I think keeps in context the idea that we're moving off the bottom in credit cost towards a level which is normalizing to pre-pandemic, but that level is very low in the grand context of banking.\nSo before I move it to Alastair, I want to just update a few comments on our consumer behavior. Consumer deposit balances continue to show strong liquidity with the lower cohorts of our consumers continue to hold several multiples of balance that they have as the pandemic began. These balances are drifting down, but they still have plenty of cushion left. And while their spending remains healthy, we continue to see the pace of that year-over-year growth slow.\nIn the aggregate, in 2022, our consumer spent $4.2 trillion, which outpaced 2021 by 10%. You can see that on Slide 35. Two things to note on that consumer spending pace. There continues to be a slowdown. Year-over-year growth percentage earlier this -- earlier in 2022 were 14% year-over-year. They've now moved to 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. So what does this spend mean? Well, that level of growth in year-over-year spending is consistent with the low inflation, 2% growth economy, we saw pre-pandemic.\nThey're also moving from services to -- from goods to service and experience and spend more money on travel vacations and eating out and things like that. That is a good for unemployment, but continues to maintain service side inflation pressure.\nWith that, let me pass the mic over to Alastair to go through the rest of the quarter. Alastair?\n\nAlastair M. Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America Corporation\n\nOkay. Thanks, Brian. And let me start with the balance sheet, and I'll use Slide 13 for this. During the quarter, our balance sheet declined $23 billion to $3.05 trillion driven by modestly lower Global Markets balances. Our average liquidity portfolio declined in the quarter, reflecting the decrease in deposits and securities levels. And that $868 billion, it still remains $300 billion above our prepandemic levels.\nShareholders' equity increased $3.7 billion from the third quarter as earnings were only partially offset by capital we distributed to shareholders and roughly $700 million in redemption of some preferred securities. We paid out $1.8 in common dividends. And we bought back $1 billion of shares, which was $600 million above those issued for employees in the quarter. AOCI was little changed in the quarter as a small benefit from lower mortgage rates was more than offset by a change in our annual pension revaluation.\nWith regard to regulatory capital, our supplementary leverage ratio increased to 5.9% versus our minimum requirement of 5%. And that obviously leaves capacity for balance sheet growth, and our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements.\nOkay. Let's turn to Slide 14 and talk about CET1, where, as you can see, our capital remains strong as our CET1 level improved to $180 billion and our CET1 ratio improved 25 basis points to 11.2%. That means in the past 2 quarters, we've improved our CET1 ratio by 74 basis points as we've added to our management buffer on top of both our current and 2024 requirements.\nSo we can walk through the drivers of the CET1 ratio this quarter, and you can see earnings net of preferred dividends generated 43 basis points, common dividends used 11 basis points, and gross share repurchases used 6 basis points. And while the balance sheet was down, loan growth drove a modest increase in RWA using 3 basis points of CET1. So we were able to support our loan growth and return capital and add to our capital buffer in the same quarter.\nLet's spend a minute on the loan growth by focusing on average loans on Slide 15. And here, you can see average loans grew 10% year-over-year, driven by credit card and commercial loan improvement. On a more near-term linked-quarter basis, loans grew at a slower 2% annualized pace just driven by credit card.\nThe credit card growth reflects increased marketing, enhanced offers and reopening of our financial centers, delivering higher levels of account openings. Mortgage balances were up modestly year-over-year, and linked quarter were driven by slower prepayments. Commercial growth reflects a good balance of Global Markets lending as well as commercial real estate and to a lesser degree, custom lending in our Private Bank and Merrill businesses.\nTurning to Slide 16 and net interest income. On a GAAP, non-FTE basis, NII in Q4 was $14.7 billion, and the FTE NII number was $14.8 billion. Focusing on FTE, net interest income increased $3.3 billion from Q4 of '21 or 29% driven by a few notable components.\nFirst, nearly $3.6 billion of the year-over-year improvement in NII was driven by interest rates. Year-over-year, the average Fed funds rates has increased 359 basis points, driving up the interest earned on our variable rate assets. Relative to that Fed funds move, the rate paid on our total deposits increased 59 basis points to 62. And focusing just on interest-bearing deposit rates paid, the increase is 91.\nSo even while Fed funds rates have increased 140 basis points more than the last cycle, at this point, our cumulative pass-through percentage rates still remain lower in this cycle. That includes an increase in the pass-through rates in the past 90 days due to the unprecedented period of rate hikes.\nIncluded in the rate benefit was $1 billion improvement in the quarterly securities premium amortization. Long-term interest rates on mortgages have increased 345 basis points from the fourth quarter of '21, which has driven down refinancing of mortgage assets and therefore, slowed the recognition of premium amortization expense recognized in our securities portfolio.\nThe second contributor is loan growth net of securities paydowns, and that's added nearly $400 million to the year-over-year improvement. And lastly, partially offsetting the banking book NII growth just described was higher funding costs for our Global Markets inventory.\nNow that is passed on to clients through our noninterest market-making line, so it's revenue neutral to both sales and trading and to total revenue. And as you can see in our material, Global Markets NII is down $660 million year-over-year.\nOkay. Turning to a linked quarter discussion. NII is up $933 million from the third quarter driven largely by interest rates. That $933 million increase included a $372 million decline in our Global Markets NII. The net interest yield was 2.22%, and that improved 55 basis points from the fourth quarter of '21. Nearly 30% of that improvement occurred in the most recent quarter with the primary driver being the benefit from higher interest rates, which includes a 13 basis point benefit from lower premium amortization. As you will note, excluding Global Markets, our net interest yield was up 89 basis points to 2.81%.\nLooking forward, I would make a couple of comments. As I do every quarter, let me provide the important caveats regarding our NII guidance. Our caveats include assumptions that interest rates in the forward curve materialize, and we anticipate card loans will decline seasonally from holiday spend paydowns. And otherwise, we expect modest loan growth. We expect a seasonal decline in Global Banking deposits and that the other deposit mix shifts experienced in Q4 may continue into the first quarter in the face of more rate hikes.\nWe also expect the funding cost for Global Markets to continue to increase based on higher rates. And as noted, the impact of that is recognized and offset in noninterest income, so it's revenue neutral. So starting with the fourth quarter NII of $14.8 billion. And assuming a decline of roughly $300 million of Global Markets NII in Q1, which would be similar to the fourth quarter decline, that would get us to a Q1 number around $14.5 billion. In addition, we have to factor in 2 less days of interest, which is about $250 million. So that would lower our starting point to $14.25 billion.\nWe believe the core banking book will continue to show the benefit of rates and other elements and can offset most of the day count. So we're expecting Q1 NII to be somewhere around $14.4 billion. Beyond Q1, with increases in rates slowing and if balances continue their recent stabilization trends, expect less variability in NII for the balance of 2023.\nOkay. Let's turn to expense, and we'll use Slide 17 for the discussion. Q4 expenses were $15.5 billion, and they were up $240 million from Q3, driven by an increase in our people and technology costs. In addition, we also saw higher costs from our continued return to work and travel and cost of client engagement. We've seen pent-up demand for our teams gathering back together in person to drive collaboration and to spend more time with our clients.\nInflationary pressures continued, but our operational excellence improvements as well as the benefits of a more digitized customer base helped offset those pressures. Our headcount this quarter increased by 3,600 from Q3. And as we faced increased attrition in 2022, our teams were quite successful in their hiring efforts to continue to support customers. As the attrition slowed in the fall, our accelerated pace of hiring outpaced attrition, leaving us with growth in our headcount.\nAs we look forward to next quarter, I would just remind everyone that Q1 typically includes $400 million to $500 million in seasonally elevated payroll taxes. And Q1 will also be the first quarter to include the costs of the late October announcement by regulators of higher FDIC insurance costs.\nAnd as a result of holding the leadership share in U.S. retail deposits, that will add $125 million to each of our quarterly costs or a total of $500 million for the year. We expect these things will put expenses around $16 billion in the first quarter before expectations that they should trend back down again over the course of 2023.\nOn asset quality, we highlight credit quality metrics on Slide 18 for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. And since Brian already covered much of the topics on asset quality, I'm going to move to a discussion of our line of business results, starting with consumer on Slide 19.\nBrian noted the earlier organic growth across checking accounts, card accounts, and investments were strong again this quarter, and that's as a result of many years of retooling and continuous investments in the business. So let me offer some highlights.\nAt this point, we have the leading retail deposit market share. We have leadership positions among the most important products for consumers, and we're the leading digital bank with convenient capabilities for consumer and small business clients. We also have a leading online consumer investment platform and a great small business platform offering for our clients.\nAnd importantly, when you combine all these capabilities with improved service, at this point, customer satisfaction is now at all-time highs. And we produced another strong quarter of results in Consumer Banking that resulted in $12.5 billion in net income in 2022.\nFor the quarter, Consumer Banking earned $3.6 billion on good organic growth and delivered its seventh consecutive quarter of operating leverage while we continue to invest for the future. Note that our top line grew 21%, while expense grew 8%. The earnings impact of 21% year-over-year revenue growth was partially offset by an increase in provision expense, and that provision increase reflects reserve builds this period compared to a reserve release in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nNet charge-offs increased as a result of the card charge-offs that Brian noted earlier. While this quarter's reported earnings were up 15% year-over-year, pretax, pre-provision income grew an even stronger 36% year-over-year. So that highlights the earnings improvement without the impact of the reserve actions.\nRevenue improvement reflects the fuller value of our deposit base as well as deepening with our deposit relationships. I'd note the growth also includes a decline in service charges of $335 million year-over-year as our insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes were in full effect by the end of Q2 of this year.\nAnd as a result of those policy changes, we continue to benefit from the better overall customer satisfaction and the corresponding lower attrition and the lower costs associated with fewer customer complaint calls, obviously, as a result of fewer fees.\nThe 8% increase in expenses reflects business investments for growth, including people and technology, along with costs related to reopening the business to fuller capacity. And remember, much of the company's minimum wage hikes and quarter 2 increased salary and wage moves impacts Consumer Banking the most of our lines of business and therefore, impacts most the year-over-year comparisons.\nWe also continued our investment in financial centers. For the year, we opened 58 and we renovated 784 more. And against all of that, both digital banking and operational excellence helped us to pay for investments, and that allowed us to improve the efficiency ratio to 47%, an impressive 600 basis point improvement over the year ago period.\nBefore moving away from Consumer Banking, I want to note some differences that highlight just how much more effectively and efficiently this business is running since even just before the pandemic. It's easy to lose sight of how well this business is operating from an already strong position in 2019. And you can see some of the stats on Slide 17 in the appendix.\nWe can best summarize by noting we've got $318 billion more in deposits; 10% more checking customers, 92% of whom are primary; 28% more investment accounts. And absent the card divestitures, we've increased the amount of new card accounts by 4%, and our payment volumes are 36% higher. We're servicing those customers with 387 fewer financial centers because of our digital capabilities, and it's allowed us to need 10% fewer people to run the business.\nOur combined credit and debit spend was up 35%. Digital sales increased 77%, and we sent and received 3x the number of Zelle transactions. All of this allowed us to run the business with fewer employees and lower our cost of deposits ratio below 120 basis points.\nMoving to Slide 20. Wealth management produced strong results, earning $1.2 billion on good revenue and 29% profit margin. This led to full year records for both revenue and net income of $21.7 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. This was an especially good result given the nearly unprecedented negative returns of both the equity and the bond markets at the same time this year.\nThe volatility and generally lower market levels put pressure on certain revenues in this business again in Q4, but what helps differentiate Merrill and the Private Bank is a strong banking business at scale with $324 billion of deposits and $224 billion of loans. So despite a 14% decline in asset under management and brokerage fees year-over-year, we saw revenues hold flat with the fourth quarter of '21.\nOur talented group of wealth advisers, coupled with powerful digital capabilities, generated 8,500 net new households in Merrill in the fourth quarter, while the Private Bank gained an impressive 550 net new high net worth relationships in the quarter. Both were up nicely from net household generation in 2021.\nWe added $20 billion of loans in this business since Q4 of '21, growing 10% and marking the 51st consecutive quarter of average loan growth in the business despite securities-based lending reductions related to the current market environment. That's consistent and sustained performance by the teams. Our expenses declined 1%, driven by lower revenue-related incentives, partially offset by investments in our business.\nMoving to Global Banking on Slide 21. And you can see the business earned $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter on record revenues of $6.4 billion, pretty remarkable given the decline in investment banking fees during this year.\nLower investment banking fees, higher credit costs and a modest increase in expenses were mostly offset by stronger NII and other fees. So overall, revenue grew 9%, reflecting the value of our Global Transaction Service business to our clients and our associated revenue growth, while investment banking fees declined a little more than 50%.\nThe company's overall investment banking fees were $1.1 billion in Q4, declining $1.3 billion year-over-year in a continued tough market. Still, we increased our ranking in overall fees for the full year 2022 to #3 as we've continued to invest in the business.\nThe $612 million increase in provision expense reflected a modest reserve build of $37 million in the fourth quarter compared to a $435 million release in the year ago period, and pretax, pre-provision income grew 13% year-over-year. Expense increased 4% year-over-year, and that was driven by strategic investments in the business. including hiring and technology.\nSwitching to Global Markets on Slide 22. And as we usually do, I'll talk about the segment results, excluding DVA. You can see our fourth quarter record results were a very strong finish to a good year. The continued themes of inflation, geopolitical tensions and central banks changing monetary policies around the globe continue to drive volatility in both bond and equity markets and repositioning from our clients. And as a result, it was another quarter that favored macro trading, while our credit trading businesses improved also. Spreads fared better than the prior year.\nOur fourth quarter net income of $650 million reflects a good quarter of sales and trading revenue partially offset by lower shares of investment banking revenue. And it's worth noting that this net income excludes $193 million of DVA losses this quarter as a result of our own credit spread movements. Reported net income was $504 million.\nFocusing on year-over-year, sales and trading contributed $3.7 billion to revenue, and that improved 27%. That's a new fourth quarter record for this business, besting the previous one by 21%. And at $16.5 billion in sales and trading for the year, it marked the best in more than a decade. FICC improved 49%, while equities was up 1% compared to the quarter a year ago. And the FICC improvement was primarily driven by growth in our macro products, while credit products also improved from a weaker Q4 '21 environment.\nWe've been investing continuously over the past year in our macro businesses. We've identified those as opportunities for us. And again, we've been rewarded for that this quarter. Year-over-year expense increased about 10% primarily driven by investments in the business.\nFinally, on Slide 23, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $689 million, and that was consistent with the year ago period. For the quarter, the effective tax rate was approximately 10%, benefiting from ESG investment tax credits and certain discrete tax benefits. Excluding those discrete items, our tax rate would have been 12.5%. And further adjusting for the tax credits, it would have been 25%. Our full year GAAP tax rate was 11%, and we would not expect 2023 to be a lot different.\nSo with that, we'll stop here, and we'll open it up, please, for Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note this call may be recorded, and I will be standing by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead.\n\nE. Lee McEntire\n\nHead of IR, Bank of America Corporation\n\nThank you, Katherine. Good morning. Welcome. Hope everyone has had a good weekend. Thank you for joining the call to review our third quarter results. I hope everyone has had -- also had a chance to review our earnings documents released earlier this morning.\nAs always, they're available, including the earnings presentation that Brian and Alastair will refer to during the call on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. I'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments, and then I'll ask Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, to cover the details of the quarter.\nBefore I turn the call over to Brian, I'll just remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and they're subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and the SEC filings that are available on the website.\nInformation about non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials that are available on the website and in the docs. So with that, I will turn it over to you, Brian. Thank you.\n\nBrian Thomas Moynihan\n\nChairman & CEO, Bank of America Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. I want to start by sending our thoughts to the impacted areas from the devastation of the recent storms, especially our impacted teammates and their families. Our teams remain busy assisting those clients and associates in the impacted areas. So we're going to start on Slide 2 of the earnings materials.\nThis quarter, Bank of America reported $7.1 billion in net income or $0.81 per diluted share. We grew revenue 8% year-over-year. We delivered our fifth straight quarter of operating leverage. Every business segment delivered operating leverage. This takes us back to our 5-year run before the pandemic. The highlights of this quarter were also once again marked by good organic customer activity. This was coupled with a significant increase in net interest income. In addition, the teams adapted well to our new capital requirements. And as a result, our common equity Tier 1 ratio or CET1 ratio improved by nearly 50 basis points to 11%, moving 60 basis points above its current minimums.\nThe decline from prior year reported net income and EPS comparisons reflect a reserve build versus reserve release from last year. At the same time, however, our asset quality remains strong as net charge-offs and several other metrics, in fact, improved from the second quarter 2022. Pretax, pre-provision income grew 10% year-over-year. From a return perspective, we produced a 15% ROTCE and a 90 basis point ROA.\nOur efficiency ratio this quarter dropped to 62%, taking up the litigation, it would have been 61%. So even while investing in marketing and people and technology and physical plan, the team continues to drive operational excellence. An easy way to think about this is we currently operate Bank of America with less people than we had in 2015, 7 years ago.\nLet's go to Slide 3. Those continued investments over the past several years in our people, tools and resources for our customers and teammates as well as our new and renovated financial centers have allowed us to continually enhance the customer experience and fuel organic growth as we drive responsible growth.\nIn the third quarter alone, we added more than 400,000 plus net new consumer checking accounts. We added 1.3 million new credit card accounts. We added 100,000 new funded investment accounts in our consumer business. Customers are finding increasingly convenient to access us. Digital users grew to 56 million. Logins by those users cleared 3 billion in the past quarter, 1 billion per month.\nErica surpassed 1 billion interactions since it was introduced 4 years ago this quarter. It has become a primary interaction method for our clients with more than 130 million interactions this quarter alone. When you look at our sales, 48% of third quarter sales are digital, a 36% year-over-year increase. This occurred even as we fully reopened our financial centers and had our teammates also selling.\nNow once again, you can find all these digital statistics and more in the appendix of our earnings material as usual. I encourage you look at those statistics, where every [wanted lines of business], not just consumer. They compare favorably to the competitive measures that we see because when we see people actually publish their numbers. At the same time, 27 million customers visit our financial center in the quarter. This highlights importance of having both high-touch and high-tech approach. In the wealth management business, we added 400 advisers this quarter.\nOur advisers added nearly 6,000 new households in the Merrill and Private Bank areas. We saw a solid net flows despite the turbulence of markets. 80% of our GWIM customers are digitally active. 30% the new Merrill accounts are open digitally. That, combined with our consumer investments business has seen more than $100 billion of net acquired flows year-to-date.\nWe continue to see increased activity both in investments as well as the banking products in this area. This quarter, GWIM opened a record number of bank accounts. GWIM also saw its 50th consecutive quarter of average loan growth. The banking capabilities and success differentiates our platform. The business grew revenue, delivered operating leverage and saw a record pretax, pre-provision growth, even in choppy markets.\nAs we turn to Global Banking, ending loan balances were down linked quarter. However, we did see solid production in this area, and that was offset by client paydowns, decreasing the value of 400 nominated loans and loans sold to manage our risk-weighted assets. which helped us build the capital levels I talked about earlier. As we look at global markets, the team had a strong third quarter in sales and trading performance.\nIn fact, the third quarter of 2022 was the strongest since the third quarter of 2010. It grew 13% from last year. It was led by strong performance in our macro FICC business, which has benefited by investments made over the past year. We had no trading loss days this quarter. Let me also make a few points using the customer activity highlighted on the continued resilience of Bank of America's broad customer base.\nSo if you look at Slide 4, you can see some points about the overall health that demonstrate what's going on in the customer base. Let me make a couple of key points. First, consumers continue to spend at strong levels. Second, consumer customer average deposit levels for September 2022, remain at multiples of the pre-pandemic levels. You can see that in the lower right. Third, there's plenty of capacity for borrowing as credit and card balances of BAC are still 12% both pre-pandemic levels, and the payment rates on those credit cards are 1,000 basis points over pre-pandemic levels.\nSo on spending a couple thoughts. A perspicacious analyst might wonder whether [talk of] inflation recession and other factors would fructify in a slower spending growth. We just don't see here at Bank of America. Year-to-date spending of $3.1 trillion through September is up 12% compared to last year. Second, as you look across the period, you can see in the trend of year-over-year spending.\nAs we entered the pandemic, we saw spending decline in click of recover than grow across the quarters. And while still strong in September 10%, spending growth has slowed just a bit from the 12% year-to-date pace, which shows you that early in the year was a faster year-over-year growth rate, but still strong. In the first 2 weeks of October show that strength is still growing at 10%.\nIt's notable that this isn't just inflation that is driving spending as a transaction are up single digits year-over-year pretty consistently. You'll also note on the bottom left, the continued growth in goods and services, particularly retail toward experiences on travel and entertainment. While fuel price volatility continues, it is not currently impacting the spend levels in this quarter as prices stabilize.\nOn the level of customer liquidity -- the level of customer liquidity remains strong. Average deposit balances of our consumer customer remained at high levels relative to a year ago. These balances are still multiples of the pre-pandemic periods, and they were largely unchanged at these elevated amounts for the month of September.\nThese deposit levels suggest continued capacity of spending at healthy levels.\nOn Slide 5, we show you as we did last quarter, some other stats about resiliency. As you can see, whether you look at early or late-stage card delinquencies, they all remain well below our pre-pandemic levels. These are decades-old lows, and we're just now seeing gradual move off these lows and early-stage delinquencies.\nLate-stage delinquencies are still 40% below pre-pandemic levels. Keep in mind, asset quality metrics were strong even before the pandemic. On this page, what you see is a 30 [to 90] day card delinquencies. If you compare them against the average for the past 5 years leading up to the pandemic, a period of growth and unemployment falling. Those averages of 183 basis points and 91 basis points, respectively.\nSo the current ratio of delinquencies have to be worse than 30% or more even approach that 5-year pre-pandemic average at a time of economic growth and falling unemployment. So consumers remain resilient. Let me take a couple of minutes to talk to you quickly about the balance sheet, and I'll turn it over to Alastair. As you think about loan and deposit balances in general, we're seeing what we expected as monetary policy tightens.\nOn deposits, we see clients with excess liquidity looking for yield without being the global banking movements, you can see from moving from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing accounts, or in our Wealth Management business, where we saw clients shift out of brokerage sweeps into preferred deposits or other investment products like treasuries that we offer. But if you look at our core customer base, where the transactional balances drive the outcome.\nWe are seeing steady balances driven by new account activity and a good value proposition we have for our customers. When you think about loans, consumer loan balance growth was led by card and reflects increased market and continued reopening of financial centers building high levels of new customer relationships.\nOn commercial, the average loans rose $16 billion linked quarter or 12% annualized. We did see a modest ending balance decline as good loan production was offset by the sale of syndication of $3 billion of loans and also by $4 billion in negative foreign currency impacts. We obviously took activity on balance sheet optimization, which helped our RWA discussion -- helped [these] RWAs and led to the capital levels I talked about earlier.\nWe have provided an update in the appendix as to the credit transformation of our loan portfolio and a few other consumer credit slides that help illustrate the quality of our portfolio under years of responsible growth. We update those slides again this quarter to show you them and you can find in an appendix, and I recommend them to you.\nSo in summary, client activity remains good. NII has improved quickly and a customer's resilience and health remains strong. We've also managed our expenses very well. We drove operating leverage. The team managed the balance sheet well and improved capital either increased our dividend and bought back a modest amount of shares. We call that responsible growth.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Alastair.\n\nAlastair M. Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America Corporation\n\nThank you, Brian. And I'll start by adding a little more detail on the income statement and refer you to Slide 6 highlights. You can see here revenue of $24.5 billion grew 8% with NII improving 24% year-over-year, while our fees declined to 8%. And I'll cover the NII improvement in just a moment. On noninterest income, the volatility and the levels of market activity drove a year-over-year decline in investment banking and asset management fees, while sales and trading benefited from investments made in the business and the volatile market conditions.\nAdditionally, service charges moved lower for 2 reasons. First, in consumer, we completed the sweeping changes around insufficient funds and overdraft in June marking a 90% reduction from June of 2021. Second, our corporate service charges declined as earned credit rates increased for clients and that overwhelmed organic growth in the gross fees associated with treasury management services performed for our clients.\nExpenses this quarter were $15.3 billion, and they included the settlement of our last large remaining legacy monoline insurance litigation. As you likely saw on October 7, we filed the 8-K announcing a settlement that resolved all of the outstanding litigation with Ambac, and that dates all the way back to the 2008 financial crisis.\nWe recorded $354 million in litigation expense this quarter above previous accruals for payment of the settlement. And without that litigation cost, our expense would have been just below the $15 billion mark.\nOkay. Let's move to the balance sheet and we'll look at Slide 7, where you can see during the quarter, the balance sheet declined $38 billion to $3.07 trillion, driven by a $46 billion decline in deposits and coupled with a $53 billion decline in securities.\nOur average liquidity portfolio declined in the quarter reflecting the decrease in deposits and security levels. At $941 billion, our liquidity still remains $365 billion above pre-pandemic levels, just to give you an idea of just how much our liquidity has increased. Shareholders' equity was stable with the second quarter at $270 billion as earnings were offset by capital distributed to shareholders and the change in AOCI from rate moves.\nWe paid out $1.8 billion in common dividends. We bought back $450 million in gross share repurchases, and that covered our employee issuances in the quarter, leaving no dilutive impact for shareholders. AOCI declined $4.4 billion as a result of the increase in loan rates, and we saw the impact primarily in 2 ways.\nFirst, we had a reduction from a change in the value of our AFS debt securities. That was $1.1 billion, and that impacted CET1. Second, rates also drove a $3.7 billion decline in AOCI from derivatives, and that does not impact CET1 that reflects cash flow hedges mostly put in place last year against some of our variable rate loans, and that protected us against CET1.\nWith regard to regulatory capital, our supplemental leverage ratio increased to 5.8% versus our minimum requirement of 5%, which still leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth and our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements.\nOkay. Let's go to CET1 waterfall on Slide 8, and we can talk about that. As you'll recall back in -- last quarter, we talked about our June CCAR results, where our stress capital buffer increased from 2.5% to 3.4%. And that increased our overall CET1 ratio minimum requirement from $9.5 to $10.4 million as of the beginning of the fourth quarter.\nOur capital levels today remains strong with $176 billion of CET1 and through the good work of our teams, we improved our CET1 ratio by 49 basis points compared to June 30, taking us to 11%. That leaves us well above our new 10.4% minimum requirement. So we'll walk through the drivers this quarter.\nFirst, it's $6.6 billion of earners net of preferred dividends and that generated 40 basis points of capital. And then also importantly, through optimization of the balance sheet, we managed our RWA balances down and that added 26 basis points more of capital ratio improvement. Dividends used 11 basis points of capital.\nAnd this quarter, the movement in treasury and mortgage-backed securities rates caused the fair value of our AFS debt securities to decrease, and that lowered our CET1 ratio by 7 basis points. We remain well positioned for the rate movement because of the hedge of a large portion of this portfolio continuing to protect us from AOCI movements while benefiting NII since swap to floating.\nSo we feel like our teams rose to the challenge well this quarter in terms of increased capital requirements.\nOn Slide 9, we've laid out average loans and looking at those loans and providing a bit more detail on a year-over-year basis, you can see 12% average growth as commercial loans grew 17% and consumer loans grew 7%, within consumer credit card grew 12%.\nFocusing on more near-term growth versus the second quarter of '22, our average total loans grew 8% on an annualized basis, led by 12% annualized commercial loan growth and 21% annualized credit card growth, while other consumer loans were relatively flat linked quarter.\nThis slower linked quarter growth included 2 notable impacts that Brian mentioned. We saw good commercial loan demand, and we also saw FX valuations adjustments as a result of the strong dollar and then some loan sales and syndications that lowered our RWAs. Partially offsetting some of the strong card growth in consumer loans, we sold about $1 billion of residential mortgage loans. Adjusting for the FX impact and loan sales loan growth from Q2 was closer to the industry's growth rate.\nLet's focus now on deposits using Slide 10. And you can see there that our average deposits year-over-year are up 1% at $1.96 trillion. The noninterest-bearing deposits are down 3%, while the interest-bearing are up 4%.\nSo overall, we grew our deposits. And as you would expect in a rising rate environment, we've seen some shifts from noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing, and it's important to understand the makeup of these moves. In consumer, our total deposits are up 7% year-over-year. These are core and foundational elements of the customers' financial activities.\nAnd we've seen growth in both noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing balances and we remain very disciplined on $1.1 trillion of total consumer deposits while Fed funds is now at 3.25%. So customers see the value in their total relationship with us through their personalized cloud engagement and our industry-leading digital capabilities and rewards.\nWe expect that to continue. Do we expect deposit rates to increase? Yes, of course, and we will remain both disciplined and competitive, and that is built into our asset sensitivity. On a linked quarter basis, our consumer deposits moved lower by less than 1%. In Wealth Management, total deposits are flat year-over-year. And again, it's important to understand that as expected, these are the clients who generally have more excess liquidity and have historically saw higher rates, both in deposit accounts as well as movements outside of deposits where we offer alternatives for those clients.\nWhile flat year-over-year. Within that, we saw a $12 billion decline in year-over-year average deposits on our brokerage platform with some shifts from sweeps to preferred deposits within the platform. Meanwhile, Merrill bank deposits and deposits with Private Bank have grown $12 billion. The higher-tiered preferred deposit products represent a little more than 20% of the mix of deposits and they're moving largely in line with short-term rates, while the other 80% or so deposit products are paying much lower rates.\nOn a linked quarter basis, we sell total GWIM deposits declined by 7%, further highlighting these trends. In Global Banking, we hold about $500 billion in customer deposits, and we saw a 7% year-over-year decline. In a rising rate environment, where excess balances can be more expensive, we typically see some runoff, particularly in high liquidity environments as clients both use cash for inventory build and begin to manage their cash for yield.\nAnd we've seen the mix of interest-bearing deposits moved from 30% a year ago to nearly 35%, and we're paying an increased rate on those interest-bearing deposits. Pricing is largely customer by customer based on the depth of relationship and many other factors. And again, we're not really seeing anything unexpected here. Betas at this point are still favorable to the last cycle.\nAnd as we would just note, relative to the last cycle, the Fed increases have been pretty rapid, and we'd expect to pay higher rates as we continue to move through this rate cycle. It's probably too early to say right now. If at the end of that cycle, the percentage of those rate pass-throughs will be similar to the last cycle.\nTurning to Slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q3 was $13.8 billion, and the FTE NII number is $13.9 million. Focusing on FTE, net interest income increased $2.7 billion from Q3 '21 or 24%, and that's driven by benefits from higher interest rates, including lower premium amortization and from loan growth. Versus the second quarter, NII is up $1.3 billion, driven largely by the same factors plus an additional day of interest in the quarter.\nYear-over-year now, average short-term interest rates have increased 200-plus basis points, driving up the interest earned on our variable rate assets while we've maintained discipline on our deposit pricing, and that has driven nearly $1 billion of improvement. Long-term interest rates on mortgages have increased even more than short-term rates, and that's improving fixed rate asset replacement and driving down refinancing of mortgage assets therefore, slowing the recognition of premium amortization recognized in our securities portfolio.\nYear-over-year, that premium amortization has improved $1 billion. And additionally, lower securities balances over the past 6 months modestly offset the benefits of year-over-year loan growth. The net interest yield was 2.06% and that improved 38 basis points from the third quarter of '21. And 20 basis points of that improvement occurred in the most recent quarter.\nAnd as you will note, excluding Global Markets activities, our net interest yield was 2.51% this quarter. Looking forward, as it relates to NII guidance, I'd like to make a couple of comments. And first, I need to make a couple of caveats. Our guidance is going to assume interest rates in the most recent forward curve and that they materialize that we see modest loan growth and modest deposit balance changes with market-based deposit pricing increasing baked in.\nWith that said, we expect NII in Q4 to be at least $1.25 billion higher than Q3. So last quarter when we were together, we told you we expected to see consecutive NII increases of about $1 billion in Q3 and another $1 billion in Q4. And that would make a total of $2 billion in Q3 and Q4 given we just put up $1.3 billion in Q3 and that outperformance and refreshing our expectation for Q4 at $1.25 billion.\nWe're now saying that aggregate quarterly improvement won't be the $2 billion we initially thought, it's increased to around $2.6 billion or more. Turning to asset sensitivity and focusing on a forward yield basis. At September 30, declined $0.7 billion to $4.2 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months, with now roughly 95% of the sensitivity driven by short rates. And on a spot basis, our sensitivity to 100 basis point instantaneous rate hike would be $5.3 billion.\nOkay. Let's turn to expense, and we'll use Slide 12 for the discussion. Third quarter expenses were $15.3 billion and were flat with the second quarter as litigation costs for our settlement in Q3 nearly offset the fines agreed to last quarter on a comparative basis. And it's nice to bring resolution to these matters. Without the costs associated with the resolutions in both periods, expenses would have been just less than $15 billion.\nWe continue to make steady investments in our people, technology, marketing and financial centers and what allows us to help pay for these investments of the operational process improvements we've talked about and the increased digital adoption rates by our customers and by our bankers. Our headcount this quarter increased by 3,500 and if we adjust for the release of our summer and turns our headcounts actually up by closer to 5,500.\nWe welcomed 1,800 new full-time associates from college campuses around the world into our company this quarter and we hired another 3,800 net new people on top of that. That included just less than 3,000 across our various lines of business and another 1,000 in staff and support and technology positions to support those lines of business. And with all the great benefits and talented people already at this company and with our great brand, it highlights that Bank of America is a great place to work.\nAs we look forward, we'd expect our fourth quarter expenses will land our full year reported expense at approximately $61 billion. That obviously includes the cost noted for resolving in the second quarter and third quarter regulatory and litigation matters. So without that, our expenses are expected to be a little more than the $60 billion level we talked about earlier in the year.\nAnd we're proud of our team's discipline around expense particularly in this inflationary environment, while at the same time, we're modestly increasing our level of investment in the company's future and our growth. Turning to asset quality on Slide 13, and I want to start by saying just as Brian did the asset quality of our customers remains very healthy.\nThe net charge-offs of $520 million declined $51 million from the second quarter, that decline was driven by prior period charge-offs associated with the sale of some noncore mortgage loans we discussed last quarter. Absent those losses, net charge-offs were relatively stable with the prior period.\nProvision expense was $898 million in the third quarter, and that was $375 million higher than the second quarter. And we built $378 million of reserve in the period compared to a modest release in Q2. The reserve build in the quarter primarily reflects good credit card loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook.\nEven as we build our resources for the future, this quarter, we saw many of our asset quality metrics continued to show modest improvement as NPLs and reservable criticized both declined from Q2, and you can see that in the supplement.\nOn Slide 14, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. And there's only one point I want to make, looking at this slide and that is delinquencies because our consumer delinquencies remain well below pre-pandemic levels. And as Brian noted earlier, we're watching closely the early-stage card delinquencies as they begin to increase modestly. Lastly, the recent hurricane Ian impacted some areas where we have strong market shares for many of our businesses, and our teams have spent the past days assessing the damages and insurance coverage down to the loan level.\nAnd we've already incorporated that analysis into our reserves for the quarter. We compared our analysis to other large storms in recent years like Sandy, Harvey and Irma where we incurred just a small amount of financial losses.\nTurning to the business segments. Let's start with Consumer Banking on Slide 15. And Brian shared earlier, we've got organic growth across the checking accounts card accounts and investments picking up this quarter, not necessarily because of anything we're doing differently in the past 90 days, but as a result of many years of retooling and continuously investing in the business.\nWe have the leading retail deposit market share. We have leadership positions among all of the important products. We're the leading digital bank with tremendous convenient capabilities for consumer and small business clients. We've got a leading online consumer investment platform and the best small business platform offering for our clients. So as a result, customer satisfaction is now at all-time highs, and that is helping us to drive strong financial results.\nThe Consumer Bank earned $3.1 billion on good organic growth and delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of operating leverage while we continued heavy investments for the future. The impact of strong year-over-year revenue growth of 12% was partially offset by an increase in provision expense.\nAnd the provision increase reflected reserve builds this period, mostly for card growth versus a reserve release in the third quarter of '21, our net charge-offs remain low and stable. While reported earnings were only modestly up year-over-year. Pretax, pre-provision income grew 12% year-over-year which highlights the earnings improvement coming through without the impact of the reserve actions.\nCard revenue was solid and increased modestly year-over-year as spending benefits were mostly offset by higher rewards costs. Service charges were down $338 million year-over-year as our insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes were in full effect now by the end of Q2. And because of the scale of the business and the diverse revenue, we fully absorbed that revenue impact and are now benefiting from the benefits of overall customer satisfaction, lower attrition in our client base and lower cost associated with fewer customer complaint calls associated with less nuisance fees.\nExpense increased 11% from business investments for growth, including people, digital and marketing along with costs related to opening the business to fuller capacity. Much of the company's increased salary and wage moves in the quarter impact Consumer Banking the most. We also continued our investment in financial centers, opening another 16 in the quarter while we renovated nearly 200 more. Both digital banking and operational process improvements are helping to pay for those investments.\nAnd as revenue grew, we've improved the efficiency ratio to 51%.\nMoving to Slide 16. Wealth Management produced strong results, earning $1.2 billion, and that's a particularly strong result given both equity and bond market levels. If they remain unchanged for the rest of the year, this would be only the first time since 1976, that both equity and bond markets were down for the year.\nNow the volatility and generally lower market levels have put pressure on revenue in this business. And what's helping to differentiate Merrill and the Private Bank right now is a strong banking business. In this case to the tune of $339 billion of deposits and $224 billion of loans. So while many of our brokerage peers faced declines in revenue and margin, we've seen year-over-year revenue growth of 2% and and a margin of 29%, driving the sixth straight quarter of operating leverage.\nAnd we saw enough revenue growth from banking products in Q3 that more than offset declines in assets under management and brokerage fees. Our talented group of financial advisers, coupled with our powerful digital capabilities, allowed modern Merrill to gain 5,200 net new households and the Private Bank gained 550 more in the quarter, both up nicely from net household generation in 2021.\nWe added $24 billion of loans since Q3 of '21, growing 12% and this marked our 50th consecutive quarter of average loans growth in the business, consistent and sustained performance. Assets under management flows were $4 billion in the quarter and $42 billion since this time last year. Expenses increased 2%, driven by continued client-facing hiring and higher other employee-related costs as our advisers are increasing their in-person engagement with clients, and that's partially offset by lower revenue-related incentives.\nOn Slide 17, you'll see our Global Banking results, where we earned $2 billion in Q3 on strong revenue growth as higher NII and more than offset lower noninterest income. Earnings were down year-over-year, driven in large part by the absence of a prior period reserve release. Our 7% revenue growth is quite healthy given the more than 40% decline in investment banking fees, coupled with lower leasing revenue.\nWhile the company's overall investment banking fees declined $1 billion year-over-year in a continued tough market, investment banking fees did improve modestly from Q2 and and the teams did a nice job of holding on to our #3 ranking in overall fees in a tough environment. Otherwise, in fees, we saw a decline in corporate service charges as enterprise credit rates rose with increased rates, and that outpaced the growth in gross treasury service fees generated from new and existing clients.\nI'd also remind you the GTS benefits greatly from the NII off of deposits that more than offsets this. So our year-over-year total GTS revenue was up 44%. We also had lower leasing related revenue comparatively. The provision expense increase reflected a reserve build of $144 million in Q3 '22 compared to a $789 million release in the year ago period.\nAnd with regard to expenses, they increased 5% year-over-year, driven by continued investments in the business. For example, in Commercial Banking, our strategic hiring over the years has just continued to increase our client and prospect calling efforts.\nSwitching to Global Markets on Slide 18. And as we usually do, we'll talk about segment results, excluding DVA. Inflation, continued geopolitical tensions and the changing monetary policies of central banks around the world continue to drive volatility in both the bond and equity markets. As a result, it's another quarter that favored macro trading while credit trading businesses faced the continued challenging market environment with wider spreads and recession concerns.\nSo the third quarter net income of $1.1 billion reflects a good quarter of sales and trading revenue. Focusing on year-over-year. Sales & Trading contributed $4.1 billion to revenue, improving 13%. FICC improved 27% while equities declined 4%. The FICC improvement was primarily driven by growth in our macro products, while our credit traded products were down. And we've been investing heavily over the past year in several macro businesses that we identified as opportunities for us, and we were rewarded this quarter.\nThe decline in equities was driven by lower client activity in Asia and weaker performance in cash, partially offset by good performance in derivatives where we saw increased client activity. Year-over-year expense declined reflecting the absence of costs associated with the realignment of liquidating business activity that we took in the fourth quarter of '21, and the business generated a 10% return in the third quarter.\nFinally, on Slide 19, we show all other, which reported a loss of $281 million, declining from the year ago period, driven by the litigation settlement that I noted earlier and higher tax expense. On income tax expense, I just want to mention one thing that made our tax rate a little higher this quarter, and that is with the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, among other things that incorporated, there was a change that allowed solar energy investments to elect production tax credits versus upfront investment tax credits.\nAnd those production tax credits have the potential to earn more credits over the expected life of the production facility. So as a result, our third quarter tax expense is approximately $150 million higher due to the net reversal of tax credits accrued for 2022 solar deals taken in the first half of 2022 that were recognized under initial investment tax credits at the time and we were placed with production tax credits.\nSo a little impact this quarter that net benefit to the shareholder over time. This drove the effective tax rate a little higher this quarter to more than 14% and still obviously benefiting from our ESG investment tax credits. And excluding the impact of ESG tax credits, tax rate would have been approximately 24%.\nGiven the change noted for solar investments, we expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be similar to the third quarter tax rate and will examine the further effects of these changes and how they impact full year 2023 and report on that next quarter. And with that, I'm going to stop there and open up for Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this call may be recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Lee McEntire.\n\nE. Lee McEntire\n\nHead of IR, Bank of America Corporation\n\nGood morning, and welcome. Happy Monday, and thank you for joining the call to review Bank of America's second quarter results. I hope everyone's had a chance to review our earnings release documents. As always, they're available, including the earnings presentation that we'll be referring to during this call, on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website.\nI'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments. And then I'll ask Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, to cover the details of the quarter.\nBefore I turn the call over to Brian, just let me remind you, we may make some forward-looking statements, and please refer to our non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nFactors that may cause actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and SEC filings available on our website. Information about non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also be found on our earnings materials that are available on the website.\nSo with that, Brian, I'll turn it over to you. Thanks.\n\nBrian Thomas Moynihan\n\nChairman & CEO, Bank of America Corporation\n\nThank you, Lee. And thank you, all of you, for joining us today this quarter. Thanks to a great team here at Bank of America.\nWe reported $6.2 billion in net income or $0.73 per diluted share. We delivered on our fourth straight quarter of operating leverage. We grew revenue 6%, while expense rose 1.5% for 4.5% of operating leverage compared to quarter 2 of 2021. We also saw a 21% year-over-year improvement in NII. These earnings generated a return on tangible common equity of 14% and return on assets of 79 basis points.\nAs a reminder, when comparing our earnings in the second quarter of '21 to the earnings this quarter, in the second quarter '21, we recorded 2 items of note. In that quarter, net income benefited by $2 billion from a tax adjustment for a U.K. tax law change, and that was worth $0.23 to EPS.\nWe also released $2.2 billion in credit reserves during that quarter that benefited earnings by $1.7 billion or $0.19 in EPS. This would bring that quarter's reported EPS to $1.03, down in the low 60s, and that compares to this quarter's $0.73 per share. This gain is illustrated by the increase in pretax, pre-provision income, which includes these 2 -- which would exclude those 2 impacts, and that was $7.4 billion this quarter, improving 15% in PPNR improvement from the second quarter of 2021.\nSo let's go to Slide 3, and let's talk about some of the drivers of the results. The organic growth engine at Bank of America that existed pre-pandemic is back in full place here. And you can see that in the second quarter of 2021. This reflects in net new checking account openings, net new consumer investment accounts, net new household growth in Wealth Management, very strong loan growth across all products and good performance by Global Markets and investment banking teams, even given a quarter with volatile capital markets.\nOur expense management continues strong, and it benefits by the best digital banking platform in the world. Once again, we drove more users, saw more log-ins and usage, and that generated 20% more sales from the platform compared to last year. Our asset quality remains very strong, with net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2021 still 50% below pre-pandemic levels in late 2019 when credit was pretty good.\nBreaking down the performance by segment, I'd make a few comments. Our Consumer Banking segment continued to see good momentum as we grew loans at the fastest quarterly pace in nearly 3 years. We added more than 240,000 net new checking accounts in the quarter, in the second quarter alone. We opened new financial centers and renovated others and deepened digital engagement with both consumer and small business clients. And after considering the highly elevated consumer income tax outflows, payments of taxes which is good for the government, we saw good deposit activity.\nIn our Wealth Management segment, in a period of declining market values, where stocks and bonds had the worst first half in 5 decades, revenues still grew in that business 7% year-over-year, and we expanded our pretax margin. Our banking business with the clients overcame those market values and weakness.\nWe added more than 5,100 net new households across Merrill and Private Bank. Across our entire Wealth platform, Merrill, the Private Bank; and our consumer investments team, Merrill Edge, client balances, including deposit investments and loans, totals $3.8 trillion at 6/30/2022, aided by nearly $150 billion of client inflows over the last year into those businesses.\nOur Global Banking team grew loans 5% linked quarter. That's 5% in a single quarter, 20% annualized. We also saw Global Treasury Services revenue as customers utilized our service to management quality stand up well in the quarter.\nOverall, revenue in Global Banking was impacted by the weaker investment banking fees that were available in this volatile market; lower investment banking fees; and we also had marked, as previously discussed, our leveraged finance positions. Our NII improvement nearly offset all those impacts, leaving revenue only modestly down year-over-year. We maintained our #3 investment banking market share ranking.\nIn Markets, we had a solid quarter of sales and trading results, growing 11% from last year ex DVA. Our macro FICC business, where we have been investing over the last couple of years, performed well, as did the equity derivatives, while the FICC businesses felt the effects of spread widening and customers taking a more [risk-off] position.\nFrom a broader enterprise, our P&L perspective, quarter 2 expense was down modestly from quarter 1 and consistent with what we told you on our last call. It is notable that we achieved that even as quarter 2 included approximately $425 million in regulatory matters that Alastair will discuss in a few minutes.\nAs I said earlier, one of the reasons we continue to have good expense results and continued progress on digital engagement across the businesses. I commend you to look at Slides 22, 27, 29 in our appendix where we set forth our digital operating results by lines of business.\nOverall, digital sales continue to grow, up 20%. Digital choice for payments continue to grow. Sale transactions continue to outdistance checks written, crossing off the last year, and the gap continues to widen. Erica is approaching 1 billion interactions since we started with it. Clients have filled out 8 million life plans, enhancing our asset growth and account retention. That's one of the fastest-growing product implementations we've had.\nIt is also worth noting the strong credit quality. Most all of asset quality metrics improved again this quarter. You will note, however, the charge-offs rose in quarter 2, but this increase was largely due to some loan sale accounting and some other credit decisions due to the past pandemic issues. As I've done for several quarters, I want to make a few points about customer activity.\nLet's go to Slide 4. Buyer data crossed the 35 million core checking households plus we have in 60 million consumers in America. U.S. consumers remain quite resilient. I would offer a few thoughts as you look at Slide 4. In addition, I'll give you where we see -- what we see so far in July in a moment.\nFirst, customers -- consumers continue to spend at a healthy pace even as quite some time has passed since the receipt of any stimulus. Second, the overall average deposit balances for most client cohorts are higher than they were both last quarter and even rose in June versus May. They remain at multiples above the pre-pandemic levels.\nAnd importantly, we're seeing no deterioration in our customers' asset quality, and they have the capability to borrow. Our customer data shows Bank of America customers spent the highest quarterly period on record in quarter 2 at $1.1 trillion in total spending. That's up 12% year-over-year. This quarter also was the highest debit-spending period on record for us.\nBut as you think about more recently, just to give you the more recent statistics, in June 2022, spending was up 11.3% over June 2021. Transactions also rose more than 6%. For the first 2 weeks of July, the spending is up 10% plus in transactions, again, rising 6% plus. This is strong consumer resilience.\nWe continue to see shifts in what people are spending on as the quarter took place, more of on experiences, travel and things like that and a bit more on fuel due to increased prices and less on retail stores. In quarter 2, we saw the higher gas spend as well as the continued recovery in the travel categories and a continued recovery in restaurant spending.\nIn the lower right-hand chart, you'll note the continued shift in how people spend money. The check and cash volumes continue to come down and are replaced by digital alternatives. This continues to help on our cost structure.\nRegarding our customer liquidity, average deposit balance of our customers remained at high levels relative to the year ago in pre-pandemic periods. The larger change for the mass market customers, they rose about 1% over June from May. The only area where we had any change to the negative was a small dip, 1%, for the most affluent segments of those customers. That reflects the tax payments made in April and the build back coming more slowly for those customers.\nIn addition to this data, I would refer you to Slides 24 and 25, which completes the resiliency picture. That shows you strong asset quality across our consumers. Also, look at elevated payment rates on credit cards. That means people paying off their debt at a good clip.\nThere's no real differentiation across the trends in customer cohorts, even for the very small portion of our card book that is in lower credit quality. So while all this is good news, it clearly makes the Fed's job tougher when you take these statistics and this activity and combine it with a low unemployment rate.\nI want to switch gears now and talk a little bit more about credit. We provided more information on credit this quarter, as would be obvious, given the debate about a future recession. Whether this debate can discuss this potential outcome, we just continue to drive responsible growth at our company, and so we're prepared.\nSo as you look at Slide 5, you can see how much the loan book has changed under more than a decade of responsible growth. As you can see on the top left chart, our loan book is quite well balanced now between consumer and commercial loans. Focusing on the top right chart, note that the consumer portfolio is even more collateralized with a greater mix of mortgage and less card.\nIn addition, much less second mortgage, and obviously, second mortgage as they're underwritten clearly differently than they were in the mid-2000 to 2010 decade. And all consumer portfolios have much higher FICOs. In the bottom left chart, you'll note that more diversified commercial mix as well. And if you look at the lower right chart, you can see our results on the stress test and how they fared time and time again.\nWhen you go to Slide 6, we gave you a little detail on what we look like in the height of the last crisis compared to where we are now. You can see the loan portfolio in 2009 when risk were at the peak for Bank of America, because this was after we closed the Merrill and the Countrywide transactions and the company was all put together.\nWe give you those metrics, what they look like pre pandemic, at the end of 2019 and what they look like today. On the right are the changes we've made under that decade-plus of responsible growth. Given all these changes, 92% of our commercial loan book today is either investment-grade or secured.\nAnd while there is not much difference in something like commercial real estate book, you have to look underlying to see the changes. For instance, the land development loans increased -- have decreased from $5 billion in '09 to $200 million currently, and secured residential exposure decreased from $11 billion to $150 million now.\nWe've also included a few slides in our appendix, Pages 23 to 25, to highlight the consumer resilience and delinquency points as well as our consumer lending statistics, highlighting this continued strong quality of all our originations. Take note of the FICOs on the newly originated activity there.\nSo in the end, despite the worries of a slowing economy and other global issues, client activity remained good this quarter, NII has improved quickly, and our customers' resilience and health remains strong. We recognized some expense from regulatory matters and still managed to keep expenses flat to the first quarter and in line with what we've told you. We continue to drive strong operating leverage in a weaker capital markets environment. These earnings are delivering strong returns and delivering capital back to shareholders.\nAnd thinking about capital, remember, first, we use our capital to support customers and related loans, and we continue to invest in the franchise. Second, we are delivering capital back to you as shareholders. We announced our intent to increase our dividend in quarter 3, which we have our dividend 22% higher than it was just 12 months ago. In addition, we retired shares this quarter.\nThird, we're going to be building capital, given the new higher [requirements] received during the stress. It will make our balance sheet even stronger. Along the way, we believe our expected earnings generation over the next 18 months will provide an ample amount of capital, which allows us to support customer growth, pay dividends and use the rest to allocate between buying back shares and growing into our new capital requirement.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Alastair.\n\nAlastair M. Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America Corporation\n\nThank you, Brian. And since Brian hit the highlights of the income statement, I just want to reiterate, we saw good returns in the quarter with a return on tangible common equity of 14% and return on assets of 79 basis points. So I'm going to begin my comments on Slide 7 and the balance sheet.\nAnd as you can see, during the quarter, the balance sheet declined $127 billion to a little more than $3.1 trillion, and that reflected an $88 billion decline in deposits and a decrease in our Global Markets balance sheet. We utilized a combination of cash and some rotation from securities this quarter to fund our loans growth given the decline in deposits.\nOur average liquidity portfolio declined in the quarter, reflecting a drop in deposits and lower securities valuation, and it remains very elevated at nearly $1 trillion. For reference, that was $576 billion pre-pandemic, just to give you an idea of how much liquidity has increased over the period.\nShareholders' equity increased to $2.5 billion from Q1, with a few different components we should note. Shareholders' equity benefited from net income after preferred dividends of $5.9 billion and the issuance of $2 billion in preferred stock. So that's $7.9 billion flowing into equity. We paid out $2.2 billion in common dividends and net share repurchases.\nAOCI declined as a result of the increase in loan rates. And we saw that impact in 2 ways. First, we had a reduction from a change in the value of our available-for-sale debt securities of $1.8 billion, and that impacts CET1.\nSecond, rates also drove a $2 billion decline in AOCI from derivatives that does not impact CET1. And that reflects cash flow hedges mostly put in place last year against some of our variable rate loans, and that provided some NII growth and also protected CET1 at the same time. With that equity growth, we saw book value increase in the quarter.\nWith regard to regulatory capital, our supplemental leverage ratio increased 10 basis points to 5.5% versus our minimum requirement of 5%, leaving plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. And our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements.\nOkay. Let's turn to Slide 8, and we'll talk about CET1, where our capital levels remain very strong. We have $172 billion of CET1 and a 10.5% CET1 ratio, which increased from the first quarter and remains well above our second quarter 9.5% minimum requirement. That 10.5% CET1 ratio is also expected to be just above our new 10.4% requirement from CCAR when it's confirmed by regulators at the end of August. And that new level will be effective for us on October 1.\nI'll walk through the drivers of the CET1 ratio this quarter. First, $5.9 billion of earnings, net of preferred dividends, which generated 36 basis points of capital. And looking at the chart, you can see how we use that. We grew loans by $38 billion. And with a decline in our Global Markets balance sheet and some loan sales and other balance sheet initiatives, we were able to hold RWA flat this quarter.\nSecond, we returned $2.7 billion of capital to shareholders, representing 16 basis points. Third, this quarter, the movement in treasury and mortgage-backed securities rates caused a decline in the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities, and that lowered our CET1 ratio by 11 basis points.\nAnd we remained well positioned for that rate movement as our hedge of a large portion of this portfolio continued to protect it from AOCI movements. So we ended the quarter above our expected minimum of 10.4% required October 1, and we expect to build some additional buffer on top of that in Q3.\nMoving beyond the third quarter, we should just remind you, our balance sheet growth last year means our G-SIB surcharge and CET1 requirement will move higher by 50 basis points beginning in 2024. And I just want to make sure we repeat that for clarity, it's 2024, because I know others have different time lines for their requirements.\nGiven our additional higher G-SIB minimum over the next 6 quarters, we'll work to move above that expected CET1 minimum of 10.9% by January 1 of 2024. And we'll look to exceed that with another 50 basis points of internal management buffer on top of that requirement.\nOkay. So now let's talk about the biggest use of CET1 this quarter, and I'm referring to loans on Slide 9. As you review the average loan data, we just want to remind you that our discipline around responsible growth has remained tight.\nAverage loans have climbed back over $1 trillion. They're up 12% compared to Q2 '21, led by commercial growth of 15% and complemented by consumer growth of 8%. Each line of business and product segment reflected good growth. And geographic and industry participation within that growth has also broadened over the past several quarters.\nAs we turn to linked quarter comparisons, I'll use ending balances. And the $25 billion linked quarter commercial improvement came mostly from new loans and also included some improved utilization from existing clients.\nFrom an asset quality standpoint, 98% of the commercial loan growth was either investment-grade or secured. Consumer loans grew $10 billion linked quarter, led by both credit card and mortgage and also increases in auto and securities-based lending. And for the first time in years, home equity balances increased modestly.\nCard loans grew $5 billion from Q1, reflecting healthy spend levels even as payments rates remain elevated. Within our growth, our average FICO was 771, as you can see on Slide 23 in the appendix.\nAnd as we've done in the past, in the appendix on Slide 32, we've provided that daily ending loan chart that shows trends through the quarter. And you can see both commercial and consumer loans balances are now back to pre-pandemic periods, with really only credit cards still remaining 15% to 20% below that period.\nMoving to deposits on Slide 10. Across our past 12 months, we've seen solid growth across the client base as we've deepened relationships and added new accounts. Some of the year-over-year growth was impacted by a higher level of tax payments across consumer and GWIM clients and businesses in Q2 of this year. Those elevated tax payments drove the decline in deposits from Q1.\nYear-over-year average deposits are up $123 billion or 7%, and retail deposits with our Consumer and Wealth Management clients grew $129 billion. And we believe our retail deposits of $1.4 trillion continue to lead all competitors.\nWithin the consumer balances, I'd just like to point out that small business deposits of $177 billion grew 14% year-over-year, and that reflects continued reopening of small businesses across America and the consumer spending supporting their growth. The average balance of these accounts is more than $40,000.\nOn Wealth Management, we saw clients paying higher tax bills this year, and we saw some move deposits to market-based funds, much of which remained in our own complex. With our commercial clients, deposits were up modestly year-over-year, even as customer tax payments are higher this year. And some have recently begun to seek higher yields and use cash strategically for acquisitions and other operational activities.\nTurning to Slide 9 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q2 was $12.4 billion, and the FTE net interest income number was $12.5 billion. Focusing on FTE, NII increased $2.2 billion from the second quarter of last year or 21%, and that's driven by benefits from higher interest rates, including lower premium amortization and loans growth.\nNII compared to the first quarter rose $870 million, and that came in a good bit higher than the $650 million plus that we signaled on our last earnings call. The benefits of higher rates, lower premium amortization, loans growth and the additional day of interest more than offset the impact of lower securities balances.\nOur net interest yield was 1.86%, improving 17 basis points from Q1 and benefited from the rise in rates, loans growth funded with cash and a 4 basis point improvement from lower premium amortization on securities. Looking forward, we want to provide the following NII guidance, and we just have to provide a few caveats.\nFirst, we based the guidance on interest rates and the forward curve materializing, and I'm referring to the curve on July 15. Second, we assume modest growth in loans and deposits. And third, we assume deposit betas reflecting disciplined pricing to achieve our growth.\nIf those assumptions hold true, we can see NII in Q3 increase by at least $900 million, possibly $1 billion, versus Q2. And then we expect it to grow again at a faster pace on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter. And the way we think about those NII increases, given the expense discipline that we have, is we expect the majority of that to fall to the bottom line for shareholders.\nFocusing on asset sensitivity for a moment. As you know, we typically disclose our asset sensitivity based on a 100 basis point instantaneous parallel shock in rates above the forward curve. And on that forward basis, asset sensitivity at June 30 was $5 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months. More than 90% of that is driven by short rates. That's down from $5.4 billion at March 31, largely because the benefit of higher rates is now already factored into our baseline of actual NII after we grew the $870 million.\nNow given that the yield curve is projecting 125 basis points of rate hikes over the next couple of meetings, we thought it was also appropriate to provide the disclosure again regarding asset sensitivity on a spot basis. And on a spot basis, our sensitivity to a 100 basis point instantaneous rate hike would be $5.8 billion or $800 million higher than the forward basis at June 30.\nOkay. Let's turn to expense, and we'll use Slide 12. Our expenses were $15.3 billion, up a couple of hundred million or 1.5% from the year-ago period and down modestly compared to the first quarter. I want to focus on the more recent comparison versus the first quarter.\nWe had higher expense for regulatory matters related to certain issues, and those offset the seasonal decline from the first quarter elevated payroll taxes and revenue-related incentive costs. Let me pause for a moment on the $425 million expense we've recognized for regulatory matters in the second quarter.\nA little more than half of the amount relates to fines to resolve regulatory investigations relating to our administration of prepaid unemployment benefit card programs in certain states and that we announced last week. The balance of the expense relates to an industry-wide issue, and it concerns the use of unapproved personal devices. And that has not yet been fully resolved.\nAs we look forward more broadly on expenses, we continue to invest heavily in technology, in people and in marketing across the businesses, and we continue to add new financial centers and renovated old ones in expansion and new growth markets. To help pay for those investments, we continued to look for opportunities to simplify our processes and reduce work, driving our costs lower to self-fund our new investments.\nOur headcount this quarter includes roughly 2,300 summer interns, and we hope they will consider us to be a great place to work and join us full time next year. This is the most diverse group of talent we've seen yet. Absent the addition of those interns, our headcount was down a little more than 700 associates. And we, like many other companies, are doing many things to tackle challenging labor market conditions, and we're meeting that challenge pretty well so far.\nTurning to asset quality on Slide 13. I want to repeat what we've said now for many, many quarters. The asset quality of our customers remains very healthy, and that's true in both consumer and commercial. So net charge-offs of $571 million increased $179 million from Q1, driven by loan sales and some other credit decisions that we made as opposed to core credit deterioration. Absent those losses, net charge-offs were down modestly compared to the year-ago period and up slightly from Q1.\nProvision expense was $523 million in Q2, driven by the charge-offs as we had a small reserve release of $48 million. Now that release includes builds for loan growth. It includes builds for a dampened macroeconomic outlook in the future. And the builds were offset by continued asset quality improvement and the effect of reduced pandemic uncertainty.\nOn Slide 14, we're highlighting the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios, and a couple of things are worth repeating again this quarter. Consumer delinquencies remain well below pre-pandemic levels, and you can see the decline in reservable criticized. And NPLs saw a modest decrease, driven both by the loan sales mentioned earlier and other improvement across commercial.\nTurning to the business segments. Let's start with Consumer Banking on Slide 15. And the Consumer Bank earned $2.9 billion on good organic growth, delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of operating leverage.\nStrong top line growth of 12%, driven by net interest income improvement, was more than offset by increase in provision expense resulting from the prior year's much larger reserve release. And while reported earnings were down, pretax, pre-provision earnings for Consumer grew 26% year-over-year, which highlights the earnings improvement without the impact of that reserve action.\nCard revenue was solid and increased modestly year-over-year as spending benefits were mostly offset by higher rewards costs. Service charges were down nearly $200 million year-over-year as our previously announced insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes were in full effect by June.\nThe third quarter will reflect the full run rate going forward, and we believe these changes are helping to improve overall customer satisfaction and further lower customer attrition. Expense increased 2%, as much of our increased salary and wage moves in the quarter impact Consumer Banking the most. And as revenue grew, we improved the efficiency ratio to 54%.\nReduced costs associated with continued shifts in client behavior to digital engagement is also allowing us to invest in higher marketing, more technology and higher wages for our people. We also continued our investment in financial centers, opening another 19 in the quarter while we renovated 157 more.\nNotable customer activity highlights included 240,000 net new checking accounts opened in the second quarter and marking the 14th consecutive quarter of net new consumer checking account growth. This led to a record 35 million consumer checking accounts, with 92% of them considered to be their primary account. Additionally, small business accounts are enjoying the features of their business Advantage Rewards and showed growth of 5% from last year.\nWe also grew investment account 6% year-over-year. And not surprisingly, the market impacted customer balances negatively on the investment side. At the same time, over the past 12 months, we've seen 21 billion of positive client inflows.\nLastly, once again, we opened over 1 million credit cards in the quarter, and we grew average active card accounts and saw combined credit and debit card spend up 10%. And as you saw earlier, we had solid lending activity with continued low loss rates.\nOur 43 million active digital users signed on this quarter a record 2.8 billion times, with our Erica users up 30% year-over-year. And we captured over 123 million total client interactions in the second quarter alone. You can see all the other digital metrics and trends on Slide 26.\nTurning to Wealth Management on Slide 16. You can see we produced strong results, earning $1.2 billion and producing 16% year-over-year growth. Revenue growth was 7% as NII generated through our banking assistance for these clients more than offset modest declines in assets under management fees from market impacts during a challenging quarter.\nClients and advisers recognize this value of a holistic financial relationship across investments and banking. And doing that at Bank of America differentiates both Merrill and the Private Bank, and it helps to diversify and differentiate our earnings in this business compared to other brokers.\nOur talented group of financial advisers, coupled with powerful digital capabilities, allowed modern Merrill to gain nearly 4,500 net new households. We also gained 650 more in the Private Bank this quarter. And that's a very solid showing by both, given the complexities of serving our clients in challenging market conditions over the past 90 days.\nWe added $25 billion of loans over the last year, growing 13%, and marking 49 consecutive quarters of loans growth in the business. And that is consistent and sustained performance. Assets under management flows and deposit growth were a little more muted this quarter as clients paid taxes, impacting the quarter-to-quarter comparison.\nYear-over-year, our deposits were up $17 billion. And overall investment flows were $78 billion over the past 4 quarters, with total flows of $110 billion. Expenses increased 2%, driven by higher employee-related costs, and resulted in operating leverage of 6%.\nTurning to Slide 17 and Global Banking. You'll see the business earned $1.5 billion in the second quarter, down $918 million year-over-year and driven by the absence of a large prior-period reserve release and lower investment banking revenue. As you know, it was a tough comparative quarter for the business as the industry investment banking fee pool declined 50%.\nAnd while we acknowledge that's a big drop, we just want to remind you that before the pandemic, our quarterly average for investment banking fees was in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion compared to the $1.1 billion we put up in the second quarter. So we view this level as temporary, and we believe it can rise back to more normal levels in the next few quarters when economic uncertainty becomes more muted.\nWhile the company's overall investment banking fees declined, we held on to our #3 ranking in overall fees. And we maintained our market share through the first half of the year compared to 2021.\nAt the same time, we saw very strong loans growth. Ending loans grew $18 billion linked quarter and are up $62 billion or 19% year-over-year. That loans growth and higher rates drove net interest income growth, which was able to offset the drop in investment banking fees, leaving revenues in the business fairly flat year-over-year.\nAlso impacting revenue was half of the firm's $300 million leveraged finance valuation marks. The market turmoil and abrupt slowdown in the second quarter sparked a downturn in the leveraged finance markets, causing a number of the deals across various market participants to get marked down. Some of those deals have been funded, and we're working through any remaining exposure to get them through the market.\nThe provision expense increase reflects a reserve build of $143 million in Q2 compared to an $834 million release in the year-ago period. And finally, we saw expenses increase by 8%, driven by higher personnel costs and a share of the noted expenses for regulatory matters.\nSwitching to Global Markets on Slide 18. And as we usually do, we'll talk about the segment results, excluding DVA. Second quarter net income of $900 million reflects a solid quarter of sales and trading revenue. It was another quarter that favored macro trading, while the credit trading business has faced a more challenging market environment with widening spreads in the face of increased inflation fears and recession beliefs.\nFocusing on year-over-year, sales and trading contributed $4 billion to revenue, improving 11%. FICC was up 19%, while equities was up 2%. That FICC improvement was primarily driven by growth in our macro products, while credit-traded products were down. We've been investing heavily over the past year in several of the macro businesses identified as opportunities for us, and we were rewarded for that this quarter.\nOur strength in equities was driven by good performance in derivatives and offset by a weaker trading performance in cash. Lastly, also impacting revenue was the other half of the firm's $300 million in leveraged finance markdowns.\nYear-over-year expense declined, reflecting the absence of costs associated with the realignment of a liquidating business activity, partially offset by that share of the regulatory costs. Absent these impacts, expense was relatively unchanged. And the business generated an 8% return in Q2, impacted by both the elevated leveraged finance marks and regulatory matter expense.\nFinally, on Slide 19, we show All Other which reported a loss of $318 million, declining from the year-ago period, driven by the prior period $2 billion tax benefit from that U.K. tax law change. Revenue is roughly a couple of hundred million higher than Q2 '21 due to the absence of some prior-period structured note losses. Expense increased as a result of the regulatory matters and the realignment of liquidating activity last year to All Other.\nAnd as a reminder, for the financial statement presentation in this release, the business segments all are taxed on the standard fully taxable equivalent basis. And in All Other, we incorporate the impact of our ESG tax credits and any other unusual items.\nFor the quarter, our effective tax rate was 9%. That benefited from 2 things: first, ESG investment tax credits; and second, roughly $300 million of discrete tax benefits that applied to this quarter. Excluding those tax credits and discrete items, our tax rate would have been 26%.\nAnd with that, we'll jump into Q&A, please. Thank you.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this call may be recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Lee McEntire.\n\nE. Lee McEntire\n\nHead of IR, Bank of America Corporation\n\nGood morning. Thank you, Katherine. Welcome. I hope everybody had a nice weekend, and thank you for joining the call to review the first quarter results. I trust everybody has had a chance to review our earnings release documents. As always, they are available, including the earnings presentation that we'll be referring to during this call, on our Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website.\nI'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments; and then ask Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, to cover the details of the quarter.\nBefore I turn the call over to Brian, just let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and the assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and our SEC filings that are available on the website. Information about non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also be found in the earnings materials that are available on the website.\nSo with that, take it away, Brian.\n\nBrian Thomas Moynihan\n\nChairman & CEO, Bank of America Corporation\n\nThank you, Lee, and good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us. As we open our earnings call this quarter, we want to acknowledge that there's -- the humanitarian crisis continue to take place in Ukraine and remain watchful and have provided assistance from our company to the Ukranian citizens and staying ready to help further where we can.\nBefore we get into some discussion on the current outlook and activity, I want to step back and focus on the big picture about Bank of America this quarter. In a quarter that had a lot of variables shop, we delivered responsible growth again. We reported $7.1 billion in net income or $0.80 per diluted share. We grew revenue, we reduced costs, and we delivered our third straight quarter of operating leverage coming out of pandemic.\nNet interest income grew 13% and is expected to grow significantly from here. We saw a strong loan growth. We grew deposits. We saw a strong investment for us. We made trading profits every day during the quarter. We grew pretax pre-provision income by 8%. We had a return on tangible common equity of 15.5%. All this came in that quarter that saw geopolitical conflict, rising interest rates, epidemic, rising inflation concerns and much, much more. I want to thank our team for delivering on responsible growth once again.\nSo if you look at the statistics on Slide 2, you can see some of those highlights. You can see the organic growth engine that our company is delivering once again. In our banking business, you can see the strong loan and deposit growth. We grew and expanded customer relationships across every business. In fact, we grew net new checking accounts by more than 220,000 this quarter alone. We opened new financial centers, and we renovated many others. We added more digital capabilities and crossed 50% in digital sales.\nIn our Wealth Management businesses, you can see over $160 billion of client flows over the year and more than $4 trillion in client balances, including Merrill Edge. We saw both strong investment flow performance in addition to banking flows. Over the past year, we brought on a significant number of net new households, 24,000, Merrill; and then the 2,000 in the private bank.\nAcross the combination of our Consumer and Wealth businesses, we saw more than $90 billion of investment flows. We now have managed client balances, including deposits loan investments of more than $5 trillion with us.\nIn Global Markets, (inaudible) and his team had a solid quarter of sales and trading results, which included a record quarter for equities. Despite the market turmoil, we had 0 days of trading losses. And while the investment banking fee line was down from the record quarters of the past year, Matthew Koder and his team produced solid results with a strong forward pipeline, and we gained market share in several areas, including moving to #2 in the mid-cap investment banking.\nFrom a broader enterprise perspective, part of managing costs while it comes from the drive we have in the company to provide enhanced digital capabilities to our customers, which in turn drives adoption for the digital engagement and lower costs.\nIf you look at Slide 23 and beyond, you can see we are now selling more digitally than we are in person. It takes both to be successful. What makes them even more impressive is all the financial centers are now open and back to operating at their usual great capacity. So adding the digital capacity clearly increases our total production capabilities.\nYou can also see our digital sales are now twice the pre-pandemic level just 3 years ago. Even more impressive, look at Zelle and Erica volumes, up more than 4x in pre-pandemic levels. We're now processing more outgoing Zelle transactions than checks. In our cash pro mobile app with our commercial clients, we see many $5 billion usage days. There are a lot more stats on the slide showing strong digital growth. I commend them to you to see how a high-tech innovative company drives organic growth.\nThis quarter, our resilience was tested. And once again, we maintained a focus on what we control and grew responsibly, earned our way through the turmoil. So as we talked to you during the quarter, many of you expressed questions about the impact of the macro environment and changes in our company. So the lingering impact of the pandemic on supply chains and business opportunity, inflation and Fed reduction of [monetization], the impacts of Russian-Ukraine war, both on the first order effect and second order effects. We do remain mindful of all these. So could a slowdown in the economy happen? Perhaps. But right now, the size of the economy is bigger than pre-pandemic levels. Consumer spending remains strong, unemployment is low and wages are rising.\nCompany earnings are also generally strong. Credit is widely available. And our customers' usage of their lines of credit is still low, i.e., they have capacity to borrow more.\nWe are all focused on the ability of Fed to use their tools to reduce inflation. We (inaudible) know that will take interest rates with rate hikes and a reduction in the balance sheet. We predict it will slow the economy from 3% growth in 2022 to a little below 2% in '24 -- '23, excuse me. That is back to trend. So the interest rate hikes comes better NII. Could the Fed had to push harder to sell inflation? Perhaps. That is why we run stress test each quarters to look at scenarios to see what would happen in a highly inflationary environment.\nIf (inaudible) fast the implication of capital? For sure, as you saw some in this quarter. But in the context of the capital build, those impacts are manageable. The impact increases earnings also. And then over time, the bonds pull back to par. All that results in a rebuild of the capital quite quickly. But for some short period of time, that capital usage, along with customer usage, might slow share repurchase a little bit, but it will be temporary.\nWhat if we're wrong and things do get tougher? We already know what that looks like in 2020, as we built significant reserves and also built 90 basis points of capital during the economic shutdown period. Rates moved against us and earnings fell. So we have already proven resilient. We continue to focus on responsive growth and things we control.\nIf you go to Slide 3, I want to mention to show some of the strengths we see in our U.S. consumer base. Bank of America consumers spent at the highest-ever quarter 1 level, which is a double-digit percentage increase over the 2021 level that you can see in the upper left. From our card spend to date, we have seen a strong recovery in travel, entertain, restaurant spending. In the upper right, you can see that. By the way, even with the fuel costs up 40% and more from last year, fuel represents about 6% of overall debit and credit card spending and a lot less of overall spending as car as you can see in the lower left, is 21% of all spending.\nImportantly, despite March of last year, including stimulus bonus, we saw the spending in the month of March 2022 on a comparable basis to 2021, 13% higher by dollar volume. And we saw a 7.4% increase in the number of transactions. So both dollar volumes and numbers of transactions rose nicely. And as you expect, the message by which people spend continues to shift away from cash and checks to replace with digital alternatives. And you can see that follow.\nOur data showed continued growth in the average deposit balance across all customer levels, which suggests capacity for strong spending continue. On an aggregated basis, average deposit balances were up 47% from pre-pandemic levels and 15% higher than 2021. And the momentum continued through quarter 1, particularly in the low balance accounts, which grew in February to March, continuing a streak since mid last year.\nNow a couple of examples so you can see how this works. We looked at the pre-pandemic customers who had $1,000 to $2,000 of clear balances BAC. Today, we have a -- at that time, pre-pandemic had an average balance of [1.4 or] $1,400. You take that same cohort of customers with -- the same customers in 2022 versus 2019, and they have an average clear balance of now of $7,400. So they increased from $1,400 to $7,400.\nIf you go to the next cohort up, those with $2,000 to $5,000 of cleared balances in the pre-pandemic, their average was $3,250. Now those same customers today have an average cleared balance of $12,500. What does that tell us? The consumers are sitting on lots of cash. Why this is true while you know, high wage growth, high savings by limited enabled spending. But what it means is a long tail to consumer spend growth. And in April through the first 2 weeks, spending is growing and as [fast] at 18% over April 2021.\nAnother economic sign posted a continuation of loan growth. A year ago, we highlighted the green shoots of our loan growth. We then delivered a growth in quarter 2 and quarter 3 and quarter 4 despite PPP runoff and the change in economic conditions. To convey where we are today, we focus on ending loans to give you a progression through the quarter.\nIf you go to Slide 4, you can see the highlights of that growth in the upper left of the slide. I would remind you that in quarter 4, we highlighted to you that of the $55 billion of growth in that single quarter, $16 billion was Global Markets. So we did not expect that to hold true for quarter 1 of 2022. So as we thought, Global Markets did come down $5 billion this quarter. Despite that, overall commercial loans grew $13 billion from quarter 4, excluding PPP. That means commercial loans, excluding Global Markets, grew $17 billion. Every single customer group, Global banking, large corporate, middle market, business banking crew as well as commercial loans and Wealth Management.\nThat improvement came from both new loans as well as improving utilization rates from existing clients. You can see in the top chart, loans have moved back above our pre-pandemic levels on the right-hand side of the slide, and you can see it being led by commercial.\nConsumer loans continue to grow late quarter as well. This is despite typical seasonality and despite the continued suppressed credit card balance, as you can see on the lower left. Mortgage loans grew $4 billion, originations remained at high levels, and paydowns declined.\n[Card loans] declined $2 billion from quarter 4, driven by the transfer of $1.6 billion affinity card loan portfolio to the held-for-sale category. Absent that transfer, card loans would have declined very modestly, whereas the previous quarter, [1 quarter], they declined several billion.\nOn Slide 5, we provide data around consumer clients' leverage and asset quality as compared to pre-pandemic periods, which further supports our belief that consumers remain in good shape. On the upper left, we looked at our customers that have both a credit card and a deposit account with us.\nAs you will note, the average card balance of our credit card customers that had deposit relationships are still 8% lower than they were pre-pandemic. They continue to pay down their balances on a monthly basis at a higher rate than pre-pandemic. And as you know, delinquency rates are significantly lower.\nFurther, as you can see in my earlier point, these borrowing customers have built significant additional savings, and their average deposit balances were up 39%. So a lot of strength or dry powder is its goal. So what if we went to the modest FICO as more modest amount of low FICO customers you have at BAC. Looking at that small subset of our base, you can see a similar trend, even stronger on cash balances and lower debt levels. And you see in the bottom charts, we believe this is not just a phenomena BSE as industry data points around debt service levels are hovering near historic lows and household deposit and cash levels are $3 trillion higher than we entered the crisis.\nNow a word on Russia. This is not an area of material direct exposure for Bank of America. More than a decade ago, we've reduced our exposure in Russia, and it's result in having 90% less before the most recent crisis. Our current very limited activities in Russia are focused on compliance with all sanctions and other legal and regulatory requirements. Our lending and counterparty exposure to companies based in Russia totals approximately $700 million and is limited to 9 Russian-based borrowers. It's largely comprised of top-tier commodity exporters with a history of strong cash flows who continue to make payments. Prior to the Ukrainian invasion, these exposure were mostly investment grade, we report all of them on our reservable criticized.\nOur quarter 1 allowance includes increased reserves from this direct exposure. And I just note that even with the addition of these loans to reservable criticized, we still declined $1.7 billion in this category during the first quarter. We continue our daily monitoring with sanctions and interest payments might impact these loans. We also evaluate our portfolios and continue to do so considering second order impact to this crisis. Currently, we believe this to be modest and reflect our international strategy to focus on large multinational clients that have geographically diverse operations.\nOur quarter 1 allowance for credit losses reflects all of these things as well. On Russian counterparty risk, our teams have done a tremendous job from ending down our exposures. And at the end of the quarter, we have de minimis, meaning less than $20 million [counterbalance] exposures with a single Russian-based counterparty. And very limited impacts from quarter -- and any of those impacts are in our trading results for this quarter. So responsible growth has served us well here.\nAnd as you might note, after the 2014 Crimea conflict, we intentionally reduced our exposure. And Russia has not been our top 20 country risk exposure table since 2015.\nSo a few comments on NII. On NII, remember the rate increases came late in the quarter and had little first quarter 2022 NII impact. And there were 2 fewer days of interest in the quarter and decreased PPP fees hurt NII growth, yet we still grew NII by $200 million, in line with our guidance we gave you last quarter. Given the forward curve expectation for higher interest rates and our expectations of further loan growth, we expect significant NII improvement through the next several quarters. Alistair will expand on this point for you.\nWe have more than $2 trillion of deposits, and $1.4 trillion of those are with our consumer Wealth Management clients with more than 40% of those and low to no interest checking. That is a franchise that isn't rivaled. We will benefit as the rates move off to [0 4s], allowing us to earn more money on those check and deposits.\nDeposits, I know some -- several of you are wondering if deposits can continue to grow as rates begin to rise. So we went back and looked at the last rising cycle in the last decade. We pinpointed the peak rate paid to customers during the quarter reflected of this peak Fed tightening. We then went back and looked at the 12 months preceding growth rate in deposits. And in fact, during that 12 months preceding that peak, Deposits grew 5%, driven by organic growth engine, our market share gains and overall economic growth.\nIf we go to Page -- Slide 6, you can see that comment where we talked about capital. Just to start off, our capital remained strong with 10.4% CET1 ratio well above our 9.5% minimum requirement. As you can see, $7 billion of earnings, net of preferred dividends, generated 41 basis points of capital.\nIf you look on the right-hand side of the page, you can see that 14 basis points of that capital was used to support our customers' growth. That's a good thing. We also returned $4 billion to shareholders in common dividends and share repurchase, will represent about 27 basis points of use. Despite the Treasury and mortgage-backed securities rates caused the fair value of our AFS debt securities to decrease and lowered our CET1 by 21 basis points. That's the part that goes through the calculation of the capital. While one wouldn't expect this impact every quarter, we're well positioned -- we were well positioned for the spike. As you recall, we invested much of our securities books and held to maturity due to our huge excess and stable deposit base. We have $2 trillion of deposits and less than $1 trillion in loans.\nIn addition, to be cautious, we hedge a large portion of securities in the AFS portfolio, protecting it from a much larger hit to AOCI. I remind you, as the securities mature, the AOCI reverses and higher rates result in higher NII over a relatively short period of time. That should result in higher earnings that will benefit CET1 ratios on an ongoing basis and more than offset the negative upfront AOCI impact.\nLast thing I would note is our balance sheet growth to support our customer means our GSIB buffer will probably move higher by 50 basis points beginning in 2024, i.e., to 10% regulatory minimums. Well, this is nearly 2 years away, we continue to move towards it. Given this new higher minimum over the next couple of years, we'll look to gradually move to target CET1 range of 10.75% towards 11%. Importantly, while we grow into this range, we'll be able to support our clients, we'll be able to continue to increase our dividend, and we'll be able to continue to buy back stock.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Alastair.\n\nAlastair M. Borthwick\n\nCFO, Bank of America Corporation\n\nThank you, Brian, and I'll start with the summary income statement on Slide 7, where you can see our comparisons illustrating 3% year-over-year operating leverage produced by growing revenue and managing our costs well. That was nearly enough to overcome the change in provision expense, driven by the $2.7 billion reserve release in the year-ago period compared to a $400 million released this quarter.\nOn asset quality, more broadly, we continue to see very strong metrics. Net charge-offs remained low, and in fact, they're down more than 50% in just the past year. Consumer early and late-stage delinquencies are still below 2019 levels, and reservable criticized moved lower again in Q1.\nLooking ahead, we continue to feel good about the asset quality results of our consumer and commercial businesses near term, given our customers' high liquidity, low unemployment and rising wages. We produced good returns again this quarter with an ROTCE of nearly 16%, and we delivered $4.4 billion of capital back to shareholders, driving average shares lower by 6% year-over-year.\nLooking forward and with continued expectations of growing NII, combined with strong expense control, we expect to drive operating leverage and see our efficiency ratio work back towards 60%.\nSo let's turn to Slide 8 and the balance sheet. And you can see during the quarter, our balance sheet grew $69 billion to a little more than $3.2 trillion. This reflected $14 billion of growth in loans and the growth of our Global Markets balance sheet as customers increased their activity with us. Our decline in cash this quarter was associated with that growth in Global Markets.\nOur liquidity portfolio was stable compared to year-end. And at $1.1 trillion, it represents roughly 1/3 of the balance sheet. Shareholders' equity declined $3.4 billion from Q4 with a few different component side of note. Shareholders' equity benefited from net income after preferred dividends of $6.6 billion as well as issuance of $2.4 billion in preferred stock. So that's $9 billion that flowed into equity in Q1. And we paid out $4.4 billion in common dividends and share repurchases.\nAOCI declined as a result of the spike in loan rates that Brian referenced, and we saw the impact in 2 ways. First, we had a reduction from a change in the value of our AFS debt securities, that was $3.4 billion. That's the piece that impacts CET1, as Brian noted. And second, rates also drove a $5.2 billion decline in AOCI from derivatives, but does not impact CET1. That reflects cash flow hedges against our variable rate ones, which provides some NII growth and protected CET1 at the same time.\nWith regard to regulatory capital, since Brian already talked about CET1, I'd simply note that our supplemental leverage ratio was stable at 5.4% versus the minimum requirement of 5%, and still leaves us plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. And our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements.\nTurning to Slide 9, we included the schedule on average loan balances. And in the interest of time, the only thing I would add to Brian's earlier comments, and for your perspective, is simply a reminder that PPP loans are down $19 billion year-over-year. There's just a few billion of those left. And excluding PPP, our total loans grew $89 billion or 10% compared to last year.\nMoving to deposits on Slide 10. First, let's look at year-over-year growth. And across the past 12 months, we saw solid growth across the client base as we deepened relationships and added net new accounts. Our year-over-year average deposits are up $240 billion or 13%. Retail deposits with our Consumer and Wealth Management businesses grew $190 million, and our retail deposits have now grown to more than $1.4 trillion, where we lead all competitors.\nLooking at linked-quarter growth from Q4 and combining Consumer and Wealth Management customer balances, our retail deposits grew $53 billion in just the past 90 days. With our commercial clients, they're up nicely year-over-year, and we simply note the Q1 decline, which is entirely consistent with previous year's seasonal trends.\nTurning to Slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q1 was $11.6 billion. And the FTE NII number was $11.7 billion. So I'll focus on FTE, where net interest income has now increased $1.4 billion from the first quarter last year. As Brian noted, that's 13% increase driven by deposits growth and our related investment of liquidity.\nNII was up $200 million versus the fourth quarter as the benefits of lower premium amortization and loans growth more than offset the headwinds of 2 less days of interest accruals and lower PPP fees.\nSo let's pause for a moment to discuss asset sensitivity because I want to make a couple of points as we begin what the Fed has signaled to be a significant rate hike period. Remember, asset sensitivity is our measure of NII for the next 12 months above an expected baseline of NII, given changes in interest rates and other assumptions. In an environment of sharply rising rates each quarter, the baseline of NII -- actual NII increases and, therefore, the future sensitivity declines. Now we typically disclose our asset sensitivity based on a 100 basis point instantaneous parallel shock in rates above the forward curve. And on that basis, asset sensitivity at March 31 was $5.4 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months, and 90% of that sensitivity is driven by short rates. That $5.4 billion is down from $6.5 billion at year-end, largely because higher rates are now factored into and running through our actual or baseline NII.\nWell, you asked the question last quarter about the same sensitivity on a spot basis relative to our current curve. And given that the yield curve is projecting 125 basis points of rate hikes over the next 3 [meetings], we thought it was appropriate to provide that disclosure.\nSo in a 100 basis point shock to the current curve using spot rates, our sensitivity to that kind of move would be $6.8 billion or $1.4 billion higher than on a forward basis. So assuming rising rates as reflected in today's forward curve and if we see continued loans growth, I would just reiterate what we said last quarter that we expect to see robust NII growth in 2022 compared to 2021. We're not going to provide numerical guidance for the full year because the changes in interest rates have proven quite volatile in just the last 90 days, let alone a year. We do provide that asset sensitivity so that you can use it as guardrails to think about changes as you modify your own assumptions. I do, however, want to provide a near-term expectation and say that if loans grow and rates in the forward curve materialize, we would expect to see NII in Q2 increase by more than $650 million over the Q1 level and then grow again significantly on a sequential basis in each of the following 2 quarters.\nOkay. Let's turn to expenses, and we'll use Slide 12 for that discussion. Our Q1 expenses were $15.3 billion, down a couple hundred million from the year-ago period. I'll focus my remarks on the more recent comparison versus Q4 where we're up $600 million. And as expected, and we conveyed to you last quarter, the Q1 increase was driven mostly by seasonality of payroll tax expense [or] roughly $400 million. We also experienced modestly higher wage and benefit costs.\nAs we look forward, we continue to invest heavily in technology, people and marketing across our lines of business, and we've continued to add new financial centers in expansion and growth markets. We modestly increased our full year new tech initiative budget for the year to $3.6 billion. And that's on top of -- that's on top of more than $35 billion that we put to work over the past 12 years to help us build powerful, more secure and scalable technology platforms. This is the investment that allowed us to maintain a leadership position in patents among our peers. We had 512 of them granted in 2021, and we're maintaining in a similar pace this year. We think this is one of the things that's happened to protect our moat around leadership positions in places that matter most to customers.\nIn addition to modestly higher marketing costs this year, our investments also include adding up to 100 new financial centers. And we also plan to renovate more than 800 more during the year. We will also continue our upward march on minimum hourly wage toward $25 by 2025. So how do we pay for all that? Through continued work on operational excellence and digital engagement. And as we look to Q2, we expect our expenses to be down modestly from Q1, as much of the seasonal payroll tax expense abates and is somewhat offset by investment timing, inflation and the cost of opening up more fully for travel and clone entertainment. Because it feels like we've got a lot of pent-up demand for face-to-face meetings by our clients and our people.\nSo let's turn to asset quality on Slide 13. And as you can see, asset quality of our customers remains very healthy. Net charge-offs this quarter were better than our expectations once again and remained below $400 million, down 52% compared to Q1 2021. Provision expense was [$30] million in Q1 as reserve release of $362 million closely matched net charge-offs in the quarter. And that reserve release was primarily in our Consumer portfolios.\nOn Slide 14, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios. I am happy to answer any questions later, but a couple of things are worth repeating. Consumer delinquencies remain well below pre-pandemic levels. And despite reporting our commercial Russian lending exposure in reservable criticized, those levels still declined $1.7 billion from Q4.\nNPL saw a modest increase, and that simply reflects a small amount of consumer real estate deferrals expiring with the expiration of the CARES Act.\nTurning to the business segments. One thing we'd ask you just to keep in mind for each of the businesses is Q1 expense includes the seasonal payroll tax expense, which has negatively impacted efficiency ratios or profit margins in Q1. Also, and as usual, Q1 of every year includes segment capital level evaluation. And you'll note, we put additional capital against each of the businesses due to their growth. And as usual, we've tried to include business trends and digital stats for each segment.\nSo let's start with Consumer Banking on Slide 15, where you can see the Consumer Bank earned nearly $3 billion. That's 11% up over Q1 2021 as revenue growth more than offset the larger prior period reserve release. It's probably most easily identified by looking at pretax pre-provision earnings, which grew 32% year-over-year.\nRevenue grew 9% on NII improvement, and expense declined 4%, creating 13% operating leverage and the fourth consecutive quarter of operating leverage for our Consumer team. Notable customer activity highlights included our 228,000 net new checking accounts opened in Q1, which represents our 13th consecutive quarter of net new consumer checking account growth. Now this occurred as we began to implement our previously announced insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes, which lowered our service charges about $80 million.\nSo during this time, we saw accounts grow and we saw expenses decline. We also grew investment accounts 7%, and we saw those balances grow 10% from Q1 '21 to $350 billion, and that included $20 billion of client flows. And once again, we opened nearly 1 million credit cards in the quarter and grew average active card accounts and saw growth in combined credit and debit spend of 15%.\nOur continued investment in digital capabilities drove activity with our customers as we crossed 50% in digital sales this quarter and we continued investment in our financial centers, opening another 8 in the quarter. It's also worth noting that small business saw continued growth in loans, in deposits and in spending. Small business card spend was up 28% year-over-year. It gives you an idea of how small businesses are reopening for business.\nI'd also draw your attention to Slide 22 in the appendix. We've shared this with you previously, and it simply highlights the origination strength and quality of our consumer underwriting. Throughout everything, our underwriting standards have remained consistent.\nMoving to Slide 16. Wealth Management produced strong results earning $1.1 billion, and that represented 28% year-over-year growth, driven by strong revenue improvement, good expense management and low credit costs. Bank of America continues to deliver Wealth Management at scale across a full range of our client segments and with the best advisers in the industry according to Barron's rankings. That, coupled with our digital leadership, is delivering a modern Merril and a modern Private Bank for clients through enterprise relationships, and our clients and advisers have recognized the value in a holistic financial relationship that extends across investments, planning and banking. And that's what helped drive the $150 billion of clients' balance flows that you see here over the past 12 months. Not only did we see strong investment flows of more than $70 billion, but deposits grew $59 billion, up 18%, and we added $22 billion in loans over the same period, marking our 48th consecutive quarter of average loans growth in the business, just consistent and sustained performance from the team.\nRevenues grew 10% to a new record and were led by 25% growth in NII on the back of those solid deposit and loans increases as well as a 9% improvement in asset management fees. Expenses increased 4%, driven by higher revenue-related costs and resulted in over 600 basis points of operating leverage. And we generated nearly [11,000] in net new households in Merrill and more than 800 in the Private Bank this quarter.\nMoving to Global Banking on Slide 17. The business momentum with our Commercial clients remained strong in the first quarter. The business earned $1.7 billion in Q1, down $450 million year-over-year, driven by the absence of a large prior period reserve release and lower investment banking revenue. Revenue improvement of 12% year-over-year reflected higher leasing-related revenue and NII growth, partially offset by those lower investment banking fees.\nNet interest income grew on the back of strong loans and deposits growth. And the leasing revenue improvement included more ESG-related investments, particularly in solar, as well as the absence of weather-related losses recorded last year. While the company's overall investment banking fees of $1.5 billion declined 35% year-over-year, we gained market share in some important areas and recorded a #3 ranking in overall fees. And importantly, our investment banking pipeline remains quite healthy.\nProvision expense reflected a reserve build of $177 million compared to a $1.2 billion release in the year-ago period, and this quarter's provision includes reserves taken for Russia exposure and other considerations for loans growth, offset by continued improvement in asset quality metrics.\nFinally, we saw expense decline by 4%, driving strong operating leverage.\nSwitching to Global Markets on Slide 18. And as we usually do, I will talk about the segment results, excluding DVA. Q1 net income of $1.5 billion reflects a solid quarter of sales and trading revenue, and it includes a new record for equities. The business generated a 15% return in Q1 even with a 12% increase in the capital allocated to the business. Our investments in this business saw good results as our financing clients continue to increase their activities with our company.\nFocusing on year-over-year, sales and trading contributed $4.7 billion to revenue. Versus Q4, that was a 58% improvement, a little higher than typical seasonality. And versus Q1 '21, we saw a decline of 8% as the prior year included higher commodities results due to weather-related events.\nFICC declined 19%, while equities improved 9%. That FICC decline reflects the higher prior period commodities and a weaker credit trading environment. And it was partially offset by improved performance across our macro products, especially rates and foreign exchange. The strength in equities was driven by strong performance in derivatives.\nAnd year-over-year expense declined, reflecting the absence of costs associated with the realignment of a liquidating business activity to the all other unit as well as some Q1 '21 accelerated cost for incentive changes. Absent those impacts, expenses were up modestly.\nFinally, on Slide 19, we show all other, which reported a loss of $364 million, declining $620 million from the year-ago period. Revenue declined as a result of higher volume of deals, particularly solar, and therefore, higher partnership losses on ESG investments, and this is partially offset by the tax impact in this reporting unit.\nExpense increased as a result of costs now recorded here in this segment following the Q4 realignment of that liquidating business out of Global Markets. And as a reminder, for the financial statement presentation in this release, the business segments are all taxed on a standard fully taxable equivalent basis. So in all other, we incorporate the impact of our ESG tax rates and any other unusual items.\nFor the quarter for the company, our effective tax rate was 10%, benefiting from ESG investment tax credits. And excluding the tax credits, the tax rate would have been roughly 24%. We expect our effective tax rate in 2022 to be between 10% to 12%, absent any tax law changes or any unusual items.\nAnd with that, let's open it up, please, for Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this call may be recorded. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn today's conference over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead.\n\nE. Lee McEntire\n\nHead of IR, Bank of America Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Thank you for joining our quarterly earnings call. Good morning to everybody. I'm sure by now, you've all had a chance to review the earnings that were released before 7 this morning. As usual, they're available, including our earnings presentation that we will refer to during the call on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website.\nI'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments; and then we will hear from Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, who will cover the details of the quarter.\nBefore I turn the call over to Brian and Alastair, let me just remind you that we may make some forward-looking statements and refer you to the non-GAAP financial measures during the call regarding various elements of our financial results. Our forward-looking statements that may be made are based on management's current expectations and the assumptions therein and are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nFactors that may cause our actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and the SEC filings that are available on the website. Information about the non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to those, can also be found in our earnings materials that are available on the website.\nSo with that, let me turn it over to Brian, take it away.\n\nBrian Thomas Moynihan\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Bank of America Corporation\n\nThank you, Lee, and good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us again. I hope all of you continue to manage safely through the new variant.\nFirst, I'd like to start this call by recognizing that Paul, our CFO for many years, has now moved on to help us with our efforts helping our customers make a just transition to a low carbon footprint, and I want to thank him for his many years of service. And welcome, Alastair, to the call. Our new CFO has been in that role since November 1, and he's off to a great start, and you're going to hear from him in a minute.\nSo just stepping back on the cover slide. Today, we reported $7 billion in after-tax net income or $0.82 per diluted share. That's up significantly from the year-ago period. This quarter was a repeat of the themes we discussed with you in the last few quarters, the pre-pandemic organic growth engine that is Bank of America is fully back in place and producing success. We had strong organic and responsible growth across all our businesses. We grew revenue and produced positive operating leverage. We continue to see very strong asset quality metrics. We support our clients and our need for capital, and we made further progress in support of local community efforts across all our markets.\nI want to congratulate you -- congratulate importantly and thank our 200,000 teammates around the globe for all the great work they did in 2021 that enable us to deliver for our clients, our team, our shareholders and our communities.\nLet's go to start on Slide 2 and a few comments about our full year results. This quarter capped a record year of $32 billion in earnings for 2021 and represented significant growth in net income over 2020. We even saw a more significant growth in EPS as share count drop. We generated more than $7 billion of earnings in every quarter in 2021.\nRevenue grew 4% year-over-year and activity gained momentum throughout the year. NII grew well in the second half of the year, which complemented fee growth, especially in our markets-related businesses. Wealth Management, investment banking and sales and trading revenues were all strong in '21.\nPausing in NII, recall that in the first quarter 2021, we noted at the time that our expectation is that quarterly NII could progress up by $1 billion per quarter as we entered the fourth quarter. And in fact, we have recorded fourth quarter NII that is $1.2 billion or 12% better than first quarter '21. Our teams managed well through the rate volatility, and we grew loans and deposits with our customers as the year progressed. That sets us up nicely for 2022, and Alastair is going to talk about that in a minute.\nExpense was well managed, but expense did go up as we continue to invest for growth. That's axiomatic. Our COVID-related costs remained elevated and revenue-related costs grew. So while we do not see full year operating leverage, we did, however, return to strong operating leverage in each of the last 2 quarters of the year, restarting our streak that we had before the pandemic.\nCredit remains stellar through 2021. Charge-offs consistently improved each quarter. Our commitment to responsible growth remains well placed. We are growing faster than the market and keeping credit costs in check. The economic improvement and our strong credit allowed us to release much of the reserves we built in 2020.\nWhen you look at the balance sheet, we grew deposits $270 billion in 2021. That was on top of the $360 billion of growth we had in 2020. Our loan growth accelerated throughout the year. Fourth quarter represented the strongest quarter of organic loan growth we have experienced at Bank of America. Now of course, that's absent the first quarter of 2020 at the start of COVID, which had $70 billion of panic drawdowns in a few weeks.\nAt the end of the day, we produced strong ROA and a 17% ROTCE for you, our shareholders, and we returned $32 billion in capital during the year.\nLet's go to Slide 3. The best way to highlight the drivers behind the earnings success is to look at the momentum in client activity across the businesses. This shows organic growth engine is running hard. More and more of this client activity is powered by our digital transformation, which is foundational to everything we do. We are proud of our digital stats and continue to spotlight our results later in the materials as usual, see Pages 24 to 28.\nBut some key stats on this page. Consumers logged into our digital channels more than 2.7 billion times in the fourth quarter alone. Erica, our digital financial assistant, completed more than 400 million requests from our clients in the year 2021. Half our consumer sales were digital in the fourth quarter. 86% of all the check deposit transactions are now digital. Customer use Zelle to transfer $65 billion in the most recent quarter. The number of Zelle transactions now surpasses the checks written by our consumers.\nCash flow approvals by our commercial and corporate clients to move money grew 240% since the pandemic. So the digital journey continues, and that supercharge is our relationship manager-driven model. And together, that has driven the growth in loans and deposits and fees.\nNet new checking accounts have grown in each of the past 12 quarters. This contributes to the continued growth in our core deposits. This also demonstrates the extent of our leadership position with U.S. consumers and deposits. We have $1.4 trillion in deposits from all American consumers.\nOn credit cards at roughly 1 million new accounts in the fourth quarter alone, that's now operating at the same level of new card production as it was pre pandemic. We're going to continue to drive that opportunity.\nWhen you think about consumer investments, Merrill Edge, as we call it, we opened 525,000 new accounts in the year 2021. Those accounts carried when they renew at opening, $70,000 imbalances for each of those accounts. This demonstrates the deep penetration of the mass affluent customer base of America.\nSales of bank products in both Merrill and our Private Bank teams have remained strong. Now when you combine Merrill, the Private Bank and consumer investments, they produced more than $170 billion in net client flows in 2021. In Global Banking, we had record years of investment banking fees combined with strong GTS results. In Global Markets, we saw record equity sales and trading revenue. These are just a few examples of the types of client activity that are driving market share gains for our company.\nAs I've done in the past, I want to spend a few minutes on the broader economy, and I use our own customer data to make a few points. Let's go to Slide 4. First, on consumer spending, I'd offer a few thoughts. We are a provider of choice for individuals and businesses when paying for goods and services. Our award winning and easy-use capabilities across all forms, help clients budget, save, spend and borrow carefully and confidently. We look at all forms of consumer spending, including ACH wires bill pay, P2P cash and checks.\nMany firms and many people discuss credit and debit spending, but as you look at the chart on the lower left-hand side of Page 4, you can see that 80% of the money moves in other form. So what happened in 2021? Well, consumers spent record amounts in context on comparing '21 against the pre-pandemic period of '19. And you can see that in the upper chart on both sides of the page.\nBank of America's 67 million clients made $3.8 trillion in total payments during 2021. That was an increase of 24% over pre-pandemic levels, an all-time high. Fourth quarter in December payments also reached record highs. Fourth quarter payments were up 28% over 2019. The December payments were up 30% over 2019. These are the dollar volume payments, but likewise, the numbers of payments were up double digits also and showing more and more activity.\nJust focused on debit and credit spending for the holiday period of November and December, spending was up 26% over 2019. This data confirms that consumers continue to spend into the holiday season. And so far this year, that strength continues. For all the spending of all types through January 17, 2022, we have seen it up over 11% versus the start of '21, which is well up over '20 and '19. That bodes well for the rest of the year and quarter.\nFocusing on the channels of payment in the lower right-hand chart, that you'd expect cash and check volumes are down 24% for 2021 compared to '19. This simply means more and more customers are using our digital capabilities to achieve their goals each year. Now importantly, though, this allows us to grow our consumer business with lower cost. We believe there's lots of potential spending capacity left as average deposit balances continue to move up to the end of the year despite the heavy spending you see.\nWe had one segment, one cohort of deposits that dipped for 1 month out of the last part of the year. In November, we had a small dip in customers who had $2,000 or less in their balances pre pandemic. They dipped by 1%. Other than that every cohort from June, July, August, September, October, November and December all grew every month. And what's striking is that the balances for people had less than $2,000 average balances before the pandemic, they're now sitting with 5x the balances they had pre pandemic. For those customers at $10,000 in accounts before the pandemic, they're now sitting with 2x in their accounts. The teams track this data carefully and it shows the spending power left in the American consumer.\nAnother economic signpost worth noting with our customer activity was acceleration of loan growth in the fourth quarter. Earlier this year, we -- earlier last year, we talked about the green shoots of loan growth we saw in the first quarter, and we saw that turn into growth as we move through the quarters, culminating with $50 billion in record loan growth this quarter. We note these borrowers, both consumer and commercial, have strong capacity to continue to borrow so desire as lines across the border in low-usage status.\nWe provide Slide 5 to show you the daily outstanding loans again this quarter, which gives you a sense of progression across time. Every loan category saw improvement this quarter except for home equity. But I would draw your attention to on Slide 5 is the addition of the pre-pandemic starting point to give you some reference.\nWith some of the growth this quarter was in Global Markets, and that business even flows with the market activity. $35 billion of that $50 billion was in the core consumer and commercial books. So far in January, the business as other global markets continue to show growth over the end of the year.\nSo let's start and talk about the commercial portfolio where we have moved above the pre-pandemic level for the most recent growth. Commercial loans, excluding PPP, grew $43 billion or 9% linked quarter. Compared to quarter 3, growth this quarter was broad-based across all segments of commercial lending. We saw improvement in both new loans as well as improving utilization from existing clients. This reflects the intense relationship manager effort our teams have done and -- across the last couple of years and adding more and more relationship managers.\nCommercial loans of wealth management clients extended their growth trend this quarter as these customers barred for various liquidity needs for asset purchases. In small business lending, the all-important small business segment, lending activity is running consistently above pre-pandemic levels. And especially in our Practice Solutions Group that supports medical dental and veterinary practices, we continue to see continued momentum and finished one of the best years across all small business with our Business Advantage Rewards cards.\nTurning to consumer loans. Card loans grew $4.6 billion or 6% from quarter 3 levels. This occurred as spending increase and even occurred as payment rates paying off the card completely trended higher for the quarter. Card balances still remain well below the pre-pandemic levels of $95 billion, and we continue to push that opportunity. Mortgage loan levels grew 2% linked quarter as origination remained at high levels and paydown slowed down.\nOn the next, Slide 6, I would like -- I would say that while we deliver capital back to our shareholders, $32 billion, and we invested in our teammates, we also continue to invest in our communities through our local teams across the country focused on our markets. I call out the reference in the bottom of the slide, middle -- bottom middle of Slide 6 to the sweeping changes we announced last week in our NSF policies. These updates continue the work we began over a decade ago to simplify our product set and allow a great experience for our clients and an efficient capability for our operations. Eliminating NSF fees and reducing the overdraft charge per occurrence from $35 to $10 and the other changes we're making is a big win for our clients. It's going to have an obvious impact on those fees, which have fallen dramatically since 2009 and 2010, but currently run about $1 billion in '21, and we'd expect them to drop by 75% over the next year or so.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Alastair.\n\nAlastair M. Borthwick\n\nCFO and Vice Chair of Global Diversity & Inclusion Council, Bank of America Corporation\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to take us to our fourth quarter results on Slide 7, focusing on comparisons against the prior year quarter. And I'll also talk through the high-level commentary on Slide 8.\nAs Brian noted, we produced $7 billion in net income, which grew 28% from fourth quarter '20, while earnings per share of $0.82 improved at a faster 39% pace due to our share repurchases. Looking at our top line improvement on a year-over-year basis, revenue rose 10%. The improvement was driven by a $1.2 billion increase in NII and a little more than $800 million increase in noninterest income. Each business segment produced strong noninterest income results. And as you look at significant components of revenue, it was pretty consistent through the quarters in 2021.\nOne important aspect of responsible growth has been to grow consistently and sustainably. And I think we executed on that in 2021 with investment banking over $2 billion each quarter; sales and training trading near or above $3 billion each quarter; investment and brokerage services revenue over $4 billion each quarter.\nWith regard to expenses, our revenue-related costs increased and we continue to make investments in our people and our capabilities to grow the franchise. At the same time, lower COVID costs and further digital engagement have helped to offset some of those increases. In the fourth quarter, revenue growth outpaced expense growth on a year-over-year basis, which produced operating leverage of 400 basis points and a 19% year-over-year improvement in pretax pre-provision income to $7.3 billion. With regard to returns, our ROTCE was 15%, ROA was 88 basis points, both of which improved nicely over the year.\nMoving to Slide 9. During the quarter, the balance sheet grew $85 billion to a little less than $3.2 trillion, and this reflected the $100 billion of growth in deposits. These deposits funded $51 billion of loans growth. And we also added $14 billion in securities and so our cash increased by $68 billion. Partially offsetting these increases were typical year-end moves in our Global Markets balance sheet.\nOur liquidity portfolio grew to $1.2 trillion or a little more than 1/3 of our balance sheet and shareholders' equity declined $2.4 billion from Q3 driven by the $8.9 billion of capital distributions, which once again outpaced earnings in the fourth quarter as it did in Q3.\nWith regard to our regulatory ratios, CET1 under the standardized approach was 10.6% and remains well above our 9.5% minimum requirement. The CET1 ratio declined 50 basis points from Q3, driven by excess capital reduction as well as an increase in our RWA due to the strong loan growth. And we're happy to see that capital usage increasingly needed to support customers and to fuel their growth, while still producing plenty of capital to return to our shareholders.\nEarnings alone in the most recent quarter contributed 45 basis points to our CET1 ratio before the other capital impacts of share repurchase. Given our deposit growth, our supplemental leverage ratio declined to 5.5% versus a minimum requirement of 5%, which still leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. And our TLAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements.\nTurning to Slide 10. We included the schedule on average loan balances, but in the interest of time, I don't have anything to add beyond what Brian noted earlier.\nMoving to deposits on Slide 11. We continue to see significant growth across the client base as we deepened relationships and added net new accounts across our deposit-taking businesses. Combining both consumer and Wealth Management customer balances, I would highlight that retail deposits grew $48 billion from Q3. Our retail deposits have now grown to nearly $1.4 trillion, and we lead our competitors.\nWe also saw continued strong growth with our commercial clients. And remember, the deposits we're focused on and are gathering are the operational deposits of our customers in both consumer and wholesale.\nTurning to Slide 12 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q3 was $11.4 billion. But I know, as investors, you tend to focus on the FTE NII number, which was $11.5 billion. So focusing on the change on an FTE basis, net interest income increased $1.2 billion from Q4 '20 and or 11%, driven by deposit growth and related investing of liquidity.\nNII versus Q3 of '21 was up $319 million, driven by deposit growth and then higher securities levels as well as loans growth. Premium amortization declined roughly $100 million to $1.3 billion in Q4, and the positive NII impact of lower premium amortization offset lower PPP fees.\nGiven continued deposit growth and low rates, our asset sensitivity to rising rates remains significant. It's modestly lower quarter-over-quarter as long-end rates moved higher, and we recognized some of that sensitivity in our now higher reported level of NII.\nSo I'd like to give you a couple of thoughts on NII expectations for 2022. First, I want to start by reiterating Paul's comment last quarter that we expect to see robust NII growth in 2022 compared to 2021. That assumes we see continued loans growth and the rising rate expectations embedded in the forward curve.\nAnd in the first quarter specifically, we expect 2 headwinds. First, there are 2 less interest accrual days in the quarter. And as a reminder, we picked those back up in the subsequent 2 quarters. Second, we expect less PPP fee benefits. Combined, those 2 headwinds add to about $250 million. Despite those headwinds, we would still expect Q1 to be up about a couple of hundred million from Q4 and should grow nicely each subsequent quarter in 2022. Again, that's, of course, dependent upon the realization of the forward curve and some loans growth.\nLastly, we see the forward curve now expecting a new rate hiking cycle to begin, we added Slide 13, as we thought it might be helpful from a historical context to see the trend of NII across the years since the last rate hike cycle. And what I draw your attention to is the stark difference in the size of our balance sheet today. And because of that balance sheet differential, today's NII is already at the NII level we saw when we were well into the middle of the last rate cycle. And importantly, our short-end asset sensitivity today is twice what it was in the third quarter of 2015 as that cycle began.\nOkay. Let's turn to costs, and we'll use Slide 14 for that discussion. Our Q4 expenses were $14.7 billion, an increase of $291 million from Q3. Higher revenue-related costs, and to a lesser degree, seasonally higher marketing costs drove the increase. As Brian noted at the mid-quarter conference, our Q4 expenses were a bit higher than we anticipated when we ended the last quarter. Revenue continued to hold up well, and the company had a good year, both resulting then in higher incentive costs. Compared to the year-ago period, expense growth was driven by incentive costs associated with all of our markets-related improvements.\nAs we look forward, we continue to invest in technology and people at a high rate across our businesses, and we continue to add new financial centers in expansion and growth markets. So let me say 2 things about 2022 expenses. First, relative to Q4 expense, we expect Q1 to include 2 elements of seasonality. We typically experience seasonally higher payroll tax expense, and that was about $400 million in 2021. Also, Q1 is typically our best period of sales and trading revenue which results in modestly higher associated costs.\nSecond, with regard to full year 2022, our best expectation currently is we can hold expenses flat compared to 2021, which finished just below $60 billion. This guidance incorporates our expected continuing investments, strong revenue performance and the inflationary costs we experienced in the second half of 2021. It also relies upon our continued expense discipline, operational excellence improvements and the benefits of digital transformation to deliver the operating leverage we seek.\nTurning to asset quality on Slide 15. The asset quality of our customers remains very healthy and net charge-offs this quarter fell to a historical low of $362 million or 15 basis points of average loans. They continued a steady decline through the quarters of 2021, with Q4 down $100 million from Q3 and down more than $500 million from Q4 last year.\nOur credit card loss rate was 1.42%, and that's less than half of the pre-pandemic rate. It improved each quarter during the year. Several other loan product categories have been in recovery positions throughout the year. Provision was a $489 million net benefit in Q4, driven primarily by asset quality, and macroeconomic improvement and was partially offset by loans growth. This included a reserve release of $850 million, primarily in our commercial portfolio. And on Slide 16, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios.\nTurning to the business segments. Let's start with Consumer Banking on Slide 17. I'll start by acknowledging what a strong year the Consumer Bank has had as they generated nearly $12 billion of earnings, which is 37% of record year results for the company. Consumer opened over 900,000 net new checking accounts. And in fact, this quarter represents their 12th consecutive quarter of net new consumer checking account growth.\nAnd in turn, consumer grew deposits by more than $140 billion. They opened 3.6 million credit cards and grew card accounts in 2021 by more than any of the past 4 years. This helped card balances grow in Q4 despite payments remaining high.\nThey also opened 525,000 new consumer investment accounts. And that helped us to reach a new record for investment balances of $369 billion, growing 20% year-over-year as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering. Yes, market valuations grew balances, and we also saw $23 billion of client flows since Q4 '20.\nSo Q4 was a strong finish to these results. And in the quarter, the business produced $3.1 billion of earnings off $8.9 billion of revenue and manage costs well. Our 8% revenue growth was led by NII improvement as we continue to recognize more of the value of our deposit book. And while revenue grew, expense declined by 1% year-over-year, generating over 900 basis points of operating leverage. Lower COVID costs and increased digital adoption by clients more than offset our continued investments in people and our franchise. This expense discipline has now driven our cost of deposits to an industry-leading 111 basis points.\nNet charge-offs declined and we had $380 million of reserve release in the quarter. And as you can see, and as I already noted, deposits continued to grow strongly both year-over-year as well as linked quarter. Importantly, our rate paid remained low and stable.\nTurning to the Wealth Management business. Bank of America continued to deliver wealth management at scale across a full range of client segments. The continued economic progress, strong market conditions and the efforts of our advisers contributed to strong client flows and net new household growth. This allowed Wealth Management to generate more than $4 billion in earnings in 2021, up more than 40% from 2020.\nIn Q4, this powerful combination of Merrill Lynch and our Private Bank produced records for revenue, earnings, investment balances and asset management fees as well as record levels of loans and deposits. In fact, with regard to loans, this is the 47th consecutive quarter of average loans growth in the business. It's consistent and it's sustained.\nQ4 net income was $1.2 billion, improving 47% year-over-year and driven by strong revenue growth, good expense controls and lower credit costs. Revenue growth of 16% was led by strong improvements in both AUM and brokerage fees as well as higher NII on the back of solid loan and deposit increases.\nExpenses increased 8% in alignment with the higher revenue and resulted in 800 basis points of operating leverage. Client balances of $3.8 trillion rose $491 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by higher market levels as well as very strong net client flows of $149 billion. Within these flows, deposits grew $68 billion year-over-year to $390 billion, and loans grew $21 billion year-over-year to $212 billion. And that loan and deposit growth is further evidence that more and more Merrill and Private Bank clients are using the bank's products broadly.\nNet new household generation is getting closer to pre-pandemic levels as advisers are meeting in person more with clients and are building their pipelines back following the shutdown during the pandemic. This quarter, Merrill Lynch's net new households of 6,700 and Private Banking relationships net new of 500 were both up more than 30% from the year-ago period. The clients of this business continue to lead our franchise in digital adoption, utilizing digital tools to access their investments and also for other banking needs like mobile check deposits and lending. The evolution is forming a modern Merrill, which is adviser-led and powered by digital.\nMoving to Global Banking on Slide 19. The business momentum through the back half of the year was strong. Net interest income grew on the back of accelerating loans growth. Investment banking fees reached record levels and deposits continue to grow as clients navigated the pandemic. We also saw strong demand from our clients around ESG investments driving improvements in bottom line results. Net income for the full year was a record $9.8 billion or 31% of the company's overall net income.\nThe business earned $2.7 billion in Q4, improving nearly $1 billion year-over-year, driven by higher revenue and lower provision costs, partially offset by higher expenses. Revenue improvement of 24% year-over-year reflected more than 30% growth in investment banking fees in this segment, and net interest income increased 18%.\nThis investment banking performance allowed us to gain market share and record #3 ranking in overall fees in what was a very strong Q4 market. We ranked #1 in investment grade and #2 in leverage finance with market share improvement compared to the year-ago period. And we also saw another record M&A period. And most importantly, our investment banking pipeline remains quite healthy.\nProvision expense reflected a reserve release of $435 million, compared to a $266 million release in the year-ago period. And what I draw your attention to here is the reduction in net charge-offs year-over-year from $314 million in Q4 of '20 to small recoveries in Q4 '21. That year-ago period included some losses from clients in those industries that were heavily impacted by COVID. Finally, given the strength of revenue we saw expenses increase by 12%, which is still only half of our increase in revenue.\nSwitching to Global Markets on Slide 20. Full year net income of $4.6 billion reflects another solid year of sales and trading revenue. This included a record year for equities, up 19% versus 2020. Investments made in this part of the business are seeing good results as our financing clients are doing more business with our company.\nAs we usually do, I'll talk about the segment results, excluding DVA, even though net DVA was negligible in both Q4 '21 and Q4 '20. In Q4, Global Markets produced $667 million in earnings, $167 million lower than the year-ago quarter. Focusing on year-over-year, revenue was modestly down, driven by sales and trading. Sales and trading contributed $2.9 billion to revenue, a decline of 4% year-over-year.\nFICC, down 10% and while equities improved 3%. FICC results reflect a weaker credit trading environment in Q4 '20, and the strength in equities was driven by growth in client financing activities and the multiplier effect. Year-over-year expense move was driven by investments in revenue-related sales and trading costs, partially offset by the absence of costs associated with the realignment of liquidating business activity to the all other units in Q4.\nFinally, on Slide 21, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $673 million, which declined a little more than $250 million from the year-ago period. Revenue declined as a result of higher volume of deals, particularly solar, and partnership losses on ESG investments. That's offset by the tax impact in this reporting unit.\nExpense increased as a result of costs now recorded here after the fourth quarter realignment out of Global Markets, which was partially offset by a decrease in various other expenses in the segment. That realignment obviously had no bottom line impact on our company overall. As a reminder, for the financial statement presentation in this release, the business segments are all taxed on the standard fully taxable equivalent basis. And in All Other, we incorporate the impact of our ESG tax credits and any other unusual items.\nFor the full year, the effective tax rate was 6%. And excluding the second quarter '21 positive tax adjustment triggered by the U.K. tax law change, and other discrete items, the tax rate would have been 14%. Further adjusting for ESG tax credits, our tax rate would have been 25%. And looking forward, we would expect our effective tax rate in 2022 to be between 10% and 12%, absent any tax law changes or unusual items.\nAnd with that, I think I'll stop and we'll open it up for Q&A.",

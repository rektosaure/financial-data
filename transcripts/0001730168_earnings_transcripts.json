Welcome to Broadcom Inc.'s Third Quarter, Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ji Yoo, Head of Investor Relations of Broadcom Inc. Please go ahead.\n\nJiyung Yoo\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Broadcom Inc.\n\nThank you, Sheree, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Hock Tan, President and CEO; Kirsten Spears, Chief Financial Officer; and Charlie Kawwas, President, Semiconductor Solutions Group. Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables after the market close, describing our financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the investor section of Broadcom's website at broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and an audio replay of the call can be accessed for one year through the investor section of Broadcom's website.\nDuring the prepared comments, Hock and Kirsten will be providing details of our third quarter fiscal year 2025 results, guidance for our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, as well as commentary regarding the business environment. We'll take questions after the end of our prepared comments.\nPlease refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. I will now turn the call over to Hock.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nThank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. In our fiscal Q3 2025, total revenue was a record $16 billion, up 22% year-on-year. Revenue growth was driven by better-than-expected strength in AI semiconductor solutions and our continued growth in VMware. Q3 consolidated adjusted EBITDA was a record $10.7 billion, up 30% year-on-year. Looking beyond what we're just reporting this quarter, with robust demand from AI, bookings were extremely strong, and our current consolidated backlog for the company hit a record of $110 billion. Q3 semiconductor revenue was $9.2 billion, as year-on-year growth accelerated to 26% year-on-year.\nThis accelerated growth was driven by AI semiconductor revenue of $5.2 billion, which was up 63% year-on-year and extended the trajectory of robust growth to 10 consecutive quarters. Let me give you more color on our XPU (custom AI accelerators) business, which accelerated to 65% of our AI revenue this quarter.\nDemand for custom AI accelerators from our three customers continued to grow, as each of them journeys at their own pace towards compute self-sufficiency. Progressively, we continue to gain share with these customers. Further to these three customers, as we had previously mentioned, we have been working with other prospects on their own AI accelerators. Last quarter, one of these prospects released production orders to Broadcom Inc., and we have accordingly characterized them as a qualified customer for XPUs and, in fact, have secured over $10 billion of orders of AI racks based on our XPUs.\nReflecting this, we now expect the outlook for our fiscal 2026 AI revenue to improve significantly from what we had indicated last quarter.\nTurning to AI networking, demand continued to be strong because networking is becoming critical as large language model (LLMs) clusters continue to evolve in intelligence and compute clusters have to grow bigger. The network is the computer, and our customers are facing challenges as they scale to clusters beyond 100,000 compute nodes. For instance, scale-up, which we all know about, is a difficult challenge when you're trying to create substantial bandwidth to share memory across multiple GPUs or XPUs within a rack. Today's AI rack scales up a mere 72 GPUs at 28.8 Tbps bandwidth using a proprietary NVLink.\nOn the other hand, earlier this year, we have launched Tomahawk V with OpenEthernet, which can scale up 512 compute nodes for customers using XPUs. Moving on to scaling out across racks, today the current architecture using 51.2 Tbps requires three tiers of networking switches.\nIn June, we launched Tomahawk VI and our Ethernet-based 102 Tbps switch, which flattens the network to two tiers, resulting in lower latency, much less power. When you scale to clusters beyond a single data center footprint, you now need to scale computing across data centers. Over the past two years, we have deployed our Jericho 3 Ethernet router with hyperscale customers to just do this. Today, we have launched our next-generation Jericho 4 Ethernet fabric router with 51.2 Tbps deep buffering, intelligent congestion control to handle clusters beyond 200,000 compute nodes crossing multiple data centers.\nWe know the biggest challenge to deploying larger clusters of compute for generative AI will be in networking. For the past 20 years, what Broadcom has developed for Ethernet networking is entirely applicable to the challenges of scale-up, scale-out, and scale across in generative AI.\nTurning to our forecast, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to make steady progress in growing our AI revenue. For Q4 2025, we forecast AI semiconductor revenue to be approximately $6.2 billion, up 66% year-on-year. Now, turning to non-AI semiconductors, demand continues to be slow to recover. Q3 revenue of $4 billion was flat sequentially. While broadband showed strong sequential growth, enterprise networking and server storage were down sequentially. Wireless and industrial were flat quarter on quarter, as we expect.\nIn contrast, in Q4, driven by seasonality, we forecast non-AI semiconductor revenue to grow low double digits sequentially to approximately $4.6 billion. Broadband, server storage, and wireless are expected to improve, while enterprise networking remains down quarter on quarter. Now, let me talk about our infrastructure software segment.\nQ3 infrastructure software revenue of $6.8 billion was up 17% year-on-year, above our outlook of $6.7 billion as bookings continue to be strong during the quarter. We broke, in fact, total contract value over $8.4 billion during Q3. Here's what I'm most excited about. After two years of engineering development by over 5,000 developers, we delivered on a promise when we acquired VMware. We released VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0, a fully integrated cloud platform which can be deployed by enterprise customers on-prem or carried to the cloud. It enables enterprises to run any application workload, including AI workloads, on virtual machines and on modern containers.\nThis provides the real alternative to public cloud. In Q4, we expect infrastructure software revenue to be approximately $6.7 billion, up 15% year-on-year.\nIn summary, continued strength in AI and VMware will drive our guidance for Q4 consolidated revenue to approximately $17.4 billion, up 24% year-on-year. We expect Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be 67% of revenue. With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nCFO and CAO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nThank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q3 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was a record $16 billion for the quarter, up 22% from a year ago. Gross margin was 78.4% of revenue in the quarter, better than we originally guided on higher software revenues and product mix within semiconductors. Consolidated operating expenses were $2 billion, of which $1.5 billion was research and development. Q3 operating income was a record $10.5 billion, up 32% from a year ago. On a sequential basis, even as gross margin was down 100 basis points on revenue mix, operating margin increased 20 basis points sequentially to 65.5% on operating leverage.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $10.7 billion, or 67% of revenue, was above our guidance of 66%. This figure excludes $142 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our two segments, starting with semiconductors.\nRevenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $9.2 billion, with growth accelerating to 26% year-on-year, driven by AI. Semiconductor revenue represented 57% of total revenue in the quarter. Gross margin for our semiconductor solutions segment was approximately 67%, down 30 basis points year-on-year on product mix. Operating expenses increased 9% year-on-year to $961 million on increased investment in R&D for leading-edge AI semiconductors. Semiconductor operating margin of 57% was up 130 basis points year-on-year and flat sequentially. Now moving on to infrastructure software.\nRevenue for infrastructure software of $6.8 billion was up 17% year-on-year and represented 43% of revenue. Gross margin for infrastructure software was 93% in the quarter compared to 90% a year ago. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of approximately 77%. This compares to operating margin of 67% a year ago, reflecting the completion of the integration of VMware.\nMoving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $7 billion and represented 44% of revenue. We spent $142 million on capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding were 37 days in the third quarter compared to 32 days a year ago. We ended the third quarter with inventory of $2.2 billion, up 8% sequentially in anticipation of revenue growth next quarter. Our days of inventory on hand were 66 days in Q3 compared to 69 days in Q2, as we continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the third quarter with $10.7 billion of cash and $66.3 billion of gross principal debt.\nThe weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $65.8 billion in fixed-rate debt is 3.9% and 6.9 years, respectively.\nThe weighted average interest rate and years to maturity of our $500 million in floating rate debt is 4.7% and 0.2 years, respectively. Turning to capital allocation. In Q3, we paid stockholders $2.8 billion of cash dividends based on a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.59 per share. In Q4, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 4.97 billion shares, excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases. Now moving to guidance. Our guidance for Q4 is for consolidated revenue of $17.4 billion, up 24% year-on-year. We forecast semiconductor revenue of approximately $10.7 billion, up 30% year-on-year.\nWithin this, we expect Q4 AI semiconductor revenue of $6.2 billion, up 66% year-on-year. We expect infrastructure software revenue of approximately $6.7 billion, up 15% year-on-year.\nFor your modeling purposes, we expect Q4 consolidated gross margin to be down approximately 70 basis points sequentially, primarily reflecting a higher mix of XPUs and also wireless revenue. As a reminder, consolidated gross margins through the year will be impacted by the revenue mix of infrastructure software and semiconductors and product mix within semiconductors. We expect Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be 67%. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate for Q4 and fiscal year 2025 to remain at 14%. I will now pass the call back to Hock for some more exciting news.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nI don't know about exciting, Kirsten, but I do. I thought before we move to questions, I should share an update. The board and I have agreed that I will continue as the CEO of Broadcom through 2030, at least. These are exciting times for Broadcom, and I'm very enthusiastic to continue to drive value for our shareholders. Operator, please open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. To ask a question, you will need to press star 11 on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press star 11 again. Due to time restraints, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question will come from the line of Ross Seymour with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nRoss Seymour\n\nSemiconductor Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for asking the question. Hock, thank you for sticking around for a few more years. I just wanted to talk about the AI business and specifically the XPU. When you said you're going to grow significantly faster than what you had thought a quarter ago, what's changed? Is it just the impressive prospect moving to a customer definition, so that $10 billion backlog that you mentioned? Is it stronger demand across the existing three customers? Any detail on that would be helpful.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nI think it's both, Ross, but to a large extent, it's the fourth customer that we now add on to our roster, which we will ship pretty strongly in 2026, beginning 2026, I should say. It's a combination of increasing volumes from our existing three customers, and we move through that very progressively and steadily. The addition of a fourth customer with immediate and fairly substantial demand really changes our thinking of what 2026 would be starting to look like.\n\nRoss Seymour\n\nSemiconductor Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nEquity Research, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nHi, good afternoon. Congratulations on a well-executed quarter and a strong free cash flow. I know everybody's going to ask a lot of questions on AI, Hock. I'm going to ask about the non-AI semiconductor business. If I look at your guidance for Q4, it looks like the non-AI semiconductor business is going to be down about 7%, 8% year-over-year in fiscal 2025 if you hit the midpoint of the Q4 guidance. Good news is that the negative year-over-year trends have been improving through the year. In fact, I think you guys are going to be positive year-over-year in the fourth quarter. You've characterized it as relatively close to the cyclical bottom, relatively slow to recover.\nHowever, we have seen some green shoots of positivity, right? Broadband, server storage, enterprise networking, you're still driving the DOCSIS 4.0 upgrade in broadband cable.\nYou've got next-gen PON upgrades in China and the U.S. in front of you. Enterprise spending on network upgrades is accelerating. Near term, from the cyclical bottom, how should we think about the magnitude of the cyclical upturn? Given your 30-40 week lead times, are you seeing continued order improvements in the non-AI segment, which would point you to continued cyclical recovery into next fiscal year?\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nIf you take a look at that non-AI segment, you're right. From a year-on-year Q4 guidance, we are actually up, as you say, slightly, a couple 1% or 2% from a year ago. It's not much really to shout about at this point. The big issue is the puts and takes. The puts and takes and the bottom line to all this is, other than seasonality that we perceive, if you look at it short term, we are looking year-on-year, but looking sequentially, we see in things like wireless, and we even start to see some seasonality in server storage these days. It kind of all washes out so far. The only consistent trend we've seen over the last three quarters that is moving up strongly is broadband.\nNothing else, if you look at it from a cyclical point of view, seems to be able to sustain an uptrend so far. I don't think it's getting, but as a whole, they're not getting worse, as you pointed out, Harlan. They're not showing a V-shaped recovery as a whole that we would like to see and expect to see in cyclical semiconductor cycles. The only thing that gives us some hope is broadband at this point, and it is recovering very strongly. It was the business that was most impacted in the sharp downturn of 2024 and early 2025. Again, one takes that with a grain of salt. The best answer for you is non-AI semiconductor is kind of slow to recover, as I said.\nQ4 year-on-year is up maybe a low single digit is the best way to describe it at this point.\nI'm expecting to see more of a U-shaped recovery in non-AI, and perhaps by late 2020s, mid 2026, late 2026, we start to see some meaningful recovery. As of right now, not clear.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nEquity Research, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nAre you starting to see that in your order trend, in your order book, just because your lead times are like 40 weeks, right?\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nWe are. We've been tricked before, we are. The bookings are up, and they're up year-on-year in excess of 20%. Nothing like what AI bookings look like, but 23% is still pretty good, right?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Senior Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nThanks for taking my question, and best wishes, Hock, for the next part of your tenure. My question is on, you know, if you could help us quantify what is the new fiscal 2026 AI guidance, because I think the last call you mentioned, fiscal 2026 could grow at the 60% growth rate. What is the updated number? Is it, you know, 60%+ the $10 billion that you mentioned? Related to that, do you expect the custom versus networking mix to stay broadly what it has been this past year or evolve more towards custom? Any quantification and this, you know, networking versus custom mix would be really helpful for fiscal 2026.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nOkay, let's answer the first part first. If I could be so bold as to suggest to you when I last quarter, when I said, hey, the trend of growth of 2026 will mirror that of 2025, which is 50%, 60% year-on-year. That's really all I said. I didn't quote, but of course, it comes up 50%, 60% because that's what 2025 is. All I'm saying, if you want to put another way of looking at what I'm saying, which is perhaps more accurate, is we're seeing the growth rate accelerate as opposed to just remain steady at that 50%, 60%. We are expecting and seeing 2026 to accelerate more than the growth rate we see in 2025.\nI know you love me to throw in a number at you, but you know what? We're not supposed to be giving you a forecast for 2026.\nThe best way to describe it, it will be fairly material improvement.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Senior Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nThe networking versus custom?\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nGood point. Thanks for reminding me. As we see, and a big part of this driver of growth will be XPUs. At the risk of repeating what I said in my remarks, it comes from the fact that we continue to gain share at our three original customers. They are on their journey, and each passing generation, they go more to XPUs. We are gaining share from these three. We now have the benefit of an additional fourth significant customer. I should say fourth and very significant customer. That combination will mean more XPUs.\nAs I said, as the ratio, as we create more and more XPUs among four guys, the networking, we get the networking with these four guys, but now the mix of networking from outside these four guys will now be a smaller, be diluted, be a smaller share.\nI expect actually networking percentage of the pool to be a declining percentage going into 2026.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Senior Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nThank you, Hock.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could help me parse out this $110 billion backlog. Did I hear that number right? Could you give us some color on the makeup of that? How far out does that go? How much of that $110 billion is AI versus non-AI versus software?\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nStacy, we generally don't break our backlog. I'm just giving you a total number to give you a sense of how strong the business is as a whole for the company. It's largely driven by AI in terms of growth. Software continues to add on a steady basis, and non-AI, as I indicated, has grown double digits. Nothing compared to AI, which has grown very strongly. Give you a sense, perhaps fully 50% of it at least is semiconductors.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nOkay. It's fair to say that of that semiconductor piece, it's going to be much more AI than non-AI.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nRight.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nYeah, got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open.\n\nBen Reitzes [Managing Director\n\nHead of Technology Research] (Melius Research)\n\nHey, guys. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Hock, congrats on being able to guide to the AI revenue well above 60% for next year. I wanted to be a little greedy and ask you about maybe 2027 and the other three customers or so. How's the dialogue going beyond these four customers? In the past, you've talked about having seven. Now we've added a fourth to production, and then there were three. Are you hearing from others? How's the trend going maybe with the other three, maybe beyond 2026 into 2027 and beyond? How's that momentum, you think, going to shape up? Thanks so much.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nYou are definitely greedy and definitely overthinking this for me. Thank you. That's asking for subjective qualification. Frankly, I don't want to give that. I'm not comfortable giving that because sometimes we stumble into production in time frames that are fairly unexpected, surprisingly. Equally, it could get delayed. I'd rather not give you any more color on prospects than to tell you these prospects are real prospects and continue to be very closely engaged towards developing each of their own XPUs with every intent of going into substantial production, like the four we have today who are customers.\n\nBen Reitzes [Managing Director\n\nHead of Technology Research] (Melius Research)\n\nYeah, you still think that 1 million units by, you know, goal for these seven, though, is still intact?\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nFor the three, I said. Now they're four. That's still only for the customers. For the prospects, no comment. I'm not positioned to judge on that. For our three, four customers now, yes.\n\nBen Reitzes [Managing Director\n\nHead of Technology Research] (Melius Research)\n\nAll right, thanks a lot. Congrats.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSIEM Category Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Hock, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color, not necessarily on the prospects which you still have in the pipeline, but how you view the universe of additional prospects beyond the seven customers and prospects you've already identified. Do you still see there being additional prospects that would be worthy of a custom chip? I know you've been relatively circumspect in terms of the number of customers that are out there and the volume that they can provide and selective in terms of the opportunities you're interested in. Maybe frame for us the additional prospects as you see them beyond these seven.\nThank you.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nThat's a very good question. Let me answer it in a fairly broader basis. As I said before, and perhaps repeat a bit more, we look at this market in two broad segments. One is simply the parties, the customers who develop their own large language model. The rest of the other market I consider is collectively lumped as enterprise. That is, markets that will run AI workloads for enterprise, whether it's on-prem or GPU, XPU, or whatever as a service, the enterprise. We don't address that market, to be honest. We don't. That's because that's a hard market for us to address, and we're not set up to address that. We instead address this large language model market.\nAs I said many times before, it's a very few narrow markets, few players driving frontier models on a consistent, on a very accelerated trend towards superintelligence for one, plagiarizing the term of someone else, but you know what I mean. They are the other parties who would invest, who need to invest a lot initially, my view, on training, training of ever larger and larger clusters of ever more capable accelerators. Also, as for these parties, they have to be accountable to shareholders or accountable to being able to create cash flows that can sustain their path. They start to also invest in inference in a massive way to monetize their models. These are the players we work with.\nThese are individually people or players who spend a lot of money on a lot of compute capacity. It's just that there are only so few of them.\nI have indicated, identified seven, four of which now are customers, three continue to be prospects we engage with. We're very careful, I should say, shouldn't use the word picky, careful who qualifies under that. I indicated it. They are building a platform or have a platform and are investing very much on leading large language models. We have seven, and I think that's about it. We may see one more, perhaps, as a prospect. Again, we are very thoughtful and careful about even making that qualification. Right now, for sure, we have seven. That, for now, is pretty much what we have.\n\nRoss Seymour\n\nSemiconductor Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nThomas O'Malley\n\nEquity Research Director, Barclays Investment Bank\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the really good results. I wanted to ask on the Jericho 4 commentary. Nvidia talked about the XGS switch and now is talking about scale across. You're talking about Jericho 4. It sounds like this market is really starting to develop. Maybe you could talk about when you see material uplift in revenue there and why it's important to start thinking about those types of switches as we move more towards inferencing. Thank you, Hock.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks for picking that up. Yes, scale across is the new term now, right, thrown in. There's scale-up, which is within the rack, you know, within the rack, which is computing within the rack, scale-out, doing across racks, but within the data center. Now when you get to clusters that are, I'm not 100% sure where the cutoff is, but say above 100,000 GPU or XPUs, that's you're talking about probably in many cases because of limitation of power shell that the data center that you don't do one single data center footprint site to sit with over 100,000 of those XPUs in one site. Power may not be easily available. Land may not be. It's cumbersome.\nMany outcomes, most of all our customers now we see, create multiple data center sites close at hand, not far away, within range 100 km.\nIt's kind of the level, but be able to then put in homogeneous XPUs or GPUs in these multiple locations, three or four, and network across them so that they behave like, in fact, a single cluster. That's the coolest part. That technology, which requires, because of distance, deep buffering, very intelligent congestion control, is technology that exists for many, many years in the likes of the telcos of AT&T and Verizon doing network routing, except this is for even somewhat more trickier workloads, but the same. We've been shipping that to a couple of hyperscalers over the last two years as Jericho 3.\nAs the scale of these clusters and the bandwidth required for AI training expands, we now launched this Jericho 4, 51 Tbps to handle more bandwidth. Same technology we have tested, proven for the last 10, 20 years. Nothing new.\nDon't need to create something new for that. It's running on Ethernet and very proven, very stable. As I said, last two years under Jericho 3, which runs 256 connections and no compute nodes, we've been selling to a couple of our hyperscale customers.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\n\nKarl Ackerman\n\nManaging Director, BNP Paribas\n\nYeah, thank you. Hock, have you completely converted your top 10,000 accounts from vSphere to the entire vSphere Cloud Foundation virtualization stack? I ask because I think last quarter, 87% of accounts had adopted that, and that's certainly a marked increase versus less than 10% of those customers who bought the entire suite before the deal. As you address that, what interest level are you seeing with the longer tail of enterprise customers adopting vCF? Are you seeing tangible cross-selling benefits of your merchant semiconductor storage and networking business as those customers adopt VMware? Thank you.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nOkay. To answer your first part of the question, yeah, pretty much virtually way over 90% has bought vCF. I'm careful about the choice of what because we have sold them on it and they've bought licenses to deploy it. It doesn't mean they're fully deployed. Here comes the other part of our work, which is to take these 10,000 customers or a big chunk of them who have taken, who have bought the vision of a private cloud on-prem and working with them to enable them to deploy it and operate it successfully on their infrastructure on-prem. That's the hard work over the next two years that we see happening.\nAs we do it, we see expansion across the IT footprint on vCF private cloud running on their data set within their data center. That's the key part of it. We see that continuing.\nThat's the second phase of my VMware story. The first phase is convince these people to convert from perpetual subscription and in so doing purchase vCF. The second phase now is make that purchase they made on vCF create the value they look for in private cloud on their premise, on their IT data centers. That's what's happening. That will sustain for quite a while because on top of that, we will start selling advanced services, security, disaster recovery, even AI, running AI workloads on it. All that is very exciting. Your second question is, is that able to enable me to sell more hardware?\nNo. It's quite independent. In fact, as they virtualize their data centers, we consciously accept the fact that we are commoditizing the underlying hardware in the data center, commoditizing servers, commoditizing storage, commoditizing even networking. That's fine.\nBy so commoditizing, we're actually reducing the cost of investments in hardware in data centers for enterprises. Now, beyond the largest 10,000, are we seeing a lot of success? We are seeing some. Again, two reasons why we do not expect it to be a necessary success. One is the value, the TCO, as they call it, that comes from it will be much less. The more important thing is the skill sets that need to not just deploy, that you can get services and ourselves to help them, but to keep operating it might not be something that they can take on. We shall see. This is an area we're still learning, and it'll be interesting to see. VMware has 300,000 customers.\nWe see the top 10,000 as making for as being people where it makes a lot of sense, derive a lot of value in deploying private cloud using vCF. We now are looking at whether the next 20,000, 30,000 mid-sized companies see the same way. Stay tuned. I'll let you know.\n\nRoss Seymour\n\nSemiconductor Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nVery clear. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. That will come from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping to focus on gross margins. I understand that the guide down 70 basis points, particularly with software lower sequentially and greater contributions from wireless and XPU. To hit that 77.7%, I either have to model semiconductor margins flat, which I would think would be lower, or software gross margins to 95%, up 200 basis points. Can you kind of help me better understand the moving parts there to allow only a 70 basis points drop?\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nCFO and CAO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nTPUs will be going up along with wireless, as I said on the call. Software revenue will be coming up just a bit as well.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYou mean XPUs?\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nCFO and CAO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nXPUs, yes.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment.\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nCFO and CAO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nWireless is typically our heaviest quarter, right, of the year for wireless. You have wireless and TPUs with generally lower margins, right, and then our software revenue coming up.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nSemiconductor Industry Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. In terms of the fourth customer, I think you've talked in the past about potential customers four and five were more hyperscale, and six and seven were more like, you know, the LLM makers themselves. Can you give us a sense for if you could help us categorize that? If not, that's fine. The $10 billion of orders, can you give us a timeframe on that? Thank you.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nYeah, it's towards the end of the day, all seven do LLMs. Not all of them have a current, have the huge platform we're talking about, but one could imagine eventually all of them will have or create a platform. It's hard to differentiate the two. Coming on the second and third, and the delivery of the $10 billion will probably be in around, I would say, the second half of our fiscal year 2026. I would say, to be even more precise, likely to be Q3 of our fiscal 2026.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nSemiconductor Industry Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nQ3, it starts, or Q3, what timeframe does it take to deploy $10 billion?\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nIt starts and ends in Q3.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nSemiconductor Industry Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. All right. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowan. Your line is open.\n\nJoshua Buchalter [Director\n\nSenior Analyst, Semiconductors Equity Research] (Cowen Inc.)\n\nHey, guys. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the results. I was hoping you could provide some comments on momentum for scale-up Ethernet and how it compares with, you know, UALink and PCIe solutions out there. How big of a, how meaningful is it to have the Tomahawk Ultra product out there with a lower latency? How meaningful do you think the scale-up Ethernet opportunity could be over the next year as we think about your AI networking business? Thank you.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nThat's a good question. We ourselves are thinking about that too, because to begin with, our Ethernet solutions are very disaggregated from the AI accelerators anybody does. It's separate. We treat them as separate. Even though you're right, the network is the computer. We have always believed that Ethernet is open source. Anybody should be able to have choices, and we keep it separate from our XPU. The truth of the matter is, for our customers who use the XPU, we develop and we optimize our networking switches and other components that relate to being able to network signals in any clusters hand in hand with it.\nIn fact, all these XPUs have developed with interface that handles Ethernet, very, very much so. In a way, with XPUs, with our customers, we are openly enabling Ethernet as a networking protocol of choice, very, very openly.\nIt need not be our Ethernet switches. It could be any other, but somebody else's Ethernet switch that does it. It just happens to be we're the lead in this business, so we get that. Beyond it, especially when it comes to a closed system of GPUs, we see less of it, except in the hyperscalers, where the hyperscalers are able to architect their GPUs clusters very separate from the networking side, especially in scale-out. In which case, on those hyperscalers, we sell a lot of these Ethernet switches that do scaling out. We suspect when it goes to scaling across now, even more Ethernet that are disaggregated from the GPUs that are in the place.\nAs far as XPUs are concerned, for sure, it's all Ethernet.\n\nRoss Seymour\n\nSemiconductor Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\n\nChristopher Rolland\n\nSemiconductor Analyst, Susquehanna International Group\n\nThank you for the question and congrats on the contract extension, Hock. My questions are about competition, both on the networking side and the ASIC side. You kind of answered some of that, I think, in the last question. Do you view any competition on the ASIC side, particularly from U.S. or Asian vendors, or do you think this is decreasing? On the networking side, do you think UALink or PCIe even has a chance of displacing SUE in 2027 when it's expected to ramp? Thanks.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nThank you for embracing SUE. Thank you. I didn't expect that to come out, and I appreciate that. You know I'm biased, to be honest. It's so obvious, I can't help but being biased because Ethernet is well proven. Ethernet is so known to the engineers, the architects that sit in all these hyperscalers developing, designing AI data centers, AI infrastructure. It's the logical thing for them to use. They are using it, and they are focusing on it. The development of separate individualized protocols, frankly, it's beyond my imagination why they bought it. Ethernet is there. It's been well used. It's proven it can keep going up.\nThe only thing people talk about is perhaps latency, especially in scaling up, hence the emergence of NVLink. Even then, as I indicated, it's not hard for us, and we are not the only ones who can do that.\nQuite a few others in Ethernet can do it in the switches. You can just tweak the switches to make the latency super good, better than NVLink, better than InfiniBand, less than 250 ns easily. That's what we did. It's not that hard. Perhaps I say that because we have been doing it as the Ethernet has been around the last 25 years at length. It's there, the technology. There's no need to go and create some cook-up protocol that now you have to bring people around. Ethernet is the way to go, and there's plenty of competition too because it's an open-source system. I think Ethernet is the way to go.\nFor sure, in developing XPUs for our customers, all these XPUs with the agreement of customers are made compatible interface with Ethernet and not some fancy other interface that one has to keep going as bandwidth increases.\nI assure you, we have competition, which is one of the reasons why the hyperscalers like Ethernet. It's not just us. They can find somebody else if for whatever reason they don't like us, and we're open to that. It's always good to do that. It's an open-source system, and there are players in that market, not any closed system. Switching on to XPU competition, yeah, we hear about competition and all that. It's just that it's a competition that's an area that we always see competition. Our only way to secure our position is we try to out-invest and out-innovate anybody else in this game. We have been fortunate to be the first one creating this XPU model of ASICs on silicon.\nWe also have been fortunate to be probably one of the largest IP developers of semiconductor out there.\nThings like serializer, deserializer sets, being able to develop the best packaging, being able to design things that are very low power. We just have to keep investing in it, which we do, to outrun the competition in this space. I believe we're doing a fairly decent job of doing it at this point.\n\nChristopher Rolland\n\nSemiconductor Analyst, Susquehanna International Group\n\nVery clear. Thanks, Hock.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We do have time for one last question. That will come from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nHarsh Kumar\n\nSenior Research Anayst, Piper Jaffray\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in, Hock. Congratulations on all the exciting AI metrics, and thanks for everything you do for Broadcom and sticking around. Hock, my question is, you've got three to four existing customers that are ramping. As the data centers for AI clusters get bigger and bigger, it makes sense to have differentiation, efficiency, et cetera. Therefore, the case for XPUs. Why should I not think that your XPU share at these three or four customers that are existing will be bigger than the GPU share in the longer term?\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nIt will be. It's a logical conclusion, Hash. You're correct. We are seeing that step by step. As I said, it's a journey. It's a multi-year journey because it's multigenerational, because these XPUs don't stay still either. I'm doing multiple versions, at least two versions, two-generation versions for each of these customers we have. With each newer generation, they increase the consumption, the usage of the XPU. As they gain confidence, as the model improves, they deploy it even more.\nThat's the logical trend that XPUs will keep in these few customers of ours, whereas they have successfully deployed and their software stabilizes, the software stack, the library that sits on these chips stabilizes and proves itself out. They will have the confidence to keep using a higher and higher % of their compute footprint in their own XPUs, for sure. We see that.\nThat's why I say we progressively gain share.\n\nHarsh Kumar\n\nSenior Research Anayst, Piper Jaffray\n\nThank you, Hock.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ji Yoo, Head of Investor Relations, for any closing remarks.\n\nJiyung Yoo\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Broadcom Inc.\n\nThank you, Sharice.

Joining me on today's call are Hock Tan, President and CEO, Kirsten Spears, Chief Financial Officer, and Charlie Kawwas, President, Semiconductor Solutions Group. Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables after the market closed, describing our financial performance for the Q2 of fiscal year 2025. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the investor section of Broadcom's website at broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and an audio replay of the call can be accessed for one year through the investor section of Broadcom's website.\nDuring the prepared comments, Hock and Kirsten will be providing details of our Q2 fiscal year 2025 results, guidance for our Q3 of fiscal year 2025, as well as commentary regarding the business environment. We'll take questions after the end of our prepared comments. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.\nIn addition to US GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the table attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. I will now turn the call over to Hock.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nThank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. In our fiscal Q2 2025, total revenue was a record $15 billion, up 20% year-on-year. This 20% year-on-year growth was all organic, as Q2 last year was the first full quarter with VMware. Now, revenue was driven by continued strength in AI semiconductors and the momentum we have achieved in VMware. Now, reflecting excellent operating leverage, Q2 consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $10 billion, up 35% year-on-year. Now, let me provide more color. Q2 semiconductor revenue was $8.4 billion, with growth accelerating to 17% year-on-year, up from 11% in Q1.\nAnd of course, driving this growth was AI semiconductor revenue of over $4.4 billion, which is up 46% year-on-year and continues the trajectory of nine consecutive quarters of strong growth. Within this, custom AI accelerators grew double digits year-on-year, while AI networking grew over 170% year-on-year. AI networking, which is based on Ethernet, was robust and represented 40% of our AI revenue. As a standards-based open protocol, Ethernet enables one single fabric for both scale-out and scale-up, and remains the preferred choice by our hyperscale customers.\nOur networking portfolio of Tomahawk switches, Jericho routers, and NICs is what's driving our success within AI clusters in hyperscalers. The momentum continues with our breakthrough Tomahawk 6 switch just announced this week. This represents the next generation 102.4 Tb per second switch capacity. Tomahawk 6 enables clusters of more than 100,000 AI accelerators to be deployed in just two tiers instead of three. This flattening of the AI cluster is huge because it enables much better performance in training next generation frontier models through a lower latency, higher bandwidth, and lower power.\nTurning to XPUs, our custom accelerators, we continue to make excellent progress on the multi-year journey of enabling our three customers and four prospects to deploy custom AI accelerators. As we had articulated over six months ago, we eventually expect at least three customers to each deploy 1 million AI accelerator clusters in 2027, largely for training their frontier models. We forecast and continue to do so, a significant percentage of these deployments to be custom XPUs. These partners are still unwavering in their plan to invest despite this certain economic environment.\nIn fact, what we've seen recently is that they are doubling down on inference in order to monetize their platforms. And reflecting this, we may actually see an acceleration of XPU demand into the back half of 2026 to meet urgent demand for inference on top of the demand we have indicated from training. And accordingly, we do anticipate now our fiscal 2025 growth rate of AI semiconductor revenue to sustain into fiscal 2026. Turning to our Q3 outlook, as we continue our current trajectory of growth, we forecast AI semiconductor revenue to be $5.1 billion, up 60% year-on-year, which would be the 10th consecutive quarter of growth.\nNow, turning to non-AI semiconductors in Q2, revenue of $4 billion was down 5% year-on-year. Non-AI semiconductor revenue is close to the bottom, has been relatively slow to recover, but there are bright spots. In Q2, broadband, enterprise networking, and server storage revenues were up sequentially. However, industrial was down, and as expected, wireless was also down due to seasonality. In Q3, we expect enterprise networking and broadband to continue to grow sequentially, but server storage, wireless, and industrial are expected to be largely flat. Overall, we forecast non-AI semiconductor revenue to stay around $4 billion.\nNow, let me talk about our infrastructure software segment. Q2 infrastructure software revenue of $6.6 billion was up 25% year-on-year, above our outlook of $6.5 billion. As we have said before, this growth reflects our success in converting our enterprise customers from perpetual vSphere to the full VCF software stack subscription. Customers are increasingly turning to VCF to create a modernized private cloud on-prem, which will enable them to repatriate workloads from public clouds while being able to run modern container-based applications and AI applications. Of our 10,000 largest customers, over 87% have now adopted VCF.\nThe momentum from strong VCF sales over the past 18 months since the acquisition of VMware has created annual recurring revenue, or otherwise known as ARR, growth of double digits in our core infrastructure software. In Q3, we expect infrastructure software revenue to be approximately $6.7 billion, up 16% year-on-year. In total, we're guiding Q3 consolidated revenue to be approximately $15.8 billion, up 21% year-on-year. We expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be at least 66%. With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nCFO, Broadcom\n\nThank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q2 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was a record $15 billion for the quarter, up 20% from a year ago. Gross margin was 79.4% of revenue in the quarter, better than we originally guided on product mix. Consolidated operating expenses were $2.1 billion, of which $1.5 billion was related to R&D. Q2 operating income of $9.8 billion was up 37% from a year ago, with operating margin at 65% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $10 billion, or 67% of revenue, above our guidance of 66%. This figure excludes $142 million of depreciation. Now, a review of the P&L for our two segments, starting with semiconductors.\nRevenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $8.4 billion, with growth accelerating to 17% year-on-year, driven by AI. Semiconductor revenue represented 56% of total revenue in the quarter. Gross margin for our semiconductor solution segment was approximately 69%, up 140 basis points year-on-year, driven by product mix. Operating expenses increased 12% year-on-year to $971 million on increased investment in R&D for leading-edge AI semiconductors. Semiconductor operating margin of 57% was up 200 basis points year-on-year. Now, moving on to infrastructure software.\nRevenue for infrastructure software of $6.6 billion was up 25% year-on-year and represented 44% of total revenue. Gross margin for infrastructure software was 93% in the quarter, compared to 88% a year ago. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of approximately 76%. This compares to operating margin of 60% a year ago. This year-on-year improvement reflects our disciplined integration of VMware. Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $6.4 billion and represented 43% of revenue.\nFree cash flow as a percentage of revenue continues to be impacted by increased interest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition and increased cash taxes. We spent $144 million on capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding were 34 days in the Q2, compared to 40 days a year ago. We ended the Q2 with inventory of $2 billion, up 6% sequentially in anticipation of revenue growth in future quarters. Our days of inventory on hand were 69 days in Q2, as we continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the Q2 with $9.5 billion of cash and $69.4 billion of gross principal debt.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we repaid $1.6 billion of debt, resulting in gross principal debt of $67.8 billion. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $59.8 billion in fixed-rate debt is 3.8% and seven years, respectively. The weighted average interest rate and years to maturity of our $8 billion in floating-rate debt is 5.3% and 2.6 years, respectively. Turning to capital allocation, in Q2, we paid stockholders $2.8 billion of cash dividends based on a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.59 per share. In Q2, we repurchased $4.2 billion, or approximately 25 million shares of common stock.\nIn Q3, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 4.97 billion shares, excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases. Now, moving on to guidance. Our guidance for Q3 is for consolidated revenue of $15.8 billion, up 21% year-on-year. We forecast semiconductor revenue of approximately $9.1 billion, up 25% year-on-year. Within this, we expect Q3 AI semiconductor revenue of $5.1 billion, up 60% year-on-year. We expect infrastructure software revenue of approximately $6.7 billion, up 16% year-on-year.\nFor modeling purposes, we expect Q3 consolidated gross margin to be down approximately 130 basis points sequentially, primarily reflecting a higher mix of XPUs within AI revenue. As a reminder, consolidated gross margins through the year will be impacted by the revenue mix of infrastructure software and semiconductors. We expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be at least 66%. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate for Q3 in fiscal year 2025 to remain at 14%. And with this, that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. To ask a question, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. Due to time constraints, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Hock, I wanted to jump onto the AI side and specifically some of the commentary you had about next year. Can you just give a little bit more color on the inference commentary you gave? Is it more the XPU side, the connectivity side, or both that's giving you the confidence to talk about the growth rate that you have this year being matched next fiscal year?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nThank you, Ross. Good question. I think we're indicating that what we are seeing and what we have quite a bit of visibility increasingly is increased deployment of XPUs next year, much more than we originally thought, and hand in hand with it, of course, more and more networking. So it's a combination of both.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThe inference side of things?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nYeah. We're seeing much more inference now.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, and great job on the quarterly execution. Hock, good to see the positive growth inflection quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year growth rates in your AI business. As the team has mentioned, the quarters can be a bit lumpy. So if I smooth out kind of first three quarters of this fiscal year, your AI business is up 60% year-over-year. It's kind of right in line with your three-year kind of SAM growth CAGR, right? Given your prepared remarks and knowing that your lead times remain at 35 weeks or better, do you see the Broadcom team sustaining the 60% year-over-year growth rate exiting this year?\nI assume that that potentially implies that you see your AI business sustaining the 60% year-over-year growth rate into fiscal 2026, again, based on your prepared commentary, which again is in line with your SAM growth CAGR. Is that kind of a fair way to think about the trajectory this year and next year?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nHarlan, that's a very insightful set of analysis here. And that's exactly what we're trying to do here because over six months ago, we gave you guys a point a year, 2027. As we come into the second half of 2025, and with improved visibility and updates we're seeing in the way our hyperscale partners are deploying data centers, AI clusters, we are providing you some level of guidance, visibility, what we are seeing, how the trajectory of 2026 might look like. I'm not giving you any update on 2027. We're just still establishing the update we have in 2027 six months ago. But what we're doing now is giving you more visibility into where we're seeing 2026 headed.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nIs the framework that you laid out for us, like second half of last year, which implies 60% kind of growth CAGR in your SAM opportunity, is that kind of the right way to think about it as it relates to the profile of growth in your business this year and next year?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nYes.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Thank you, Hock.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Your line is open.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nHey, how you doing? Thanks, guys. Hey, Hock. AI networking was really strong in the quarter, and it seemed like it must have beat expectations. I was wondering if you could just talk about the networking in particular, what caused that, and how much of that is your acceleration into next year? When do you think you see Tomahawk kicking in as part of that acceleration? Thanks.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nWell, I think AI networking, as you probably would know, goes pretty hand in hand with deployment of AI accelerator clusters. It doesn't deploy on a timetable that's very different from the way the accelerators get deployed, whether they are XPUs or GPUs. It does happen. And they deploy a lot in scale-out, where Ethernet, of course, is the choice of protocol, but it's also increasingly moving into the space of what we all call scale-up within those data centers, where you have much higher, more than we originally thought, consumption or density of switches than you have in the scale-out scenario. In fact, the increased density in scale-up is five to 10x more than in scale-out.\nThat's the part that kind of pleasantly surprised us, which is why this past quarter, Q2, the AI networking portion continues at about 40% from when we reported a quarter ago for Q1. At that time, I said I expected it to drop. It hasn't.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nYour thoughts on Tomahawk driving acceleration for next year and when it kicks in?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nOh, Tomahawk 6? Oh, yeah. That's extremely strong interest. Now, we're not shipping big orders or any orders other than basic proof of concepts out to customers, but there is tremendous demand for this new 102 Tb per second Tomahawk switches.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nThanks, Hock.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nBlayne Curtis\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks. Great results. I just wanted to ask, maybe following up on the scale-out opportunity. So today, I guess your main customer is not really using an NVLink switch-style scale-up. I'm just kind of curious your visibility or the timing in terms of when you might be shipping a switch Ethernet scale-up network to your customers?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nThe talking scale-up?\n\nBlayne Curtis\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nScale-up.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nYeah. Well, scale-up is very rapidly converting to Ethernet now, very much so. For our fairly narrow band of hyperscale customers, scale-up is very much Ethernet.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Hock, I still wanted to follow up on that AI 2026 question. I want to just put some numbers on it just to make sure I've got it right. So you did 60% in the first three quarters of this year. If you grow 60% year-over-year in Q4, it puts you at, I don't know, $5.8 billion, something like $19 or 20 billion for the year. And then are you saying you're going to grow 60% in 2026, which would put you $30 billion + in AI revenues for 2026? I just want to make sure, is that the math that you're trying to communicate to us directly?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nI think you're doing the math. I'm giving you the trend. But I did answer that question, I think Harlan asked earlier. The rate we are seeing now, so far in fiscal 2025, and will presumably continue. We don't see any reason why it doesn't, given lead time visibility in 2025. What we're seeing today, based on what we have visibility on 2026, is to be able to ramp up this AI revenue in the same trajectory. Yes.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nSo is the SAM going up? So is the SAM going up as well? Because now you have inference on top of training. So is the SAM still 60 to 90, or is the SAM higher now as you see it?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nI'm not playing a SAM game here. I'm just giving a trajectory towards where we drew the line on 2027 before. So I have no response to is the SAM going up or not. Stop talking about SAM now. Thanks.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Research Analyst of Semiconductors, Bank of America\n\nThanks for taking my question. I had a near and then a longer-term question on the XPU business. So Hock, for near term, if you're networking upside in Q2 and overall AI was in line, it means XPU was perhaps not as strong. So I realize it's lumpy, but anything more to read into that, any product transition or anything else? So just a clarification there. And then longer term, you have outlined a number of additional customers that you're working with. What milestones should we look forward to, and what milestones are you watching to give you the confidence that you can now start adding that addressable opportunity into your 2027 or 2028 or other numbers? How do we get the confidence that these projects are going to turn into revenue in some reasonable timeframe from now? Thank you.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nOkay. On the first part that you're asking, it's like you're trying to count how many angels on the head of a pin here. I mean, whether it's XPU or networking. Networking is hot, but that doesn't mean XPU is any softer. It's very much along the trajectory we expect it to be. And there's no lumpiness. There's no softening. It's pretty much what we expect the trajectory to go so far and into next quarter as well and probably beyond. So we have a fairly, I guess, in our view, a fairly clear visibility on the short-term trajectory. In terms of going on to 2027, no, we are not updating any numbers here.\nSix months ago, we drew a sense for the size of the SAM based on a million GPU XPU clusters for three customers. That's still very valid at that point that you'll be there. We have not provided any further updates here, nor are we intending to at this point. When we get a better visibility, clearer sense of where we are, and that probably won't happen until 2026, we'll be happy to give an update to the audience. Right now, though, in today's prepared remarks and answering a couple of questions, we are, as we are doing as we have done here, we are intending to give you guys more visibility what we're seeing, the growth trajectory in 2026.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Research Analyst of Semiconductors, Bank of America\n\nThank you, Hock.\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nCFO, Broadcom\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\n\nC.J. Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director and Semiconductor Research Analyst, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping to follow up on Ross's question regarding inference opportunity. Can you discuss workloads that are optimal that you're seeing for custom silicon? Over time, what percentage of your XPU business could be inference versus training? Thank you.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nI think there's no differentiation between training and inference in using merchant accelerators versus custom accelerators. I think the whole premise behind going towards custom accelerators continues, which is not a matter of cost alone. It is that as custom accelerators get used and get developed on a roadmap with any particular hyperscaler, that's a learning curve. A learning curve on how they could optimize the way their algorithms on their large language models get written and tied to silicon.\nAnd that ability to do so is a huge value added in creating algorithms that can drive their LLMs to higher and higher performance, much more than basically a segregation approach between hardware and the software. It's that you literally combine end-to-end hardware and software as they take that journey. It's a journey. They don't learn that in one year.\nDo it a few cycles, get better and better at it. There lies the fundamental value in creating your own hardware versus using a third-party merchant silicon. That you are able to optimize your software to the hardware and eventually achieve way higher performance than you otherwise could. We see that happening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\n\nKarl Ackerman\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Semiconductors, and IT Hardware, BNP Paribas\n\nYes, thank you. Hock, you spoke about the much higher content opportunity in scale-up networking. I was hoping you could discuss how important is demand adoption for co-packaged optics in achieving this 5 to 10x higher content for scale-up networks? Or should we anticipate much of the scale-up opportunity will be driven by Tomahawk and Thor NICs? Thank you.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nI'm trying to decipher this question of yours. So let me try to answer it perhaps in a way I think you want me to clarify. First and foremost, I think most of what's scaling up, there are a lot of the scaling up that's going in, as I call it, which means a lot of XPU or GPU to GPU interconnects is done on copper interconnects. And because the size of this scale-up cluster is still not that huge yet, that you can get away with using copper interconnects. And they're still doing it. Mostly, they're doing it today.\nAt some point soon, I believe, when you start trying to go beyond maybe 72 GPU to GPU interconnects, you may have to push towards a different protocol by protocol mode at a different medium from copper to optical. When we do that, yeah, perhaps then things like exotic stuff like co-packaging of silicon, with optical might become relevant. But truly, what we really are talking about is that at some stage, as the clusters get larger, which means scale-up becomes much bigger, and you need to interconnect GPU or XPU to each other in scale-up many more than just 72 or 100, maybe even 128. You start going more and more.\nYou want to use optical interconnects simply because of distance. That's when optical will start replacing copper. When that happens, the question is, what's the best way to deliver on optical? One way is co-packaged optics. But it's not the only way. You can just simply continue use, perhaps pluggable, low-cost optics. In which case, then you can interconnect the bandwidth, the radix of a switch. Our switch is now 512 connections. So you can now connect all these XPUs, GPUs, 512 for scale-up phenomenon. And that was huge. But that's when you go to optical. That's going to happen, in my view, a year or two.\nAnd we'll be right in the forefront of it. And it may be co-packaged optics, which we are very much in development, but it's a lock-in co-package. Or it could just be, as a first step, pluggable optics. Whatever it is, I think the bigger question is, when does it go from optical and from copper connecting GPU to GPU to optical connecting it? And the step in that move will be huge. And it's not necessarily co-packaged optics, though that's definitely one path we are pursuing.\n\nKarl Ackerman\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Semiconductors, and IT Hardware, BNP Paribas\n\nVery clear. Thank you.\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nCFO, Broadcom\n\nOne moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nJoshua Buchalter\n\nDirector of TMT and Semiconductors Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I realize it's a bit nitpicky, but I wanted to ask about gross margins in the guide. So revenue implies sort of $800 million incremental increase, but gross profit up, I think, $400 to 450 million, which is kind of pretty well below corporate average fall-through. I appreciate that semis is diluted and custom is probably diluted within semis. But anything else going on with margins that we should be aware of? How should we think about the margin profile of custom longer term as that business continues to scale and diversify? Thank you.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nYeah. We've historically said that the XPU margins are slightly lower than the rest of the business, other than wireless. And so there's really nothing else going on other than that. It's just exactly what I said, that the majority of it, quarter-over-quarter, the 130 basis point decline is being driven by more XPUs. There are more moving parts here than your simple analysis proves here. I think your simple analysis is totally wrong in that regard.\n\nJoshua Buchalter\n\nDirector of TMT and Semiconductors Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nCFO, Broadcom\n\nOne moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot, Hock. I also wanted to ask about scale-up, Hock. So there's a lot of competing ecosystems. There's UALink, which of course you left. And now there's the big GPU company opening up NVLink. And they're both trying to build ecosystems. And there's an argument that you're an ecosystem of one. What would you say to that debate? Does opening up NVLink change the landscape? How do you view your AI networking growth next year? Do you think it's going to be primarily driven by scale-up or will it still be pretty scale-out heavy things?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nPeople do like to create platforms and new protocols and systems. The fact of the matter is scale-up can just be done easily. It's currently available. It's open standards, open source, Ethernet. Just as well. You don't need to create new systems for the sake of doing something that you could easily be doing in networking in Ethernet. So, yeah, I hear a lot of these interesting new protocols, standards that are trying to be created.\nMost of them, by the way, are proprietary, much as they like to call it otherwise. What is really open source and open standards is Ethernet. We believe Ethernet will prevail as it does for the last 20 years in traditional networking. There's no reason to create a new standard for something that could be easily done in transferring bits and bytes of data.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGot it, Hock. Thank you.\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nCFO, Broadcom\n\nOne moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\n\nChristopher Rolland\n\nSenior Equity Analyst of Semiconductors, Susquehanna\n\nThanks for the question. Yeah, my question is for you, Hock. It's kind of a bigger picture one here. This kind of acceleration that we're seeing in AI demand, do you think that this acceleration is because of a marked improvement in ASICs or XPUs closing the gap on the software side at your customers? Do you think it's these tokenomics around inference, test-time compute driving that, for example? What do you think is actually driving the upside here? And do you think it leads to a market share shift faster than we were expecting towards XPU from GPU? Thanks.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nYeah. Interesting question. But no, none of the foregoing that you outlined. It's very simple. The way inference has come out very, very hot lately is, remember, we're only selling to a few customers, hyperscalers with platforms and LLMs. That's it. There are not that many. And we told you how many we have. And we haven't increased any. But what is happening is these hyperscalers and those with LLMs need to justify all this spending they're doing. Doing training makes your frontier models smarter. That's no question. It's almost like science, research, and science. Make your frontier models by creating very clever algorithms that consume a lot of compute for training smarter.\nTraining makes it smarter. You want to monetize inference. And that's what's driving it. Monetize, I indicated in my prepared remarks, to drive to justify a return on investment. And a lot of that investment is training. That return on investment is by creating use cases, a lot of AI use cases, AI consumption out there through availability of a lot of inference. That's what we are now starting to see among a small group of customers.\n\nChristopher Rolland\n\nSenior Equity Analyst of Semiconductors, Susquehanna\n\nExcellent. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nVijay Rakesh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Mizuho\n\nYeah. Thanks. Hey, Hock, just going back on the AI server revenue side, I know you said fiscal 2025 kind of tracking to that up 60%-ish growth. If you look at fiscal 2026, you have many new customers ramping with Meta, and probably you have the four or the six hyperscalers that you're talking about. Would you expect that growth to accelerate into fiscal 2026 above that kind of 60% you talked about?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nMy prepared remarks, which I clarified, that the rate of growth we are seeing in 2025 will sustain into 2026 based on improved visibility and the fact that we're seeing inference coming in on top of the demand for training as the clusters get bigger and bigger and bigger still stands. I don't think we are getting very far by trying to pass through my words or data here. It's just a trend.\n\nVijay Rakesh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Mizuho\n\nGot it.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nWe see that going from 2025 into 2026 as the best forecast we have at this point.\n\nVijay Rakesh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Mizuho\n\nGot it. On the NVLink, the NVLink Fusion versus the scale-up, do you expect that market to go the route of top of the rack where you're seeing some move to the Ethernet side in kind of the scale-out? Do you expect scale-up to kind of go the same route? Thanks.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nWell, Broadcom does not participate in NVLink. So I'm really not qualified to answer that question, I think.\n\nVijay Rakesh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Mizuho\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question. I think all my questions on scale-up have been asked. But I guess, Hock, given the execution that you guys have been able to do with the VMware integration, looking at the balance sheet, looking at the debt structure, I'm curious if you could give us your thoughts on how the company thinks about capital return versus the thoughts on M&A and the strategy going forward. Thank you.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nOkay. That's an interesting question. I agree. Not too untimely, I would say. Because, yeah, we have done a lot of the integration of VMware now. You can see that in the level of free cash flow we're generating from operations. As we said, the use of capital has always been very, I guess, measured and upfront with a return through dividends, which is half our free cash flow of the preceding year. Frankly, as Kirsten has mentioned three months ago and six months ago during the last two earnings calls, the first choice, typically, of the other part of the free cash flow is to bring down our debt to a level that we feel closer to no more than two ratio of debt to EBITDA.\nThat doesn't mean that opportunistically we may go out there and buy back our shares as we did last quarter. Indicated that by Kirsten when we did $4.2 billion of stock buyback. Now, part of it is used to basically when employee RSUs vest, basically, we basically buy back part of the shares for used to be paying taxes on the vested RSU. But the other part of it, I do admit we used it opportunistically last quarter when we see an opportunity situation when basically we think that it's a good time to buy some shares back. We do. But having said all that, our use of cash outside of dividends would be, at this stage, used towards reducing our debt.\nI know you're going to ask, what about M&A? Well, the kind of M&A we will do, in our view, would be substantial enough that we need debt in any case. It's a good use of our free cash flow to bring down debt to, in a way, expand, if not preserve, our borrowing capacity if we have to do another M&A deal.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Your line is open.\n\nSrini Pajjuri\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst of Equity Research, Raymond James\n\nThank you. Hock, a couple of clarifications. First, on your 2026 expectation, are you assuming any meaningful contribution from the four prospects that you talked about?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nNo comment. We don't talk on prospects. We only talk on customers.\n\nSrini Pajjuri\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst of Equity Research, Raymond James\n\nOkay. Fair enough. And then my other clarification is that I think you talked about networking being about 40% of the mix within AI. Is that the right kind of mix that you expect going forward, or is that going to materially change as we, I guess, see XPUs ramping going forward?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nNo. I've always said and expect that to be the case in going forward in 2026 as we grow, that networking should be a ratio to XPU, should be closer in the range of less than 30%, not the 40%.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nSoftware Analyst of Semiconductors, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. You've said you're not going to be impacted by export controls on AI. I know there's been a number of changes in the industry since the last time you made the call. Is that still the case? Can you give people comfort that there's no impact from that down the road?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nNobody can give anybody comfort in this environment, Joe. You know that. Rules are changing quite dramatically as bilateral trade agreements continue to be negotiated in a very, very dynamic environment. So I'll be honest, I don't know. I know as little as probably you know more than I do, maybe, in which case then I know very little about this whole thing about whether there's any export control, how the export control will take place. We're guessing. So I'd rather not answer that because, no, I don't know whether it will be.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We do have time for one final question. That will come from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of Technology, Truist Securities\n\nYeah. Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about VMware. Can you comment as to how far along you are in the process of converting customers to the subscription model? Is that close to complete, or is there still a number of quarters that we should expect that that conversion continues?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nThat's a good question. And so let me start off by saying a good way to measure it is, most of our VMware contracts are about typically three years. And that was what VMware did before we acquired them. And that's pretty much what we continue to do, three years, very traditional. So based on that, the renewals were like 2/3 of the way, almost halfway, more than halfway through the renewals. So we probably have at least another year plus maybe a year and a half to go.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ji Yoo for closing remarks.\n\nJi Yoo\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Broadcom\n\nThank you, operator. Broadcom currently plans to report its earnings for the Q3 of fiscal year 2025 after close of market on Thursday, 4 September 2025. A public webcast of Broadcom's earnings conference call will follow at 2:00PM Pacific. That will conclude our earnings call today. Thank you all for joining. Operator, you may end the call.",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ji Yoo, Head of Investor Relations of Broadcom Inc.\n\nJi Yoo\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Broadcom\n\nThank you, Cherie, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Hock Tan, President and CEO, Kirsten Spears, Chief Financial Officer, and Charlie Kawwas, President, semiconductor solutions Group. Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables after the market closed describing our financial performance for the Q4 and fiscal year 2024. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investor section of Broadcom's website at broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and an audio replay of the conference call can be accessed for one year through the Investor section of Broadcom's website. During the prepared comments, Hock and Kirsten will be providing details of our Q4 and fiscal year 2024 results, guidance for our first quarter of fiscal year 2025, as well as commentary regarding the business environment. We'll take questions after the end of our prepared comments.\nPlease refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition to US GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. I will now turn the call over to Hock.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nThank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today.\nWell, this has been a transformative year for Broadcom. Our fiscal year 2024 consolidated revenue grew 44% year-over-year to a record $51.6 billion. Now, excluding VMware, our revenue grew over 9% organically. So fiscal 2024 operating profit excluding transition costs grew 42% year-over-year and we returned record $22 billion in cash to our shareholders, up 45% year-on-year through dividends, buybacks, and eliminations. There were two significant drivers of this transformation this year. First, we closed the acquisition of VMware in the early weeks of fiscal 2024 and have focused VMware on its technology leadership in data center virtualization. The integration of VMware is largely complete. Revenue is on a growth trajectory and operating margin reached 70% exiting 2024.\nWe are well on the path to delivering incremental Adjusted EBITDA at a level that significantly exceeds the $8.5 billion we communicated when we announced the deal. We're planning to achieve this much earlier than our initial target of three years.\nThe second driver in 2024 was AI. Our AI revenue, which came from strength in custom AI accelerators or XPUs and networking, grew 220% from $3.8 billion in fiscal 2023 to $12.2 billion in fiscal 2024 and represented 41% of our semiconductor revenue. This drove semiconductor revenue up to a record $30.1 billion during the year.\nOkay, now let's move on to Q4 and give you more color. Consolidated net revenue of $14.1 billion was up 51% year-on-year, excluding VMware, organic growth was 11%, and operating profit of $8.8 billion was up 53% year-on-year.\nFor the details on infrastructure software in Q4, this infrastructure software segment revenue was $5.8 billion, 196% year-on-year, flat sequentially, even as multiple deals slip over into Q1. In VMware, we booked $21 million total CPU calls in a quarter versus $19 million a quarter ago. Of these, about 70% represented VMware Cloud Foundation or VCF, the full software stack virtualizing the entire data center, and this translated into annualized booking value or ABV, as we call it, of $2.7 billion for VMware in Q4, up from $2.5 billion in Q3 since closing the acquisition. Just over a year ago, we signed up over 4,500 of our largest 10,000 customers for VCF. VCF enable customers to deploy private cloud environments on prem as an alternative to running the applications in the public cloud. In doing all this, we continue to drive down CapEx spending.\nIn VMware, we brought spending down to $1.2 billion in Q4, down from $1.3 billion in Q3. By reference, VMware spending was averaging over $2.4 billion per quarter prior to the acquisition, with operating margin less than 30%.\nMoving on to Q1 outlook for infrastructure software, we expect Q1 revenue to grow to $6.5 billion, up 11% sequentially and 41% up year-on-year. For VMware, ABV is expected to exceed $3 billion compared to $2.7 billion in the preceding quarter. Turning to semiconductors, let me give you more details. By end markets, networking Q4 revenue of $4.5 billion grew 45% year-on-year. AI networking revenue, which represented 76% of networking, grew 158% year-on-year. This was driven by a doubling of our AI XPU shipments to three US hyperscale customers and four times growth in AI connectivity revenue driven by our Tomahawk and Jericho shipments globally. In Q1 we expect the momentum in AI connectivity to be as strong as more hyperscalers deploy Jericho3-AI in their fabrics. Our next generation XPUs.\nAre in 3nm and will be the first of its coming to market in that process node. We are on track for volume shipment at our hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025.\nTurning on to server storage, from its bottom six months ago, Q4 server storage connectivity revenue has recovered some 20% to $992 million, and in Q4 we expect server storage revenue to continue to grow.\nTurning to wireless, as we expected, seasonal launch by our North American customer drove Q4 wireless revenue to $2.2 billion, up 30% sequentially. This was up 7% year-on-year because of higher content. We continue to be very engaged with this customer in multi-year roadmaps across various technologies we have leadership in, including RF, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, sensing, and touch. In Q1, reflecting seasonality, we expect wireless to be down sequentially but still be flat year-on-year.\nIn Q4, broadband reached bottom at $465 million, down 51% year-on-year. We've seen significant orders across multiple service providers during this quarter, and reflecting this trend, we now expect broadband to show recovery beginning in Q1. Finally, on to industrial, which only represents 1% of the total revenues measured on resales. Q4 industrial resales of $173 million declined 2027% year-on-year. We only expect a recovery in H2 2025.\nBefore I sum up and provide you Q1 fiscal 2025 guidance, let me.\nOutline a longer term perspective on how we see our semiconductor business evolving over the next three years.\nOn the broad portfolio of non-AI semiconductors with its multiple end markets, we saw a cyclical bottom in fiscal 2024 at $17.8 billion. We expect a recovery from this level at the industry's historical growth rate of mid-single digits.\nIn sharp contrast.\nWe see our opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive.\nSpecific hyperscalers have begun their respective journeys to develop their own custom AI accelerators.\nOur XPUs as well as network these XPUs with open and scalable Ethernet connectivity for each of them. This represents a multi-year, not a quarter-to-quarter journey. As you know, we currently have three hyperscaler customers who have developed their own multi-generational AI XPU roadmap to be deployed at varying rates over the next three years. In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy one million XPU clusters across a single fabric. We expect this to represent an AI revenue serviceable addressable market or SAM for XPUs and network in the range of $60 to 90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. We are very well positioned to achieve a leading market share in this opportunity and expect this will drive a strong ramp from our 2024 AI revenue base of $12.2 billion.\nKeep in mind though, this will not be a linear ramp. It will show quarterly variability.\nTo compound this, we have been selected by two additional hyperscalers and are in advanced development.\nFor their own next-generation AI XPUs. We have line of sight to develop these prospects into revenue-generating customers before 2027 and could therefore expand this SAM significantly. So the reality going forward for this company is that the AI semiconductor business will rapidly outgrow the non-AI semiconductor business. Recognizing this, we will now shift to guiding our semiconductor business by AI and non-AI revenue segments.\nSo summarizing, Q4 semiconductor revenue of $8.2 billion grew 12% year-on-year and 13% sequentially. Q4 AI revenue grew a strong 150% year-on-year to $3.7 billion. Non-AI semiconductor revenue declined by 23.3% year-on-year to $4.5 billion, but still a 10% recovery from the bottom of six months ago.\nNow moving on to our outlook for Q1.\nWe expect semiconductor revenue to grow approximately 10% year-on-year to $8.1 billion.\nAI demand remains strong, and we expect AI revenue to grow 65% year-on-year to $3.8 billion. We expect non-AI semiconductor revenue to be down about mid-teens percent year-on-year. And so in total, summing this all up, we're guiding consolidated Q1 revenue to be approximately $14.6 billion, up 22% year-on-year. And we expect this will drive Q1 Adjusted EBITDA to approximately 66% of revenue. With that, let me turn this call over to Kirsten.\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nCFO and Chief Accounting Officer, Broadcom\n\nThank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q4 financial performance.\nConsolidated revenue was $14.1 billion for the quarter, up 51% from a year ago. Excluding the contribution from VMware, Q4 revenue increased 11% year-on-year. Gross margins were 76.9% of revenue in the quarter, up 20260 basis points from the year ago quarter. R&D was $1.4 billion, and consolidated operating expenses were $2 billion, up year-on-year primarily due to the acquisition and consolidation of VMware. Q4 operating income was $8.8 billion and was up 53% from a year ago with operating margin at 63% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.1 billion or 65% of revenue. This figure excludes $156 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our two segments starting with semiconductors. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $8.2 billion and represented 59% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 12% year-on-year.\nGross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 67%, down 220 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by a higher mix of AI XPUs. Operating expenses increased 11% year-on-year to $914 million on increased investment in R&D, resulting in Semiconductor operating margins of 56%.\nNow moving on to infrastructure software. Revenue for infrastructure software was $5.8 billion, up 196% year-on-year, primarily due to the contribution of VMware, and represented 41% of revenue. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 91% in the quarter, and operating expenses were $1.1 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of 72% excluding transition costs. Operating margin was 73%. Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $5.5 billion and represented 39% of revenues excluding cash used for restructuring and integration of $506 million. Free cash flows of $6 billion were up 22% year-on-year and represented 43% of revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue has declined from the same quarter a year ago due to higher cash interest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition. Higher cash taxes due to a higher mix of US.\nTaxable income, the continued delay in the reenactment of Section 174, and recent proposed regulations on corporate AMT. We spent $122 million on capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding were 29 days in the Q4 compared to 31 days a year ago. We ended the Q4 with inventory of $1.8 billion, down 7% sequentially. We continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the Q4 with $9.3 billion of cash and $69.8 billion of gross principal debt. During the quarter we replaced $5 billion of floating rate debt with new senior notes.\nWe used cash on hand to pay a mix of senior notes which came due in Q4 and additional floating rate debt, reducing debt by $2.5 billion. Following these actions, the weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $56 billion in fixed rate debt is 3.7% and 7.6 years, respectively. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $14 billion in floating rate debt is 5.9% and 3.2 years, respectively. We expect to repay approximately $495 million of fixed rate senior notes coming due in Q1. Now let me recap our financial performance for fiscal year 2024. Our revenue hit a record $51.6 billion, growing 44% year-on-year including VMware and 9% organically. Excluding VMware, semiconductor revenue was $30.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year.\nInfrastructure software revenue was $21.5 billion, up 181% year-on-year, and up 19% year-on-year excluding VMware. Fiscal 2024 Adjusted EBITDA was $31.9 billion and represented 62% of revenue. Free cash flow grew 10% year-on-year to $19.4 billion and up 22% year-on-year to $21.9 billion excluding restructuring and integration costs. Turning to capital allocation, for fiscal 2024 we spent $22.2 billion consisting of $9.8 billion in the form of cash dividends and $12.4 billion in share repurchases and eliminations aligned with our ability to generate increased cash flows in the preceding year and off of a larger share count base from the acquisition of VMware. We are announcing an increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend in Q1 fiscal 2025 to $0.59 per share on a split-adjusted basis, an increase of 11% from the prior quarter.\nWe intend to maintain this target quarterly dividend throughout fiscal 2025, subject to quarterly board approval. This implies that our fiscal 2025 annual common stock dividend to be a record $2.36 per share on a split-adjusted basis, an increase of 12% year-on-year. I would like to highlight that this represents the 14th consecutive increase in annual dividends since we initiated dividends in fiscal 2011. Now moving on to guidance from a year-on-year comparable basis. Keep in mind that Q1 of fiscal 2024 was a 14-week quarter and Q1 of fiscal 2025 is a 13-week quarter. As we are now past one year following the close of the VMware acquisition. Starting in Q1 of fiscal 2025, we will no longer break out VMware revenue and costs on a standalone basis.\nWe will continue to report infrastructure software segment revenue and profitability, which includes Brocade, Fibre Channel, SAN, CA, Mainframe, Enterprise Security, and VMware. Our guidance for Q1 is for consolidated revenue of $14.6 billion with semiconductor revenue of $8.1 billion, up approximately 10% year-on-year, and infrastructure software revenue of $6.5 billion, up 41% year-on-year. We expect Q1 Adjusted EBITDA to be a record 66% and Q1 non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 4.9 billion shares. For modeling purposes, we expect Q1 consolidated gross margins to be up 100 basis points sequentially on the higher revenue mix of infrastructure, software, and product mix within semiconductors. Note that consolidated gross margins through the year will be impacted by the revenue mix of infrastructure, software, and semiconductors and product mix within semiconductors.\nWe expect the non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal year 2025 to be approximately 14.5% as tax deductions related to interest expense are reduced. As we pay down and refinance debt under more favorable interest terms, GAAP net income and cash flows in Q1 will be impacted by higher taxes, restructuring, and integration-related cash costs due to the VMware acquisition.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. To ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, press star one one. Again, due to time restraints, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster.\nOur first question will come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nBlayne Curtis\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks so much for taking my question. It's kind of a clarification and a question. I thought I heard you say that AI networking revenue was 76% of networking. I just couldn't get that math right. But maybe the broader question is you've seen growth up that low point in April in AI. Can you just talk about ASIC strength versus networking? The trends you're seeing in kind of October into January?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nWell, that's a very interesting question.\nBoth were growing, not at the same rates, but we've been shipping, I believe, a lot more of network AI connectivity networking components.\nIn the back half of this year compared to the first half of this fiscal year.\nWe suspect a lot of that will continue in the first half of next fiscal year before more XPUs. As I indicated, the new generation of 3nm XPUs will start ramping very much in the back half of 2025.\n\nBlayne Curtis\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nVery clear. Thanks, Hock.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.\nThat will come from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\n\nC.J. Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess Hock, I wanted to hit on the $60 to 90 billion revenue range for fiscal 2027 for AI. I was hoping you could speak to the mix you see there between XPU and networking. And within that construct, are you including all kind of the customers that you see out there in hyperscale and vertically integrated consumers, or any sort of help in terms of what you're including in that potential mix will be very helpful. Thank you.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nThank you. Well, thanks for the question. Give me an opportunity here to clarify and be very specific. First, on the total dollars. This non revenue, by the way, is the revenue opportunity for us. It's what I call.\nServiceable Addressable Market, as we all term SAM, not TAM. SAM is Serviceable Addressable Market for three of our hyperscale customers. That's it. It's a very narrow serviceable addressable market we're talking about. And we're talking about XPUs and AI connectivity. At that scale.\nAI connectivity could probably estimate to run approximately close to 15% to 20 of the dollar content.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.\nThat will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you.\nI wonder if you could talk to the XPU market.\nHow are your customers sort of reacting to some of the rack-scale products from the merchant competitor from NVIDIA? You know, how do they sort of get the connectivity to multiple XPUs inside the rack? You know, just how does that present a competitive dynamic for you? Thanks.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nWell, it's, you know, everybody's trying to figure out when you start, when you connect a cluster on a single fabric of 10,000 XPUs or GPU, say GPU, and scale it up to 100,000 and on to 500,000 and a million is a whole new game in terms of architecture. And so you guys hear the differences of when you do this racks, you have what you call scale up and then you have joining rack to rack because you have no choice. You can't get to a million for them at 100,000, otherwise you call it scale out. And that's a continuing evolving architecture. But I think each of these hyperscale customers of ours have at this point kind of figured out how to get there.\nHence a roadmap that will keep growing from 100,000 to a million XPU cluster on pretty much similar architecture basis over the next three, four years.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank You.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Hock Tan. I know the team is putting out an AI guide for fiscal 2025 and I appreciate the multi-year sort of SAM opportunity outlook. But for this year, you know, can we look at what your customers on the networking and custom accelerators are thinking about from a data center CapEx spending perspective? So for example, our latest roll up is that the top four cloud and hyperscalers are going to grow their CapEx 35% to 40 in fiscal 2025. I would expect that your AI business would sort of closely mirror this trend, maybe even think about it as a base case. When we think about Ethernet taking share from InfiniBand, ASICs going faster than merchant GPUs, maybe the profile of your AI business can go even faster than the CapEx trends. Either way, ±.\nIs that, is that how we should think about the growth in the AI business, roughly in line with CapEx growth trends of your large cloud and hyperscale customers?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nNo.\nIt doesn't. I mean, I think the hyperscalers tend to give you an overall CapEx numbers. I'm not sure they really break up between what's AI and what's non-AI out there. And.\nClearly the spend in AI outstrips the spend in non AI, even on the CapEx. And so no, I won't necessarily stop at that.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. No. Thank you. Ha.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThanks for taking my question. I have a more tactical question. So, you have software pushouts into Q1, which is elevating it. Should we think about those pushouts rolling off as we get into Q2 and the back half of the year? And, like, what are the implications on the shape of software for the year as well as gross margins? Because, I guess, maybe in the back half you'll have, like, software a little weaker versus Q2 as well as the XPU stronger. So, should we be thinking about the gross margin trajectory off the current elevated base, kind of like easing as we get in the back half? So, just anything you can tell us around the shape of the software, around the pushouts, and implications for revenues and gross margins?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nWell, number one is a slip and I think you're overthinking.\nThis whole project. It's just a slip. Pick it up and you see the differences between Q4 growth and Q1 reacceleration, that's all it is.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nI'm asking, should Q2 be lower because you had push out into Q1? Is what I'm asking.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nNo, it doesn't. Not Q2. No, it won't have material impact on the rest of the fiscal 2025.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nDo you think software can kind of hold at these levels or even grow off of these like $6.5 billion levels as we go through the year?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nI'm not giving you guidance. I might remind you for the rest of the year. I'm just giving you guidance for Q1. I'm just telling you your analysis is kind of defective.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nI've been told that before. Okay, thank you, Hock.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nThank you, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. That will come from Benjamin Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open.\n\nBenjamin Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius\n\nHey, thanks a lot and nice quarter there. Hock. I wanted to ask you about the $60 to 90 billion with a little more clarity. Previously you've talked about cumulative TAM from your customers. So you know, and that, you know, is this a run rate TAM or a cumulative TAM kind of meaning do we take the $12.2 then add some, you know, growth for the next two years and then think of it that way or do we think of we take a share of like a $75 billion TAM and what your revenue yield is and then I just also was hoping you could clarify, you're not including those two new customers. Do those two customers have the same $20 to 30 billion TAM each that the current three do? Or do you think they're smaller or bigger?\nSorry about the multi part question there.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nNo, I think you asked. The first part was very similar to an earlier question, but I'd be pleased to clarify.\nNo, there's $60 to 90 billion. We are not talking cumulative SAM or TAM anymore. We are putting for you a destination, so to speak, a milestone which happens to be three years since 2027, possibly slip a bit part of 2028, but 2027, we are seeing a destination 2027 or milestone, better one where.\nThe deployment of those large scale AI clusters, each on single fabric, pretty much to run those large LLM models would come to $60 to 90 billion in that one year period and collectively all three of them.\nTo answer.\nYou know, possibly yes, at least one of them, we believe, yes. But you know what, I don't want you adding 1 + 1 = 2 here. Those are not.\nValidated in our view under our model as customers. So please don't do your addition to that $60 to 90 million SAM that I have postulated in my remarks.\nThank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. Thanks, Brittany. That's a good question. I want to talk about the cash return side of things. Great job on the dividend increase. The other 50% is fiscal 2025 a year where you're going to still be paying down debt.\nShare repurchases in the mix? Or Hock, you mentioned that VMware, the integration, is largely now behind you. Usually that puts you on the prowl looking for deals. Is that something we should in general think about, or is, you know, there are regulatory issues that are still a concern? Just trying to figure out what that other 50% is going to go towards this year.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nOh well.\nTo start with, yeah. The other 50% of cash that will be generated that we're not using. That is beyond dividends. We only want use for two uses for it. We've always said one is parking on balance sheet.\nFor the opportunity to buy someone else. But in reality, we're buying big enough companies. You almost say that 50% cash is sitting there. It's not adequate. So the likely use of that 50% cash is, as Kirsten indicated in her prepared remarks, pay down debt. We do intend to use part of that 50% free cash flow that's not used for dividends to go delever ourselves given the size of the debt load we are taking on or we have taken on since we acquired VMware.\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nCFO and Chief Accounting Officer, Broadcom\n\nYeah, Ross, it's Kirsten. We want to focus on reducing interest expense so we'll go after those term loans. So yes, the focus will be on paying down debt.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question.\nThat will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks for taking my question. Hock, back to AI. What do you think is the SAM in 2024 so we can get a baseline view of what your $12.2 billion in sales represent? And is your assumption that you maintain this share, you grow it or what happens to that share over time? And then for a related question to that is what happens to your semiconductor gross margins if AI grows to such an extent because you give us a mid single digit for non AI. And I'm wondering if AI gets to be such a big part of semis, what happens to gross margin? So both kind of the baseline of what SAM was this year and what happens to your share and margins over time.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nOkay, that's a fair, very insightful question. On the first one, which, on the first one anyway, where we are saying what is the baseline on the $60 to 90 billion in three years time where we are specifying down to these three customers of ours and I would estimate.\nThis 2024 for that to be about less than $20 billion. $15 to 20 billion dollars at this point in 2024. $15 to 20 billion going to $60 to 90 billion.\nIn terms of margins, well, don't get too hung up on gross margin please.\nVivek, because you're not wrong. Gross margin semiconductors will dilute. You are saying that. But see, the game here is the revenue will leverage so much on the spending we have to do to generate it that the operating margin will improve from where we are today.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nHarsh Kumar\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah.\nHey, first of all, guys, huge congratulations on successfully integrating VMware.\nSo much ahead of your time frame.\nHock, I had a two-part question. Is there a simple dollar metric that we can think of for networking attached to XPUs? For example, it's $1 of networking to $1 of XPUs.\nAnd then, for my question in one.\nIn your posts you talked about sovereign data centers and VMware. I guess my question is, is there a play for Broadcom outside of the software piece? In other words, are you noticing that sovereign guys are wanting to use XPUs or are they sticking to merchant silicon?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nLet me answer your question backwards. Easiest one first, sovereign guys.\nAre like most.\nOf the other, most of the enterprise. It's pretty much like enterprise market, you know, which is simply merchant. Sovereign guys do not have the capability, necessarily, to create, first, the hardware but, more importantly, this software stack to enable transistors in hardware to translate itself into high-level language, which then the LLM, API, and app application large language models, and application AI applications can operate on. So let's stick to what's available, which is merchant silicon and the available.\nEcosystem of.\nSoftware layers that allow that translation. So it will be there very much that way on XPUs. Then, on your first question of what's the ratio between AI connectivity, networking that is just saying to XPUs to compute. Well, it's a changing number. As the cluster expands, though, there are some ratios to be looked at, and the simple ratio to look at is there is scale up and there is scale out.\nAs we expand into a single fabric.\nCluster of XPUs or GPU that grows bigger and bigger. Guess what is more important? Scale-up becomes more and more important. And the ratio we are talking about as we move up increases almost exponentially. Which is why I'm saying from probably networking as a percent of AI content in silicon today of between 5% to 10, you're going up to 15% to 20 by the time you hit 500,000 to a million XPU GPU clusters.\n\nHarsh Kumar\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question.\nThat will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good afternoon.\nThank you so much for taking the question. The $60 to 90 billion SAM forecast for fiscal 2027. I'm curious if you guys have a view on the TAM. So just want to know how big the SAM is as a percentage of the total opportunity set. And then my main question is you talked about going for leading market share within your SAM, which makes sense. I assume you're not assuming 100% share. So the value of that $60 to 90 billion that you won't be capturing, is that a function of some of your hyperscaler customers wanting to capture value internally or is it.\nAlways having a backup or a second source? Is there low margin business that you just simply won't pursue? How should we think about the part of the $60 to 90 billion that you won't be going after or won't be capturing?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nThank you. Okay, first to answer with a bigger overarching question. I don't know the term. I don't make any thoughts too hard. I don't think too far and hard about them. We don't think in macro approaches. We're looking at line of sight here. So I got customers. I try to figure out how much volume, where the roadmap of the customer is, not just product technology but what they are building out. What is their consumption pattern like? That's how we create our SAM actually, in a way, bottoms up, then tops down. So I have no idea what the TAM is beyond customers we are serving closely, collaborating closely. So let's make it clear in terms of.\nMarket share, don't know. But as you all can see, it's a very large substantial market opportunity. There's room for many players. All we're doing to do is gain our fair share. We're just very well positioned today having the best technology very relevant in this space. We have by far one of the best technology combination technology out there to do XPUs and to connect those GPUs, the silicon technology that enables it. We have it here in Broadcom by the boatloads. Which is why we're very well positioned with these three customers of ours. So we, based on that we are. And based on the depth of our engagement today, this didn't just start, this was going on now for a while.\nIn terms of deep engagement with engineering teams from the other side, we are very well positioned, well on the way to creating a multi-year roadmap.\nTo enable these few customers of ours to get to where their ambition leads them to be in. And it's because of the great technology we have where we are actually enabling in the areas we are very good at. We're talking about, you know, silicon design, packaging design, and optical technology.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question.\nThat will come from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nManaging Director and Technology Senior Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGreat, thanks for taking my question. I want to add my congrats to all the great results this year, for the quarter, and outlook. But Hock, you know this is sort of a stunning turn of events in the last year with what we've been accustomed to thinking of as a sort of mature, slow growth business at its core with all the M&A tacked onto it. And I wonder, with the sudden acceleration of the organic business, given your, you know, exposure to these capabilities and ASICs to bring AI technologies to customers, does that change your interest level in M&A and does it change your.\nFocus area of potential M&A going forward? Thank you.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nNo it doesn't.\nWe are open, still open, always open. Because that's been a core part of our strategy business model of this company for the last 10 years, which is.\nWe're always interested in adding to our portfolio very good franchise assets, be they in semiconductors or be they in infrastructure software. As long as they meet the criteria, the fairly demanding criteria we look for, we would always be open to acquiring this asset and adding into our portfolio. So no, it hasn't changed our thinking at all.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nManaging Director and Technology Senior Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question.\nThat will come from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nVijay Rakesh\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nHi Hock. Great results here. Just a question back on the AI custom silicon side. I guess it looks like of the $17.5 billion TAM here, SAM, here you have about 70% share. So assuming that 70%, looking out to 2027, your custom silicon AI revenue should be like $50 billion in fiscal 2027. So do we have a good line of sight into fiscal 2026 showing a pretty nice ramp to hit those numbers? Maybe with Ultra Ethernet and all that to do the million XPUs. How do you see that? Thanks.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nI don't know. We don't have really a good enough line of sight to want to share it with you. No. For that matter, do we have a policy of giving you guidance beyond what we're doing one quarter a year? But we do want to give you a sense of where this journey is headed. We want to give you a sense of where this could lead us, this company, in terms of its AI semiconductor AI revenue trajectory. Given that we now made it very open, official almost, that we are going forward only guiding AI revenue versus non-AI revenue, we figured at least give you a sense of what the AI trajectory is on a non-AI. We have known it, you have known it with us for a long time.\nIt's mature, stable, evolving, growing, mid-single-digit GDP plus. AI will never give you that. So that's why we take the stage, the step now unprecedented in some ways of laying that roadmap in terms of potential market for AI. Now, the only market we have is the customers we have and the end markets we serve. So we create this SAM, and the clarity we see is to some extent in 2027. How that journey progresses with each of our.\nCustomers is.\nSomewhat variable. It's the rate of the adoption and.\nOf their own experience and will be very much, very much a part of that journey. But because of that, we expect to see a situation where there could be quarter-to-quarter variability given the only three customers, and the fact that deployment comes in big chunks typically. So my best answer to you is I can't give you any clarity beyond what I've given so far.\n\nVijay Rakesh\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGot it. And the other two CSPs, when do you see them ramping?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nWell, first of all, I got to get into production. They got to get into production. So why don't we cross that bridge when we get to it? We are working very hard with them to get it production stage. We're pretty deeply engaged with tablet chips, but they got to get their software ready, they got to get it tested, and they got to get going on it. So now I'm not sure, but definitely over the next three years.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, that is all the time we have for our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ji Yoo, Head of Investor Relations, for closing remarks.\n\nJi Yoo\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Broadcom\n\nThank you, Cherie.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ji Yoo, Head of Investor Relations of Broadcom Inc.\n\nJi Yoo\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Broadcom\n\nThank you, Cherie, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Hock Tan, President and CEO; Kirsten Spears, Chief Financial Officer; and Charlie Kawwas, President, Semiconductor Solutions Group. Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables after the market close describing our financial performance for the Q4 and fiscal year 2024. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Broadcom's website, broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and an audio replay of the conference call can be accessed for one year through the Investors section of Broadcom's website. During the prepared comments, Hock and Kirsten will be providing details of our Q4 and fiscal year 2024 results, guidance for our first quarter of fiscal year 2025, as well as commentary regarding the business environment. We'll take questions after the end of our prepared comments.\nPlease refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition to US GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. I will now turn the call over to Hock.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nThank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today.\nWell, this has been a transformative year for Broadcom. Our fiscal year 2024 consolidated revenue grew 44% year-over-year to a record $51.6 billion. Now, excluding VMware, our revenue grew over 9% organically. So fiscal 2024 operating profit excluding transition costs grew 42% year-over-year and we returned record $22 billion in cash to our shareholders, up 45% year-on-year through dividends, buyback, and eliminations. There were two significant drivers of this transformation this year. First, we closed the acquisition of VMware in the early weeks of fiscal 2024 and have focused VMware on its technology leadership in data center virtualization. The integration of VMware is largely complete, revenue is on a growth trajectory and operating margin reached 70% exiting 2024.\nWe are well on the path to delivering incremental Adjusted EBITDA at a level that significantly exceeds the $8.5 billion we communicated when we announced the deal. We're planning to achieve this much earlier than our initial target of three years.\nThe second driver in 2024 was AI. Our AI revenue, which came from strength in custom AI accelerators or XPUs and networking, grew 220% from $3.8 billion in fiscal 2023 to $12.2 billion in fiscal 2024 and represented 41% of our semiconductor revenue. This drove semiconductor revenue up to a record $30.1 billion during the year.\nOkay, now let's move on to the Q4 and give you more color. Consolidated net revenue of $14.1 billion was up 51% year-on-year. Excluding VMware, organic growth was 11%, and operating profit of $8.8 billion was up 53% year-on-year.\nFor the details on infrastructure software in Q4, this infrastructure software segment revenue was $5.8 billion, 196% year-on-year, flat sequentially, even as multiple deals slip over into Q1. In VMware, we booked 21 million total CPU calls in a quarter versus 19 million a quarter ago. Of these, about 70% represented VMware Cloud Foundation, or VCF, the full software stack virtualizing the entire data center, and this translated into annualized booking value, or ABV as we call it, of $2.7 billion for VMware in Q4, up from $2.5 billion in Q3 since closing the acquisition. Just over a year ago, we signed up over 4,500 of our largest 10,000 customers for VCF. VCF enables customers to deploy private cloud environments on-prem as an alternative to running their applications in the public cloud, and in doing all this we continue to drive down spending.\nIn VMware, we brought spending down to $1.2 billion in Q4, down from $1.3 billion in Q3. By reference, VMware's spending was averaging over $2.4 billion per quarter prior to the acquisition, with operating margin less than 30%.\nMoving on to Q1 outlook for infrastructure software, we expect Q1 revenue to grow to $6.5 billion, up 11% sequentially and 41% year-on-year. For VMware, ABV is expected to exceed $3 billion compared to $2.7 billion in the preceding quarter. Turning to semiconductors, let me give you more details by end markets. Networking Q4 revenue of $4.5 billion grew 45% year-on-year. AI networking revenue, which represented 76% of networking, grew 158% year-on-year. This was driven by a doubling of our AI XPU shipments to our three hyperscaler customers and 4x growth in AI connectivity revenue driven by our Tomahawk and Jericho shipments globally. In Q1, we expect the momentum in AI connectivity to be as strong as more hyperscalers deploy Jericho3-AI in their fabrics.\nOur next generation XPUs are in 3nm and will be the first of its kind coming to market in that process node. We are on track for volume shipment at our hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025.\nTurning to server storage from its bottom six months ago, Q4 server storage connectivity revenue has recovered some 20% to $992 million, and in Q4 we expect server storage revenue to continue to grow.\nTurning to wireless, as we expected, seasonal launch by our North American customer drove Q4 wireless revenue to $2.2 billion, up 30% sequentially. This was up 7% year-on-year because of higher content. We continue to be very engaged with this customer in multi-year roadmaps across various technologies we have leadership in, including RF, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, sensing, and touch. In Q1, reflecting seasonality, we expect wireless to be down sequentially but still be flat year-on-year.\nIn Q4, broadband reached bottom at $465 million, down 51% year-on-year. We've seen significant orders across multiple service providers during this quarter, and, reflecting this trend, we now expect broadband to show recovery beginning in Q1. Finally, on to industrial, which only represents 1% of the total revenues measured on resales. Q4 industrial resales of $173 million declined 2027% year-on-year. We only expect a recovery in the second half 2025.\nBefore I sum up and provide you Q1 fiscal 2025 guidance, let me.\nOutline a longer-term perspective on how we see our semiconductor business evolving over the next three years?\nOn the broad portfolio of non-AI semiconductors with its multiple end markets. We saw a cyclical bottom in fiscal 2024 at $17.8 billion. We expect a recovery from this level at the industry's historical growth rate of mid-single digits.\nIn sharp contrast.\nWe see our opening opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive.\nSpecific hyperscalers have begun their respective journeys to develop their own custom AI accelerators.\nOur XPUs as well as network these XPUs with open and scalable Ethernet connectivity for each of them. This represents a multi-year, not a quarter-to-quarter journey. As you know, we currently have three hyperscale customers who have developed their own multigenerational AI XPU roadmap to be deployed at varying rates over the next three years. In 2027 we believe each of them plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. We expect this to represent an AI revenue serviceable addressable market, or SAM, for XPUs and network in the range of $60 to 90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. We are very well positioned to achieve a leading market share in this opportunity and expect this will drive a strong ramp from our 2024 AI revenue base of $12.2 billion.\nKeep in mind though, this will not be a linear ramp. Will show quarterly variability.\nTo compound this, we have been selected by two additional hyperscalers and are in advanced development.\nFor their own next-generation AI XPUs. We have line of sight to develop these prospects into revenue-generating customers before 2027 and could therefore expand this SAM significantly. So, the reality going forward for this company is that the AI semiconductor business will rapidly outgrow the non-AI semiconductor business. Recognizing this, we will now shift to guiding our semiconductor business by AI, non-AI revenue segments.\nSo, summarizing, Q4 semiconductor revenue of $8.2 billion grew 12% year-on-year and 13% sequentially. Q4 AI revenue grew a strong 150% year-on-year to $3.7 billion. Non-AI semiconductor revenue declined by 23% year-on-year to $4.5 billion, but still a 10% recovery from the bottom of six months ago.\nNow moving on to our outlook for Q1.\nWe expect semiconductor revenue to grow approximately 10% year-on-year to $8.1 billion.\nAI demand remains strong, and we expect AI revenue to grow 65% year-on-year to $3.8 billion. We expect non-AI semiconductor revenue to be down about mid-teens percent year-on-year. And so, in total, summing this all up, we're guiding consolidated Q1 revenue to be approximately $14.6 billion, up 22% year-on-year, and we expect this will drive Q1 Adjusted EBITDA to approximately 66% of revenue. With that, let me turn this call over to Kirsten.\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nCFO and Chief Accounting Officer, Broadcom",
    "content2": "Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q4 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was $14.1 billion for the quarter, up 51% from a year ago, excluding the contribution from VMware. Q4 revenue increased 11% year-on-year. Gross margins were 76.9% of revenue in the quarter, up 200 and 60 basis points from the year ago quarter. R&D was $1.4 billion, and consolidated operating expenses were $2 billion, up year-on-year, primarily due to the acquisition and consolidation of VMware. Q4 operating income was $8.8 billion and was up 53% from a year ago, with operating margin at 63% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.1 billion, or 65% of revenue. This figure excludes $156 million of depreciation. Now, a review of the P&L for our two segments, starting with semiconductors.\nRevenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $8.2 billion and represented 59% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 12% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 67%, down 220 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by a higher mix of AI XPUs. Operating expenses increased 11% year-on-year to $914 million on increased investment in R&D, resulting in semiconductor operating margins of 56%.\nNow moving on to infrastructure software. Revenue for infrastructure software was $5.8 billion, up 196% year-on-year, primarily due to the contribution of VMware, and represented 41% of revenue. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 91% in the quarter, and operating expenses were $1.1 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of 72% excluding transition costs. Operating margin was 73%. Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $5.5 billion and represented 39% of revenues excluding cash used for restructuring and integration of $506 million. Free cash flows at $6 billion were up 22% year-on-year and represented 43% of revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue has declined from the same quarter a year ago due to higher cash interest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition, higher cash taxes due to a higher mix of US.\nTaxable income, the continued delay in the reenactment of Section 174, and recent proposed regulations on corporate AMT. We spent $122 million on capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding were 29 days in the Q4 compared to 31 days a year ago. We ended the Q4 with inventory of $1.8 billion, down 7% sequentially. We continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the Q4 with $9.3 billion of cash and $69.8 billion of gross principal debt. During the quarter, we replaced $5 billion of floating rate debt with new senior notes. We used cash on hand to pay a mix of senior notes which came due in Q4 and additional floating rate debt, reducing debt by $2.5 billion.\nFollowing these actions, the weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $56 billion in fixed-rate debt is 3.7% and 7.6 years, respectively. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $14 billion in floating-rate debt is 5.9% and 3.2 years, respectively. We expect to repay approximately $495 million of fixed-rate senior notes coming due in Q1. Now let me recap our financial performance for fiscal year 2024. Our revenue hit a record $51.6 billion, growing 44% year-on-year including VMware and 9% organically excluding VMware. Semiconductor revenue was $30.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $21.5 billion, up 181% year-on-year and up 19% year-on-year excluding VMware. Fiscal 2024 Adjusted EBITDA was $31.9 billion and represented 62% of revenue.\nFree cash flow grew 10% year-on-year to $19.4 billion and up 22% year-on-year to $21.9 billion, excluding restructuring and integration costs. Turning to capital allocation, for fiscal 2024 we spent $22.2 billion consisting of $9.8 billion in the form of cash dividends and $12.4 billion in share repurchases and eliminations. Aligned with our ability to generate increased cash flows in the preceding year and off of a larger share count base from the acquisition of VMware, we are announcing an increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend in Q1 fiscal 2025 to $0.59 per share on a split-adjusted basis, an increase of 11% from the prior quarter. We intend to maintain this target quarterly dividend throughout fiscal 2025 subject to quarterly Board approval.\nThis implies that our fiscal 2025 annual common stock dividend to be a record $2.36 per share on a split-adjusted basis, an increase of 12% year-on-year. I would like to highlight that this represents the 14th consecutive increase in annual dividends since we initiated dividends in fiscal 2011. Now moving on to guidance from a year-on-year comparable basis, keep in mind that Q1 of fiscal 2024 was a 14-week quarter and Q1 of fiscal 2025 is a 13-week quarter as we are now past one year following the close of the VMware acquisition. Starting in Q1 of fiscal 2025, we will no longer break out VMware revenue and costs on a standalone basis. We will continue to report infrastructure software segment revenue and profitability, which includes Brocade Fibre Channel, CA, Mainframe, Enterprise Security, and VMware.\nOur guidance for Q1 is for consolidated revenue of $14.6 billion\nWith semiconductor revenue of $8.1 billion, up approximately 10% year-on-year, and infrastructure software revenue of $6.5 billion, up 41% year-on-year. We expect Q1 Adjusted EBITDA to be a record 66% and Q1 non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 4.9 billion shares. For modeling purposes, we expect Q1 consolidated gross margins to be up 100 basis points sequentially on the higher revenue mix of infrastructure, software, and product mix within semiconductors. Note that consolidated gross margins through the year will be impacted by the revenue mix of infrastructure, software, and semiconductors, and product mix within semiconductors. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal year 2025 to be approximately 14.5% as tax deductions related to interest expense are reduced.\nAs we pay down and refinance debt under more favorable interest terms, GAAP net income and cash flows in Q1 will be impacted by higher taxes, restructuring, and integration-related cash costs due to the VMware acquisition.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Thank you. To ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, press star one one. Again, due to time restraints, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster.\nOur first question will come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nBlayne Curtis\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks so much for taking my question. It's kind of a clarification and a question. I thought I heard you say that AI networking revenue was 76% of networking. I just couldn't get that math right. But maybe the broader question is you've seen growth off that low point in April in AI? Can you just talk about ASIC strength versus networking? The trends you're seeing in kind of, you know, October into January?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nWell, that's a very interesting question.\nBoth were growing, not at the same rates, but we've been shipping, I believe, a lot more of network AI connectivity networking components.\nIn the back half of this year compared to the first half of this fiscal year.\nWe suspect a lot of that will continue in the first half of next fiscal year before more XPUs next year, as I indicated, more the new generation of 3nm XPUs will start ramping very much in the back half of 2025.\n\nBlayne Curtis\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nVery clear. Thanks, Hock.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Question. And that will come from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\n\nC.J. Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess Hock, I wanted to hit on the $60 to 90 billion revenue range for fiscal 2027 for AI. I was hoping you could speak to the mix you see there between XPU and networking. And within that construction, are you including?\nAll kinds of the customers that you see out there in hyperscalers and vertically integrated customers, or any sort of help in terms of what you're including in that potential mix, will be very helpful. Thank you.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nThank you. Well, thanks for the question. Give me an opportunity here to clarify and be very specific. First, on the total dollars, this, not revenue, by the way, is a revenue opportunity for us. It's what I call.\nServiceable addressable market, as we all term SAM, not TAM, SAM. It's serviceable addressable market for three of our hyperscaler customers. That's it. A very narrow serviceable addressable market we're talking about. We're talking about XPUs and AI connectivity at that scale.\nAI connectivity could probably estimate to run approximately close to 15% to 20% of the dollar content.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.\nThat will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you.\nI wonder if you could talk to the XPU market?\nHow are your customers sort of reacting to some of the rack-scale products from your ASIC, a merchant competitor from NVIDIA? You know, how do they sort of get the connectivity to multiple XPUs inside the rack? You know, just how does that present a competitive dynamic for you? Thanks.\nWell, it's, you know, everybody's trying to figure out when you start, when you, when you connect a cluster on a single fabric of 10,000 XPUs or GPU, say GPU, and scale it up to 100,000 and on to 500,000 and a million is a whole new game in terms of architecture. And so you guys hear the differences of when you do this racks, you have what you call scale up and then you have joining rack to rack because you have no choice. You can't get to a million, for that matter, 100,000. Otherwise you call it scale out. And that's a continuing evolving architecture. But I think each of these hyperscale customers of ours have at this point kind of figured out how to get there.\nHence a roadmap that will keep growing from 100,000 to a million XPU cluster on pretty much similar architecture basis over the next three, four years.\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Hock. I know the team is putting out an AI guide for fiscal 2025, and I appreciate the multi-year sort of SAM opportunity outlook. But for this year, you know, can we look at what your customers on the networking and custom accelerators are thinking about from a data center CapEx spending perspective? So for example, our latest roll-up is that the top four cloud and hyperscalers are going to grow their CapEx 35% to 40% in fiscal 2025. I would expect that your AI business would sort of closely mirror this trend, maybe even think about it as a base case when we think about Ethernet taking share from InfiniBand, ASICs going faster than merchant GPUs, maybe the profile of your AI business can go even faster than the CapEx trends. Either way, ±.\nIs that how we should think about the growth in the AI business, roughly in line with CapEx growth trends of your large cloud and hyperscale customers?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nNo.\nIt doesn't. I mean, I think the hyperscalers tend to give you an overall CapEx numbers. I'm not sure they really break up between what's AI and what's non-AI out there. And.\nClearly the spend in AI outstrips the spend in non AI even on the CapEx. And so no, I won't necessarily stop at that.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay.\nNo.\nThank you. Hock.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThanks for taking my question. I have a more tactical question. So you have software pushouts into Q1 which is elevating it. Should we think about those pushouts that are rolling off as we get into Q2 and the back half of the year, and like what are the implications on the shape of software for the year as well as gross margins? Because I guess maybe in the back half you'll have like software a little weaker versus Q2 as well as the XPU stronger. So should we be thinking about the gross margin trajectory off the current elevated base, kind of like easing as we get in the back half, so just anything you can tell us around the shape of the software, around the pushouts, and implications for revenues and gross margins?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nWell, number one, it's a slip. I think you're overthinking.\nThis whole project. It's just a slip. Pick it up and you see the differences between Q4 growth and Q1 reacceleration. That's all it is.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nI'm asking, should Q2 be lower because.\nYou had push out into Q1, is what I'm asking.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nNo, it doesn't. Not Q2. No, it won't have material impact on the rest of the fiscal 2025.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nDo you think software can kind of hold at these levels or even grow off of these like $6.5 billion levels as we go through the year?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nI'm not giving you guidance. I might remind you for the rest of the year. I'm just giving you guidance for Q1. But I'm just telling you your analysis is kind of defective.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nI've been told that before.\nOkay, thank you Hock, thank you.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question, and that will come from Benjamin Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open.\n\nBenjamin Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius\n\nHey, thanks a lot and nice quarter there Hock. I wanted to ask you about the $60 to 90 billion with a little more clarity. Previously you've talked about cumulative TAM from your customers. So you know, and that you know, is this a run rate TAM or a cumulative TAM kind of meaning do we take the $12.2 then add some, you know, growth for the next two years and then think of it that way or do we think of we take a share of like a $75 billion TAM and what your revenue yield is? And then I just also was hoping you could clarify you're not including those two new customers. Do those two customers have the same $20 to 30 billion TAM each that the current three do or do you think they're smaller or bigger?\nSorry about the multi part question there.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nNo, I think you asked. The first part was very similar to an earlier question, but I'd be pleased to clarify.\nNo, there's $60 to 90 billion. We are not talking cumulative SAM or TAM anymore. We are putting for you a destination, so to speak, a milestone which happens to be three years since 2027, possibly slip a bit part of 28, but 2020 sense we are seeing a destination 2027 or milestone, better one where.\nThe deployment of those large scale AI clusters, each on single fabric, pretty much to run those large LLM models would come to $60 to 90 billion. In that one year period and collectively all three of them.\nTo answer.\nYou know, possibly yes, at least one of them we believe yes. But you know what, I don't want you adding one plus one equals two here. Those are not.\nValidated in our view under our model as customers. So please don't do your addition to that 60 to 90 million SAM that I have postulated in my remarks.\n\nBenjamin Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. Thanks Ridley. That's a good question. I want to talk about the cash return side of things. Great job on the dividend increase. The other 50% is fiscal 2025 a year where you're going to still be paying down debt. Is share repurchases in the mix or Hock, you mentioned that VMware, the integration is largely now behind you. Usually that puts you on the prowl looking for deals. Is that something we should in general think about or is, you know, there are regulatory issues that are still a concern. Just trying to figure out what that other 50% is going to go towards this year.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nOh well.\nLet's start with. Yeah, the other 50% of cash that will be generated that we're not used to. That is beyond dividends. We have two uses for it. We've always said one is parking on the balance sheet for.\nThe opportunity to buy someone else. But in reality, we're buying big enough companies. You almost say that 50% cash is sitting there. It's not adequate. So the likely use of that 50% cash is, as Kirsten indicated in her prepared remarks, pay down debt. We do intend to use part of that 50% free cash flow that's not used for dividends to go delever ourselves given the size of the debt load we are taking on or we have taken on since we acquired VMware.\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nCFO and Chief Accounting Officer, Broadcom\n\nYeah, Ross, it's Kirsten. We want to focus on reducing interest expense. So we'll go after those term loans. So yes, the focus will be on paying down debt.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question.\nThat will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks for taking my question back to AI. What do you think is the SAM in 2024 so we can get a baseline view of what your $12.2 billion in sales represent? And is your assumption that you maintain the share, right? You grow it or what happens to that share over time? And then for a related question to that, is what happens to your semiconductor gross margins if AI grows to such an extent? Because you gave us a mid single digit for non AI. And I'm wondering if AI gets to be such a big part of semis, what happens to gross margin? So both kind of the baseline of what SAM was this year and what happens to your share and margins over time?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nOkay, that's a fair, very insightful question. On the first one which, on the first one anyway, where we are saying what is the baseline on the $60 to 90 billion in three years time where we are specifying down to these three customers of ours, and I would estimate.\nThis 2024 for that to be about less than $20 billion. $15 to 20 billion at this point.\nIn 2024, $15 to 20 billion going to $60 to 90 billion.\nIn terms of margins. Well, don't get too hung up on gross margin, please.\nVivek, because you're not wrong. Gross margin in semiconductors will dilute you in saying that. But, see, the game here is the revenue will leverage so much on the spending we have to do to generate it that the operating margin will improve from where we are today.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nHarsh Kumar\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah.\nHey, first of all, guys, huge congratulations on successfully integrating VMware.\nSo much ahead of your time frame.\nHock, I had a two-part question. Is there a simple dollar metric that we can think of for network attached to XPUs? For example, it's $1 of networking to $1 of XPUs.\nAnd then for my question, in one.\nOf your posts you talked about sovereign data centers and VMware. I guess my question is is there a play for Broadcom outside of the software piece? In other words, are you noticing that sovereign guys are wanting to use XPUs or are they sticking to merchant silicon?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nLet me answer your question backwards. Easiest one first, sovereign guys.\nMost of the enterprise. It's pretty much like enterprise market, you know, which is simply merchant silicon guys do not have the capability necessarily to create first the hardware, but more importantly this software stack to enable transistors in hardware to translate itself into high-level language which then the LLM, API and API application, large language models and applications, AI application can operate on.\nJust stick to what's available, which.\nIs merchant silicon and the available?\nEcosystem of.\nSoftware layers that allow that translation. So it will be there very much that way on XPUs. Then on your first question of what's the ratio between AI, connectivity, networking, that is just saying to XPU's to compute well, it's a changing number. As the cluster expands though, there are some ratios to be looked at. And the simple ratio to look at is there is scale up and there is scale out.\nAnd as we expand into a single fabric.\nCluster of XPUs or GPUs that grows bigger and bigger, guess what is more important? Scale up becomes more and more important, and the ratio we are talking about as we move up increases almost exponentially. Which is why I'm saying from probably networking as a percent of AI content in silicon today of between 5% to 10, you're going up to 15% to 20 by the time you hit 500,000 to a million XPU GPU clusters.\n\nHarsh Kumar\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question.\nThat will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. The $60 to 90 billion SAM forecast for fiscal 2027. I'm curious if you guys have a view on the TAM. So just want to know how big the SAM is as a percentage of the total opportunity set. And then my main question is you talked about going for leading market share within your SAM, which makes sense. I assume you're not assuming 100% share. So the value of that $60 to 90 billion that you won't be capturing, is that a function of some of your hyperscaler customers wanting to capture value internally or is it?\nAlways having a backup or a second source? Is there low margin business that you just simply won't pursue? How should we think about the part of the $60 to 90 billion that you won't be going after or won't be capturing? Thank you.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nOkay, first to answer with a bigger overarching question, I don't know the TAM. I don't make any thoughts too hard. I don't think too far and hard about them. We don't think in macro approaches. We're looking at line of sight here. So I got customers. I try to figure out how much volume, where the roadmap of the customer is not just product technology but what they are building out. What is their consumption pattern like? That's how we create our SAM actually in a way, bottoms up, then tops down. So I have no idea what the TAM is beyond customers. We are serving closely, collaborating closely. So let's make it clear in terms of.\nMarket share, don't know. But as you all can see, it's a very large substantial market opportunity. There's room for many players. All we're doing to do is gain our fair share. We're just very well positioned today, having the best technology very relevant in this space. We have by far one of the best technology combination technology out there to do XPUs and to connect those XPUs. The silicon technology that enables it, we have it here in Broadcom by the boatloads, which is why we are very well positioned with these three customers of ours.\nSo, based on that, we are, and based on the depth of our engagement today, this isn't just that; this was going on now for a while in terms of deep engagement with engineering teams from the other side, each of the other side we are very well positioned, well on the way to creating a multi-year roadmap.\nTo enable these few customers of ours to get to where their ambition leads them to be in. It's because of the great technology we have where we are actually enabling in the areas we are very good at. We're talking about, you know, silicon design, packaging design, and optical technology.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question.\nThat will come from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nManaging Director and Technology Senior Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGreat.\nThanks for taking my question. I want to add my congrats to all the great results this year and for the quarter and outlook. But, Hock. You know, this is sort of a stunning turn of events in the last year with what we've been accustomed to thinking of as a sort of mature, slow growth business at its core with all the M&A tacked onto it. And I wonder with the sudden acceleration of the organic business, given your, you know, exposure to these capabilities in ASICs to bring AI technologies to customers, does that change your interest level in M&A and does it change your.\nFocus area of potential M&A going forward? Thank you.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nNo it doesn't.\nWe are open, still open, always open. Because that's been a core part of our strategy business model of this company for the last 10 years, which is.\nWe're always interested in adding to our portfolio very good franchise assets, be they in semiconductors or be they in infrastructure software. As long as they meet the criteria, the fairly demanding criteria we look for, we would always be open to acquiring this asset and adding into our portfolio. So no, it hasn't changed our thinking at all.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nManaging Director and Technology Senior Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question.\nThat will come from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nVijay Rakesh\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nHi Hock. Great results here. Just a question back on the AI custom silicon side, I guess it looks like of that $17.5 billion TAM here, SAM here you have about 70% share. So assuming that 70% looking out to 2027, your custom silicon AI revenue should be like $50 billion in fiscal 2027. So do we have a good line of sight into fiscal 2026 showing a pretty nice ramp to hit those numbers maybe with Ultra Ethernet and all that to do the 1 million XPUs. How do you see that? Thanks.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nI don't have, we don't have really a good enough line of sight to want to share it with you. Nor for that matter do we have a policy of giving you guidance beyond what we're doing one quarter a year. But we do want to give you a sense of where this journey is headed. We want to give you a sense of where this could lead us, this company, in terms of its AI semiconductor AI revenue trajectory. Given that we now made it very open, official almost, that we are going forward only guiding AI revenue versus non AI revenue, we figured at least give you a sense of what the AI trajectory is on a non AI. We have known it, you have known it with us for a long time.\nIt's mature, stable, evolving, growing mid-single-digit GDP plus. AI will never give you that. So that's why we take the step now, unprecedented in some ways, of laying that roadmap in terms of potential market for AI. Now the only market we have is the customers we have and the end markets we serve. So we create this SAM and the clarity we see is to some extent in 2027. How that journey progresses with each of our.\nCustomers is.\nSomewhat variable. It's the rate of the adoption and.\nOf their own XPUs and we'll be.\nVery much a part of that journey. But because of that we expect to see a situation where there could be quarter to quarter variability given there are only three customers and the fact that deployment comes in big chunks typically. So my best answer to you is I can't give you any clarity beyond what I've given so far.\n\nVijay Rakesh\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGot it. And the other two CSPs, when do you see them ramping?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nWell, first of all, I got to get into production, they got to get into production. So whether we cross that bridge or get to it, we are working very hard with them to get it. Production stage, we're pretty deeply engaged with tablet chips, but they got to get their software ready, they got to get it tested, and they got to get going on it. So no, I'm not sure, but definitely over the next three years.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, that is all the time we have for our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ji Yoo, Head of Investor Relations, for closing remarks.\n\nJi Yoo\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Broadcom\n\nThank you, Cherie. Broadcom currently plans to report its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 after close of market on Thursday, 6 March 2024. A public webcast of Broadcom's earnings conference call will follow at 2:00PM Pacific Time. That will conclude our earnings call today. Thank you all for joining.

Welcome to Broadcom Inc. Q2 fiscal year 2024 financial results conference call. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ji Yoo, Head of Investor Relations of Broadcom Inc.\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nCFO, Broadcom Inc\n\nThank you, Operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Hock Tan, President and CEO, Kirsten Spears, Chief Financial Officer, and Charlie Kawwas, President, Semiconductor Solutions. Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables after the market closed, describing our financial performance for Q2 of fiscal year 2024. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investor Section of Broadcom's website at broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and an audio replay of the call can be accessed for one year through the Investor Section of Broadcom's website.\nDuring the prepared comments, Hock and Kirsten will be providing details of our Q2 fiscal year 2024 results, guidance for our Q2 2024, as well as commentary regarding the business environment. We'll take questions after the end of our prepared comments. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.\nIn addition to US GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. I'll now turn the call over to Hock.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nThank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining today. In our fiscal Q2 2024, consolidated net revenue was $12.5 billion, up 43% year-on-year, as revenue included a full quarter of contribution from VMware. But if we exclude VMware, consolidated revenue was up 12% year-on-year. This 12% organic growth in revenue was largely driven by AI revenue, which stepped up 280% year-on-year to $3.1 billion, more than offsetting continued cyclical weakness in semiconductor revenue from Enterprises and Telcos. Let me now give you more color on our two reporting segments.\nBeginning with software, in Q2, infrastructure software segment revenue of $5.3 billion was up 175% year-on-year and included $2.7 billion in revenue contribution from VMware, up from $2.1 billion in the prior quarter. The integration of VMware is going very well. Since we acquired VMware, we have modernized the product SKUs from over 8,000 disparate SKUs to four core product offerings, and simplified the go-to-market flow, eliminating a huge amount of channel conflicts. We are making good progress in transitioning all VMware products to a subscription licensing model.\nSince closing the deal, we have actually signed up close to 3,000 of our largest 10,000 customers to enable them to build a self-service virtual private cloud on-prem. Each of these customers typically sign up to a multi-year contract, which we normalize into an annual measure known as Annualized BookingValue, or ABV. This metric, ABV, for VMware products accelerated from $1.2 billion in Q1 to 1.9 billion in Q2. For reference, for the consolidated Broadcom software portfolio, ABV grew from $1.9 billion in Q1 to 2.8 billion over the same period in Q2. Meanwhile, we have integrated SG&A across the entire platform and eliminated redundant functions.\nYear to date, we have incurred about $2 billion of restructuring and integration costs and drove our spending run rate at VMware to $1.6 billion this quarter, from what used to be $2.3 billion per quarter pre-acquisition. We expect spending will continue to decline towards a $1.3 billion run rate exiting Q4, better than our previous $1.4 billion plan, and will likely stabilize at $1.2 billion post-integration. VMware revenue in Q1 was $2.1 billion. It grew to $2.7 billion in Q2 and will accelerate towards a $4 billion per quarter run rate. We therefore expect operating margins for VMware to begin to converge towards that of classic Broadcom software by fiscal 2025.\nTurning to semiconductors, let me give you more color by end markets. Networking, Q2 revenue of $3.8 billion grew 44% year-on-year, representing 53% of semiconductor revenue. This was again driven by strong demand from hyperscalers for both AI networking and custom accelerators. It's interesting to note that as AI data center clusters continue to deploy, our revenue mix has been shifting towards an increasing proportion of networking. We doubled the number of switches we sold year-on-year, particularly Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3, which we deploy successfully in close collaboration with partners like Arista Networks, Dell, Juniper, and Supermicro.\nAdditionally, we also doubled our shipments of PCI Express Switches and NICs in the AI backend fabric. We're leading the rapid transition of optical interconnects in AI data centers to 800 Gb bandwidth, which is driving accelerated growth for our DSPs, Optical Lasers, and PIN Diodes. We are not standing still. Together with these same partners, we are developing the next generation switches, DSPs, and Optics that will drive the ecosystem towards 1.6 Tb connectivity to scale out larger AI accelerator clusters. Talking of AI Accelerators, you may know our hyperscale customers are accelerating their investments to scale up the performance of these clusters.\nTo that end, we have just been awarded the next-generation custom AI Accelerators for these hyperscale customers of ours. Networking these AI Accelerators is very challenging, but the technology does exist today. In Broadcom, we have the deepest and broadest understanding of what it takes for complex, large workloads to be scaled out in an AI fabric. Proven in point, seven of the largest eight AI Clusters in deployment today use Broadcom Ethernet Solutions. Next year, we expect all mega-scale GPU deployments to be on Ethernet. We expect the strength in AI to continue.\nAnd because of that, we now expect networking revenue to grow 40% year-on-year compared to our prior guidance of over 35% growth. Moving to Wireless, Q2 wireless revenue of $1.6 billion grew 2% year-on-year, was seasonally down 19% quarter-on-quarter, and represents 22% of Semiconductor revenue. And in fiscal '24, helped by content increases. We reiterate our previous guidance for Wireless revenue to be essentially flat year-on-year. This trend is wholly consistent with our continued engagement with our North American customer, which is deep, strategic, and multi-year, and represents all of our Wireless business.\nNext, our Q2 Server, Storage, and Connectivity revenue was $824 million, or 11% of Semiconductor revenue, down 27% year-on-year. We believe, though, Q2 was the bottom in Server and Storage. Based on updated demand forecasts and bookings, we expect a modest recovery in the second half of the year. Accordingly, we forecast fiscal '24, Server, and Storage revenue to decline around the 20% range year-on-year. Moving on to Broadband, Q2 revenue declined 39% year-on-year to $730 million and represented 10% of Semiconductor revenue. Broadband remains weak on a continued pause in Telco and service providers spending.\nWe expect Broadcom to bottom in the second half of the year with a recovery in 2025. Accordingly, we are revising our outlook for fiscal '24, Broadband revenue to be down high 30s year-on-year from our prior guidance for a decline of just over 30% year-on-year. Finally, Q2 Industrial revenue resale of $234 million declined 10% year-on-year. For fiscal '24, we now expect Industrial resales to be down double-digit percentage year-on-year compared to our prior guidance for a high single-digit percentage decline. So to sum it all up, here's what we are seeing. For fiscal '24, we expect revenue from AI to be much stronger at over $11 billion.\nNon-AI semiconductor revenue has bottomed in Q2, and is likely to recover modestly for the second half of fiscal '24. On infrastructure software, we're making very strong progress in integrating VMware and accelerating its growth. Pulling all these three key factors together, we are raising our fiscal '24 revenue guidance to $51 billion. And with that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nCFO, Broadcom Inc\n\nThank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q2 financial performance, which included a full quarter of contribution from VMware. Consolidated revenue was $12.5 billion for the quarter, up 43% from a year ago. Excluding the contribution from VMware, Q2 revenue increased 12% year-on-year. Gross margins were 76.2% of revenue in the quarter. Operating expenses were $2.4 billion, and R&D was $1.5 billion, both up year-on-year primarily due to the consolidation of VMware. Q2 operating income was $7.1 billion and was up 32% from a year ago, with operating margin at 57% of revenue.\nExcluding transition costs, operating profit of $7.4 billion was up 36% from a year ago, with operating margin of 59% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $7.4 billion, or 60% of revenue. This figure excludes $149 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our two segments, starting with semiconductors. Revenue for our semiconductor solution segment was $7.2 billion and represented 58% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 6% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solution segment were approximately 67%, down 370 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by a higher mix of custom AI Accelerators.\nOperating expenses increased 4% year-on-year to $868 million on increased investment in R&D, resulting in semiconductor operating margins of 55%. Now moving on to infrastructure software. Revenue for infrastructure software was $5.3 billion, up 170% year-on-year, primarily due to the contribution of VMware and represented 42% of revenue. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 88% in the quarter, and operating expenses were $1.5 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of 60%. Excluding transition costs, operating margin was 64%.\nNow moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.4 billion and represented 36% of revenues. Excluding cash used for restructuring and integration of $830 million, free cash flows of $5.3 billion were up 18% year-on-year and represented 42% of revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue has declined from 2023 due to higher cash interest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition and higher cash taxes due to a higher mix of US income and the delay in the reenactment of Section 174. We spent $132 million on capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding were 40 days in Q2, consistent with 41 days in Q1.\nWe ended Q2 with inventory of $1.8 billion, down 4% sequentially. We continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across our ecosystem. We ended Q2 with $9.8 billion of cash and $74 billion of gross debt. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $48 billion in fixed-rate debt is 3.5% and 8.2 years, respectively. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $28 billion in floating-rate debt is 6.6% and 2.8 years, respectively. During the quarter, we repaid $2 billion of our floating-rate debt, and we intend to maintain this quarterly repayment of debt throughout fiscal 2024.\nTurning to capital allocation, in the quarter, we paid stockholders $2.4 billion of cash dividends based on a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $5.25 per share. In Q2, non-GAAP diluted share count was 492 million, as the 54 million shares issued for the VMware acquisition were fully weighted in the Q2. We paid $1.5 billion withholding taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of 1.2 million AVGO shares. Today, we are announcing a 10-for-1 forward stock split of Broadcom's common stock to make ownership of Broadcom stock more accessible to investors and to employees.\nOur stockholders of record, after the close of market on 11 July 2024, will receive an additional nine shares of common stock after the close of market on 12 July, with trading on a split-adjusted basis expected to commence at market open on 15 July 2024. In Q3, reflecting a post-split basis, we expect share count to be approximately 4.92 billion shares. Now on to guidance.\nWe are raising our guidance for fiscal year 2024 consolidated revenue to $51 billion and adjusted EBITDA to 61%. For modeling purposes, please keep in mind that GAAP net income and cash flows in fiscal year 2024 are impacted by restructuring and integration-related cash costs due to the VMware acquisition. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder to ask a question, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press star one one again. Due to time restraints, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks for taking my question. Hock, I would appreciate your perspective on the emerging competition between Broadcom and NVIDIA across both accelerators and Ethernet Switching. So on the Accelerator side, they are going to launch their Blackwell product at many of the same customers that you have a very large position in the custom compute.\nSo I'm curious how you think customers are going to do that allocation decision, just broadly what the visibility is. And then I think part B of that is, as they launch their Spectrum-X Ethernet switch, do you think that poses increasing competition for Broadcom and the Ethernet switching side in AI for next year? Thank you.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nVery interesting question, Vivek. On AI Accelerators, I think we're operating on a different, to start with, scale, much a different model. The GPUs, which are the AI Accelerator of choice in a merchant environment, is something that is extremely powerful as a model. It's something that NVIDIA operates in a very, very effective manner. We don't even think about competing against them in that space, not in the least. That's where they're very good at, and we know where we stand with respect to that. Now, what we do for very selected or selective hyperscalers.\nIs, if they have the skill and, you know, the skills to try to create silicon solutions, which are AI Accelerators, to do particular very complex AI workloads, we're happy to use our IP portfolio to create those custom ASIC AI Accelerators. So I do not see them as truly competing against each other. Far from me to say I'm trying to position myself to be a competitor on basically GPUs in this market. We're not. We are not competitors to them. We don't try to be either. Now, on networking, maybe that's different. But again, people may be approaching, and they may be approaching it from a different angle we are. We are, as I indicated all along, very deep in Ethernet.\nWe've been doing Ethernet for over 25 years, Ethernet networking. We've gone through a lot of market transitions, and we have captured a lot of market transitions from cloud-scale networking to routing, and now AI. It's a natural extension for us to go into AI. We also recognize that being the AI compute engine of choice in the ecosystem, which is GPUs, that they are trying to create a platform that is probably end-to-end very integrated. We take the approach that we don't do those GPUs, but we enable the GPUs to work very well. If anything else, we supplement and hopefully complement those GPUs with customers who are building bigger and bigger GPU clusters.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to stick on the AI theme, Hock. The strong growth that you had in the quarter, the 280% year-over-year, could you delineate a little bit between if that's the compute offload side versus the connectivity side? And then as you think about the growth for the full year, how are those split in that realm as well? Are they kind of going hand in hand, or is one side growing significantly faster than the other, especially with the, I guess you said, the next generation accelerators are now going to be Broadcom as well?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nWell, it does say your question on the mix. You're right. It's something we don't really predict very well, nor understand completely, except in hindsight, because it's tied to some extent to the cadence of deployment of when they put in the AI Accelerators versus when they put in the infrastructure that puts it together, the networking. We don't really quite understand it 100%. All we know is it used to be 80% accelerators, and 20% networking. It's now running closer to 2/3 accelerators, and 1/3 networking. We're probably heading towards 60/40 by the close of the year.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the $11 billion AI guide. You'd be at $11.6 billion even if you didn't grow AI from the current level in the second half. It feels to me like you're not suggesting that. It feels to me like you think it would be growing. So why wouldn't that AI number be a lot more than $11.6 billion? It feels like it ought to be. Or am I missing something?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nBecause I guided just over $11 billion. They say it could be what you think it is. Quarterly shipments get sometimes very lumpy. And it depends on rate of deployment. It depends on a lot of things. So you may be right. You may estimate it better than I do. But the general trajectory is getting better.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nOkay. So I guess, again, how do I—are you just suggesting that that more than $11 billion is sort of like the worst it could be because that would just be flat at the current levels? But you're also suggesting that things are getting better into the back half, so.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nCorrect.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nOkay. So I guess we just take that that's a very—if I'm reading it wrong, that that's just a very conservative number.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nThat's the best forecast I have at this point, Stacy.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nAll right. Okay, Hock. Thank you. I appreciate it.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Hock, on cloud and AI networking silicon, good to see that the networking mix is steadily increasing. Like clockwork, the Broadcom team has been driving a consistent two-year cadence, right, of new product introductions, Trident, Tomahawk, Jericho family of switching and routing products for the past seven generations. You layer on top of that, your GPU, TPU customers are accelerating their cadence of new product introductions and deployments of their products. So is this also driving faster adoption curve for your latest Tomahawk and Jericho products?\nAnd then maybe just as importantly, like clockwork, it's been two years since you've introduced Tomahawk 5 product introduction, right. Which if I look back historically means you have silicon and are getting ready to introduce your next generation three-nanometer Tomahawk 6 products. Which would, I think, put you two to three years ahead of your competitors. Can you just give us an update there?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nHarlan, you're pretty insightful there. Yes. We launched Tomahawk 5 in '23. So you're right. By late '25, the time we should be coming out with Tomahawk 6, which is the 100 Tb switch. Yes.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nAnd is this acceleration of cadence by your GPU and TPU partners, is that also what's kind of driving the strong growth in the networking products?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nWell, you know what? Sometimes you have to let things take its time. But it's two-year cadence, so we're right on. Late '23 was when we shipped it out to a Tomahawk 5. And adoption, you're correct, with AI has been tremendous because it ties in with the need for very large bandwidth in the networking, in the fabric for AI Clusters, AI Data Centers. But regardless, we've always targeted Tomahawk 6 to be out two years after that, which we should put it into late '25.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nOkay. Thank you, Hock.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director, Melius\n\nHey, thanks a lot. Congrats on the quarter guide. Hock, I wanted to talk a little bit more about VMware. Just wanted to clarify if it is indeed going better than expectations. How would you characterize the customer willingness to move to subscription? Also just a little more color on Cloud Foundation. You've cut the price there, and are you seeing that beat expectations? Thanks a lot.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nThanks. Thanks for your kind regards on the quarter. But as far as VMware is concerned, we're making good progress. The journey is not over by any means. But it's pretty much very much to expectation. Moving to subscription, well, in VMware, we're very slow compared to, I mean, a lot of other guys, Microsoft, Salesforce, Oracle, who have already been pretty much in subscription. So VMware is late in that process. But we're trying to make up for it by offering it and offering it in a very compelling manner because subscription is the right thing to do, right?It's a situation where you put out your product offering, and you update it, patch it, but update it feature-wise.\nEverything else, and capabilities on a continual basis, almost like getting your news on an ongoing basis, subscription online versus getting it in a printed manner once a week. That's how I compare perpetual to subscription. So it's very interesting for a lot of people to want to get on. And so to no surprise, they are getting on very well. The big selling point we have, as I indicated, is the fact that we're not just trying to keep customers kind of stuck on just server or compute virtualization. That's a great product, and great technology, but that's been out for 20 years.\nBased on what we are offering now at a very compelling price point, compelling and very attractive price point. The whole stack, software stack, to use vSphere and its basic fundamental technology to virtualize networking, storage, operation, and management, the entire data center, and create this self-service private cloud. And thanks for saying it.\nYou're right. And we have priced it down to the point where it's comparable with just compute virtualization. So yes, that's getting a lot of interest, a lot of attention from the customers who have signed up, who would like to deploy the ability to deploy their own private cloud on-prem as a nice complement, maybe even alternative or hybrid to public clouds. That's the selling point. And we're getting a lot of interest from our customers in doing that.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director, Melius\n\nGreat. And it's on track for build by Q4 still, which is reiterated.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nWell, I didn't give a specific time frame, did I? But it's on track as we see this process growing towards a $4 billion quarter.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director, Melius\n\nOkay. Thanks a lot, Hock.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Thank you so much for taking the question. I guess kind of a follow-up to the previous question on your software business. Hock, you seem to have pretty good visibility into hitting that $4 billion run rate over the medium term, perhaps. You also talked about your operating margins in that business converging to classic Broadcom levels. I know the integration's not done, and you're still kind of in debt paydown mode.\nBut how should we think about your growth strategy beyond VMware? Do you think you have enough drivers both on the semiconductor side and the software side to continue to drive growth, or is M&A still an option beyond VMware? Thank you.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nInteresting question. And you're right. As I indicated in my remarks, even without the contribution from VMware this past quarter, where we have AI helping us, but we have non-AI emiconductors sort of bottoming out, we're able to show 12% organic growth year-on-year. So I have to say, so do we need to rush to buy another company? Answer is no. But all options are always open because we're trying to create the best value for our shareholders who have entrusted us with the capital to do that.\nSo I would not discount that alternative because our strategy, our long-term model, has always been to grow through a combination of acquisition, but also on the assets we acquire to really improve, invest, and operate them better to show organic growth as well. But again, organic growth, often enough, is determined very much by how fast your market would grow. So we do look towards acquisitions now and then.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nBlayne Curtis\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you, Hock, on the networking business kind of ex-AI. Obviously, I think there's an inventory correction the whole industry is seeing. But just kind of curious, I don't think you mentioned that it was at a bottom.\nSo, just perspective, I think you're down about 60% year-over-year. Is that business finding a bottom? I know you said overall, the whole semi business, non-AI should see recovery. Are you expecting any there, and any perspective on just customer inventory levels in that segment?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nWe see it behaving. I didn't particularly call it out, obviously, because more than anything else. I kind of link it very much to Server, and Storage, non-AI, that is. And we call Server, and Storage at a bottom, Q2, and we call it to recover modestly second half of the year. We see the same thing in networking, which is a combination of enterprise networking as well as the hyperscalers who run their traditional workloads on those. It's always hard to figure it out sometimes. But it is. So we see the same trajectory as we are calling out on Server, and Storage.\n\nBlayne Curtis\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. Mr. Arcuri, your line is open.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nHi. Hi. Sorry. Thanks. Hock, is there a way to sort of map GPU demand back to your AI networking opportunity? I think I've heard you say in the past that if you spend $10 billion on GPU compute, you need to spend another $10 billion on other infrastructure, most of which is networking. So I'm just kind of wondering if when you see these big GPU numbers, is there sort of a rule of thumb that you use to map it back to what the opportunity will be for you? Thanks.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nThere is, but it's so complex. I stopped creating such a model, Tim. I'm serious. But there is, because one would say that, yeah, for every you almost say for every billion dollars you spend on GPU, you probably would spend probably on networking, and if you include the optical interconnects as part of it, though we're not totally in that market, except for the components like DSPs, lasers, PIN Diodes, that go into those high-bandwidth optical interconnects. But if you just take optical interconnects in totality, switching, all the networking components that goes into attaches itself to clustering a bunch of GPUs.\nYou probably would say that about 25% of the value of the GPU goes to networking. The rest of networking. Now, not entirely all of it is my available market. I don't do the optical interconnects, but I do the few components I talk about in it. But roughly, the simple way to look at it is probably about 25%, maybe 30% of all this infrastructure components is kind of attached to the GPU value point itself. But having said that, it's never whenever that precise, that deployment is the same way.\nSo you may see the deployment of GPU or the purchase of GPU much earlier, and the networking comes later or sometimes the other way around, which is why you're seeing the mix going on within my AI revenue mix. But typically, you run towards that range, over time.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nPerfect, Hock. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nThomas O'Malley\n\nEquity Research Director, Barclays\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and nice results. But my question regards the custom AI business. Hock, you've had a long run here of a very successful business, particularly with one customer. If you look in the market today, you have a new entrant who's playing with different customers. And I know that you said historically that's not really a direct customer to you. But could you talk about what differentiates you from the new entrant in the market as of late?\nAnd then there's been profitability questions around the sustainability of gross margins longer term. Can you talk about if you see any increased competition, and if there's really areas that you would deem more or less defensible in your profile today? And if you would see kind of that additional entrant maybe attack any of those in the future?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nLet me take the second part first, which is our AI accelerator, custom AI accelerator business. It is a very profitable business. Let me put the scale and look at it as examined from a model point of view. I mean, each of these AI Accelerators, no different from a GPU, the way these large language models get run, computing get run on these accelerators, no one single accelerator, as you know, can run these big large language models. You need multiple of them no matter how powerful those accelerators are. But also, and the way the models are run, there's a lot of memory access to memory requirements.\nSo each of these accelerators comes with a large amount of cache memory, as you call it, what you guys probably now know as HBM, high-bandwidth memory specialized for AI Accelerators or GPUs. So we supply both in our custom business. The logic side of it, where the compute function is on doing the chips, hey, the margin there are no different than the margin in most of any of our semiconductor silicon chip business. But when you attach to it a huge amount of memory, memory comes from a third party. There are a few memory makers who make this specialized thing. We don't do margin stacking on that part.\nSo by almost buying basic math, we'll dilute the margin of these AI Accelerators when you sell them with memory, which we do. It does push up revenue somewhat higher, but it is dilute the margin. But regardless, the spend, the R&D, the OpEx that goes to support this as a percent of the revenue, which is higher revenue, is so much less. So on an operating margin level, this is easily as profitable, if not more profitable, given the scale that each of those custom AI Accelerators can go up to.\nIt's even better than our normal operating margin scale. So that's the return on investment that attracts and keeps us going at this game. And this is more than a game. It's a very difficult business. And to answer your first question, there's only one Broadcom, period.\n\nThomas O'Malley\n\nEquity Research Director, Barclays\n\nThanks, Hock.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Karl Ackerman with BNP. Your line is open.\n\nKarl Ackerman\n\nManaging Director, BNP\n\nYes, thank you. Good afternoon. Hock, your networking switch portfolio with Tomahawk and Jericho chipsets allows hyperscalers to build AI Clusters using either a switch-scheduled or endpoint-scheduled network. And that, of course, is unique among competitors. But as hyperscalers seek to deploy their own unique AI Clusters, are you seeing a growing mix of white-box networking switch deployments? I ask because while your custom silicon business continues to broaden, it would be helpful to better understand the growing mix of your $11 billion AI networking portfolio combined this year. Thank you.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nLet me have Charlie address this question. He's the expert.\n\nCharlie Kawwas\n\nPresident of Semiconductor Solutions, Broadcom Inc\n\nYeah. Thank you, Hock. So two quick things on this. One is you're exactly right that the portfolio we have is quite unique in providing that flexibility. And by the way, this is exactly why Hock in his statements earlier on mentioned that seven out of the top eight hyperscalers use our portfolio. And they use it specifically because it provides that flexibility. So whether you have an architecture that's based on an endpoint and you want to actually build your platform that way, or you want that switching to happen in the fabric itself, that's why we have the full end-to-end portfolio. So that actually has been a proven differentiator for us.\nAnd then on top of that, we've been working, as you know, to provide a complete network operating system that's open on top of that using SONiC and SAI, which has been deployed in many of the hyperscalers. And so the combination of the portfolio plus the stack really differentiates the solution that we can offer to these hyperscalers. And if they decide to build their own NICs, their own accelerators, or custom or use standard products, whether it's from Broadcom or other, that platform, that portfolio of infrastructure switching gives you that full flexibility.\n\nKarl Ackerman\n\nManaging Director, BNP\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping to ask a two-part software question. So excluding VMware, your Brocade, CA, and Symantec business is now running $500 million higher for the last two quarters. So curious, is that the new sustainable run rate, or were there one-time events in both January and April that we should be considering? And then the second question is, as you think about VMware Cloud Foundation adoption, are you seeing any sort of crowding out of spending like other software guys are seeing as they repurpose their budgets to IT, or is that business so less discretionary that it's just not an impact to you? Thanks so much.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nWell, on the second one, I don't know about any crowding out, to be honest. It's not. What we're offering, obviously, is not something that they would like to use themselves to be able to do themselves, which is they are already spending on building their own on-prem data centers. And typical approach people take, a lot of enterprises take historically, continue today, that most people do, a lot of people do, is they have best of breed. What I mean was they create a data center that is compute as a separate category, best compute there is, and they often enough use vSphere for compute virtualization to improve productivity, but best of breed there.\nThen they have best of breed on networking, and best of breed on storage with a common management operations layer, which very often is also VMware vRealize. What we're trying to say is this mixed bag, and what they see is this mixed bag, best of breed data center, very heterogeneous, is not grieving that it's not a highly resilient data center. I mean, you have a mixed bag. So it goes down. Where do you find quickly root cause? Everybody's pointing fingers at the other. So we got a problem, not very resilient and not necessarily secure between bare metal in one side and software on the other side.\nSo it's a natural thinking on the part of many CIOs we talk to to say, Hey, I want to create one common platform as opposed to just best of breed of each. So that gets us into that. So if it's a green field, that's not bad. They started from scratch. If it's a brown field, that means they have existing data centers trying to upgrade. Sometimes that's more challenging for us to get that adopted. So I'm not sure there's a crowding out here. There's some competition, obviously, on green field where they can spend a budget on an entire platform versus best of breed. But on the existing data center where you're trying to upgrade, that's a trickier thing to do.\nAnd it cuts the other way as well for us. But so that's how I see it. So in that sense, best answer is I don't think we're seeing a level of crowding out that is any that's very significant for me to mention. In terms of the revenue mix, no, Brocade is having a great, great fiscal year so far and still chugging along. But will that sustain? Hell no. You know that. Brocade goes through cycles like most enterprise purchases. So we're enjoying it while it lasts.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nThank you.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We do have time for one final question. That will come from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nSemiconductor & Artificial Intelligence Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks for squeezing me in. Hock, congrats on yet another great quarter and strong outlook in AI. I also want to ask about something you mentioned with VMware. In your prepared remarks, you highlighted that you've eliminated a tremendous amount of channel conflict. I'm hoping you can linger on this a little bit and clarify maybe what you did and specifically also what you did in the heritage Broadcom software business.\nWhere I think historically you'd shied away from the channel. There was an idea that perhaps you'd reintroduce those products to the channel through a more unified approach using VMware's channel partners or resources. So any sort of clarification here I think would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom Inc\n\nYes. Thank you. That's a great question. Yeah, VMware taught me a few things. They have 300,000 customers. 300,000. That's pretty interesting. Amazing. We look at it. I know under CA, we took a position that let's pick an A-list strategic guys and focus on it. I can't do that in VMware. I have to approach it differently. I start to learn the value of a very strong bunch of partners they have, which are a network of distributors, and something like 15,000 VARs, value-added resellers, supported with these distributors. So we have doubled down and invested in this reseller network in a big way for VMware.\nIt's a great move, I think, but six months into the game, we are seeing a lot more velocity out of it. Now, these resellers, having said that, tend to be very focused on a very long tail of that 300,000 customers. The largest 10,000 customers of VMware are large enterprises who tend to—they are very large enterprises, the largest banks, the largest healthcare companies. Their view is, I want very bespoke service, support, engineering solutions from us. So we created a direct approach, supplemented with their VA of choice where they need to. But on the long tail of 300,000 customers, they get a lot of services too from the resellers, value-added resellers, and so in their way.\nSo we now strengthen that whole network of resellers so that they can go direct, manage supported financially with distributors. We don't try to challenge those guys unless the customers, it all boils down to the end of the day, the customer chose where they'd like to be supported. So we kind of simplify this together with a number of SKUs there are. In the past, unlike what we're trying to do here, everybody is a partner. I mean, you're talking a full range of partners, and whoever makes the biggest deal gets the lowest price. The partner that makes the biggest deal gets the biggest discount, lowest price.\nAnd they're out there basically kind of creating a lot of channel chaos and conflict in the marketplace. Here, we don't. The customers are aware. They can take it direct from VMware to their direct sales force, or they can easily move to the reseller to get it that way. As a third alternative, which we offer, if they chose not—they want to run their applications on VMware, and they want to run it efficiently on the full stack, they have a choice now of going to a hosted environment managed by a network of managed service providers.\nWhich we set up globally that will run the infrastructure, invest, and operate the infrastructure. These enterprise customers just run their workloads in and get it as a service, basically VMware as a service, as a third alternative. We are clear to make it very distinct and differentiated for our end-use customers. They're available to all three is how they chose to consume our technology.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nSemiconductor & Artificial Intelligence Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I would now like to hand the call over to Ji Yoo, head of investor relations, for any closing remarks.

First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I will turn the call over to Ji Yoo, Head of Investor Relations of Broadcom Inc. You may begin.\n\nJi Yoo\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Hock Tan, President and CEO; Kirsten Spears, Chief Financial Officer; and Charlie Kawwas, President, Semiconductor Solutions Group.\nBroadcom distributed a press release and financial tables after the market closed, describing our financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024.

This conference call is being webcast live and an audio replay of the call can be accessed for 1 year through the Investors section of Broadcom's website.\nDuring the prepared comments, Hock and Kirsten will be providing details of our first quarter fiscal year 2024 results, guidance for our fiscal year 2024 as well as commentary regarding the business environment. We'll take questions after the end of our prepared comments. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results.\nI'll now turn the call over to Hock.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Broadcom, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. In our fiscal Q1 2024, consolidated net revenue was $12 billion, up 34% year-on-year as revenue included 10.5 weeks of contribution from VMware. Excluding VMware Consolidated revenue was up 11% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue increased 4% year-on-year to $7.4 billion. and infrastructure software revenue grew 153% year-on-year to $4.6 billion.\nWith respect to infrastructure software, revenue contribution from consolidating VMware drove a sequential jump in revenue by 132%. We expect continued strong bookings at VMware will accelerate revenue growth through the rest of fiscal 2024. In semiconductors, AI revenue quadrupled year-on-year to $2.3 billion during the quarter, more than offsetting the current cyclical slowdown in enterprise and telcos.\nNow let me give you more color on our 2 reporting segments. Starting with software. Q1 Software segment revenue of $4.6 billion was up 156% year-on-year and included $2.1 billion in revenue contribution from VMware. Consolidated bookings in software grew sequentially from less than $600 million to $1.8 billion in Q1 and is expected to grow to over $3 billion in Q2. Revenue from VMware will grow double-digit percentage. Sequentially, quarter-over-quarter, through the rest of the fiscal year.\nThis is simply a result of our strategy with VMware. We are focused on upselling customers, particularly those who are already running their compute workloads with vSphere virtualization tools to upgrade to VMware Cloud Foundation, otherwise branded as VCF. VCF is the complete software stack, integrating compute, storage and networking that virtualizes and modernizes our customers' data centers. this on-prem self-service cloud platform provides our customers a complement and an alternative to public cloud.\nAnd in fact, on a VM Explore last August, VMware and NVIDIA entered into a partnership called VMware Private AI Foundation, which enables VCF to run GPUs. This allows customers to deploy their AI models on-prem. And wherever they do business without having to compromise on privacy and data -- in control of their data. And we are seeing this capability drive strong demand for VCF, from enterprises seeking to run their growing AI workloads on-prem. And reflecting all these factors for the full year, we reiterate our fiscal 2024 guidance for software revenue of $20 billion.\nTurning to semiconductors. Before I give you an overall assessment of this segment, let me provide more color by end markets. Q1 networking revenue of $3.3 billion grew 46% year-on-year, representing 45% of our semiconductor revenue. This was largely driven by strong demand for our custom AI accelerators at our 2 hyperscale customers. This strength extends beyond AI accelerators. Our latest generation Tomahawk 5 800G switches saw through Ethernet mix [ refinements ], DSPs and optical components are experiencing strong demand at hyperscale customers as well as large-scale enterprises deploying AI data centers. For fiscal 2024, given continued strength of AI NAND working demand, we now expect networking revenue to grow over 35% year-on-year compared to our prior guidance for 30% annual growth.\nMoving on to wireless. Q1 wireless revenue of $2 billion decreased 1% sequentially and declined 4% year-on-year representing 27% of semiconductor revenue. As you all may know, the engagement with a North American customer continues to be very deep strategic and, of course, multiyear. And in fiscal 2024, helped by content increases, we reiterate our previous guidance for wireless revenue to be flat year-on-year.\nNext, our Q1 server storage connectivity revenue was $887 million or 12% of semiconductor revenue, down 29% year-on-year. We are seeing weaker demand in the first half, but expect recovery in the second half. Accordingly, we are revising our outlook for fiscal '24 server storage revenue to decline in the mid-20 percentage range year-on-year compared to prior guidance for high teens percent decline year-on-year.\nOn broadband, Q1 revenue declined 23% year-on-year to $940 million and represented 13% of semiconductor revenue. We are seeing a cyclical trough this year for broadband as telco spending continues to weaken and do not expect improvement until late in the year. And accordingly, we are revising our outlook for fiscal '24 broadband revenue to be down 30% year-on-year from our prior guidance of down mid-teens year-on-year. And finally, Q1 industrial resales of $215 million declined 6% year-on-year. In fiscal '24, we continue to expand industrial resales to be down high single digits year upon year.\nAnd in summary, with stronger-than-expected growth from AI more than offsetting the cyclical weakness in broadband and server storage, Q1 semiconductor revenue grew 4% year-over-year to $7.4 billion.\nTurning to fiscal '24. We reiterate our guidance for Semiconductor Solutions revenue to be up mid- to high single-digit percentage year-on-year. I know we told you in December, our revenue from AI would be 25% of our full year semiconductor revenue. We now expect revenue from AI to be much stronger, representing some 35% of semiconductor revenue at over $10 billion. And this more than offset weaker-than-expected demand in broadband and service storage.\nSo for fiscal 2024. In summary, we reiterate our guidance for consolidated revenue to be $50 billion, which represents 40% year-on-year growth. And we reiterate our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of 60%.\nBefore I turn this call over to Kirsten, who will provide more details of our financial performance this quarter, let me just highlight that Broadcom recently published its fourth annual ESG report available on a corporate citizenship side, which discusses the company's sustainability initiatives.\nAs a global technology leader, we recognize Broadcom's responsibility to connect our customers, employees and communities. Through our product and technology innovation and operational excellence, we remain committed to this mission. Kirsten?\n\nKirsten M. Spears\n\nCAO, VP & Corporate Controller, Broadcom Inc.\n\nThank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q1 financial performance, which was a 14-week quarter and included 10.5 weeks of contribution from VMware. Consolidated revenue was $12 billion for the quarter, up 34% from a year ago. Excluding the contribution from VMware, Q1 revenue increased 11% year-on-year. Gross margins were 75.4% of revenue in the quarter. Operating expenses were $2.2 billion and R&D was $1.4 billion, both up year-on-year primarily due to the contribution from VMware.\nQ1 operating income, including VMware, was $6.8 billion and was up 26% from a year ago, with operating margin at 57% of revenue. Excluding transition costs of $226 million in Q1, operating profit of $7.1 billion was up 30% from a year ago, with operating margin of 59% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $7.2 billion or 60% of revenue. This figure excludes $139 million of depreciation.\nNow a review of the P&L for our 2 segments, starting with Semiconductor. Revenue for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was $7.4 billion and represented 62% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 4% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 67%, down 190 basis points year-on-year driven primarily by product mix within our semiconductor end markets. Operating expenses increased 8% year-on-year to $865 million, reflecting a 14-week quarter resulting in semiconductor operating margins of 56%.\nNow moving on to our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $4.6 billion, up 153% year-on-year, primarily due to the contribution of VMware and represented 38% of revenue. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 88% in the quarter, and operating expenses were $1.3 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of 59%. Excluding transition costs, operating margin was 64%.\nMoving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.7 billion and represented 39% of revenues off a higher revenue base. Excluding restructuring and integration spend of $658 million free cash flows were 45% of revenue. We spent $122 million on capital expenditures.\nDays sales outstanding were 41 days in the first quarter compared to 31 days in the fourth quarter on higher accounts receivable due to the VMware acquisition. The accounts receivable we brought on from VMware has payment terms of 60 days unlike Broadcom standard 30 days. We ended the first quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, up 1% sequentially.\nWe continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the first quarter with $11.9 billion of cash and $75.9 billion of gross debt. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $48 billion in fixed rate debt is 3.5% and 8.4 years, respectively.\nThe weighted average coupon rate and used to maturity of our $30 billion in floating rate debt is 6.6% and 3 years, respectively. During the quarter, we repaid $934 million of fixed rate debt that came due. This week, we repaid $2 billion of our floating rate debt, and we intend to maintain this quarterly repayment of debt throughout fiscal 2024.\nTurning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $2.4 billion of cash dividends based on a quarterly common dividend of $5.25 per share. We executed on our plan to complete our remaining share buyback authorization.\nWe repurchased $7.2 billion of our common stock and eliminated $1.1 billion of common stock for taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the repurchase and elimination of approximately 7.7 million AVGO shares. To help you with modeling share count, the weighted effect of the 54 million shares issued for the VMware acquisition resulted in a sequential increase in Q1 to $478 million. With the Q2 non-GAAP diluted share count expected to increase to approximately $492 million as the shares issued are fully weighted in the second quarter.\nNow on to guidance. Regardless of the updated dynamics of our semiconductor and software segments Hock discussed, we choose to reiterate our guidance for fiscal year 2024 consolidated revenue of $50 billion and adjusted EBITDA of 60%. With regard to VMware, in February, we signed a definitive agreement to divest the end-user computing division with the transaction expected to close in 2024 and subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.\nThe EUC division has been classified as discontinued operations in our Q1 financials. We have decided to retain the Carbon Black business and merge Carbon Black with Symantec to form the enterprise security group. The impact on revenue and profitability is not significant.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ji Yoo, Head of Investor Relations of Broadcom Inc. The floor is yours.\n\nJieun Yoo\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Broadcom\n\nThank you, Operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Hock Tan, President and CEO; Kirsten Spears, Chief Financial Officer; and Charlie Kawas, President, Semiconductor Solutions Group. Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables after the market closed, describing our financial performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investor section of Broadcom's website at broadcom.com.\nThis conference call is being webcast live, and an audio replay of the call can be accessed for one year through the Investor section of Broadcom's website. During the prepared comments, Hock and Kirsten will be providing details of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 results, guidance for our fiscal year 2024, as well as commentary regarding the business environment. We'll take questions after the end of our prepared comments. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release.\nComments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. I'll now turn the call over to Hock.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nThank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. In our fiscal Q4 consolidated net revenue was $9.3 billion, up 4% year-on-year, and very much as we had guided at the last conference call. Semiconductor Solutions revenue increased 3% year-on-year to $7.3 billion, and Infrastructure Software revenue grew 7% year-on-year to $2 billion. Overall, while Infrastructure Software remains very stable, Semiconductor is continuing the cyclical slowdown at enterprises and telcos that we have been seeing over the past six months. However, hyperscalers remain strong. Generative AI revenue, driven by Internet solutions and custom AI accelerators, represented close to $1.5 billion in Q4, or 20% of semiconductor revenue, while the rest of the semiconductor revenue continued to be rather stable at around $6 billion.\nMoving on to results for the year, for fiscal 2023, consolidated revenue hit a record $35.8 billion, growing 8% year-on-year. Since 2020, even though we have not made an acquisition, we have shown a robust trajectory of growth, driven by semiconductor growth at an 18% CAGR over the past three years. In fiscal 2023, operating profit grew by 9% year-on-year, and our free cash flow grew 8% year-on-year to $17.6 billion, or 49% of revenue. We returned $13.5 billion in cash to our shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. As you well know, we just closed the acquisition of VMware on 22 November 2023, just about four weeks into Broadcom's fiscal 2024. We are now refocusing VMware on its core business of creating private and hybrid cloud environments among large enterprises globally and divesting non-core assets.\nReflecting the consolidation of a restructured VMware into our 2024 outlook, we forecast our fiscal year 2024 consolidated revenue to be $50 billion. We expect the integration to take about a year and will require close to $1 billion in transition spending, which will largely be done as we exit fiscal 2024. Regardless, we expect our fiscal year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 60% of revenue. Kirsten will give you more details in her section. Now, let me give you more color on our two reporting segments, and I'll start with software. In Q4, as you know, there's no VMware revenue, and the infrastructure software business of CA, Symantec, and Brocade grew 7% year-on-year to $2 billion. Consolidated renewal rates averaged 119% over expiring contracts, and in our strategic accounts, we actually averaged 130%. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance.\nFor the year, renewal rates averaged 116% over expiring contracts, and in strategic accounts, we averaged 124%. Revenue in fiscal 2023 was $7.6 billion, up 3% year-on-year, and our expectation for fiscal 2024 is for these revenues to be $8 billion, which is 4% year-on-year. For the 2024 outlook, we are excited to now include VMware. As we all know, VMware has the leading technology to virtualize entire data centers, not just compute, and by doing so, create private clouds on-prem. Our strategy going forward is simply to enable global enterprises to run their applications across their data centers as well as on public clouds by consuming VMware's higher-value software stack. To attract and keep these workloads across the environment, we are investing in a rich catalog of microservices tools. This will be our focus, and the non-core businesses of end-user computing and Carbon Black will be divested.\nSo for 2024, based on 11 months of contribution from VMware, we expect VMware to contribute $12 billion in revenue. On a consolidated basis, we expect our infrastructure software revenue in 2024 to be $20 billion. Turning now to semiconductor segments, let me give you more color by end markets. Q4 networking revenue of $3.1 billion grew 23% year-on-year, representing 42% of our semiconductor revenue. This was primarily driven by strong demand from hyperscalers for our custom AI accelerators and as well for our networking switches, routers, and NICs, network interface cards dedicated to scaling out AI data centers. As you know, even as Ethernet is the standard protocol in front-end networks, hyperscalers are also deploying Ethernet predominantly in their AI networks. In fiscal 2023, networking revenue grew 21% year-on-year to $10.8 billion. If we exclude the AI accelerators, networking connectivity represented about $8 billion.\nThis is purely silicon, not systems, not cables, nor subsystems. In fiscal 2024, we expect networking revenue to grow 30% year-on-year, driven by accelerating deployments of networking connectivity and expansion of AI accelerators in hyperscalers. Moving to wireless. Consistent with the seasonal launch by our North American customer, Q4 wireless revenue of $2 billion increased 23% sequentially and declined 3% year-on-year, representing 27% of semiconductor revenue. In fiscal 2023, wireless revenue was relatively flat at $7.3 billion, in fact, just down 2% year-on-year. The engagement with our North American customer continues to be deep, strategic, and multi-year. And accordingly, in fiscal 2024, we expect wireless revenue to again remain stable year-on-year. Next, our Q4 server storage connectivity revenue was $1 billion, or 14% of semiconductor revenue, and down 17% year-on-year. In fiscal 2023, server storage connectivity was $4.5 billion, up 11% year-on-year.\nGoing to fiscal 2024, we expect server storage revenue to decline mid- to high-teens % year-on-year, driven by the cyclical weakness that began late 2023. Moving on to broadband, Q4 revenue declined 9% year-on-year to $950 million, in line with expectations, and represented 13% of semiconductor revenue. In fiscal 2023, broadband revenue was $4.5 billion, and up 8% year-on-year. Moving on to fiscal 2024, we expect broadband revenue to be down low- to mid-teens % year-on-year, and reflecting again the further slowdown as the cyclical weakness at service providers that began in late 2023 continues into fiscal 2024. Finally, Q4 industrial sales of $236 million were stable year-on-year. In fiscal 2023, industrial resales were $962 million. In fiscal 2024, we expect industrial resales to be down low single digits % year-on-year.\nSo in summary, fiscal 2023 semiconductor solutions revenue was up 9% year-on-year to $28.2 billion. Revenue from generative AI in fiscal 2023 reached 15% of semiconductor revenue, in line with our expectation. Moving on to fiscal 2024, we forecast semiconductor solutions revenue to be up mid- to high single-digits percent year-on-year. We expect revenue from generative AI to represent more than 25% of the semiconductor revenue, consistent with prior guidance, which more than offsets the lack of growth from non-AI semiconductor revenue. With the consolidation of VMware bringing our infrastructure software segment revenue to $20 billion and the semiconductor segment holding at mid- to high-single-digit growth year-on-year, we are therefore guiding our fiscal 2024 revenue to be $50 billion, which represents 40% year-on-year growth from fiscal 2023. With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nChief Financial Officer, Broadcom\n\nThank you, Hock.\nLet me now provide additional detail on our Q4 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was $9.3 billion for the quarter, up 4% from a year ago. Gross margins were 74.3% of revenue in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, flat year-on-year. R&D of $940 million was also stable year-on-year. Operating income for the quarter was $5.7 billion and was up 4% from a year ago, with operating margin at 62% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $6 billion, or 65% of revenue, in line with expectations. This figure excludes $124 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our two segments, starting with our semiconductor segment. Revenue for our semiconductor solution segment was $7.3 billion and represented 79% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 3% year-on-year.\nGross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 70%, down 110 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by product mix within our semiconductor and markets. Operating expenses were stable year-on-year at $822 million, resulting in operating profit growth of 2% year-on-year and semiconductor operating margins of 58%. Now moving on to our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $2 billion, up 7% year-on-year, and represented 21% of revenue. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 92% in the quarter, and operating expenses were $339 million in the quarter. Q4 operating profit grew 12% year-on-year, with infrastructure software operating margin at 75%. Now moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.7 billion and represented 51% of revenues in Q4. We spent $105 million on capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding were 31 days in the fourth quarter, compared to 30 days in the third.\nWe ended the fourth quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, up 3% sequentially. We continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We exited the quarter with 76 days of inventory on hand, down 80 days in Q3. We ended the fourth quarter with $14.2 billion of cash and $39.2 billion of gross debt, of which $1.6 billion is short-term. Now let me recap our financial performance for fiscal 2023. Our revenue hit a record $35.8 billion, growing 8% year-on-year. Semiconductor revenue was $28.2 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $7.6 billion, up 3% year-on-year. Gross margin for the year was 74.7%, down 90 basis points from a year ago. Operating expenses were $4.6 billion, down 4% year-on-year. Fiscal 2023 operating income was $22.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year, and represented 62% of net revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $23.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year, and represented 65% of net revenue. This figure excludes $502 million of depreciation. We spent $452 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow grew 8% year-on-year to $17.6 billion, or 49% of fiscal 2023 revenue. Now turning to capital allocation. For fiscal 2023, we spent $15.3 billion, consisting of $7.6 billion in the form of cash dividends and $7.7 billion in share repurchases and eliminations. We ended the year with $7.2 billion of authorized share repurchase programs remaining. With the VMware deal closed, we have resumed repurchasing shares under our existing program. In fiscal year 2024, including the incremental shares from the acquisition of VMware and excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 494 million.\nAligned with our ability to generate increased cash flows in the preceding year, and now off of a larger share count base from the acquisition of VMware, we are announcing an increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend in Q1 fiscal 2024 to $5.25 per share, an increase of 14% from the prior quarter. We intend to maintain this target quarterly dividend throughout fiscal 2024, subject to quarterly board approval. This implies our fiscal 2024 annual common stock dividend to be a record $21 per share. I would like to highlight that this represents the 13th consecutive increase in annual dividends since we initiated dividends in fiscal 2011. Now on to guidance.\nAs Hock discussed, with the recent closing of our VMware acquisition and the integration process, which will take at least one year, for fiscal 2024, we will provide our outlook for the full year instead of quarterly guidance. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for fiscal year 2024 is for consolidated revenues of $50 billion. Within this, our fiscal year 2024 semiconductor revenue is expected to grow mid- to high-single-digit percent year-on-year. Our fiscal year 2024 infrastructure software segment revenue from continuing operations is expected to be $20 billion, including $8 billion from CA, Symantec Enterprise, and Brocade, and $12 billion from VMware. With regard to VMware, our forecast for fiscal 2024 revenue of $12 billion reflects 11 months of contribution from VMware. This does not include revenue from EUC and Carbon Black of approximately $2 billion, which we plan to divest.\nWe are also converting an installed base of licenses that is over 60% perpetual today to one that will be mostly subscription by the end of fiscal 2024. Offsetting these, our new strategy for VMware will accelerate revenue growth over the next three years. During fiscal 2024, we expect to incur about $1 billion of spend related to transitioning VMware into the new Broadcom model. This transition spending will be largely completed by the end of the fiscal year, as our VMware spending run rate exits fiscal 2024 at approximately $1.4 billion per quarter, down 40% from a year ago. So in fiscal year 2024, including VMware, we expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately 60% of projected revenue. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star 11 on your telephone.\nTo withdraw your question, please press star 11 again. Due to time restraints, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks for taking my question. Hock, so yesterday, one of your peers suggested that the market for AI accelerators could be as large as $400 billion. So kind of three related questions. What do you think about that number? And then number two, how does Broadcom participate in that, just beyond your large kind of ASIC project on the compute offload side? And then what does this larger AI accelerator market imply for your Ethernet networking business?\nI assume that they are correlated, but what is the right way to think about what is presumably a much larger market for accelerators and how it impacts Broadcom's growth prospects?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nThank you for those very interesting questions. Starting with the first one, I mean, what we're seeing is a market that continues to grow, to accelerate. What is also very obvious is it's very, very dynamic. As architectures of large language models, software models, continue to change, I mean, literally change on the fly, we are also seeing the requirements for compute silicon change.\nIt's very interesting and very fascinating for us, but it also presents quite an interesting opportunity, which is to say that if a customer has a business model that is substantial and has resources which obviously support that, it's getting to a stage that it might make a lot of sense to design AI compute engines, which comprises memory as well as the compute engine itself, that can be tailored, or better word, customized for the particular requirements on applications, on the particular LLM model. We're seeing this, as we all are seeing, LLM models continue to change and the shape of generative AI dynamically change more and more, where training and inference are now starting to, in a way, converge, and the chip designs are changing. We're seeing that in the way we design specific custom chips for hyperscalers. That's interesting.\nSo that's a very interesting opportunity for us. And as I indicated in my remarks, we see that revenue as part of networking revenue, $4 billion in networking for AI networks, and going doubling almost in 2024. Nothing new. We have said that before. And if anything else, we are reinforcing that particular guidance. Now, networking is particularly interesting, as you heard in my opening remarks. It is accelerating as fast as the AI accelerators, the compute engines, are growing. And we see that growing hand in hand, and particularly so as training continues, training of very large language models with very different, and very large parameters keep going on, and things keep changing. So we're seeing no slowdown, in fact, in the uptake on building out these AI networks. If anything else, on average, we are seeing a doubling on size of those networks across the board.\nSo that answers your question. Yeah, I fully concur with AMD when they indicate that it looks like demand appears to be accelerating rather than staying stable or decelerating.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThank you, Hock.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Ross Seymour with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank AG\n\nHi. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Just a quick clarification on the question. The clarification is, is the fiscal year guidance going to be the new protocol, or is that just for this quarter? And then the real question, Hock, is on the VMware side of things. Kirsten talked about it potentially accelerating off of that $12 billion base.\nCan you just talk about the linearity of it, maybe throughout the year, or more importantly, how is it going to be accelerating as people start to look at what the VMware street estimates were before? We know we have to take out the two divested operations, but what are the drivers of acceleration, and how should we consider the magnitude of that as we look forward?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nYeah, we are in a very interesting but very exciting situation here as we move into the next chapter for VMware. As I said, we focus the business on VMware Cloud Foundation, which is the full software stack that virtualizes data centers on-prem, soup to nuts, totally virtualized cloud environment. We are converting more and more customers step by step as they come up for renewals into this higher value stack, and we're doing it on a subscription basis.\nSo it becomes very focused. So we will kick it off at a much lower rate because subscription generally brings down revenues, as you know, in software based on revenue recognition. But we see a trajectory of accelerated growth even in 2024, through 2024. And it just doesn't stop there because it's the math and the trajectory. And to answer your question, yeah, right, we are accelerating from $12 billion, and we're probably seeing a double-digit growth for the next three years just by sheer math of selling that higher value virtualization stack versus the very loose component sales in the past, particularly on compute only. And on the fiscal year side, is this a one-quarter thing, or is this the new way you guys are going to be doing it? Oh, that's a good question. Well, we will just give you an indication.\n2024, because it's an accelerating trend, our view is that it's more appropriate and more relevant to getting you guys a sense of where we're headed to turn it to annual guidance for 2024. We will report results every quarter and update our annual guidance 2024 each time we report the quarterly actuals.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank AG\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. One quick housekeeping item question. So even off the lower revenue base starting in fiscal 2024 for VMware, is the team still targeting $8.5 billion plus of EBITDA in three years? And then for my main question, Hock, as you mentioned, right, one of the fastest-growing workloads in accelerated compute is accelerated compute and generative AI.\nAll of these workloads are increasing at an exponential rate, right? You talked about the benefits to your silicon franchise, but given the significant performance requirements of these workloads, right, training, inference, it appears that more of the near-term adoption of running these workloads is on bare metal GPU, TPU, accelerated servers. How is the team exploiting its software-defined data center solutions via either Cloud Foundation or Tanzu to try to help customers focus on AI, sort of drive better utilizations, better economics, faster deployments on this very fast-growing part of the market?\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nChief Financial Officer, Broadcom\n\nWell, as you may be aware, in the last VMware Explore in Las Vegas, VMware came out and announced in partnership with NVIDIA the VMware Private AI Cloud Foundation. Another way of describing it is VMware does the VMware Cloud Foundation software stack, the whole VCF stack, runs NVIDIA CUDA, runs NVIDIA's GPU.\nThat is the partnership. So if you're an enterprise, it's a very easy step to get into AI analytics because the data center that you as an enterprise own on-prem that runs VCF will by default run the NVIDIA GPU software stack as well. Another way to put it, it virtualizes the NVIDIA GPU. That's the VMware software stack as well. So it's a very strong attraction from our perspective to, in fact, accelerate thinking of a lot of enterprise to adopting the whole VCF stack simply because not only does it virtualize the data centers and make your on-prem data center much more resilient, easier to manage, lower cost to manage, it has the added benefit, a big attraction these days, of being able to right away start running AI workloads.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co\n\nAnd then just on my first question, are you guys still targeting $8.5 billion of EBITDA in three years on VMware?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nAs Kirsten indicated, as we exit fiscal 2024, we are practically at a run rate of $8.5 billion EBITDA.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co\n\nPerfect. That's awesome. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Kirsten, along that line, I was wondering if you're going to do 60% EBITDA margin for the company for the full year, how should we think about the beginning and exit rates on EBITDA margin relative to that full year total? And I guess aligned with that, I think I heard you say that VMware OpEx would be down 40% exiting the year versus the entrance rate.\nI'm actually kind of surprised it's not down more. Maybe that's the reinvestment, but is that $1.4 billion per quarter for VMware? That's the right exit rate going for VMware OpEx? And should it grow off of that or what?\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nChief Financial Officer, Broadcom\n\nThat's VMware spending, so that's total spending. Yeah, it will be. But let me tell you, Stacy, you're missing the biggest point. We are on a, as I indicated earlier, to an earlier question by Vivek, I think. Our revenue during this process, even 12 months, four quarters, is on a growth trajectory just because of the way the math works. As we sell more and it's on revenue, and we recognize revenue on a ratable basis, our revenue on a quarterly basis is on a growth trajectory that will keep running and will keep running beyond 2024.\nBut 2024 by itself will be on a revenue trajectory that goes up very rapidly. So what you have thinking about picture is a revenue trajectory that through 2024 that is expanding or growing while the operating expense, total spend, because of reduction of transition expenses, is declining. And that's why we are telling you that by the end of as we exit fiscal 2024, we pretty much get to the guidance we gave you at the beginning of when we announced this deal. So what's the total company EBITDA margin, say, exiting the year then, just to level set? Well, we would get pretty close to where we are supposed to before we started this whole exercise. What was that, 65? I can't remember. Somewhere between 60 and 65. How does that sound, Stacy?\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nI mean, you just did 65 on it.\nSo I think I recall you saying you were going to run VMware at 65. So I guess 65 is the right exit rate?\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nChief Financial Officer, Broadcom\n\nAs Stacy said, you're right. As Stacy said, we'll get to pretty close to 65 on VMware.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGot it. Okay. Helpful. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nHi. Hock, in the language for the approvals from China, they noted some restrictive conditions, and there were some protections around some sensitive information from your competitors. Can you detail what these are, and does this change your view on the synergies you can drive, either cost or, more importantly, revenue?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nThanks. No. I think those conditions are pretty well laid out in the website of the relevant authorities.\nI frankly don't think that it's very appropriate for me to sit here and repeat all those conditions again. It's right in the website, and that's what it is.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nOkay. And it doesn't make you think any differently about the synergies that you can drive from the business?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nNo.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nOkay. Thanks, Hock.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\n\nChristopher Rolland\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Susquehanna Financial Group\n\nThanks for the question. Congrats on the quarter and closing the VMware deal. I guess cost of capital has increased since VMware, since the announcement of the deal. And now that this is closed, I guess, does this affect how you look at your capital allocation strategy going forward? It sounds like you bumped the divvy here, and you restarted your share repurchase now that it's closed.\nAre you going to focus more on repurchases, or is it still same old Broadcom with acquisitions in mind as you deliver?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nAlways with acquisitions in mind. We're continuing our share repurchase program that we promised. So we're definitely buying back shares. Yes, as being Broadcom will deliver quickly. So we'll keep everything in mind, essentially.\n\nKirsten Spears\n\nChief Financial Officer, Broadcom\n\nI'm going to expand a bit on that. We acquired VMware with a pot of cash because it took longer. So we got ourselves a pot of cash. And with that flexibility, not only are we able to give dividends to the new shareholders from VMware's side, we are continuing to complete the commitment we made to you, the shareholders, for the rest of fiscal for the rest of calendar 2023 to buy back that $7 billion of shares out there.\n\nChristopher Rolland\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Susquehanna Financial Group\n\nGreat. Thanks. And maybe a quick follow-up.\nThoughts on just why you didn't offer next quarter in favor of the full year and if you had any thoughts on the shape of revenue for next year, whether it's back half loaded significantly or pretty linear?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nWe just bought a company that's pretty sizable. We're restructuring the business model, and we're changing, among other things, the business model to a subscription business model, as Kirsten said. And we see, therefore, that trajectory of the revenue, a sharp trajectory of growth for the revenue just by sheer conversion to subscription, and the fact that we are also upselling a higher-value product.\nThe combination of that and the fact it's a new company makes it much more sensible, let's put it this way, for us to be able to give you a full-year number rather than a three-month guidance because transition spending might slip, might accelerate revenue, might slip, and giving ourselves three months to tell you what it is, especially on a new environment to us. It's not very, very, I call it, we are not being good to you guys, the shareholders. But for the full year, I think with a hell of a lot more confidence, we will attain those endpoints at the exit.\n\nChristopher Rolland\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Susquehanna Financial Group\n\nVery sensible. Thanks and congrats again.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question.\nHock, I had a question on the semiconductor business and specifically on the non-AI side of things for both networking and server storage connectivity. As you noted, you're obviously going through a cyclical correction. Historically, you've had a pretty good understanding of where customer inventory is. When we simply look at their balance sheets for the public companies, inventory is pretty elevated, particularly on the networking side. What is your interpretation of where inventory is for your products, and how should we think about the timing and pace of recovery as you look into 2024? Thank you.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nOn our books, you can see inventory for our products is pretty darn good, right? Especially compared to our peers. That's because we keep it tight. Out in customers, and we don't sell through channel. We don't sell much through channels.\nWe usually do a lot of it direct to our larger customers. We feel they're in good shape, relatively speaking. We're still in good shape. Now, if you ask me, maybe server storage, that could be a little excessive, but not broadband and certainly not in networking. So overall, on our products, we still feel rather good about it. And the best indication is the level of our own inventory on our own books. But what we do see is customers are perhaps much more cautious about buying more stuff, not just because they don't have too much of my inventory. I think because they have too much of everybody else's inventory out there. We tend to see some caution in the way they choose to buy. Having said that, we're still keeping to our lead time.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHock, any comment on sort of the timing or the shape of the recovery in 2024?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nIf only I know. I mean, I've been speculating to say second half of 2024, things will start looking better compared to the first half of 2024.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nFair enough. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. That will come from the line of karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\n\nKarl Ackerman\n\nResearch Analyst, BNP Paribas Securities Corp.\n\nYes, thank you. Hock, I was hoping you may discuss the reason for divesting EUC and Carbon Black. And maybe more importantly, as you think about the growth rate off this $12 billion, Kirsten, could you discuss the opportunity you see in front of you as DRAM memory pooling, broadened from the adoption of CXL within data centers, that would seem to be a very big opportunity for VMware? Thank you.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nWhat's the first question again? Sorry. Okay. Why do I choose to sell end-user computing and Carbon Black? Those are good assets. Let's make no mistake. They are very sustaining. They are very stable, good assets. Why we chose to sell them is typically our playbook. We focus very much so on, in any acquisition, where we see the biggest value for our business model. Basically, we then do not want to be distracted by non-core focus. VMware for us is about core. It's about data centers. It's about core networks and core compute. So we're now going to invest and focus our sales, R&D on those core areas of VMware Cloud Foundation. To us, end-user computing, Carbon Black, good assets as they may be, we prefer not to divest them.\nAnd we'll find good homes for them because there are a lot of very interested parties who are more than happy to take those assets. And we'll be very, very thoughtful about where we put those assets eventually, simply because they're customers. Of these two assets, many of the customers are also the same customers to the VMware Cloud Foundation.\n\nKarl Ackerman\n\nResearch Analyst, BNP Paribas Securities Corp.\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nYes. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Hock, I guess I'll caveat my question in saying that I'm a semiconductor guy rather than a software expert. But I wanted to ask about the plan to convert the VMware customer base to subscription models and contrast that with what you guys did with CA and Symantec.\nSo do you feel like the process is going to be pretty similar in duration and success, or are there differences in maybe the customer base, the length of the long tail outside the sort of Fortune 1000, the type of technologies there? Are there any similarities or differences in the plan there that we should sort of think about and what that might mean for how quickly you can convert that business? Thanks.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nNo. These are very different assets. Not saying anyone necessarily is much better than the other, just different. In CA, particularly, where we're mainframe, but also some distributed, we focus very much, especially on a core customer base, which represents at that time, we bought it 70% of the overall revenue of those of CA. We focus on these customers.\nWe focus on supporting them and continuing to basically give them really good support, feature requests, growth in their area. That's how we then focus, and we focus on Symantec too, which is a small core group of customers. A big part of it is the technology of CA, especially our mainframe, is honestly running a lot of legacy applications that are still very, very much alive today, but customers preferring to run it on those mainframe tools simply because it makes no sense to modernize or change for their own good reasons. VMware, however, we're selling a product of the present and of the future. It is a growth product to be able to create a virtualized cloud environment in your own data center on-prem for any global company.\nThe good thing about going to public cloud is it's also totally virtualized, but very resilient when you run a software-defined environment. We're creating with VMware the same experience of virtualization of the data center on-prem for those companies, which has workloads, by the way, that are already running VMware products and that are applications that are already written on VMware Cloud Foundation. It is then giving these enterprises the opportunity to have a hyperscaler on-prem. That's the plan we're doing. It's plain and simple.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you for that. I really appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd thank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of William Stein with Truist. Your line is open.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. Hock, in the past, I think we've all been aware that there's one major customer on the accelerated compute side.\nI suspect that has broadened and deepened, perhaps, and I'm hoping you can give us some characterization of that, maybe the number of customers or projects, how diversified it is at this point. That would really help. Thank you.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nYes, it has. It has, which reflects somewhat my opening remarks that say that I used to tell you guys, \"Hey, merchant silicon will triumph.\" But I think with the evolution, a very rapid evolution I've been seeing on the AI large language model, generative AI large language models, and the fact that in hardware, one size doesn't fit all. There is variation depending on the models you run.\nI would say that for some of those hyperscalers, with the resources, with the scale requirements, to be able to create customized versions of hardware to match with customization of their foundation models and even their application models, we begin to see the effect of that. Other than that, I'd rather not disclose any more to you at this point because we're kind of under NDA all round.\nThank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nYeah, Hock. First of all, congratulations on closing the VMware deal. I know you've been trying to close that for a while. I wanted to ask, you've had a lot of time. Your management's had a lot of time to look at this deal through the process of closing.\nI was curious what you have seen so far that pleases you the most, and what do you think will be the most challenging aspect of the integration over the next 12 months that you highlighted?\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nWell, over the past 18 months almost, we had the journey of closing this deal from the date of announcement. You're right. We have had a great opportunity, and thanks to a very supportive management team from VMware that engages with us very, very well. Again, it's planning. We can see we can't touch, but it gives us a lot of time to plan and think through. It also gives me a lot of opportunity to go out there. And over the past 12, 16 months, I must have talked one-on-one or in small groups to at least 150 CIOs globally of the largest customers of VMware out there.\nOne thing is very clear. The VMware core product, the VMware Cloud Foundation software stack that enables virtualization of not just computing servers, compute, but storage, networking, as well as orchestration and management layer over that whole stack, is something that CIOs, head of infrastructure of many large companies out there really want. They want to be able to deploy. They want to make their data centers, which is very heterogeneous now between virtualization and compute to bare metal and a mixed environment with different vendors where each is trying to optimize best of breed to one that is managing under a single abstraction layer across a diversity of hardware. That saves a lot of hardware purchases that create a lot of cost reduction in a way to manage. That is the value of the technology VMware brings to bear. The products are there.\nFor us, it's focusing and execution, which is what you hear us say today, and which is what you hear Kirsten lay out in the numbers we are looking at just in the first year of completion of this acquisition.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nThanks, Hock.\n\nHock Tan\n\nPresident and CEO, Broadcom\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Yoo for any closing remarks.\n\nJieun Yoo\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Broadcom\n\nThank you, Operator. In closing, Broadcom currently plans to report its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 after close of market on Thursday, 7 March 2024. A public webcast of Broadcom's earnings conference call will follow at 2:00PM Pacific. That will conclude our earnings call today. Thank you all for joining. Operator, you may end the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for participating. This concludes today's program. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ji Yoo, Head of Investor Relations of Broadcom Inc.\n\nJi Yoo\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Hock Tan, President and CEO; Kirsten Spears, Chief Financial Officer; and Charlie Kawwas, President Semiconductor Solutions Group. Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables after the market closed, describing our financial performance for the third quarter fiscal year 2023.\nIf you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Broadcom's website at broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live and an audio replay of the call can be accessed for 1 year through the Investors section of Broadcom's website. During the prepared comments, Hock and Kirsten will be providing details of our third quarter fiscal year 2023 results, guidance for our fourth quarter as well as commentary regarding the business environment.\nWe'll take questions after the end of our prepared comments. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. I'll now turn the call over to Hock.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Broadcom, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ji. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. In our fiscal Q3, 2023 consolidated net revenue reached $8.9 billion, up 5% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue increased 5% year-on-year to $6.9 billion, and infrastructure software grew 5% year-on-year to $1.9 billion. Hyperscale continued to grow double digits year-on-year, but enterprise and telco spending moderated.\nMeanwhile, virtually defined gravity our wireless business has remained stable. Now generative AI investments are driving the continued strength in hyperscale spending for us. As you know, we supply a major hyperscale customer with custom AI compute engines. We are also supplying several hyperscale portfolio of networking technologies as they scale up and scale out their AI clusters within their data centers, now representing over $1 billion.\nThis represented virtually all the growth in our infrastructure business in Q3 this year-on-year. So without the benefit of generative AI revenue in Q3, our semiconductor business was approximately flat year-on-year. In fact, since the start of the year, the fiscal year, our quarterly semiconductor revenue, excluding AI, has stabilized at around $6 billion.\nAnd as we had indicated to you a year ago, we expected a soft landing during fiscal '23, and it appears this is exactly what is happening today. Now let me give you more color on our end markets. As we go through this soft lending, we see though that our broad portfolio of products, influencing the puts and takes across revenues within all our end markets, except one, and that is networking.\nAnd so in my remarks today, we focus on networking where generative AI has significant impact. Networking -- Q3 networking revenue was $2.8 billion and was up 20% year-on-year in line with guidance, representing 40% of our semiconductor revenue. As we indicated above, our switches and routers as well as our custom silicon AI engines drove growth in this end market as they were deployed in scaling out AI clusters among the hyperscale.\nWe've always believed, and more than ever now, with AI networks that Ethernet is the best networking protocol to scale out AI clusters. Ethernet today already offers the low latency attributes for machine learning and AI, and Broadcom has the best technology today and tomorrow. As a founding member of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium with other industry partners, we are driving Ethernet for scaling deployments in large language model networks.\nImportantly, we're doing this based on open standards and a broad ecosystem. Over the past quarter, we have already received substantial orders for our next-generation Tomahawk switch and Jericho3 AI routers and plan to begin shipping these products over the next 6 months to several hyperscale customers. This will replace the existing 400 gigabit networks with 800 gigabit connectivity.\nAnd beyond this, for the next-generation 1.6 terabit connectivity, we have already started development on the Tomahawk 6 switch, which has, among other things, 200G [indiscernible], generating throughput capacity of over 100 terabit per second. We are obviously excited that generative AI is pushing our engineers to develop cutting-edge technology in silicon technology that has never been developed before.\nWe know the n of Moor's Law has set limits on computing in silicon technology. But what we are developing today feels very much like a revival. We invest in fundamental technologies to enable our hyperscale customers with the best hardware capabilities to scale generative AI. We invest in industry-leading 200G [indiscernible] that can drive optics and even copper cables.\nWe have differentiating technology that breaks current bottlenecks in high-bandwidth memory access. We also have x high-speed and ultra-low power chip-to-chip connectivity to integrate multiple AI compute engines. We also have invested heavily in complex packaging technologies, migrating from today's 2.5D to 3D, which enables large memory to be integrated with the AI compute engines and accelerators.\nIn sum, we have developed end-to-end platform of plug-and-play silicon IP that enables hyperscalers to develop and deploy the AI clusters in an extremely accelerated time to market. Not surprisingly, in Q4 -- moving on to Q4, continuing to be driven by generative AI deployments.\nWe expect our networking revenue to accelerate in excess of 20% year-on-year. And this has been driven by the strength, obviously, in generative AI, where we forecast to grow about 50% sequentially and almost 2x year-on-year. Moving to wireless. Q3 wireless revenue, $1.6 billion represented 24% of semiconductor revenue up 4% sequentially, flat year-on-year.\nThe engagement with our North American customer continues to be deep and multiyear across WiFi, Bluetooth, touch, RF front end and inductive power. So in Q4, consistent with the seasonal launch, we expect wireless revenue to grow over 20% sequentially and down low single-digit percent year-on-year. On our server storage connectivity revenue, it was $1.1 billion or 17% of semiconductor revenue and flat year-on-year.\nWith a difficult year-on-year compared, we expect server storage connectivity revenue in Q4 to be down mid-teens percent year-on-year. And moving on to broadband following 9 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, revenue moderated to 1% year-on-year growth to $1.1 billion or 16% of semiconductor revenue.\nIn Q4, despite increasing penetration of deployment of 10G PON among telcos, we expect broadband revenue to decline high single digits year-on-year. Finally, Q3 industrial resales of $236 million declined 3% year-on-year, reflecting weak demand in China. And in Q4, though we expect an improvement with industrial resales up low single-digit percentage year-on-year, reflecting largely seasonality.\nSo in summary, Q3 semiconductor solutions revenue was up 5% year-on-year. And in Q4, we expect semiconductor revenue growth of low to mid-single-digit percentage year-on-year. Sequentially, if we exclude generative AI, our semiconductor revenue will be flat. Now turning to software. In Q3 infrastructure software revenue of $1.9 billion grew 5% year-on-year and represented 22% of total revenue.\nFor core software, consolidated renewal rates averaged 117% over expiring contracts. And in our strategic accounts, we averaged 127%. Within strategic accounts, annualized bookings of $408 million, included $129 million or 32% of cross-selling of other portfolio products to the same core customers.\nAnd over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance. Over the last 12 months, I should add, consolidated renewal rates averaged 115% of expiring contracts. And in our strategic accounts, we averaged 125%. Because of this, our ARR, the indicator of our revenue at the end of Q3 was $5.3 billion.\nIn Q4, we expect infrastructure software segment revenue to be up mid-single digit year-on-year. And on a consolidated basis for the company, we're guiding Q4 revenue of $9.27 billion, up 4% year-on-year. Before Kirsten tells you more about our financial performance for the quarter, let me provide a brief update on our pending acquisition of VMware.\nWe have received legal merger clearance in Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Israel, South Africa, Taiwan and the United Kingdom and foreign investment control clearance in all necessary jurisdictions. In the U.S., the Hart-Scott Rodino premerger waiting periods have expired. And there is no legal impediment to closing under U.S. merger regulations.\nWe continue to work constructively with regulators in a few other jurisdictions and are in the advanced stages of the process towards obtaining the remaining required regulatory approvals, which we believe will be received before October 30. We continue to expect to close on October 30, 2023.\nNow, Broadcom is confident that the combination with VMware will enhance competition in the cloud and benefit enterprise customers by giving them more choice and control where they locate their workloads. With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.\n\nKirsten M. Spears\n\nCAO, VP & Corporate Controller, Broadcom Inc.\n\nThank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Consolidated revenue was $8.9 billion for the quarter, up 5% from a year ago. Gross margins were 75.1% of revenue in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion, down 8% year-on-year. R&D of $913 million was also down 8% year-on-year on lower variable spending.\nOperating income for the quarter was $5.5 billion and was up 6% from a year ago. Operating margin was 62% of revenue, up approximately 100 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.8 billion or 65% of revenue. This figure excludes $122 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our 2 segments.\nRevenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $6.9 billion and represented 78% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 5% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 70%, down 160 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by product mix within our semiconductor end markets.\nOperating expenses were $792 million in Q3, down 7% year-on-year. R&D was $707 million in the quarter, down 8% year-on-year. Q3 semiconductor operating margins were 59%. Moving to the P&L for our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for the infrastructure software segment was $1.9 billion, up year-on-year and represented 22% of revenue.\nGross margins for infrastructure software were 92% in the quarter, and operating expenses were $337 million in the quarter, down 10% year-over-year. Infrastructure software operating margin was 75% in Q3 and operating profit grew 13% year-on-year. Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.6 billion and represented 52% of revenues in Q3.\nWe spent $122 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 30 days in the third quarter compared to 32 days in the second quarter. We ended the third quarter with inventory of $1.8 billion, down 2% sequentially. We continue to remain very disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We exited the quarter with 80 days of inventory on hand, down 86 days in Q2 -- down from excuse me, 86 days in Q2.\nWe ended the third quarter with $12.1 billion of cash and $39.3 billion of gross debt, of which $1.1 billion is short term. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our fixed rate debt is 3.61% and 9.7 years, respectively.\nTurning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.9 million of cash dividends. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased 1.7 billion of our common stock and eliminated 460 million of our common stock for taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the repurchase and elimination of approximately 2.9 million AVGO shares.\nThe non-GAAP diluted share count in Q3 was $436 million. As of the end of Q3, $7.3 billion was remaining under the share repurchase authorization. We suspended our repurchase program in early August in accordance with SEC rules, which do not allow stock buybacks during the period in which VMware shareholders are electing between cash and stock consideration in our pending transaction to acquire VMware.\nWe expect the election period to end shortly before the anticipated closing of the transaction on October 30, 2023. Excluding the impact of any share repurchases executed prior to the suspension, in Q4, we expect a non-GAAP diluted share count to be $435 million.\nBased on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 is for consolidated revenues of $9.27 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 65% of projected revenue. In Q4, we expect gross margins to be down 80 basis points sequentially on product mix. We note that our guidance for Q4 does not include any contribution from VMware. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ji Yoo, Head of Investor Relations of Broadcom Inc.\n\nJi Yoo\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. And good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Hock Tan, President and CEO; Kirsten Spears, Chief Financial Officer; and Charlie Collis, President, Semiconductor Solutions Group.\nBroadcom distributed a press release and financial tables after the market closed, describing our financial performance for the second quarter fiscal year 2023. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Broadcom's website at broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and an audio replay of the call can be accessed for 1 year through the Investors section of Broadcom's website.\nDuring the prepared comments, Hock and Kirsten will be providing details of our second quarter fiscal year 2023 results, guidance for our third quarter as well as commentary regarding the business environment.

A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results.\nI'll now turn the call over to Hock.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Broadcom, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ji. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. So in our fiscal Q2 2023, consolidated net revenue was $8.7 billion, up 8% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue increased 9% year-on-year to $6.8 billion, and infrastructure software grew 3% year-on-year to $1.9 billion as the stable growth in core software more than offset softness in the Brocade business.\nNow as I start this call, I know you all want to hear about how we are benefiting from this strong deployment of generative AI by our customers. Put this in perspective, our revenue today from this opportunity represents about 15% of our semiconductor business. Having said this, it was only 10% in fiscal '22, and we believe it could be over 25% of our semiconductor revenue in fiscal '24. In fact, over the course of fiscal '23 that we're in, we are seeing a trajectory where our quarterly revenue entering the year doubles by the time we exit '23. And in fiscal third quarter '23, we expect that this revenue to exceed $1 billion in the quarter.\nBut as you well know, we're also broadly diversified semiconductor and infrastructure software company. And in our fiscal Q2, demand for IT infrastructure was driven by hyperscale, while service providers and enterprise continue to hold up. Following the 30% year-on-year increases we have experienced over the past 5 quarters, overall IT infrastructure demand in moderated to mid-teens percentage growth year-on-year. As we have always told you, we continue to ship only to end-user demand. We remain very disciplined on how we manage inventory across our ecosystem. We exited the quarter with less than 86 days on hand, a level of inventory consistent with what we have maintained over the past 8 quarters.\nNow let me give you more color on our end markets. Let me begin with wireless. As you saw in our recent 8-K filing, we entered into a multiyear collaboration with a North American wireless OEM on cutting-edge wireless connectivity and 5G components. Our engagement in technology and supply remains deep, strategic and long term. Q2 wireless revenue of $1.6 billion represented 23% of semiconductor revenue. Wireless revenue declined seasonally down 24% quarter-on-quarter and down 9% year-on-year. In Q3, as we just begin the seasonal ramp of the next-generation phone platform, we expect wireless revenue to be up low single digits sequentially. We expect, however, it will remain around flattish year-on-year.\nMoving on to networking. Networking revenue was $2.6 billion and was up 20% year-on-year, in line with guidance, representing 39% of our semiconductor revenue. There are 2 growth drivers here. One, continued strength in deployment of our merchant Tomahawk switching for traditional enterprise workloads as well as Jericho routing platforms for telcos; and two, strong growth in AI infrastructure at hyperscalers from compute offload and networking.\nAnd speaking of AI networks, Broadcom's next-generation Ethernet switching portfolio consisting of Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3 AI offers the industry's highest performance fabric for large-scale AI clusters by optimizing the demanding and costly AI resources. These switches based on an open distributed disaggregated architecture will support 32,000 GPU clusters running at 800 gigabit per second bandwidth.\nEthernet fabric, as we know it, already supports multi-tenancy capability and end-to-end congestion management. This lossless connectivity with high QOS performance has been well proven over the last 10 years of network deployment in the public cloud and telcos. In other words, the technology is not new. And we are, as Broadcom, very well positioned to simply extend our best-in-class networking technology into generative AI infrastructure, while supporting standard connectivity, which enables vendor interoperability. In Q3, we expect networking revenue to maintain its growth year-on-year of around 20%.\nNext, our service rich connectivity revenue was $1.1 billion or 17% of semiconductor revenue and up 20% year-on-year. And as we noted last quarter, with the transition to next-generation mega rate, largely completed and enterprise demand moderating. We expect service storage connectivity revenue in Q3 to be up low single digits year-on-year.\nMoving on to broadband. Revenue grew 10% year-on-year to $1.2 billion and represented 18% of semiconductor revenue. Growth in broadband was driven by continued deployments by telcos of next-generation 10G PON and cable operators of DOCSIS 3.1 with higher attach rates of WiFi 6 and 6G. And in Q3, we expect our broadband growth to moderate to low single-digit percent year-on-year.\nAnd finally, Q2 industrial resales of $260 million increased 2% year-on-year as the softness in China was offset by strength globally in renewable energy and robotics. And in Q3, we forecast industrial resales to be flattish year-on-year on continuing softness in Asia, offset by strength in Europe.\nSo summary, Q2 Semiconductor Solutions revenue was up 9% year-on-year. And in Q3, we expect semiconductor revenue growth of mid-single-digit year-on-year growth.\nTurning to software. In Q2, infrastructure software revenue of $1.9 billion grew 3% year-on-year and represented 22% of total revenue. As expected, continued softness in Brocade was offset by the continuing stable growth in core software. Relating to cost software, consolidated renewal rates average 11% over expiring contracts. And in our strategic accounts, we averaged 120%. With the strategic accounts, annual lines bookings of $564 million included $133 million or 23% of cross-selling of other portfolio products to these same core customers. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance. And over the last 12 months, consolidated renewal rates averaged 117% over expiring contracts. And among our strategic accounts, we averaged 128%. Because of this, our ARR indicator of forward revenue at the end of Q2 was $5.3 billion, up 2% from a year ago. And in Q3, we expect our infrastructure software segment revenue to be up low single digits percentage year-on-year as the core software growth continues to be offset by weakness in Brocade. On a consolidated basis, we're guiding Q3 revenue of $8.85 billion, up 5% year-on-year.\nBefore Kirsten tell you more about our financial performance for the quarter, let me provide a brief update on our pending acquisition of VMware. We're making good progress with our various regulatory filings around the world, having received legal merger clearance in Australia, Brazil, Canada, South Africa and Taiwan and foreign investment control clearance in all necessary jurisdictions. We still expect the transaction will close in Broadcom's fiscal 2023. The combination of Broadcom and VMware is about enabling enterprises to accelerate innovation and expand choice by addressing their most complex technology challenges in this multi-cloud era, and we are confident that regulators will see this when they conclude their review.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.\n\nKirsten M. Spears\n\nCAO, VP & Corporate Controller, Broadcom Inc.\n\nThank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Consolidated revenue was $3.7 billion for the quarter, up 8% from a year ago. Gross margins were 75.6% of revenue in the quarter, about 30 basis points higher than we expected on product mix. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, down 4% year-on-year. R&D of $958 million was also down 4% year-on-year on lower variable spending. Operating income for the quarter was $5.4 billion and was up 10% from a year ago. Operating margin was 62% of revenue, up approximately 100 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.7 billion or 65% of revenue. This figure excludes $129 million of depreciation.\nNow a review of the P&L for our 2 segments. Revenue for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was $6.8 billion and represented 78% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 9% year-on-year. Gross margins for our Semiconductor Solutions segment were approximately 71%, down approximately 120 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by product mix within our semiconductor end markets. Operating expenses were $833 million in Q2, down 5% year-on-year. R&D was $739 million in the quarter, down 4% year-on-year. Q2 semiconductor operating margins were 59%. So while semiconductor revenue was up 9%, operating profit grew 10% year-on-year.\nMoving to the P&L for our Infrastructure Software segment. Revenue for Infrastructure Software was $1.9 billion, up 3% year-on-year and represented 22% of revenue. Gross margins for Infrastructure Software were 92% in the quarter. And operating expenses were $361 million in the quarter, down 3% year-over-year. Infrastructure Software operating margin was 73% in Q2, and operating profit grew 8% year-on-year.\nMoving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.4 billion and represented 50% of revenues in Q2. We spent $122 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 32 days in the second quarter compared to 33 days in the first quarter. We ended the second quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, down 1% from the end of the prior quarter. We ended the second quarter with $11.6 billion of cash and $39.3 billion of gross debt, of which $1.1 billion is short term. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our fixed rate debt is 3.61% and 9.9 years, respectively.\nTurning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.9 billion of cash dividends. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased $2.8 billion of our common stock and eliminated $614 million of common stock for taxes due on the vesting of employee equity, resulting in the repurchase and elimination of approximately 5.6 million AVGO shares. The non-GAAP diluted share count in Q2 was $435 million. As of the end of Q2, $9 billion was remaining under the share repurchase authorization.\nExcluding the potential impact of any share repurchases, in Q3, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be $438 million. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 is for consolidated revenues of $8.85 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 65% of projected revenue. In Q3, we expect gross margins to be down approximately 60 basis points sequentially on product mix.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ji Yoo, Head of Investor Relations of Broadcom Inc.\n\nJi Yoo\n\nDirector of IR, Broadcom Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Hock Tan, President and CEO; Kirsten Spears, Chief Financial Officer; and Charlie Kawwas, President, Semiconductor Solutions Group.\nBroadcom distributed a press release and financial tables after the market closed describing our financial performance for the first quarter fiscal year 2023. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Broadcom's website at broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live and an audio replay of the call can be accessed for 1 year through the Investors section of Broadcom's website.\nDuring the prepared comments, Hock and Kirsten will be providing details of our first quarter fiscal year 2023 results, guidance for our second quarter as well as commentary regarding the business environment. We'll take questions after the end of our prepared comments.\nPlease refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results.\nI'll now turn the call over to Hock.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nPresident, CEO, & Executive Director, Broadcom Inc.\n\nThank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. In our fiscal Q1 '23 consolidated net revenue, that was -- revenue was $8.9 billion, up 16% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue increased 21% year-on-year to $7.1 billion. While, as we expected, infrastructure software declined 1% year-on-year to $1.8 billion even as our core software sustained growth of 5% year-on-year.\nStepping back, let me sum up what happened in Q1. From our view, infrastructure spending continues to be up particularly in service providers, even as hyperscale and enterprise sustain. Spending in technology for infrastructure has been strong, showing double-digit growth for 9 consecutive quarters.\nWe continue to be booked for fiscal '23 and our lead times and visibility on semiconductors remain largely at 50 weeks. While there have been a small number of requests to push out certain orders, we know that these are the exceptions, and they have not had a material impact on our business. Because we ship linearly throughout the quarter to our customers, inventory on our books has been consistent around 80 days, and overall inventory of Broadcom products across the ecosystem remains very well managed.\nWe continue, needless to say, to be very disciplined in shipping our backlog only as and when needed by our end customers. With that, let me now provide more color on each of our end markets.\nStarting with networking. Networking revenue was $2.3 billion and was up 20% year-on-year, in line with guidance, representing 32% of our semiconductor revenue. We see continued deployment of our advanced Tomahawk switches by hyperscalers in their leaf and spine architectures.\nEven as we deliver on increased bandwidth for the hyperscalers, having said that, power remains a major challenge. So just this week, we announced the industry's first integrated silicon photonics networking solution, codename Bailly, which integrates the active optical interconnects with our next-generation Tomahawk 5 switch at 51.2 terabit per second. Bailly doubles switching performance, but it will reduce total system power.\nKeep in mind that at hyperscalers, a growing portion of our switches have been deployed within the AI networks, which are separate from the traditional x86 CPU scale out running existing workloads.\nNow this is today. Tomorrow, we generated AI using large scale -- large language, I should say, models with billions of parameters. We have to run thousands of AI engines in parallel, enabling large and synchronized bursts of data at speeds of 400 and 800 gig. The networks to support this massive processor density is critical and is important SDAI engines. Such networks have to be lossless, low latency and be able to scale.\nSo as you know, such AI networks are already been deployed at certain hyperscalers through our Jericho2 switches and Ramon fabric. In fact, in 2022, we estimated our Ethernet switch shipments deployed in AI was over $200 million.\nWith the expected exponential demand from our hyperscale customers, we forecast that these could grow to well over $800 million in 2023. We anticipate this trend will continue to accelerate and mindful that we need even more higher performance networks in the future. We have been investing in a new generation of this lossless low-latency ethernet fabric designed specifically to handle such data and compute-intensive AI workloads.\nOf course, additionally, the exciting growth prospects for generative AI are driving our compute offload accelerated business at hyperscalers. As we have indicated to you last quarter, this business achieved over $2 billion in revenue in 2022. We are on track to exceed $3 billion in revenue in our fiscal '23. In Q2, looking forward, short term, we expect these tailwinds to drive our networking revenue to grow about another 20% year-over-year.\nMoving on next to our server storage connectivity revenue. There was a record $1.3 billion or 18% of semiconductor revenue and up 57% year-on-year. Once again, as we discussed in preceding quarters, the rapid transition to next-generation MegaRAID solutions drove this substantial year-on-year content increase. After 4 consecutive quarters of such increases, this transition, however, is significantly complete, and we expect that in Q2 on a year-on-year basis server storage connectivity revenue will moderate towards 20% year-on-year growth.\nMoving on to broadband. Revenue grew 34% year-on-year to a record $1.2 billion and represented 17% of semiconductor revenue. During this quarter, our broadband business particularly benefited from robust deployments of -- by telcos of 10G PON and cable operators of DOCSIS 3.1. These gateways have high attach rates of WiFi 6 and 6E. And in Q2, we expect the secular drivers behind broadband to sustain momentum on a sequential basis. And year-on-year, broadband will grow a solid 10%.\nMoving on to wireless. Q1 revenue of $2.1 billion represented 29% of semiconductor revenue. Demand from our North American customer drove wireless revenue up 4% year-on-year, reflecting content increases, which we had previously indicated last quarter. Sequentially, wireless was flattish compared to Q4. And seasonally, we expect wireless to be down sequentially in Q2 and down high single-digit percentage year-over-year.\nFinally, Q1 industrial resale of $229 million decreased 4% year-over-year as softness in China offset strength in renewable energy and medical. And in Q2, we forecast industrial resales to be down low single-digit percentage year-on-year on continuing softness in China.\nSo in summary, Q1 semiconductor solutions revenue was up 21% year-on-year. And in Q2, we expect semiconductor revenue growth of high single-digit percentage year-on-year.\nTurning to software. In Q1, infrastructure software revenue of $1.8 billion declined 1% year-on-year and represented 20% of total revenue. While core software revenue grew 5% year-on-year, the Brocade business declined because of lumpiness in enterprise consumption in this very narrow vertical of SAN storage. For core software, consolidated renewal rates averaged 119% of expiring contracts. And within our strategic accounts, we averaged 129%, and within the strategic accounts, annualized bookings of $536 million included $197 million, which represent 37% of cross-selling of our portfolio of products to these same core strategic customers. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance.\nNow by way of comparison, over the last 12 months, consolidated renewal rates averaged 119% over expiring contracts, and in our strategic accounts, we averaged 134%. Because of these, our ARR, the indicator of forward revenue at the end of Q1 was $5.3 billion, which is up 3% from a year ago. In Q2, we expect our infrastructure software segment revenue to be up low to mid-single-digit percentage year-on-year as the stable core software growth continues to be partially offset now by weakness in Brocade.\nSo in summary, we are guiding consolidated Q2 revenue for the company to be $8.7 billion, up 8% year-on-year. Before Kirsten, tells you more about our financial performance for the quarter, let me provide a brief update on our pending acquisitions of VMware.\nWe continue to make progress with our various regulatory filings around the world, having now received legal merger clearance in Brazil, South Africa and Canada and foreign investment control clearance in Germany, France, Austria, Denmark, Italy and New Zealand. As we stated on our last earnings call, we continue to anticipate that the time line for the review process will be extended in other key regions, especially given the size of this transaction.\nHaving said that, we continue to expect the transaction to close within our fiscal 2023. We believe the combination of Broadcom and VMware is about enabling enterprises to accelerate innovation and expand choice by addressing their most complex technology challenges in this multi-cloud era. And we are confident regulators will see this when they conclude their review.\nFinally, Broadcom recently published its third annual ESG report available on our corporate citizenship website, which discusses the company's ESG initiatives. As a global technology leader, we recognize Broadcom's responsibility to have a positive impact on our customers, employees and communities. Through our product and technology innovation and operational excellence, we remain committed to this mission.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.\n\nKirsten M. Spears\n\nCFO & CAO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nThank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Broadcom had another great quarter with robust financials. Consolidated revenue was $8.9 billion for the quarter, up 16% from a year ago. Gross margins were 74% of revenue in the quarter, about 10 basis points higher than we expected. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion, down 1% year-on-year. R&D of $929 million was also down 1% year-on-year, primarily from streamlined project and other variable spending, offset in part by higher people costs resulting from increased headcount as we are hiring.\nOperating income for the quarter was $5.4 billion and was up 17% from a year ago. Operating margin was 61% of revenue, up approximately 50 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.7 billion or 64% of revenue. This figure excludes $127 million of depreciation.\nNow a review of the P&L for our 2 reportable segments. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $7.1 billion and represented 80% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 21% year-on-year. As Hock discussed, this came from strength across all of our semiconductor end markets.\nGross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 69%, down approximately 160 basis points year-on-year driven primarily by product mix within our semiconductor end markets. Operating expenses were $802 million in Q1, down 2% year-on-year. R&D was $716 million in the quarter, down 1% year-on-year. Q1 semiconductor operating margins were 58%. So while semiconductor revenue was up 21%, operating profit grew 23% year-on-year.\nMoving to the P&L for our infrastructure software reportable segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.8 billion, down 1% year-on-year and represented 20% of revenue. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 91% in the quarter, and operating expenses were $346 million in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year. Infrastructure software operating margin was 72% in Q1, and operating profit was stable year-on-year.\nMoving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $3.9 billion, representing a 16% increase year-over-year. Free cash flow represented 44% of revenues in Q1 '23 consistent with what we achieved the same quarter last year. We spent $103 million on capital expenditures.\nDays sales outstanding were 33 days in the first quarter compared to 30 days in the fourth quarter. We ended the first quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, down 1% from the end of the prior quarter or 78 days on hand. Overall, inventory of Broadcom's products across the ecosystem, as Hock indicated, remains well managed.\nWe ended the first quarter with $12.6 billion of cash and $39.3 billion of gross debt, of which $1.1 billion is short term. During the quarter, we repaid $260 million in senior notes that were due on maturity. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our fixed rate debt is 3.61% and 10.2 years, respectively.\nTurning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.9 billion of cash dividends. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased $1.2 billion of our common stock and eliminated $333 million of common stock for taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the repurchase and elimination of approximately 2.7 million AVGO shares. The non-GAAP diluted share count in Q1 was 434 million. As of the end of Q1, $11.8 billion was remaining under the share repurchase authorization. Excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases, in Q2, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be 438 million.\nBased on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 is for consolidated revenues of $8.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 64.5% of projected revenue. In forecasting such profitability, we expect gross margins to be up approximately 150 basis points sequentially on product mix and R&D spending to be up sequentially on continuing hiring of engineers and seasonal payroll tax step-ups.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",

Tan\n\nCEO, President & Executive Director, Broadcom Inc.\n\nWell, thank you, Ji. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Before I provide color on our Q4 results, let me put in perspective what we achieved in fiscal year '22. For the year, I'm pleased to report that consolidated revenue hit a record of $33.2 billion, growing 21% year-on-year, yet another year of double-digit organic growth. This growth was driven by our strong partnerships with customers and increased R&D investments, which enable accelerated adoption of our next-generation technologies. With our robust business model, we grew our fiscal 2022 operating profit by 28% year-on-year and our free cash flow per share by 25% year-upon-year.\nNow to discuss details of our fiscal Q4. In our fiscal Q4 '22, consolidated net revenue was a record $8.9 billion, up 21% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue increased 26% year-on-year to $7.1 billion, and infrastructure software revenue grew 4% year-on-year to $1.8 billion.\nIn Q4, our semiconductor business continued to perform well across hyperscale, service providers and enterprise. On top of this, wireless grew sequentially as we ramp up the new platform and our North American customer.\nIn reporting these results, I'd like to emphasize, we demonstrate our continued discipline in shipping our strong backlog only as and when needed by our end customers. So in contrast to weak consumer electronics spending today and despite concerns of a global recession, we believe overall infrastructure spending remains strong, and we continue to experience sustained demand in most of our end markets, and this is what we continue to see in Q1. So let me expand on this.\nStarting with networking. Networking revenue was a record $2.5 billion and was up 30% year-on-year, representing 35% of our semiconductor revenue. We see strong growth from deployment of [cama 4] for data center switching at hyperscale customers. And we see upgrades of edge and core routing networks with our next-generation Jericho portfolio at cloud and service providers. And at multiple cloud customers, we continue to lead in delivering custom solutions for compute offload accelerators and actually surpassed the $2 billion month in revenues in fiscal '22. Looking into Q1, we do expect networking revenue to be strong and grow about 20% year-over-year.\nNext, our storage connectivity revenue was a record $1.2 billion or 17% of semiconductor revenue and up 50% year-on-year. As we have mentioned in previous earnings call, we are benefiting here from substantial content increases as both cloud and enterprise customers adopt our next-generation migrate and storage adapters. This trend will continue in Q1, and we expect server storage connectivity revenue to grow above 50% year-on-year.\nMoving on to broadband. Revenue of $1 billion grew 20% year-on-year and represented 15% of semiconductor revenue. Our broadband business is benefiting from ongoing multiyear deployments by North American and European service providers of 10-gigabit PON and DOCSIS 3.1 We've embedded WiFi 6 and 6E. In Q1, we expect the secular drivers behind broadband to continue and our business to be strong at about 30% year-on-year growth.\nMoving on to wireless. Q4 revenue of $2.1 billion represented 29% of semiconductor revenue with the 13% year-on-year increase coming largely from higher content. And in Q1, we expect wireless revenue to be sequentially flat and up low single digits year-on-year.\nFinally, Q4 industrial resale of $234 million grew 1% year-over-year as softness in China mostly offset the strength in North American and European automotive. In Q1, we forecast industrial resales to continue the trend of low single-digit percent growth year-on-year.\nAnd so in summary, Q4 Semiconductor solutions revenue was up 26% year-on-year. And in Q1, we expect semiconductor revenue growth to sustain at approximately 20% year-on-year.\nMoving on to software. In Q4, infrastructure software revenue of $1.8 billion grew 4% year-on-year and represented 21% of total revenue. Core software revenue grew 5% year-on-year. In spite of adverse ForEx impact in dollar terms, consolidated renewal rates averaged 117% over expiring contracts. And in our strategic accounts, we averaged 128%.\nWithin our strategic accounts, annualized bookings of $357 million included $101 million of cross-selling of our portfolio of products to these customers. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscriptions and maintenance.\nOver the last 12 months, consolidated renewal rates averaged 120% over expiring contracts. And in our strategic accounts, we averaged 135%. Because of this, our ARR, which is annual recurring revenue, the indicator of forward revenue, at the end of Q4 was $5.4 billion which was up 4% from a year ago. And in Q1, we expect our infrastructure software segment revenue to be flat year-on-year, reflecting core software revenue growth of mid-single-digit percent year-over-year, offset by a year-on-year decline in the Brocade enterprise and business.\nIn summary, we're guiding consolidated Q1 revenue of $8.9 billion, up 16% year-on-year. While we are fully booked for fiscal 2023, in this environment, we are not providing you guidance for the year.\nBefore Kirsten tells you more about our financial performance for the quarter, let me provide a brief update on our pending acquisition of VMware. We are making progress with our various regulatory filings around the world, as we very much expect having received merger clearance in Brazil, Canada and South Africa. We anticipate that time line for the review process would be more extended in other key regions, especially given the size of this transaction. Having said that, we're still confident that this transaction will close and be completed in our fiscal 2023.\nThe combination of Broadcom and VMware is about enabling enterprises to accelerate innovation and expand choice by addressing their most complex technology challenges in this multi-cloud era, and we are confident that regulators will see this when they conclude their review.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.\n\nKirsten M. Spears\n\nCFO & CAO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nThank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Revenue was $8.9 billion for the quarter, up 21% from a year ago. Gross margins were 75% of revenue in the quarter and up 10 basis points year-on-year. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, up 3% year-on-year driven by investment in R&D. Operating income for the quarter was $5.5 billion and was up 25% from a year ago. Operating margin was 62% of revenue, up approximately 240 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.7 billion or 64% of revenue. This figure excludes $129 million of depreciation.\nNow a review of the P&L for our 2 reportable segments. Revenue for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was $7.1 billion and represented 79% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 26% year-on-year. Gross margins for our Semiconductor Solutions segment were approximately 71%, up 70 basis points year-on-year driven by product mix and adoption of next-generation products across our extensive product portfolio. Operating expenses were $825 million in Q4, up 4% year-on-year. R&D was $731 million in the quarter, up 4% year-on-year. Q4 semiconductor operating margins were 59%. So while semiconductor revenue was up 26%, operating profit grew 33% year-on-year.\nMoving to the P&L for Infrastructure Software segment. Revenue for Infrastructure Software was $1.8 billion, up 4% year-on-year and represented 21% of revenue. Gross margins for Infrastructure Software were 91% in the quarter; and operating expenses were $348 million in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year. Infrastructure Software operating margin was 72% in Q4, and operating profit grew 6%.\nMoving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.5 billion, representing 50% of revenue. We spent $122 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 30 days in the fourth quarter compared to 29 days in the third quarter. We ended the fourth quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, up 5% from the end of the prior quarter because we expect the mix of revenue in Q1 to have a higher cost of materials. We ended the fourth quarter with $12.4 billion of cash and $39.5 billion of gross debt, of which $440 million is short term.\nBased on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 is for consolidated revenues of $8.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 63% of projected revenue.\nIn forecasting such operating profitability, we would like to point out that because of product mix changes, our non-GAAP gross margin could be down roughly 100 basis points from Q4 and R&D spending could be up sequentially as we step up hiring of engineers for multiple critical projects.\nLet me recap our financial performance for fiscal year 2022. Our revenue hit a record $33.2 billion, growing 21% year-on-year. Semiconductor Solutions revenue was $25.8 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Infrastructure Software revenue was $7.4 billion, up 4% year-on-year. Gross margin for the year was 76%, up 110 basis points from a year ago. Our operating expenses were $4.8 billion, up 6% year-on-year. Fiscal '22 operating income was $20.3 billion, up 28% year-over-year and represented 61% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $21 billion, up 27% year-over-year and represented 63% of net revenue. This figure excludes $529 million of depreciation. We spent $424 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow grew 22% year-on-year to $16.3 billion or 49% of fiscal '22 revenue.\nTurning to capital allocation. For fiscal '22, we spent $15.5 billion, consisting of $7 billion in the form of cash dividends and $8.5 billion in repurchases and eliminations. We ended the year with $13 billion of authorized share repurchase programs remaining and expect to resume our repurchase of common stock as soon as we can under SEC rules.\nExcluding the potential impact of any share repurchases, in Q1, we expect a non-GAAP diluted share count to be $435 million. Aligned with our ability to generate increased cash flows in the preceding year, we are announcing an increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend in Q1 fiscal 2023 to $4.60 per share, an increase of 12% from the prior quarter. We intend to maintain this target quarterly dividend throughout fiscal '23, subject to quarterly Board approval. This implies our fiscal 2023 annual common stock dividend to be a record $18.40 per share. I would like to highlight that this represents the 12th consecutive increase in annual dividends since we initiated dividends in fiscal 2011.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Ji Yoo, Head of Investor Relations of Broadcom Inc.\n\nJi Yoo\n\nDirector of IR, Broadcom Inc.\n\nThank you, Sheri, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Hock Tan, President and CEO; Kirsten Spears, Chief Financial Officer; and Charlie Kawwas, President, Semiconductor Solutions Group. Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables after the market close, describing our financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal year of 2022. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Broadcom's website at broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and an audio replay of the call can be accessed for 1 year through the Investors section of Broadcom's website.\nDuring the prepared comments, Hock and Kirsten will be providing details of our third quarter fiscal year 2022 results, guidance for our fourth quarter as well commentary regarding the business environment. We'll take questions after the end of our prepared comments.\nPlease refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on those specific factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results.\nI'll now turn the call over to Hock.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, President & Executive Director, Broadcom Inc.\n\nThank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining today. We feel somewhat surreal here with what I'm about to report and go through in my screen. Let me start by saying while consumer IT hardware spending has been reported to be weak, very weak, from our vantage point infrastructure spend is still very much holding. In our fiscal Q3 '22, consolidated net revenue was a record $8.5 billion, up 25% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue increased 32% year-on-year to $6.6 billion. And infrastructure software revenue grew 5% year-on-year to be $1.8 billion.\nIn Q3, our semiconductor business was robust, with solid contributions from all our end markets. Cloud and service provider growth remained strong and, in Q4, is actually expected to accelerate year-on-year driven by data center build-outs and infrastructure upgrades. Year-on-year, enterprise continued to grow for the sixth consecutive quarter on campus deployments and data center refreshes.\nLooking at Q4, we expect enterprise to continue to grow double-digit percent year-over-year.\nMeanwhile, in wireless, which is very much tied to our large North American handphone OEM, it was solid in Q3 and is expected to grow in Q4 as we ramp the new platform.\nNow let me provide more color by end market. Starting with networking. Networking revenue was a record $2.3 billion and was up 30% year-on-year, representing 35% of our semiconductor revenue. As both cloud and enterprise data centers refresh, they continue to increase adoption of our Tomahawk, Trident and Jericho switching silicon platforms. Importantly, we expect this trend to continue.\nIn mid-August, Broadcom announced the Tomahawk 5 switch series, providing 51.2 terabit per second of Ethernet switching capacity in the single monolithic device, double the bandwidth of any other switch silicon available in the market today. We also announced the industry first silicon photonics co-package with the Tomahawk, which will enable a new benchmark for low power and extend our leadership and innovation in hyperscale data centers. Networking remains strong given these drivers. And in Q4, we expect this segment to be up 30% year-over-year.\nNext, server storage connectivity revenue was a record $1.1 billion or 17% of semiconductor sales as growth of 70% year-on-year exceeded our expectations. A primary driver remains the growth of our next-generation server storage connectivity where we benefited from high content and continued deployment of servers and storage in both cloud and enterprises. We anticipate this strong trend to actually continue. And in Q4, we expect server storage connectivity revenue to grow about 45% year-on-year.\nMoving on to broadband. Revenue of $1.1 billion grew 20% year-on-year, in line with our expectations and represented 17% of semiconductor sales. This steady growth was driven by major service provider continuing to deploy next-generation broadband fiber-to-the-home globally with high attach rates of WiFi 6 and WiFi 6E.\nWe are the industry leader in investing in the next-generation WiFi 7 and unlocking amazing wireless experiences across home gateways, enterprise access points and smartphones. And we expect first deployments to occur in the second half 2023. In Q4, we expect our broadband business to grow above 20% year-on-year.\nFinally -- next, moving to wireless. Q3 revenue of $1.6 billion represented 25% of our revenue in semiconductors. Sustained demand from our North American customer drove wireless revenue up 14% year-on-year, in line with our guidance. In Q4, we expect wireless revenues to be seasonally up 20% sequentially and grow 10% year-on-year.\nFinally, Q3 industrial resales of $244 million declined 4% year-over-year, reflecting weakness in China, partially offset by continued strength in the U.S. and Europe. Nonetheless, for Q4, we forecast industrial resales to rebound to high single-digit growth year-on-year.\nIn summary, Q3 semiconductor solution revenues was up 32% year-on-year. In Q4, we expect semiconductor revenue to remain strong at 25% year-on-year. Now putting this in perspective and if we look at it on a sequential basis, Q3 grew 6% as did Q2, and Q4 will grow another 6% largely driven by the seasonality of wireless.\nTurning to software. In Q3, infrastructure software revenue of $1.8 billion grew 5% year-on-year and represented 22% of total revenue. In dollar terms, consolidated renewal rates averaged 128% over expiring contracts. And for strategic accounts, we averaged 140%. Within these strategic accounts, annual bookings of $461 million include $136 million of cross-selling of our portfolio products to these call customers. Now 95% of our renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance.\nAnd just to put all this in context, over the past 12 months, consolidated renewal rates averaged 122% over expiring contracts. And within strategic accounts, we average -- we actually average 137%. Because of these trends, our ARR and the indicator of forward software revenue at the end of Q3 was $5.5 billion, which was up 5% from a year ago. And in Q4, we expect our infrastructure software revenue to sustain around mid-single-digit percentage growth year-over-year.\nIn summary, therefore, we're guiding consolidated Q4 revenue of $8.9 billion, up 20% year-on-year or 5% sequentially.\nNow, before Kirsten tells you more about our financial performance for the quarter, let me provide a brief update on our pending acquisition of VMware. We're making good progress with our various regulatory filings around the world. We have an excellent team focused on these efforts, and we are moving forward as very much as expected in this regard. We continue to expect the transaction to be completed in Broadcom's fiscal year 2023.\nWe remain excited about our acquisition of VMware and continue to be impressed by the world-class engineering talent as well as strong customer and channel partnerships. We have tremendous respect for what VMware has built. And together, we will enable enterprises to accelerate innovation and expand choice by addressing the most complex technology challenges in this multi-cloud era.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.\n\nKirsten M. Spears\n\nCFO & CAO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nThank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Revenue was $8.5 billion for the quarter, up 25% from a year ago. Gross margins were 76% of revenue in the quarter and up 80 basis points year-on-year. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, up 8% year-on-year, driven by investment in R&D. Operating income for the quarter was $5.2 billion and was 32% from a year ago -- was up 32% from a year ago. Operating margin was 61% of revenue, up approximately 320 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.4 billion or 63.5% of revenue. Note that this figure excludes $129 million of depreciation.\nNow a review of the P&L for our 2 segments. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $6.6 billion and represented 78% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 32% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 72%, up 220 basis points year-on-year, driven by favorable product mix and content growth in next-generation products across our extensive product portfolio. Operating expenses were $853 million in Q3, up 9% year-on-year. R&D was $765 million in the quarter, up 10% year-on-year. Q3 semiconductor operating margins increased to 59%. So while semiconductor revenue was up 32%, operating profit grew 44%.\nMoving to the P&L for our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.8 billion and represented 22% of revenue. This was up 5% year-on-year. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 90% in the quarter and were stable year-over-year. Operating expenses were $375 million in the quarter, up 4% year-over-year. Infrastructure software operating margin was 70% in Q3, and operating profit grew 5%.\nMoving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.3 billion, representing 51% of revenue. We spent $116 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 29 days in the third quarter compared to 30 days a year ago. We ended the third quarter with inventory of $1.8 billion, up 10% from the end of the prior quarter, in large part due to higher material costs and the expected sequential revenue ramp. We ended the third quarter with $10 billion of cash and $39.5 billion of gross debt, of which $304 million is short term.\nTurning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.7 billion of cash dividends. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased $1.5 billion in common stock and eliminated $292 million of common stock for taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 3.2 million AVGO shares. The non-GAAP diluted share count in Q3 was 436 million. In Q4, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be 435 million, which excludes the potential impact of any share repurchases completed in the fourth quarter. We have not repurchased any of our shares since we announced the pending acquisition of VMware as repurchases are subject to regulatory rules. We maintain our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, including buybacks, as soon as we can under SEC rules. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 is for consolidated revenues of $8.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 63% of projected revenue.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",

A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results.\nI'll now turn the call over to Hock.\n\nHock E. Tan\n\nCEO, President & Executive Director, Broadcom Inc.\n\nRight. Thank you, Ji. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. So in our fiscal Q1 '22, consolidated net revenue was a record $7.7 billion, up 16% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue grew 20% year-on-year to $5.9 billion. And infrastructure software revenue grew 5% year-on-year to $1.8 billion.\nNow enterprise demand grew very robustly from the trough we saw in Q1 last year as the recovery in enterprise IT spending continued to accelerate. Meanwhile, hyper clouds are upgrading their data centers, and service providers, telcos continue to deploy next-generation fiber-to-the-home. As expected, against the peak of a year ago, wireless grew single digits, and our core software business remains very stable and steady.\nOn the supply front, lead times remain extended and unchanged as inventory of our products in the channel and in our customers remains lean. Our semiconductor backlog at the close of Q1 continue to grow double digits from that of the prior quarter.\nLet me now provide more color by end markets, starting with networking. Networking revenue of $1.9 billion was up 33% year-on-year and represented 32% of our semiconductor revenue. This strong growth was driven by deployment at scale of Tomahawk 4 and compute off loan across several hyperscale customers, and they upgrade and scale out their data centers. In enterprises, campus switching upgrades continue to accelerate.\nLet me talk about routing in this space. Investments in 5G backhaul by telco operators worldwide continue to drive strong growth in our Qumran family of products. More than this, the opportunity in our routing silicon has expanded into hyperscale in a very significant way, moving Ethernet into the back-end network of large-scale AI/ML clusters.\nIn particular, I'm referring to the Arista's 7800 AI platform, which scales Ethernet to connect many tens of thousands of CPUs and GPUs in hyperscale. This platform is built on our Jericho router. Our devices provide the most cost-effective fabric for AI/ML scaler with an end-to-end congestion managed lossless network and highest efficiency load balancing across the link.\nNow in contrast to proprietary protocols such as Infiniband used typically in high-performance computing, we see low-latency Ethernet as the way forward for large-scale AI/ML networks as a widely adopted open architecture.\nOur unique ability to network these complex AI workloads in hyperscale is extending our customized training and inference SoC footprint at several cloud guys. In Q2, we expect networking to continue to be strong across the board and revenue growth to be in excess of 30% year-over-year.\nNext, our server storage connectivity revenue was $801 million, and growth accelerated to 32% year-on-year, representing 14% of semiconductor revenue. This was driven in large part by the continuing recovery of enterprise IT spending, much of which was deployed towards upgrading compute service. And most of these compute service use either our MegaRAID or SAN for server storage connectivity. We are also benefiting from increased content as enterprises upgrade to next-generation storage connectivity solutions to support deployment of leading-edge service.\nBeyond enterprise, with proliferation of video content in social media, we see our cloud customers increasingly adopting nearline hard disk drives as the primary storage of choice. And to manage this much arrays of hard disk drives, they deploy storage service and expanders, which utilize very much our next-generation storage connectivity, silicon and software, creating another driver for revenue growth.\nInterestingly, we are also a critical supply of preamplifiers and rechannels in nearline hard disk drives, with our revenue growing at over 20% CAGR over the last 5 years. Our nearline revenue represented over 2/3 of our hard drive business this quarter.\nWith the adoption of next-generation technology here, we're selling more bots than just silicon, resulting in much higher dollar content. This dynamic, coupled with continuing strong demand from both enterprise and hyperscale, is expected to accelerate Q2 server storage connectivity revenue to over 55% year-on-year.\nNow moving on to broadband. Revenue of $911 million grew 23% year-on-year and represented 16% of semiconductor revenue. This was driven largely by increased deployment of next-generation PON and DOCSIS, our cable modem, with high attach rates of WiFi 6 and 6E in home gateways. Examples of this about last quarter, Chartered announced trials of DOCSIS 4.0 running at speeds of 8.5 gigabit downstream and 6 gigabit upstream, both in CPE and remote note. Comcast start the deployment of their WiFi 6E DOCSIS 3.1 gateway, and AT&T announced a multi-gig PON service on their gateways. All of this are using Broadcom SoCs.\nWe remain the market leader in delivering WiFi 6 and 6E chips to leading phones as well as routers, enterprise access point and carrier gateways. Through the first quarter of 2022, we have cumulatively shipped over 1 billion WiFi 6 and 6E radios in just around 3 years since our launch. Our OEM customers and carrier partners are now ramping WiFi 6E, the current generation of WiFi making use of the 6 gigahertz band, which has increasingly been made available for unlicensed access across the globe.\nAnd as we look ahead, we are the industry leader, heavily investing in WiFi 7 as the strategic complement to 10G PON and cable modem. We see -- both broadband. We see this as the next step in broadband development and deployment globally. In the U.S. alone, the pending infrastructure access to site $65 billion over the next 5 years to connect more homes to high-speed broadband. Across the world, the same is happening as next-generation wide broadband is seen as the better alternative to 5G for home connectivity. As far as Q2 is concerned, we expect our broadband business to continue to grow 20% year-on-year.\nMoving on to wireless. Q1 revenue of $2 billion represented 34% of semiconductor revenue. Demand from our North American customer for our products continued to be strong during the quarter, driving wireless revenue up 10% sequentially and up 4% year-on-year from the peak quarter in fiscal '21. As expected in Q2, wireless revenue will be seasonally down, about mid-teens quarter-on-quarter, but will still be up mid-single digits from a year ago.\nFinally, industrial revenue of $243 million represented approximately 4% of Q1 semiconductor revenue. Q1 resales of $239 million grew 37% year-over-year driven by robust demand from electric vehicles, renewable energy, factory automation and health care. Reflecting such strong resales, our inventory in the channel remain around 1 month, and we expect resales to continue to be strong in Q2.\nAccordingly, in summary, Q1 semiconductor solution revenue was up 20% year-on-year. Q2, we expect semiconductor revenue to accelerate to 25% year-on-year.\nTurning to software. In Q1, infrastructure software revenue of $1.8 billion grew 5% year-on-year and represented 24% of total revenue. Core software revenue grew 6% year-on-year. In dollar terms, consolidated renewal rates averaged 121% over expiring contracts, while in our strategic accounts, we averaged 136%.\nWithin this strategic account, $656 million represented renewals on expiring contracts, of which $164 million represented cross-selling, including PLAs, of our portfolio products to the same customers. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance.\nOkay. ARR, annual recurring revenue, at the end of Q1 was $5.3 billion, which was up 5% from a year ago. In Q2, we expect our infrastructure software revenue to sustain around mid-single-digit percentage growth [year-upon-year].\nIn summary, in Q1, semiconductor revenue grew a strong 20%. In fact, excluding wireless, it grew -- actually grew over 30%. Combined with our stable software business, consolidated revenue grew 16% year-on-year to $7.7 billion.\nNow turning to Q2 guidance. We expect semiconductor revenue growth will accelerate to 25% year-on-year. And excluding wireless, it will be 35% year-on-year. Layering on our stable software business, we expect Q2 consolidated revenue growth of 20% year-on-year to $7.9 billion.\nAnd before I turn this call over to Kirsten, I just want to add, Broadcom recently published its second annual ESG report available on the company's corporate citizenship site, which discusses the company's ESG initiatives. As a global technology leader, we recognized the company's responsibility to have a positive impact on our communities. Through our product and technology innovation and operational excellence, we remain very committed to this mission.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.\n\nKirsten M. Spears\n\nCFO & CAO, Broadcom Inc.\n\nThank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Revenue was $7.7 billion for the quarter, up 16% from a year ago. Gross margins were 76% of revenue in the quarter and up 227 basis points year-on-year. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, up 6% year-on-year, driven by investment in research and development. Operating income for the quarter was $4.7 billion and was up 23% from a year ago. Operating margin was 60% of revenue, up approximately 362 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.8 billion or 62.5% of revenue. Note that this figure excludes $136 million of depreciation.\nNow a review of the P&L for our 2 segments. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $5.9 billion and represented 76% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 20% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 71%, up 347 basis points year-on-year, driven by favorable product mix and content growth in next-generation products across our extensive product portfolio. Operating expenses were $817 million in Q1, up 9% year-on-year. R&D was $725 million in the quarter, up 10% year-on-year. Q1 semiconductor operating margins increased to 57%. So while semiconductor revenue was up 20%, operating profit grew 31%.\nMoving to the P&L for our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.8 billion and represented 24% of revenue. This was up 5% year-on-year. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 90% in the quarter, up 71 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses were $348 million in the quarter, up 1% year-over-year. Infrastructure software operating margin was 71% in Q1, and operating profit grew 7%.\nMoving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $3.4 billion, representing 44% of revenue. We spent $101 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 30 days in the first quarter compared to 35 days a year ago. We ended the first quarter with inventory of $1.5 billion, up 17% from the end of the prior quarter, in large part due to higher material costs. Our hardware backlog at the end of the quarter was over $25 billion compared to $22 billion the preceding quarter. And our lead times remain steady at 50 weeks. Our software backlog continued to grow as well and ended the quarter at over $15 billion. As a point of reference, software backlog was $13 billion a year ago. We ended the quarter with $10.2 billion of cash and $39.5 billion of gross debt, of which $300 million is short term.\nTurning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.8 billion of cash dividends. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased $2.7 billion in common stock and eliminated $375 million of common stock for taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 5 million AVGO shares. The non-GAAP diluted share count in Q1 was $446 million.\nBased on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 is for consolidated revenues of $7.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 62.5% of projected revenue. Note that we expect Q2 non-GAAP diluted share count to be 442 million. This excludes the potential impact of any share repurchases completed in the second quarter.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",

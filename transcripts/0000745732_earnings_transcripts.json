The call will begin with prepared comments by management, followed by a question-and-answer session. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star zero on your telephone keypad. Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings, and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations.\nRisk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2024 Form 10-K, and fiscal 2025 Form 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC. I would like to turn the call over to Jim Conroy, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nGood afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer, Phil Sheehan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Connie Kao, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. As noted in today's press release, we are very pleased with our Q3 sales results, which accelerated from the prior quarter. Total sales for the period grew 10% to $5.6 billion, with comparable store sales increasing a strong 7%. Our merchants delivered a compelling assortment of brand-name values, which led to broad-based growth across all major merchandise categories. Those assortments, coupled with our new marketing campaigns, drove excitement, higher customer engagement, and increased store traffic. We had an excellent back-to-school selling season, with strong trends that continued through the balance of the quarter. Additionally, the stores and supply chain organizations executed extremely well to support the elevated sales and inventory flow.\nThe strength in top line, coupled with our continued focus on expense control, resulted in an operating margin of 11.6% that was much stronger than expected. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ending 1 November 2025 were $1.58 on net income of $512 million. Included in this year's Q3 earnings is an approximate $0.05 per share negative impact from tariff-related costs. These results compared to $1.48 per share on net earnings of $489 million in the prior year period. For the first nine months, earnings per share were $4.61 on net earnings of $1.5 billion, compared to $4.53 per share on net income of $1.5 billion for the same period last year. Included in year-to-date 2025 earnings are an approximate $0.16 per share negative impact from tariff-related costs. Sales for the year-to-date period grew to $16.1 billion, with comparable store sales up 3% over last year.\nFor Q3 at Ross, cosmetics, shoes, and ladies were the strongest merchandise areas. By geography, we saw broad-based strength, with the Southeast and the Midwest performing the best. dd's DISCOUNTS' strong value and fashion offerings continued to resonate with its shoppers and delivered comp gains relatively similar to Ross for the period. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were up 9% versus last year, and average store inventories were up 15% as we advanced the inventory build for the holiday season into the tail end of October. Pack-away merchandise represented 36% of total inventories, compared to 38% last year. We feel very good about the health and levels of our inventory and are well-positioned to deliver a broad assortment of values this holiday selling season. During Q3, we opened 36 new Ross and 4 dd's DISCOUNTS stores.\nSimilar to our summer opening group, we are pleased with the performance of our fall openings, particularly the results in the new markets, including the New York metro area. The openings in Q3 completed our expansion program for 2025. For the year, we added a total of 90 locations, comprised of 80 Ross and 10 dd's. We plan to close and/or relocate 10 locations in Q4 and expect to end the year with 1,903 Ross stores and 360 dd's locations. At this point, I would like to provide an update on our branded strategy, which has now been fully embedded in our merchandising approach for more than a year. Over this period of time, the merchants have been laser-focused on delivering high-quality, branded bargains at compelling values.\nThey have been able to deliver an assortment that spans good, better, and best brands to ensure that we are providing exceptional values to our diverse customer base. We would attribute a portion of the sequential improvement in the business to the successful implementation of the branded strategy. This strategy has particularly helped the ladies' business, which further accelerated this quarter and comped above the chain average. Additionally, the increased emphasis on brands has further strengthened our vendor partnerships, and increased closeout opportunities. These efforts not only drove higher sales, but also helped us partially offset tariff impacts, resulting in better-than-expected merchandise margins for Q3. While tariff uncertainties persist, we are encouraged by the exceptional product availability in the marketplace. This has enabled us to secure opportunistic buys that position us favorably for the holiday season.\nAs a result, we now expect tariff-related costs in Q4 to be negligible. From a pricing perspective, it is clear the consumer is prioritizing value, and our updated assortment is driving stronger customer engagement. While pricing has increased across the retail environment, our commitment to delivering value remains unchanged. We will continue to maintain a strong value proposition relative to traditional retailers, while working to mitigate the impact on our merchandise margins. Phil will now provide further details on our Q3 results and Q4 guidance.\n\nPhil Sheehan\n\nEVP and CFO, Ross Stores\n\nThank you, Jim. As previously stated, comparable store sales rose 7% in the quarter. The gain was a result of both higher transactions and a larger average basket size. Operating margin decreased by 35 basis points to 11.6%, mainly due to the impact of tariffs. Cost of goods sold increased by 35 basis points in the quarter. Distribution costs were higher by 60 basis points, primarily due to the opening of a new distribution center earlier this year and tariff-related processing costs. Merchandise margin deleveraged by 10 basis points, while buying expenses were flat compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting the higher costs in the quarter were lower domestic freight and occupancy costs of 25 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively. SG&A costs were flat year-over-year, despite the headwinds from CEO transition costs.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $262 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $1.05 billion in shares this year. Now let's discuss our Q4 guidance. We're encouraged by our business momentum as we enter the critical holiday season. As a result, for the 13 weeks ending 31 January 2026, we are raising our comparable store sales forecast to be up 3%-4, with earnings per share in the range of $1.77-$1.85. This updated guidance range reflects approximately $0.03 earnings per share of unfavorable timing of pack-away-related expenses that benefited the Q3. Based on our year-to-date results and updated Q4 forecast, we are increasing our earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2025 to be in the range of $6.38 to $6.46.\nAs for tariffs, we now forecast the Q4 impact to be negligible, leading to a full-year cost of approximately $0.15 per share. These estimates are based on the current level of tariffs. In addition, as a reminder, 2024 Q4 and full-year earnings per share of $1.79 and $6.32, respectively, included a benefit of approximately $0.14 in earnings per share related to the sale of a pack-away facility. The operating statement assumptions that support our Q4 guidance include the following: Total sales are projected to increase 6% to 8%. We expect operating margin to be in the range of 11.5%-11.8, compared to 12.4% last year. Year-over-year change primarily reflects last year's benefit from the sale of a pack-away facility that was worth about 105 basis points. Net interest income is estimated to be about $30 million.\nOur tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 322 million. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for closing comments.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nThank you, Bill. To sum up, we are pleased with our Q3 results and encouraged by our sales momentum. With a strong merchandising plan and a terrific product assortment in place, we are optimistic about our prospects for Q4. Additionally, the store and supply chain teams are well-positioned for the holiday season, and our marketing campaigns have continued to build excitement. We believe that this multifaceted approach will help us continue our positive momentum and enable us to capture additional market share. Finally, I would like to thank the entire organization for their hard work and solid execution, which enabled us to deliver a strong Q3 performance. Despite the ongoing challenges and uncertainty in the macro environment, we remained focused on our core strategies and executed well as a cohesive team across the entire company.\nAt this point, we would like to open the call and respond to any questions you might have. John?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate that your line is in the queue. You may press star two to remove yourself from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. One moment, please, while we pull for questions. The first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMatthew Boss\n\nMD and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks, and congrats on a really great print.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nThank you, Matt.\n\nMatthew Boss\n\nMD and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nJim, could you help break down the inflection in same-store sales, or the 500 basis point sequential acceleration that you saw? How much would you attribute to company-specific initiatives as we think about marketing or the early stages of store experience relative to the macro backdrop? Could you just elaborate on the strong momentum that you cited in November that supported the Q4 raise?\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nSure. It was a really nice sequential improvement, and I think in the prepared remarks we used the word broad-based. The merchandise categories, every single merchandise category in Q3, every single major merchandise category anyway, was positive or nicely positive. We had some businesses in the second quarter that were somewhat underperforming, and they've really caught up, and we've seen some really great improvement in most categories across the business. We also had broad-based strength across the country in terms of our geographic regions, including regions that you would otherwise think would be under pressure. Broad-based strength across the business, how much of it is internal versus external? It's hard to say. We acknowledge that there probably has been some tailwinds out there. Some people are calling out that weather may have been a help.\nLast year, we called out that weather was a hindrance to our business a little bit. In terms of headwinds, there's a whole bunch of other macro uncertainties that have probably left consumers a little bit uneasy in their shopping. I'd give a lot of credit to the team. The product team leads the charge. The assortments look fantastic. They've navigated through tariffs and very strategically have maneuvered AURs. The marketing team has done a very nice job. The stores team has stepped up. Really, the whole company. I'm sure there might be something in the macro backdrop that's a tailwind to us, but I also give some credit to the team for just executing extremely well.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSVP and Lead Equity Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thanks, and good afternoon, and congrats on the strong results. Jim, I just wanted to hone in on this element of change. You've come into the business, and we were comping flat to start the year, and we've really substantially accelerated. I wanted to get a flavor for what, in your view, are the major drivers of this improvement in the momentum, and then what do you think is perhaps the stickiest of all of these changes that is going to propel the business on a multi-year trajectory for continued growth and improvement in outperformance?\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nSure. Happy to have a shot at that. First, I'd start with I absolutely inherited a strong company that was being managed extremely well. The company had been growing for years before I showed up. The first quarter was a bit of an anomaly, right? We had a lot of macro headwinds that pushed the business to a flat after a challenging latter part of January and a very challenging February, which we called out last year. In terms of some of the things that have changed, it's not very different than my remarks on some of the first couple of investor calls. The merchandising team is extremely sophisticated, and some of the best merchants in the world work for Ross, and that strength continues to propel the business forward.\nIf I added anything to the business, it is to sort of raise or amplify the voices of the marketing group and the stores team so we can drive more traffic from a marketing standpoint, and when they get to the stores, they can enjoy a slightly better, or hopefully much better, in-store shopping environment. The overarching strategy is quite simple, which is just to get merchandising, marketing, and stores, perhaps add supply chain to that mix, operating in unison so we're all kind of pushing the business forward for more growth.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSVP and Lead Equity Analyst, Jefferies\n\nUnderstood. Just as a follow-up, the new marketing campaigns have clearly resonated. What is it, in your view, that you think has materially helped to accelerate the amplification of all of these improvements that you've made in the business, particularly from a branded perspective, that's really working from a marketing standpoint and that's helping to amplify the message even more and resonate with consumers?\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nSure, sure. Coming in as an outsider, there are some disadvantages. I wasn't an off-price person, and I'm not a true merchant. Perhaps if there was one advantage, it was a set of fresh eyes. From a marketing standpoint, we absolutely want to remain rooted in great branded values, but the challenge that I gave to the marketing team and to the new agency was, how do we create cut-through with a refreshed marketing message? We've really contemporized how we go to market in terms of a creative standpoint. We've tweaked the merchandise mix a bit. Notably, we haven't increased marketing expense, at least as a percentage of sales.\nI think sort of this refreshed view of how you can look at the store and reach out to customers in a slightly different way, and perhaps reach out to younger customers in a more aggressive way, it seems to be taking root. We are encouraged by it, we're excited by it, we've seen some hard metrics improve, and we've seen some qualitative factors improve nicely. I certainly don't want to dampen anybody's enthusiasm because it's fantastic to see. Let's just remember that it's only been a few months now, right? We've got a very busy holiday season to get through, and then we'll see why it becomes sticky in your mind.\nComing back to that part of your question, I think probably the stickiest thing ultimately will be the power of the Ross brand and just what that means for customers, and the promise that it delivers to shoppers. It's had a great legacy up to this point, and if I had any impact on it, it's how can we modernize it slightly so we continue to resonate with all customers, particularly younger customers.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSVP and Lead Equity Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThat's a great color. Thanks so much, and best of luck.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMark Altschwager\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThank you for taking my question. You're expecting tariff costs now to be negligible in Q4, which is great to hear. I was hoping you could update us on the mitigation efforts, what's working, what's giving you the comfort with your ability to fully offset, and with that, hoping you could speak specifically to the AUR trend you're seeing, and also how we should interpret that Q4 guide as we think about the wraparound effects of tariffs for early 2026.\n\nMichael Hartshorn\n\nPresident and COO, Ross Stores\n\nHi, Mark. It's Michael Hartshorn. Similar to what happened in the second quarter, as you saw in our commentary, the tariff-related costs came in lower than we expected, and our merchant teams have done a tremendous job balancing cost concessions with modest market-driven price increases where we can maintain our value gap against other retailers. In addition, they were able to take advantage, given the closeout availability, take advantage of closeouts in the marketplace and chase above-plan sales. As we expected, as we imagined the year when we had additional lead time from the initial tariff announcements and had opened the buy to fill, our merchant teams have been able to mitigate the impact of tariffs as we progressed through the year. In addition, with some tariff stability, we've been able to normalize ticketing activities in our distribution centers.\nFor going forward, it's too early to speak for 2026, but barring any meaningful changes in the tariff policy, we would expect pricing stability, which would eliminate the need for our merchants to make pricing decisions against a moving target.\n\nMark Altschwager\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThank you. A quick follow-up on the comp acceleration. I believe you said consistency, or you said strength across regions, but I'm wondering if there's any call-out by demographic or income cohort.\n\nMichael Hartshorn\n\nPresident and COO, Ross Stores\n\nSure. Just to follow up on your question on AUR, the comp components for the quarter: traffic, UPT, and AUR all increased, and transactions were the biggest of those. In terms of demographic performance, we called out in previous quarter our Hispanic stores during the quarter at both Ross and dd's stores that have what I'd say is high trade area Hispanic population, saw an improvement that was similar to the chain from quarter to quarter, and ended up posting solid comps despite trailing the chain slightly. Other call-outs we did mention in the call: Southeast and the Midwest were our top-performing markets. In terms of bigger markets, California, Florida, and Texas were all relatively in line with the chain.\n\nMark Altschwager\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThank you.\n\nMichael Hartshorn\n\nPresident and COO, Ross Stores\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nSenior Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nHey, thanks, Tom. Good afternoon. Thanks. On the marketing change, can we double-click on that a little bit? Do you think you're driving new or lapsed customers? Do you think you're increasing engagement with existing customers? Where do you still see opportunity on that front?\n\nMichael Hartshorn\n\nPresident and COO, Ross Stores\n\nIt's hard to tease out the components of the traffic. We do believe we're gaining some new customers and re-engaging with lapsed customers. If you go through the analytics provided by Meta Platforms and you go through TikTok, I think it's safe to say we have improved our engagement. In terms of where we are, in terms of our evolution from a marketing and branding standpoint, it's very, very early, right? We hired an agency in the beginning of the year. Their first output was in the July timeframe. We've just released a couple of new spots for holiday that then translate across all the digital platforms as well. Very early innings.\nDeepa and the marketing team have done an unbelievable job, but there's just even more in front of us, I think, for us to continue to learn and react to that, and continue to deliver some great messaging.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nSenior Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nThat's great. Just as a follow-up, you noted that as a percentage of sales, you didn't increase the spend, but it's well known that you spend far less in dollars and as a percentage of sales relative to your largest peer. When you look ahead, do you think you need to grow that, or do you think you continue to just reinvest and redeploy those dollars?\n\nMichael Hartshorn\n\nPresident and COO, Ross Stores\n\nIt's a good question. Right now, we're going to maintain our percent of sales where it is. We have a financial and operating model that I want to kind of work within. Clearly, if we can spur on more business and drive more customers and drive more sales, even at the same rate, we'll get some more marketing dollars. It's too early to say we'll invest any more in it. Right now, the amount we're spending seems to be paying dividends. Stay tuned for that, but there's no immediate plans for an increased spend there.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nSenior Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nMichael Hartshorn\n\nPresident and COO, Ross Stores\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nLorraine Hutchinson\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. Jim, you called out the branded strategy as a key driver of the comp acceleration. Can you talk about how this benefit has built over time, and how much more opportunity you see going forward?\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nSure. Absolutely. If you want to go through the timeline, in the fourth quarter last year, we had a decent quarter, and we called out the branded strategy touches everything, but it's probably most impactful to ladies. If we just look at the ladies' business and how it's sequentially changed over the last few quarters, last year, fourth quarter was pretty strong, but ladies was a drag on the comp. In Q1 and in Q2, the ladies' business was slightly better but still flattish and a slight drag on the comp in Q1. In Q2, it started to show some improvement. It was kind of in line with the company, maybe slightly comp-enhancing. In this most recent quarter, the entire business got better, substantially better, and the ladies' business was actually comp-enhancing.\nIf we posted a +7, you can intuit that the ladies' business was better than a +7.\n\nLorraine Hutchinson\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHow much more opportunity do you see? Yeah, how much more opportunity going forward do you see in this ladies' business from the branded strategy?\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nA fair amount, I think. I mean, as you know, we've been investing in that over four or five quarters. It had a drag on our merchandise margin that we thought would be an investment in the business, and that investment seems to be paying off now. I think with one very solid quarter under our belt, I'd like to think that for the next three quarters until we have leap anniversary of that, we'll see some outsized growth. Of course, that team has really started to build excitement, some great leadership there. I think even after we anniversary this quarter, I think they'll find some opportunities for more comp improvement. There's not a lack of ideas for innovation in that part of the business.\n\nLorraine Hutchinson\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Paul Lejue with Citibank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nMD and Head of Consumer Discretionary Research, Citi\n\nHey, thanks. Jim, sorry if I missed it, did you say anything about the monthly cadence? Curious if you could share anything on that front, home versus apparel, and specifically not just performance, home versus apparel, but AURs in each of those categories. Is there any quantification of how your customer base has changed? Within that ladies' business, can you isolate that you are getting a customer of a certain age that you did not previously have? Is there any quantification to that?\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nI'll just start on a couple of those, Paul. During the quarter, we had a very strong back-to-school and held the trend throughout the quarter. Throughout, the trends were fairly consistent, and that was true for both Ross and dd's. On the AUR, I said in a previous commentary that it was driven by increases in traffic, UPT, and AUR, with the traffic or transactions for us the biggest of those. Traffic and the basket were very similar. In terms of overall category performance, we mentioned children's and men's were relatively in line with the chain. Cosmetics, shoes, and ladies were best performers. Home was slightly below the chain average. You also asked about shifts in business. The things we measure against, usually you see bigger trends over time. We certainly talked about demographics and the Hispanic customer.\nIn terms of household income, not only was the sales very broad-based across geographies and merchandise categories, they were also very broad-based across trade area income levels, and we did not see any significant shifts there.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nMD and Head of Consumer Discretionary Research, Citi\n\nThank you. Good luck.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Alexandra Straton with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAlex Straton\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks so much. Congrats on a great quarter. Maybe just on maybe for you, Jim, on the upgrading the store experience. I think you highlighted that as an opportunity when you first started. Did any changes there play a role in the comp acceleration? How do you gauge effectiveness of those strategies? What are your priorities on that front as you think about Q4 and into next year?\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nI can take that. We're addressing the store experience on a couple of different factors. First, we have begun refreshing. We expect to refresh all stores in the chain, which we believe will provide a more modern look and feel for the customer. This includes new perimeter signing, wayfinding signage, along with addressing cosmetic-type repairs. We're halfway through the chain there. Though it's very early, the customer feedback has been good. The other focus areas within the store, as you can imagine, are improving line lengths and throughput through the front end of the store and also improving our recovery throughout the day. We're finding places to get efficiencies within the store and then reinvest it in those focus areas. In terms of immediate impact in the quarter, I think it's very early days. If anything, we'd expect to build momentum over time.\n\nAlex Straton\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good luck.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nSure. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrooke Roach\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for taking our question. Jim, I wanted to get your thoughts on Ross's approach to value gaps into holiday and 2026 as market prices move up. How much of the AUR growth in the third quarter was driven by price actions versus mix? Are there any categories where you've taken action on pricing where you're starting to see any signs of consumer elasticity?\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nSure. Happy to take it. In terms of the first part of your question, our strategy is, I think, a pretty typical off-price strategy of keeping an umbrella under traditional retailers in terms of pricing. We tend to be very intensely focused on the values that we provide, which is one of the reasons why we were a little bit slower to make any changes to AUR because we really wanted to underscore with the customer that we were going to be delivering values, including during a tariff environment. Holding true to that, and we've called out tariff impacts over the last couple of quarters, although they're going away for the fourth quarter, holding true to that sort of promise perhaps has helped us pull in some new customers or bring back lapsed customers. We are excited about that.\nI think Michael talked about in terms of transactions, AUR, and UPT. Transactions was still the biggest driver of the comp. As we look at the fourth quarter, we were pretty much bought up for the fourth quarter for a while. I wouldn't expect any significant changes in our strategy from a pricing standpoint for the fourth quarter. I think it was encouraging that we were able to have a modest increase in our AUR and not see degradation in units per transaction. That was up a little bit. We also continue to see transactions. Hopefully, that's answered the question. I mean, it's been a very difficult thing to navigate for the last several months looking at the changing in tariffs and the changes in the retail environment and trying to find exactly the right set of prices for every single category. Have we made mistakes within that?\nProbably. What ultimately falls out of that is a business that may start turning slightly slower, so you may mark it down, and then you move through it. On balance, we haven't had any significant footfalls that have created massively increased markdowns or slowdown in our terms.\n\nBrooke Roach\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks so much. Best of luck going forward.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nThanks, Brooke.\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Binetti\n\nSenior MD and Fundamental Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking our questions here. Congrats on a nice quarter. Jim, I guess as you look at marketing and some of the store refreshes and the state of the fleet today, as you look at some of the initial successes and the top-line impact here, how do you think about what to invest in and accelerate those things that are working to keep the top line going versus how you think about flowing through some of the earnings on these initiatives to investors next year? I think just at the highest level, maybe some thinking on the trade-offs between pushing sales harder now that you've got some things that are very obviously working and then flow-through versus investment next year. Then separately, you've spoken a little bit about a strong pipeline of dd's stores in the past.\nHow are the Ross Banner stores in the Northeast area doing? Do you see an opportunity to accelerate store growth at both chains, at Ross in addition to dd's?\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nSure. Maybe I'll take the first one, and Michael will take the second piece of that in terms of store growth. On the investors to flow-through, yeah, I'm not even here a year, and I was very cautious when I first got here to listen, learn, and lead, right? I really wanted to learn a new business, a much bigger business, the off-price sector, etc. While I had some hypotheses for change, as did the team, I really wanted to be respectful of the financial model and the operating model that has been successful for the company for so long.\nWhile we've made some changes over the last couple of quarters, and perhaps we're seeing fruits of those changes now, I'd like to let some more time go before we come out and say, we're going to overinvest betting on the cum for future results. Anything we've done so far has been, again, within the expense structure, within the financial model the company has. We haven't spent anything in an outsized way from a marketing perspective. Well, really, even from a store's perspective outside of sort of the capital plan that was here when I got here. Three months from now, six months from now, if we continue to see positive ROI, to your point, we may then get more aggressive and say, look, if we can break the model slightly from a financial standpoint, will we deliver higher comps and additional earnings? Perhaps.\nRight now, I think we're all kind of committed to the operating model that's worked for the company for decades.\n\nMichael Hartshorn\n\nPresident and COO, Ross Stores\n\nMichael, on real estate, first on this year's store openings, as we said in the commentary, we opened 80 Ross and 10 dd's. As an entire group, the new stores have outperformed our plan, and we're very excited, although it's very early, with the success in both the Northeast and the New York stores, and also in our Puerto Rico stores that opened over the summer. As I said, what we've seen thus far, we're really optimistic about a Northeast expansion. We feel good about the real estate landscape. We have a very healthy pipeline. We've said before that we're going to re-accelerate the dd's growth. In terms of the combined groups, we'll have more to say when we get to the end of the year in our 2026 guidance.\n\nMichael Binetti\n\nSenior MD and Fundamental Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nAll right, guys. Congrats again. Best of luck to the holidays. Thank you.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nIke Boruchow\n\nMD and Senior Equity Consumer Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, everyone. Jim has figured out ask about self-checkout. I think it's something you've talked about in the past as a driver. How many stores is that rolled out to? How meaningful can that be maybe over the next 12 months? Just kind of how are you thinking about ROI on that investment?\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nSure, Ike. It's in 80 stores today, and it's taken us a while to get to this point. We tried a couple of different models, and it's taken us a while to get the shrink aspect of self-checkout correct. We now have a prototype that's worked well for us over the last year, and we're not only seeing lower shrink, but we're seeing high customer adoption. We're seeing sales impacts in the stores that we put it in, and we'll be rolling it out to further stores next year. How big it will be depends on kind of the next phase of rollout, but where it works best for us is in our high-volume stores. We will continue to roll it out. We'll have more to say on how many of those stores in the 2026 preview.\n\nIke Boruchow\n\nMD and Senior Equity Consumer Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Adrian Yee with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAdrian Yee\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good afternoon. Congratulations on a great acceleration into holiday. First question on dd's. Did you see any—I mean, was it patterned very similarly to the Ross Dress for Less stores, or did you see any pressure, particularly in the early part of November with the delay of the SNAP benefits? Has that rebounded? Secondly, you mentioned that the results fully offset all of the tariff, the gross tariff amount. Should we assume that that obviously is the case for the fourth quarter, but that kind of the biggest impact because of your turns being so fast, that the biggest impact would have been felt in 2025, and we enter 2026 in a pretty normal way state in terms of tariffs, or there's probably a little bit of overhang in Q1? Thank you.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nAdrian, on the dd's, dd's was very similar to Ross. The business was very consistent across the quarter, so there's nothing that I would call out there. In terms of tariffs, we did say there continued to be an impact in Q3, but it will be neutral in Q4 as we've been able to chase the business with closeouts. We've been able to work with vendors on cost concessions, and I would expect it to be somewhat neutral. It is neutral in Q4 and expected to be neutral as we move into 2026.\n\nAdrian Yee\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. My quick follow-up is just going to be there are very few companies that are exiting the third quarter with overall sales growing faster than inventory on an average basis or even at the end of the quarter. Obviously, you've built some inventory up. The availability is fantastic. Is this just sort of—do you feel—well, I'm going to ask a question that I know the answer to. I mean, clearly, you can chase that inventory, but I guess as you think about kind of heading into spring, what are you seeing in terms of kind of being a little bit more maybe disciplined or judicious about taking some of that pack-away? Any changes to strategy as we head into spring when we think that broader retail will raise prices across the board?\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nOn the ending inventory, as we said in the commentary, we did end up 15% on the last day of the quarter. Actually, during the quarter, inventory was in line with sales, which, similar to prior years, holiday shopping and promotions are well underway ahead of Thanksgiving holiday. In anticipation of those shifts, we set the sales floor for the holiday at the end of October, which is earlier than last year, and also advanced some of the inventory into the store.\n\nAdrian Yee\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Perfect. Thanks. Best of luck. Great quarter.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nThank you.\n\nMichael Hartshorn\n\nPresident and COO, Ross Stores\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with the Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDana Telsey (Telsey Advisory Group]\n\nCEO and Chief Research Officer\n\nHi, good afternoon, everyone, and congratulations on the terrific results. As you take a look at your customer—thanks. As you take a look at your customer, particularly an assessment of the lower-income customers, are you seeing anything? Are you seeing a trade-down to the core Ross? What are you seeing in dd's? Is there any difference in performance of the lower-income stores in lower-income areas versus others? Lastly, with the expansion into the New York area or the Northeast, as you think about your store expansion plans for next year, will a greater portion of those stores be in the Northeast? How do you see opening costs? Is the opportunity for greater sales from those stores in more dense areas leveraging the cost, given it may be a higher cost structure? Thank you.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nDana, on the trade-down customer, it's really hard to peel apart in the data. We do measure the trade area demographics around the stores, and the seven-comp was very broad-based across all income levels. We didn't see any distinction between the lower or higher-income customers. In terms of entry into the Northeast, today, about 70% of our store openings are in what I call existing markets, and 30% in newer markets, which would now include the Northeast and Puerto Rico. Over the last couple of years, it's included the upper Midwest. I'd expect that pace to continue and will gradually continue to add in New York over time and to Puerto Rico, and continue to expand those markets. We don't think our return on opening a new store will decline as we enter the Northeast.\nAs you say, its more dense population should drive up higher sales to support the additional investment and higher costs in some of the store data there.\n\nDana Telsey (Telsey Advisory Group]\n\nCEO and Chief Research Officer\n\nGot it. Just one more thing, Jim. In terms of what you're seeing with the store refreshes, the great enhancements that you're making in brand in general, other categories besides women's where you're seeing this opportunity for? When you think about the store refreshes, anything that is particularly notable that you see as the opportunity for next year? Thank you.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nWell, we certainly have some ideas about next year, and we don't want to sort of necessarily divulge those just yet. In terms of categories that have improved, we've seen sequential improvement across a number of different businesses. Perhaps the one to call out is the home business was a drag in Q2 and was nicely positive in Q3. We feel well-positioned in that piece of the business as we go into the fourth quarter when it spikes as a percent of sales. I think that may be another category that we can talk about, some of the wins that that merchandise team has pulled together. Yes, I'm glad to hear the enthusiasm on store refreshes, and the stores, I think, are looking a bit better.\nI would kind of come back to some of my earlier comments that it's still very early innings in some of these changes. Maybe that's just good news in terms of the best is yet to come.\n\nDana Telsey (Telsey Advisory Group]\n\nCEO and Chief Research Officer\n\nThank you.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of John Kernan with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJohn Kernan\n\nTD Cowen, Research Analyst\n\nAll right, congrats on the great quarter, guys.\n\nMichael Hartshorn\n\nPresident and COO, Ross Stores\n\nThanks, John.\n\nJohn Kernan\n\nTD Cowen, Research Analyst\n\nJust wanted to circle back to gross margin. The merch margin was down slightly. You're now lapping a lot of the initiatives in the branded segment. I'm just curious what you think the opportunities for merch margin are going forward. You are comfortably above the levels you were at pre-COVID as a benchmark. I'm just curious what you see as long-term drivers. I just have a quick follow-up on distribution costs.\n\nMichael Hartshorn\n\nPresident and COO, Ross Stores\n\nI mean, like you said, merch margin, although it declined, it was a little better than we expected as we had less ticketing, and some stronger shrink results helped there. Moving forward, it's an area of continued focus. Certainly, we would like it to get better, but I think currently, we'd expect it to be relatively stable over time.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nI think there is.\n\nJohn Kernan\n\nTD Cowen, Research Analyst\n\nOkay. Yeah.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nWe talked about we're a year and a half into the brand strategy. I think there's going to continue to be opportunity to gain some leverage as we move through time as we've built the branded relationships with the vendors, gives us opportunity for closeouts. I think there's still some opportunity there. Within gross margin, the transportation cost will be a year-to-year kind of market-based discussion, but I think there's ongoing improvement capture in merchandise markets.\n\nJohn Kernan\n\nTD Cowen, Research Analyst\n\nObviously, the new DC is going to give you a lot of capacity. Just curious on distribution at D-leverage. Is that something that continues into next year? Looks like it picked up in Q2 this year, and I'm assuming it continues a little bit in the fourth quarter.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nYeah. In Q3, that D-leverage, like we've talked about a bit before, is the full impact of the opening of a new distribution center and also some tariff-related processing costs. As we move forward, we'd expect that pressure from the new DC continued, but that pre-ticketing pressure we've seen before related to tariffs should improve a bit. We'd expect just a slight headwind in Q4. As we grow capacity, we look beyond this year, we'll be able to continue to lever that new capacity until we open our next distribution center, which is two to three years away.\n\nJohn Kernan\n\nTD Cowen, Research Analyst\n\nThat's great. Thanks, guys.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAneesha Sherman\n\nVP and Senior Equity Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThanks, Connie. I want to follow up on the brand strategy. As you've discussed it in the past, you've talked about not changing the good, better, best mix, but rather increasing the availability of branded goods versus unbranded and labeled. As you're now attracting new customers and growing AUR and basket size, are you rethinking that and potentially considering adding more higher-end brands to expand the mix on the higher side? A follow-up on home. Jim, you talked about home getting better this quarter, though it was still weaker than the chain for two quarters in a row. Have you pulled back on the assortment at all in response to that weakness? Are there any implications there in terms of holiday and gifting and home decor assortment going into the holiday period? Thank you.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nOf course. On the home piece, absolutely not. We feel that the home business is really building momentum, and the team there has just created tremendous sequential improvement. As we get into the fourth quarter, the categories change a bit, right? Toys increases quite a bit, food increases, etc. Those businesses kind of have nothing to do with the incoming trend line, and we feel extremely well-positioned from a gifting standpoint, and from a toy standpoint. In terms of branded versus unbranded, a couple of points I guess I would say is over the last several years, right, the reason the brand strategy was put in place and certainly predated me was there was a notion that the company had migrated away a little bit too much from known brands chasing higher margin or higher markup kind of tertiary players, and we needed to right that shift.\nThat doesn't always mean higher-end brands, though, right? There are some really great brands at all price points within the store, and we have a very diverse customer base in every definition of that term. We want to have the best branded values for a good, better, or best pricing tier. Is there some opportunity to stretch higher? Perhaps. The merchants are always out there looking for the next new brand. It's always a small celebration within the buying office when we've opened a new brand and we've gotten access to new closeouts, etc. Over time, perhaps that will include reaching up a little bit. I would say it's across the board.\n\nAneesha Sherman\n\nVP and Senior Equity Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nOf course.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with The Retail Tracker. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMarni Shapiro\n\nFounding Partner, The Retail Tracker\n\nHey, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter, and congratulations on the New York store. I hear it is the place to be. I'm just curious on the marketing. It's what I'm hearing, it's what my people say. I'm so curious on the marketing side as you kind of dive a little bit more into marketing. Two things. Will you at some point consider a loyalty program, and what would that look like if you've thought about it? Are you doing even some of the more basic stuff like email or phone number capture so that you can more directly talk to your consumers?\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nNot sure about the loyalty program. On the email and text, we do have a pretty decent email database in existence today, a few million active email addresses. While we don't constantly update that number to the street, we saw a really nice increase in active emails over the last quarter, so that was great. We don't have an active text program at the moment. Who knows? The first order of business from a marketing standpoint was to experiment with some slightly different messaging and maybe a slightly more contemporary aesthetic. Over time, we might try some of these other ideas. Yes, the Brooklyn store has been just a great addition to the portfolio. I'm glad it's the place to be seen.\nWe've seen a lot of interesting people come in and out of the store recently, and we're constantly kind of spying on it with our CCTV. We kind of know everybody that goes in and out. Yeah.\n\nMarni Shapiro\n\nFounding Partner, The Retail Tracker\n\nThose four associates.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, everybody. Competitors, everybody. That store has been a really nice arrow in the quiver, and who knows what it bodes for future stores there. I mean, that particular location is pretty unique, very high traffic. There are other stores that we've seen open up in that area, in the New York metro area, that have had very strong openings. Perhaps that would probably be the outlier one, the one in Brooklyn that you're talking about.\n\nMarni Shapiro\n\nFounding Partner, The Retail Tracker\n\nAll right. Great. Thanks, guys. Best of luck for the holiday, and have a nice Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nLikewise, thank you.\nThanks, Marni.\n\nMarni Shapiro\n\nFounding Partner, The Retail Tracker\n\nBye.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have time for one last question coming from the line of Jay Sole with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJay Sole",
    "content2": "Managing Director and Senior Retail Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking my question. Jim, my question is about the guidance because you're guiding to 3%-4 comp. I look back, ex the post-COVID period, and the company hasn't guided above a 2%-3 in at least 10 years. I'm just wondering what this signals. I mean, are you taking a different approach to guiding now being CEO, or is it just that the quarter-to-date trends you're seeing are so good that you just felt like 2%-3 just wasn't even relevant and you had to guide to 3%-4? Sometimes the thought is that the guide is as much as an internal signal as an external signal, sort of a signal to sort of plan conservatively and then just be prepared to chase, keep a lot of open liquidity if opportunities materialize in the quarter.\nJust kind of wondering how you're thinking about guiding and why you decided to go to three to four instead of just sticking to the same old two to three.\n\nMichael Hartshorn\n\nPresident and COO, Ross Stores\n\nJay, it's Michael Hartshorn. It's probably less tricky than you think. It is our internal plan. Currently, coming off a seven comp, that's how the underlying business is planned. We always try to align the internal latest forecast with the plan. There is no change in methodology. It is really how we're planning the business for the fourth quarter based on the momentum in Q3.\n\nJay Sole\n\nManaging Director and Senior Retail Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it. All right, thank you so much.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nJay Sole\n\nManaging Director and Senior Retail Analyst, UBS\n\nOf course.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Jim Conroy for closing remarks.\n\nJim Conroy\n\nCEO, Ross Stores\n\nVery good. Well, thank you, everybody, for your interest in Ross Stores. We wish you all a very happy holiday season. Take care.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time."

[Operator Instructions]\nBefore we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and in the company's fiscal 2024 Form 10-K and fiscal 2025 Form 10-Q and 8-Ks on file with the SEC. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Conroy, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nJames G. Conroy\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Boot Barn Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; [indiscernible], Group Senior Vice President and Deputy Chief Financial Officer, and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations.\nI'd like to begin the call by recognizing the efforts of the entire Ross organization this past quarter. Despite ongoing uncertainty in the external environment, the team's dedication and hard work have been truly commendable. Their commitment has helped us to adapt quickly, execute on our ongoing initiatives and deliver a solid quarter.\nNow let's turn to our second quarter results. As noted in today's press release, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement in sales trends relative to the first quarter. This improvement was broad-based with a positive change in trend in nearly all major merchandise categories and most of the regions across the company. During the second quarter, sales in May were strong and softened in June before rebounding sharply in July. We were pleased to see the improved trend at the end of the quarter particularly with the early sales performance related to the back-to-school selling season, which bodes well for the third quarter. We ended the period with second quarter sales in line with our expectations, while earnings modestly exceeded the high end of our guidance range due to lower-than-expected tariff-related costs.\nOperating margin decreased 95 basis points to 11.5% compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting tariff-related costs. Total sales for the period grew 5% to $5.5 billion, up from $5.3 billion last year, with comparable store sales up 2%. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended August 2, 2025, were $1.56 on net income of $508 million. Included in this year's second quarter earnings is an approximate $0.11 per share negative impact from tariff-related costs. These results compared to $1.59 per share on net earnings of $527 million in last year's second quarter.\nFor the first 6 months, earnings per share were $3.03 on net income of $987 million. These results compare to earnings per share of $3.05 on net earnings of $1 billion for the first half of 2024. Sales for the 2025 year-to-date period grew to $10.5 billion, up from $10.1 billion in the prior year. Comparable sales for the first half of 2025 were up 1%.\nIn the second quarter, cosmetics was the best merchandise area by geographic region, the strongest markets for the Southeast and the Midwest. Overall comp store sales at dd's DISCOUNTS were solid and ahead of Ross, while monthly trends were closely aligned between the 2 trains throughout the quarter. It was encouraging that both chains saw growth in both traffic and basket size with strong momentum exiting the quarter. At quarter end, both total consolidated inventories and average store inventories were up 5% versus last year. Packaway merchandise was 38% of total inventories at quarter end compared to 39% last year. We feel good about our inventory levels and believe we are well positioned for the back half of the year.\nTurning to store growth. In Q2, we opened 28 new Ross and 3 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. These openings reflect our expansion into new and existing markets. New market entries included several stores in the New York Metro area as well as our 3 inaugural stores in Puerto Rico. We remain on track to open a total of approximately 90 new locations this year, comprised of about 80 Ross and 10 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 to 15 older stores.\nBefore I turn the call over to Adam to provide further details on our financial performance and guidance, I wanted to provide an update on tariffs. While tariffs remain at elevated levels, we feel good about the progress the merchants have made to mitigate the impact on margins. The team has worked tirelessly to execute a multipronged approach, including vendor negotiations, diversifying our sourcing mix and adjusting prices strategically.\nAdditionally, we were able to expand the portion of our business driven by closeouts, which further mitigates the impact. Looking ahead, we are confident that we can continue to offset most of the impact of tariffs but we do anticipate modest pressure in the third quarter, which we expect will be further mitigated in the fourth quarter. From a pricing perspective, we are beginning to see higher prices across the retail industry.\nWith this backdrop, we are focused on maintaining our value proposition relative to traditional retailers, while balancing the opportunity to preserve our merchandise margin. Our top priority will always be providing high-quality branded merchandise at outstanding value. The off-price sector has historically benefited from disruptions within the supply chain and the retail industry we believe this time will be no different. I will now turn the call over to Adam to provide further details on our second quarter results and additional color on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2025.\n\nAdam M. Orvos\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. Second quarter operating margin decreased 95 basis points to 11.5% and included an approximate 90 basis point negative impact from tariff-related costs. Cost of goods sold during the period increased by 70 basis points. Distribution costs deleveraged by 55 basis points, primarily from the opening of a new distribution center in the second quarter and tariff-related processing costs. Merchandise margin decreased 3 basis points, which included the impact of tariffs and occupancy deleveraged 10 basis points, partially offsetting these higher costs were lower domestic freight and buying costs of 15 and 10 basis points, respectively.\nFor the period deleveraged by 25 basis points, partly due to CEO transition costs. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $262 million. As a result, we remain on track to buy back a total of $1.05 billion in stock for the year. Now let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2025. As Jim noted in today's press release, given the uncertainty associated with the macroeconomic environment, we will maintain a somewhat cautious approach to planning our business for the balance of the year.\nFor both the third and fourth quarters, we are planning comparable store sales growth of up 2% to 3%. If sales perform in line with this guidance, third quarter earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.31 to $1.37 versus $1.48 last year. and $1.74 to $1.81 for the fourth quarter compared to $1.79 in 2024. These ranges include a negative tariff cost of approximately $0.07 to $0.08 and $0.04 to $0.06 per share in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. These estimates are based on the current level of announced tariffs. If the second half of 2025 performs in line with these projections, Earnings per share for the full year are now forecast to be in the range of $6.08 to $6.21 versus $6.32 last year.\nFor fiscal 2025, we anticipate an approximate $0.22 to $0.25 per share impact from announced trade policies. As a reminder, last year's fourth quarter and fiscal year results included a onetime benefit to earnings equivalent to approximately $0.14 per share related to the sale of a packaway facility. Now let's turn to our guidance assumptions for the third quarter of 2025. Total sales are forecast to increase 5% to 7% versus the prior year. We expect to open 40 stores during the quarter, including 36 Ross and 4 dd's locations.\nOperating margin for the third quarter is planned to be in the 10.1% to 10.5% range which includes a 50 to 60 basis point negative impact from tariff-related costs. Our forecast also reflects unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and continued deleverage from the opening of a new distribution center in the quarter.\nNet interest income is estimated to be approximately $27 million. The tax rate is projected to be about 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $30 million. Now I will turn the call over to Jim for closing comments.\n\nJames G. Conroy\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Boot Barn Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Adam. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement in sales trend relative to the first quarter. particularly the strength of our early back-to-school business in July. We believe pricing will move higher across the entire retail landscape, leading consumers to seek more value this fall season. As such, we are positioning our assortments to deliver high-quality branded merchandise at compelling price points to reinforce our value proposition. We strongly believe this breathens our competitive position to capture market share over the balance of the year. Before we turn to your questions, I would like to take a moment to recognize and thank Adam Orvos for his contributions to Ross.\nAs many of you know, Adam is retiring from Ross at the end of September. His leadership and financial expertise have been instrumental to our success, and we wish him well and this exciting new chapter. We also appreciate Adam working closely with Bill to ensure a smooth transition. At this point, we would like to open the call and respond to any questions that you may have. John?",

Our 2-month overlap was an invaluable transition period for me as I was able to immerse myself in the company. while Barbara led the day-to-day operations of the business.\nI am grateful she will continue to serve as a strategic adviser, and I look forward to building on the foundation that she has created and the company's long history of success.\nNow let's turn to the fourth quarter results. As noted in today's press release, fourth quarter sales and earnings results a high end of our expectations. Sales were driven by our customers' positive responses to the improved assortments of quality branded bargains, coupled with strong execution by the store and supply chain teams during the critical holiday selling season.\nEarnings per share for the 13 weeks ended February 1, 2025, were $1.79 compared with $1.82 per share for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2024. Net income for the period was $587 million versus $610 million last year. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $5.9 billion with a comparable store sales gain of 3% on top of a robust 7% gain in the same period last year.\nFor the 2024 fiscal year, earnings per share were $6.32, up from $5.56 for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2024. Net income for fiscal 2024 rose to $2.1 billion compared to $1.9 billion last year. Total sales for the year increased to $21.1 billion, up from $20.4 billion in the prior year period.\nComparable store sales for the 52 weeks ended February 1, 2025, grew 3% and versus a 5% gain in fiscal 2023. Both the fourth quarter and full year results included a onetime benefit to earnings equivalent to approximately $0.14 per share related to the sale of a packaway facility. Additionally, as a reminder, prior year sales and earnings results for the 2023, fourth quarter and fiscal year included approximately $308 million in sales and a $0.20 earnings per share benefit from the 53rd week. Fourth quarter operating margin of 12.4% was flat to last year as the gain from the sale of the packaway facility was offset by planned declines in merchandise margin and unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs.\nThe sale of the facility contributed about 105 basis points to this year's fourth quarter operating margin, while the 53rd week benefited the prior year's period by about 80 basis points.\nLet's turn now to additional details on our fourth quarter results. For the holiday selling season, cosmetics and children's were the best-performing merchandise areas while geographically, the Pacific Northwest and Texas were the strongest regions. Similar to the prior quarter, DD's discounts posted healthy sales gains as the chain's value and fashion offerings resonated with shoppers. We are especially encouraged by the ongoing improved performance of DVs in our newer markets and expect to begin rebuilding our pipeline there for expanded growth in the near future.\nAt the end of the year, consolidated inventories were up 12%, mainly due to higher planned packaway levels. On an average store basis, inventories were up 2%. Packaway represented 41% of total inventories compared to 40% last year. Regarding our store expansion program. We added 75 new Ross Dress for Less stores and 14 dd's DSICOUNT during the year. Inclusive of 12 closures, we ended the year with 2,186 stores including 1,831 Ross Dress for Less and 355 dd's DISCOUNTS locations.\nAs noted in today's release, during the recently completed fourth quarter, 1.7 million shares were repurchased for a total price of $262 million. For fiscal 2024, a total of 7.3 million shares of common stock were repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of $1.05 billion. These purchases were made pursuant to the 2-year $2.1 billion program announced in March 2024. We expect to complete the $1.05 billion remaining under this authorization in fiscal 2025.\nOur Board also recently approved a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.405 per share to be payable on March 31, 2025, to stockholders of record as of March 18, 2025. We ended the year with $4.7 billion of cash after funding the growth and capital needs of our business. As a result, our ongoing share buyback and increased dividend programs reflect our long-standing commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.\nNow Adam will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and additional color on our outlook for fiscal 2025.\n\nAdam M. Orvos\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. As previously mentioned, comparable store sales rose 3% for the quarter, generated by both higher traffic and average size of the basket. Fourth quarter operating margin of 12.4% and was flat to last year and included a 105 basis point benefit from the facility sale. Cost of goods sold deleveraged by 80 basis points in the quarter.\nMerchandise margin declined by 85 basis points as planned due to the increased mix of quality branded assortments. Occupancy deleveraged by 45 basis points as we anniversaried the extra week last year. Distribution costs were flat as unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs offset improved productivity. Domestic freight leveraged by 30 basis points, while buying improved by 20 basis points, mainly due to lower incentives. SG&A For the period leveraged by 80 basis points, primarily due to the facility sale.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for fiscal 2025, starting with the first quarter. While we were pleased with our 2024 results, including the holiday selling period, sales trends began softening later in January and into February. We believe that a combination of unseasonable weather and heightened volatility in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment has negatively impacted customer traffic. Given the lack of visibility we have on these external factors, we believe it is prudent to take a cautious approach in forecasting our business, especially as we start the year.\nAs a result, we expect comparable store sales for the 13 weeks ending May 3, 2025, to be down 3% to flat and earnings per share of $1.33 to $1.47 versus $1.46 last year. The operating statement assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following: Total sales are planned to be down 1% to up 3% versus last year's first quarter. This same-store sales perform in line with our plan, operating margin for the first quarter is expected to be in the range of 11.4% to 12.1% compared to 12.2% last year.\nThe expected decrease mainly reflects our forecast for sales deleverage and unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs. Merchandise margin is also expected to be down slightly in the first quarter. We plan to add 19 new stores consisting of 16 Ross and 3 dd's DISCOUNTS during the period. Net interest income is estimated to be $35 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are forecast to be about $328 million.\nTurning to our full year guidance assumptions for 2025. For the 52 weeks ending January 31, 2026, and while we hope to do better, we are planning same-store sales to be down 1% to up 2%. Based on these assumptions, fiscal 2025 earnings per share are projected to be $5.95 to $6.55 compared to $6.32 for fiscal 2024. As previously mentioned, last year's results included a per share benefit of $0.14 from the facility sale, Total sales are planned to be up 1% to up 5% for the year. If same-store sales perform in line with our plan, operating margin for the full year is expected to be in the range of $11.5 million to 12.2% compared to 12.2% in 2024, which benefited by 30 basis points from the facility sale.\nExcluding this onetime gain, our operating margin forecast reflects sales deleverage and higher distribution costs as well as lower incentive compensation expenses as we anniversary higher incentive costs in 2024. In addition, we expect merchandise margin to be relatively neutral for fiscal 2025. For 2025, we expect to open approximately 90 new locations comprised of about 80 Ross and 10 DD. These openings do not include our plans to close or relocate about 10 to 15 older stores. Net interest income is estimated to be $127 million. Depreciation and amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization are forecasted to be about $690 million for the year. The tax rate is projected to be about 24% to 25% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are expected to be around $325 million.\nIn addition, capital expenditures for 2025 are planned to be approximately $855 million as we make further investments in our stores, supply chain and merchant processes to support our long-term growth and to increase efficiencies throughout the business. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for closing comments.\n\nJames G. Conroy\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Boot Barn Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Adam. As Adam mentioned, we have seen softer business as we transitioned out of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. While there are always opportunities for us to improve our execution, we believe the softness we are currently seeing is primarily due to macro pressures impacting consumer confidence, resulting in a pullback in discretionary spending. That said, we believe that some of the recent challenges we are seeing could be transitory in nature. Additionally, we anticipate that the volatile external environment will result in more opportunities for closeout merchandise and could set us up well to deliver even greater values on branded goods in future quarters.\nTurning to the broader business. As I reflect on my observations over the past few months, I believe that the brand and merchandising strategies that we have in place for both Ross and dd's are the right ones, and I do not foresee making significant changes to those strategies in the near future. In addition, we have a flexible business model that positions us well to navigate through the current uncertainty, and we will continue to focus on the strong execution of our key initiatives.\nIn closing, I would like to thank the more than 100,000 associates throughout the company for their hard work and dedication and for delivering such solid fourth quarter and annual results in 2024.\nAt this point, we would like to open the call and respond to any questions that you may have.",

The call will begin with prepared comments by management followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\nBefore we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2023 form 10-K and fiscal 2024 Form 8-Ks on file with the SEC.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nBarbara Rentler\n\nVice Chairman & CEO\n\nGood afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations.\nWe'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter 2024 results, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, though we had hoped to do better, first quarter sales were still in line with our guidance despite macroeconomic headwinds that continue to pressure our customers' discretionary spending. Earnings results for the period were better than expected, primarily due to lower expenses relative to our plan. Total sales grew 8% to $4.9 billion, up from $4.5 billion last year, while comparable store sales rose 3%. Earnings per share were $1.46 or net earnings of $488 million for the 13 weeks ended May 4, 2024. These results compare to earnings per share of $1.09 and on net income of $371 million for the 13 weeks ended April 29, 2023.\nAccessories and children were the strongest merchandise areas during the quarter for California and the Pac Northwest for the top performing regions. Dd's DISCOUNT sales trends in the first quarter were ahead of frost as shoppers has [ responded ] favorably to its improved value offering. In the newer markets, we are in the process of updating the assortment to better address the different tastes and preferences of this diverse customer base. We will continue to make ongoing adjustments over time to better position dd's for the future.\nAt quarter end, total consolidated inventories were up 10% versus last year, while average store inventories were up 4% at the end of the quarter due to the 53rd week calendar shift. Packaway merchandise represented 41% of total inventories versus 42% last year.\nTurning to store growth. We opened 11 new Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNT locations in the first quarter. We continue to plan for approximately 90 new stores this year, comprised of about 75 Ross and 15 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 to 15 older stores.\nNow Adam will provide further details on our first quarter results and additional color on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024.\n\nAdam M. Orvos\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales were up 3% for the quarter, primarily driven by an increase in traffic. First quarter operating margin of 12.2% was up 205 basis points from 10.1% in 2023. This improvement was due to lower distribution, incentive and freight costs that were partially offset by the planned merchandise margin decline. Cost of goods sold during the period improved by 140 basis points. Distribution costs levered by 75 basis points while buying improved by 50 basis points. Domestic freight improved by 30 basis points and merchandise margin declined by 15 basis points as pressure from offering more sharply priced brands was partially offset by lower ocean freight costs. SG&A for the period levered by 65 basis points, mainly due to higher sales. In addition, SG&A benefited from lower incentives versus last year when we significantly outperformed our plans.\nDuring the first quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $262 million under the new 2-year $2.1 billion authorization approved by our Board of Directors in March of this year. We remain on track to buy back a total of $1.05 billion in stock during 2024.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2024. Ongoing uncertainty in today's macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, including prolonged inflation continue to squeeze our low to moderate income customers purchasing power. As a result, we will remain especially focused on delivering a wide assortment of branded values throughout our stores. For the 13 weeks ending August 3, 2024, comparable sales are forecast to be up 2% to 3%. Second quarter 2024 earnings per share are projected to be $1.43 to $1.49 versus $1.32 for the 13 weeks ended July 23, 2023.\nOur guidance assumptions for the second quarter of 2024 include the following: Total sales are forecast to increase 5% to 7% versus the prior year. We expect to open 24 locations in the second quarter, including 21 Ross and 3 dd's locations. If same-store sales perform in line with our forecast, Operating margin for the second quarter is projected to be in the 11.5% to 11.8% range compared to 11.3% in 2023. Higher sales and lower incentive and distribution costs are expected to be partially offset by a decline in merchandise margin as we build on our efforts to offer more sharply priced brands. We expect net interest income to be approximately $37 million. The tax rate is projected to be about 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $332 million.\nNow turning to the full year. Based on our first quarter results and forward guidance, comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2025, remain unchanged at up 2% to 3%. We now project earnings per share for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2025, to be in the range of $5.79 to $5.98 compared to $5.56 for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2024. This guidance range includes an approximate $0.02 per share favorable impact from the timing of expenses that benefited the first quarter. As a reminder, fiscal 2023 earnings per share included a benefit of approximately $0.20 from the 53rd week.\nNow I will turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments.\n\nBarbara Rentler\n\nVice Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Adam. While overall sales were respectable in the first quarter, there remains uncertainty in the external environment, including prolonged inflation that continue to pressure discretionary spending from our low to moderate income customers. As a result, it's more important than ever that we remain focused on delivering the best branded values that we can possibly offer. In addition, we'll continue to manage inventory expenses tightly in order to maximize sales and earnings growth over the balance of the year. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.",

Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2023 performance followed by our outlook for 2024. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.\nAs noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our fourth quarter sales and earnings results that were well ahead of our expectations. Our above plan sales were driven by our customers' positive response to the improved assortments of quality branded bargains throughout our stores. Earnings per share for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2024, were $1.82, up from $1.31 per share for the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2023. Net income for the period rose to $610 million versus $447 million last year.\nSales for the fourth quarter of 2023 grew to $6 billion, driven by robust comparable store sales gain of 7%. For the 2023 fiscal year, earnings per share were $5.56, up from $4.38 for the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2023. Net income for the fiscal 2023 was $1.9 billion compared to $1.5 billion last year.\nTotal sales for the year increased to $20.4 billion, up from $18.7 billion in the prior year period. Comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ended January 27, 2024, grew a solid 5%. As noted in our press release, the sales results for both the 2023 fourth quarter and fiscal year included a $308 million benefit from the 53rd week. Earnings per share for both periods also benefited from the extra week by approximately $0.20 per share. Fourth quarter operating margin grew 165 basis points to 12.4%, up from 10.7% in 2022. This improvement was mainly due to the strong gains in same-store sales and lower freight costs that were partially offset by higher. The 53rd week also benefited operating margin by 80 basis points.\nNow let's turn to additional details on our fourth quarter results. For the holiday selling season, cosmetics, home and children were the best-performing merchandise areas, while geographic results were broad-based. Dd's discount sales trends slightly trailed Ross' growth. While dd's top line results were respectable in fiscal 2023, we are disappointed with the performance in newer markets.\nWe are currently conducting an in-depth analysis of dd's to better understand and address the different wants and needs of their diverse customer base, particularly as we expand outside our current existing geographies. Until this work is completed, we believe it is wise over the near term to moderate dd's store growth in newer markets and focus new store openings, primarily in existing regions.\nNow let's turn to inventory. As we ended the quarter and the year, consolidated inventories were up 8%. Average store inventories were up 9% compared to 2022's holiday period due primarily to the 53rd week shift. Packaway represented 40% of total inventories similar to last year. Regarding our store expansion program, we added 94 net new stores in 2023, including 71 Ross Stores Ross Dress for Less and 23 dd's DISCOUNTS. We ended 2023 and with 2,109 stores, including 1,764 Ross Dress for Less and 345 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As we noted in today's release, for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2023, we repurchased a total of 1.9 million and 8.2 million shares of common stock, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $247 million in the quarter and $950 million for the fiscal year. These purchases were made pursuant to the 2-year $1.9 billion program announced in March 2022, which we have now completed as planned.\nOur Board of Directors also recently approved a new 2-year $2.1 billion stock repurchase authorization or approximately $1.05 billion for each fiscal year. This new plan represents an 11% increase over the recently completed repurchase program. In addition, the Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.3675 per share to be payable on March 29, 2024, to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2024. The increases to our stock repurchase and dividend programs reflect our continued commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns, given the strength of our balance sheet and our ongoing ability to generate significant amounts of cash after funding growth and other capital needs of business.\nNow Adam will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and additional color on our outlook for fiscal 2024.\n\nAdam M. Orvos\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, comparable store sales rose a strong 7% for the quarter, entirely driven by higher traffic and shoppers positive response to our improved assortments throughout our stores.\nAs Barbara noted earlier, fourth quarter operating margin of 12.4% was up 165 basis points from 10.7% in 2022 and included about an 80 basis point benefit from the 53rd week in 2023. Cost of goods sold as a percent of sales improved by 265 basis points versus last year, benefiting from a combination of factors.\nMerchandise gross margin increased by 110 basis points, primarily due to lower ocean freight costs. Distribution costs declined by 75 basis points partially driven by favorable timing of packaway-related costs. Domestic freight and occupancy costs levered by 75 and 45 basis points, respectively. Partially offsetting these benefits were buying costs that increased 40 basis points, mainly from higher incentives. SG&A for the period delevered by 100 basis points, mostly driven by higher incentive costs and wages.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for fiscal 2024. As mentioned in our press release, we are encouraged by the sustained sales momentum that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through the holiday season. That said, there remains ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments. In addition, while inflation has moderated, prices for necessities like housing, food and gasoline remain elevated and continue to pressure the low to moderate income customers discretionary spend. While we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to continue to take a conservative approach to forecasting our business in 2024. For the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2025, we are planning operable store sales to increase 2% to 3% on top of a solid 5% gain in 2023. If sales perform in line with this plan, we expect earnings per share for 2024 to be in the range of $5.64 to $5.89 compared to $5.56 in fiscal 2023. As a reminder, fiscal 2024 is a 52-week year compared to 53 weeks in 2023. As previously mentioned, our 2023 earnings per share benefited from an additional $0.20 of EPS from the extra week.\nTurning to our guidance assumptions for the 2024 year. Total sales are planned to grow by 2% to 4% for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2025, versus the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2024. This year-over-year increase in total revenue is affected by last year's 53rd week, which added approximately $308 million to sales in the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2023. If same-store sales performed in line with our plan. Operating margin for the full year is expected to be in the range of 11.2% to 11.5% compared to 11.3% last year, which benefited by 25 basis points from the 53rd week. This year-over-year change also includes the benefit of anniversarying higher incentive costs in 2023, given our outperformance. In addition, for fiscal 2024, we expect merchandise margins to be pressured as we plan to offer even more brands that are sharply priced to deliver the strong value proposition that our customers expect from us. For 2024, we expect to open approximately 90 new locations, comprised of about 75 Ross and 15 dd's DISCOUNTS. These openings do not include our plans to close or relocate about 10 to 15 older stores.\nNet interest income is estimated to be $143 million. Depreciation amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $610 million for the year. The tax rate is projected to be about 24% to 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $332 million. In addition, capital expenditures for 2024 are planned to be approximately $840 million as we make further investments in our stores, supply chain and merchant processes to support our long-term growth and to increase efficiencies throughout the business.\nLet's turn now to our guidance for the first quarter. We are planning comparable store sales for the 13 weeks ending May 4, 2024, to be up 2% to 3% versus a 1% gain in last year's first quarter. If sales perform in line with this range, we expect earnings per share for the first quarter of 2024 to be $1.29 to $1.35 versus $1.09 last year. The operating statement assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following: Total sales are planned to be up 6% to 8% versus last year's first quarter. We would then expect first quarter operating margin to be 11.1% to 11.4% compared to 10.1% last year. The expected increase mainly reflects our forecast for lower incentives and freight costs that are partially offset by lower merchandise margin and higher wages. We plan to add 18 new stores consisting of 11 Ross and dd's DISCOUNTS during the period. Net interest income is estimated to be $44 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25% and diluted shares are forecasted to be about $335 million.\nNow I'll turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments.\n\nBarbara Rentler\n\nVice Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Adam. To sum up, as Adam noted, while we hope to do better than forecast this year, the external environment remains uncertain and our low to moderate income customers' discretionary spend continues to be impacted by elevated cost of living. Despite these headwinds last year, our shoppers responded positively to the strong values we offered across our stores which drove our better-than-expected sales and earnings growth throughout 2023.\nIn 2024, we plan to build upon these efforts and offer even more brands that are sharply priced to deliver the strong value proposition that our customers expect from us. We believe the diligent execution of this plan will result in increased market share gains this year and in the future. At this point, we'd like to open the call and respond to any questions you may have.",

We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance followed by an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.\nAs noted in today's press release, we are pleased that both sales and earnings outperformed our expectations for the quarter as customers responded favorably to the terrific values we offer throughout our stores. Operating margin for the period was 11.2%, up from 9.8% last year. Leverage from the same-store sales gain and lower freight costs were partially offset by higher incentives and store wages. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, were $1.33 compared to earnings per share of $1 last year. Net income for the period rose to $447 million versus $342 million in the prior year period. Total sales for the quarter were $4.9 billion, up from $4.6 billion last year, with the comparable store sales gain of 5%.\nFor the first 9 months, earnings per share were $3.74 on net earnings of $1.3 billion compared to $3.08 per share on net income of $1.1 billion for the same period last year. Sales for the year-to-date period grew to $14.4 billion with comparable store sales up 4% over last year. For the third quarter at Ross, cosmetic, accessories and shoes were again the strongest performing businesses, while geographic results were broad-based.\nLike Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS shoppers also responded favorably to its strong value offerings, driving improved sales trends during the quarter. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were up 5% versus last year, while average store inventories were up 2%. Packaway merchandise represented 39% of total inventories versus 41% in the same period of the prior year. During the third quarter, we also completed our expansion program for 2023 with the addition of 43 new Ross and [ 8 ] dd's discounts. Over the year, we added a total of 97 locations comprised of 72 Ross and dd's. We now expect to end the year with 1,764 Ross stores and 345 dd's DISCOUNTS for a net increase of 94 stores.\nNow Adam will provide further details on our third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance.\n\nAdam M. Orvos\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Barbara. As previously stated, comparable store sales rose 5% in the quarter, primarily driven by higher traffic. Operating margin increased 135 basis points to 11.2%. Cost of goods sold improved by 260 basis points in the quarter. Merchandise margin was the main driver with a 235 basis point increase, primarily from lower ocean freight costs. Distribution expenses improved by 45 basis points, mainly due to favorable timing of packaway-related costs. Domestic freight and occupancy levered by 40 and 25 basis points, respectively. Partially offsetting these benefits were higher buying costs that increased 85 basis points, mainly from higher incentives.\nSG&A costs for the period increased by 125 basis points, primarily driven by higher incentive costs and store wages. During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $239 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $950 million in stock for the year. Now let's discuss our fourth quarter guidance. We continue to face macroeconomic volatility, persistent inflation and more recently, geopolitical uncertainty.\nIn addition, we are up against our most difficult quarterly sales comparisons versus 2022 in the fourth quarter. As a result and while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain a cautious approach in forecasting our business and are reiterating our prior sales guidance for the fourth quarter. For the 13 weeks ending January 27, 2024, we continue to plan same-store sales to be up 1% to 2%. Earnings per share for the 14 weeks ending February 3, 2024, are projected to be in the range of $1.56 to $1.62 compared to $1.31 in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nThis guidance range includes an approximate $0.02 per share unfavorable impact from the timing of expenses that benefited the third quarter. Based on our year-to-date results and our fourth quarter forecast, earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2024, are now expected to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.36 versus $4.38 last year. Incorporated in this guidance for both the fourth quarter and full year is an estimated earnings per share benefit of $0.16 from the 53rd week in fiscal 2023.\nThe operating statement assumptions that support our fourth quarter guidance include the following: Total sales are projected to grow 8% to 10%, including an estimated $260 million benefit from the 53rd week. We expect operating margin to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.5% versus 10.7% last year. This range includes a 65 basis point benefit from the extra week. We are planning for higher merchandise margins, given lower ocean freight cost, though moderating from the improvement earlier this year. In addition, lower domestic freight and distribution costs, partially due to favorable packaway timing are expected to benefit margin.\nPartially offsetting these lower costs are forecast for higher incentive compensation. Net interest income is estimated to be about $45 million as we continue to benefit from higher interest rates on our cash balance. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% to 24%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about $335 million. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.\n\nBarbara Rentler\n\nVice Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Adam. Looking ahead, despite all the challenges in the external environment, we are encouraged by our healthy above-plan results to date this year. We also remain confident in the resilience of the off-price sector and our ability to operate successfully within it, especially given consumers' heightened focus on value and convenience. As a result, we remain optimistic about the company's future prospects and our ability to expand market share and profitability over time. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have. .",

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and in the company's fiscal 2022 Form 10-K and fiscal 2023 Form 10-Q and 8-Ks on file with the SEC. And now I would like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nBarbara Rentler\n\nVice Chairman & CEO\n\nGood afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter 2023 performance, followed by our updated outlook for the second half and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our second quarter results with both sales and earnings well above our expectations. Along with easing inflationary pressures, customers responded well to our improved value offerings throughout our stores. Total sales for the period were $4.9 billion, up from $4.6 billion last year, while comparable store sales rose 5%.\nEarnings per share for the 13 weeks ended July 29, 2023, were $1.32 on net income of $446 million. These results compared to $1.11 per share on net earnings of $385 million in the prior year's second quarter. For the first 6 months, earnings per share were $2.41 on net income of $818 million. These results compared to earnings per share of $2.08 on net earnings of $723 million in the first half of 2022. Sales to 2023 year-to-date period were $9.4 billion, with comparable sales up 3% versus a 7% decline in the first half of last year. Cosmetics and accessories were the strongest merchandise areas during the quarter, while performance across geographic areas was broad-based. Similar to Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS performance also improved due to better merchandise assortments and the aforementioned moderating inflation. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were down 15% and versus last year, while average store inventories were up 4%.\nPackaway merchandise represented 38% of total inventory versus 41% in the same period of the prior year. Turning to store growth. We opened 18 new Ross and 9 dd's DISCOUNT locations in the second quarter. We remain on track to open a total of approximately 100 locations this year comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores. Now Adam will provide further details on our second quarter results and additional color on our updated outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2023.\n\nAdam M. Orvos\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales were up 5% for the quarter, driven by higher traffic. Second quarter operating margin was flat compared to last year at 11.3%. Cost of goods sold during the period improved by 185 basis points. Merchandise margin increased 200 basis points, primarily due to lower ocean freight costs. Domestic freight declined 60 basis points while occupancy and distribution costs improved by 20 and 5 basis points, respectively. Partially offsetting these benefits were buying expenses that delevered by 100 basis points mainly due to higher incentives. SG&A for the period increased 180 basis points as higher incentive costs and store wages more than offset the leverage from higher sales. During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $230 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $950 million in stock for the year.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2023. As Barbara noted in today's press release, despite the recent moderation in inflation, our low to moderate income customer continues to face persistently higher costs on necessities. As a result, we believe it is prudent to continue to plan the business cautiously. However, given our improved second quarter performance, we are raising our second half sales and earnings outlook. We are now planning comparable store sales for the third and fourth quarters of 2023 to be up 2% to 3% and 1% to 2%, respectively. As noted in our press release, if the second half performs in line with these updated sales assumptions, earnings per share for the third quarter is projected to be $1.16 to $1.21 versus $1 last year, and $1.58 to $1.64 for the fourth quarter compared to $1.31 in 2022.\nBased on our first half results and second half guidance, earnings per share for fiscal year 2023 are now planned to be in the range of $5.15 to $5.26 versus $4.38 last year. Incorporated in this updated guidance range is an estimated benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.16 from the 53rd week in fiscal 2020 rate. Now let's turn to our guidance assumptions for the third quarter of 2023. Total sales are forecast to increase 4% to 6% versus the prior year. We expect to open 51 stores during the quarter, including 43 Ross and 8 dd's locations. Operating margin for the third quarter is planned to be in the 10.3% to 10.5% range versus 9.8% in 2022 as the benefit from lower ocean and domestic freight costs more than offset an increase in other expenses, primarily related to incentive compensation and store wages. Net interest income is estimated to be approximately $34 million versus $2.8 million last year as we continue to benefit from higher interest rates on our cash balance. The tax rate is projected to be about 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $337 million. Now I will turn the call over to Barbara for closing comments.\n\nBarbara Rentler\n\nVice Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Adam. While we are pleased with our above-plan results in the second quarter, the macroeconomic, geopolitical and retail environments remain uncertain. Moving forward, we remain keenly focused on delivering the most compelling bargains possible as our customer is more motivated than ever. to seek the best branded value as prolonged inflation remains an issue. We will also carefully manage our expenses and inventory to maximize our potential for both sales and earnings growth. Longer term, we believe the rigorous execution of our off-price business model will allow us to consistently deliver solid results. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. .",

Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.\nAs noted in today's press release, despite continued inflationary pressures impacting our low to moderate income customers, first quarter sales were relatively in line with our expectations. Total sales of $4.5 billion, up from $4.3 billion last year, while comparable store sales rose 1%. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended April 29, 2023, are $1.09 on net income of $371 million. These results compare to $0.97 per share on net earnings of $338 million for the 13 weeks ended April 30, 2022.\nCosmetics and accessories were the strongest merchandise areas during the quarter, while the Midwest was the top-performing region. dd's DISCOUNTS performance in the first quarter continued to trail Ross reflecting the aforementioned inflationary pressures that continues to have a larger impact on our lower income households. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were down 16% versus last year. Average store inventories were up 2% at the end of the quarter.\nPackaway merchandise represented 42% of total inventories versus 43% last year.\nTurning to store growth. We opened 11 new Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the first quarter. We continue to plan for approximately 100 new stores this year comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores. Now, Adam will provide further details on our first quarter results and additional color on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2023.\n\nAdam M. Orvos\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales were up 1% for the quarter, driven by an increase in transactions. First quarter operating margin of 10.1% was down from 10.8% in 2022. As expected, this decline primarily reflects higher incentive compensation versus last year when we underperformed our expectations.\nCost of goods sold improved by 50 basis points due to a combination of factors. Merchandise margin was up 120 basis points, primarily due to lower ocean freight costs, while domestic freight costs declined by 60 basis points.\nPartially offsetting these 2 favorable items were higher distribution expenses of 65 basis points, driven primarily by unfavorable packaway-related costs and deleverage from the opening of our Houston distribution center. Buying increased by 60 basis points due to higher incentive compensation and occupancy deleveraged 5 basis points.\nSG&A for the period rose 115 basis points, mainly due to higher incentive compensation and store wages versus last year. During the first quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $234 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $950 million in stock for the year.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2023. For the 13 weeks ending July 29, 2023, comparable sales are forecast to be relatively flat. Second quarter 2023 earnings per share are projected to be $1.07 to $1.14 versus $1.11 for the 13 weeks ended July 30, 2022. Our guidance assumptions for the second quarter of 2023 include the following: total sales are forecast to increase 1% to 4% versus the prior year. We plan to open 27 locations in the second quarter, including 18 Ross and 9 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. Operating margin for the second quarter is planned to be in the 9.8% to 10.1% range, down from 11.3% in 2022 as higher merchandise margin from lower ocean freight cost is forecast to be offset by an increase in expenses, primarily related to incentive compensation and store wages.\nWe expect net interest income to be approximately $31 million. The tax rate is projected to be about 25%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 339 million.\nNow turning to the full year. Based on our first quarter results and guidance for the second quarter, comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ending January 27, 2024, are still planned to be relatively flat. We now project earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2024, to be $4.77 to $4.99 compared to $4.38 for the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2023. This guidance includes an estimated benefit to full year 2023 earnings per share of approximately $0.15 from the 53rd week. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments.\n\nBarbara Rentler\n\nVice Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Adam. As noted on our last earnings call, we had expected fiscal 2023 to be another challenging year. This was especially true given the continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic, geopolitical and retail environment. As a result of today's uncertain external landscape, especially the prolonged inflationary pressures negatively impacting our customers' discretionary spend, shoppers are seeking even stronger values when visiting our stores.\nIn response, we remain focused on delivering the most compelling bargains possible while diligently managing expenses and inventory to maximize our opportunities for growth. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.",

Chief Executive Officer.\n\nBarbara Rentler\n\nVice Chairman & CEO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nJoining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2022 performance, followed by our outlook for 2023. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.\nAs noted in today's press release, during a very competitive holiday season, our fourth quarter sales and earnings results exceeded our guidance due to customers' positive response to our improved assortment and stronger value offerings. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.31 on net income of $447 million. These results compare to earnings per share of $1.04 on net earnings of $367 million for the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2022. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $5.2 billion with comparable store sales up 1% on top of a 9% increase for the same period in 2021.\nFor the 2022 fiscal year, earnings per share were $4.38 on net income of $1.5 billion compared to $4.87 per share on net earnings of $1.7 billion in 2021. Sales for 2022 were $18.7 billion, with comparable store sales down 4% versus a robust 13% increase in the prior year. Fourth quarter operating margin was 10.7% compared to 9.8% in 2021. This improvement was mainly driven by lower freight and incentive costs that were partially offset by unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses.\nNow let's turn to additional details on our fourth quarter results. For the holiday selling season, shoes was the best-performing merchandise area, while Florida was the strongest region. Similar to Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS sales trends improved compared to the prior quarter but continue to trail Ross' results primarily due to ongoing inflationary pressures that are continuing to have a larger impact on dd's lower-income customers. Inventory levels moderated significantly from the first half of 2022 with consolidated inventories down 11% versus last year. Average store inventories during the quarter were down slightly compared to 2021 holiday period, while packaway merchandise represented 40% of total inventories similar to last year. We also believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the numerous buying opportunities in the marketplace.\nAs noted in today's release, the company repurchased a total of 2.1 million and 10.3 million shares of common stock, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $231 million in the quarter and $950 million for the fiscal year. These purchases were made pursuant to the 2-year $1.9 billion program announced in March of 2022. We expect to complete the $950 million remaining under this authorization in fiscal 2023. Our Board also recently increased our quarterly cash dividend by 8% and to $0.335 per share to be payable on March 31, 2023, to stockholders of record as of March 14, 2023. Our stock repurchase and increased dividend program reflects our continued commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns as well as our confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and projected future cash flows.\nNow Adam will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and additional color on our outlook for fiscal 2023.\n\nAdam M. Orvos\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, comparable store sales rose 1% for the quarter on top of a 9% gain in the prior year. This slight increase was due to growth in the size of the average basket as traffic was relatively flat compared to last year. As Barbara discussed earlier, fourth quarter operating margin of 10.7% was up 90 basis points from 9.8% in 2021. Cost of goods sold grew 15 basis points versus last year due to a combination of factors. Distribution expenses rose 90 basis points primarily due to timing of packaway-related costs and deleverage from the opening of our Houston distribution center earlier in the year, while domestic freight and occupancy delevered by 20 and 5 basis points, respectively. Partially offsetting these costs was higher merchandise margin, which grew by 15 basis points as the benefit from lower ocean freight costs more than offset somewhat higher markdowns. Buying expenses also improved by 85 basis points due to lower incentive compensation. SG&A for the period levered by 105 basis points, again, primarily due to lower incentive expense.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for fiscal 2023. As Barbara noted in our press release, the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments remain highly uncertain. As a result, we believe it is prudent to remain conservative when planning our business. While we hope to do better for the 52 weeks ending January 27, 2024, we are planning comparable store sales to be relatively flat. If sales perform in line with this plan, we expect earnings per share for 2023 to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.95 compared to $4.38 in fiscal 2022. It is important to note that fiscal 2023 is a 53-week year. Incorporated in this guidance range is an estimated benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.15 from the extra week.\nOur guidance assumptions for the 2023 year include the following: Total sales are planned to grow by 2% to 5% for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2024. Comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ending January 27, 2024, are planned to be relatively flat. Based on these sales plans, Operating margin for the full year is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 10.7%. This reflects the resetting of the baseline for incentive compensation, higher wages, the deleveraging effect on flattish same-store sales and lower freight costs. Also incorporated in this operating margin guidance is an estimated benefit of about 20 basis points from the 53rd week.\nFor 2023, we expect to open approximately 100 new locations comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd's DISCOUNTS. As usual, these openings do not include our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. Net interest income is estimated to be $115 million. Depreciation and amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $570 million for the year. The tax rate is projected to be about 24% to 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 339 million. In addition, capital expenditures for 2023 are planned to be approximately $810 million as we make further investments in our stores, supply chain and merchant processes to support our long-term growth and to increase efficiencies throughout the business.\nLet's turn now to our guidance for the first quarter. Elevated inflation continues to impact our low to moderate income customer. As such, we are also planning comparable store sales to be relatively flat for the 13 weeks ending April 29, 2023. This compares to a 7% decrease and a 13% gain in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. If sales perform in line with this plan, we expect earnings per share for the first quarter of 2023 to be $0.99 to $1.05 versus $0.97 last year. The operating statement assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following: Total sales are planned to be up 1% to 4% versus last year's first quarter. We would then expect first quarter operating margin to be 9.6% to 9.9% compared to 10.8% last year. The expected decline reflects the deleveraging effect if same-store sales perform in line with our plan, unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and higher wages. Further, merchandise margin is forecast to benefit from lower freight costs. We plan to add 19 new stores consisting of 11 Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS during the period. Net interest income is estimated to be $28 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25% and diluted shares are forecast to be about 341 million.\nNow I will turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments.\n\nBarbara Rentler\n\nVice Chairman & CEO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Adam. To sum up, over the past 3 years, we have faced a wide range of unprecedented challenges from the COVID pandemic, supply chain disruptions as well as ongoing inflationary headwinds. These factors have not only negatively impacted our own business, but also our customers' household budgets, their discretionary income and their shopping behaviors. As a result, our shoppers today are seeking even stronger values when visiting our stores. In response, our merchants are fine-tuning our assortments with an increased focus on delivering the most competitive bargains available while continuing to adjust our product mix based on our customers' evolving preferences. Looking ahead, we have significantly increased our focus on strictly controlling inventory and operating expenses throughout the company. We strongly believe that these measures will enable us to maximize our potential for both sales and profit growth in 2023 and beyond.\nAt this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.",

(Operator Instructions)\nBefore we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business.\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2021 Form 10-K and fiscal 2022 Form 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, ma'am. Please go ahead.\n\nBarbara Rentler\n\nVice Chairman & CEO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance, followed by an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.\nAs noted in today's press release, third quarter results were above our expectations as we delivered stronger values throughout our stores. Operating margin for the period was 9.8% versus 11.4% last year, reflecting the deleveraging effect from the comparable sales decline as well as pressure from higher markdowns and unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs.\nEarnings per share for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2022, were $1.00 on net income of $342 million. This compares to $1.09 per share or net earnings of $385 million for the 13 weeks ended October 30, 2021. Total sales for the quarter were $4.6 billion, in line with the prior year, with comparable sales down 3% on top of a robust 14% gain in the third quarter of 2021.\nFor the first 9 months, earnings per share were $3.08 on net earnings of $1.1 billion compared to $3.82 per share on net income of $1.4 billion for the same period in 2021. Sales for the year-to-date period totaled $13.5 billion with comparable store sales down 5% versus a strong 14% increase last year.\nFor the third quarter at Ross, shoes was the best-performing business, while Florida and Texas were the top-performing regions as they were bolstered by the outperformance of border and tourist locations.\nAt dd's DISCOUNTS, sales trends improved versus the first half, but continued to trail Ross' results due to ongoing inflationary pressures that are having a larger impact on dd's lower-income customers.\nInventory levels moderated significantly from the first half of the year, with total consolidated inventories at the end of the quarter up 12% compared to last year.\nAverage store inventories during the quarter were up 4% versus 2021 and down compared to pre-pandemic levels. Packaway merchandise represented 41% of the total compared to 31% last year when we used packaway merchandise to fuel robust sales gains.\nTurning to store growth. We completed our expansion program for 2022 with the addition of 28 new Ross and 12 dd's DISCOUNTS in the third quarter. For the year, we added a total of 99 locations comprised of 71 Ross and 28 dd's DISCOUNTS. We now expect to end the year with 1,693 Ross stores and 322 dd's DISCOUNTS locations for a net increase of 92 stores.\nNow Adam will provide further details on our third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance.\n\nAdam M. Orvos\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Barbara. As previously stated, comparable store sales were down 3% in the quarter. Although traffic improved from the second quarter, it still declined versus the prior year. Partially offsetting these declines was a higher average basket size.\nOperating margin of 9.8% for the third quarter was down 160 basis points from last year. Cost of goods sold grew by 230 basis points in the quarter. Merchandise margin declined 165 basis points, primarily due to higher markdowns.\nDistribution costs were up 140 basis points, mainly due to unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and deleverage from our new distribution center, while occupancy delevered by 20 basis points. These higher expenses were partially offset by a 75 basis point decrease in buying costs, mainly from lower incentives.\nLastly, pressure from domestic freight expenses eased in the third quarter and improved 20 basis points as we anniversaried the freight headwinds that began in the second half of last year.\nSG&A for the period improved by 70 basis points as deleverage from the negative comparable sales was more than offset by lower incentives. During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $244 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $950 million in stock for the year.\nNow let's discuss our fourth quarter guidance. We continue to expect a very promotional holiday selling season and ongoing inflationary headwinds to pressure our low- to moderate-income customers. That said, we face our easiest sales and earnings comparisons in the fourth quarter and are raising our guidance given our third quarter sales momentum and improved holiday assortments.\nFor the 13 weeks ending January 28, 2023, we now expect comparable store sales to be flat to down 2% on top of a 9% gain in the prior year. As a result, earnings per share are forecasted to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.26. The operating statement assumptions that support our fourth quarter guidance include the following. Total sales are projected to be flat to up 3%. We expect operating margin to be in the range of 9.7% to 10.5% versus 9.8% last year.\nThis mainly reflects the anniversarying of significant cost pressures from ocean freight and lower incentives, partially offset by the deleveraging effect from lower same-store sales, unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and higher markdowns.\nNet interest income is estimated to be about $14 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. And weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 342 million. Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter guidance, earnings per share for fiscal 2022 are now projected to be in the range of $4.21 to $4.34 compared to $4.87 last year.\nNow I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.\n\nBarbara Rentler\n\nVice Chairman & CEO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Adam. Despite the many challenges over the last few years, coupled with today's uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, we remain optimistic about our future growth prospects. Our top priority is and always will be delivering fresh and exciting named brand merchandise at compelling discounts every day in our growing store base of over 2,000 locations.\nWith consumers' heightened focus on value and convenience, this bodes well for our ability to expand our market share and profitability in the future. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.",

The call will begin with prepared comments by management, followed by a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)\nBefore we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business.\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the Company's fiscal 2021 Form 10-K and fiscal 2022 Form 10-Q and 8-Ks on file with the SEC. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nBarbara Rentler\n\nVice Chairman & CEO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations.\nWe'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter 2022 performance, followed by our updated outlook for the second half and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.\nAs noted in today's press release, we are disappointed with our sales results, which were impacted by the mounting inflationary pressures our customers faced as well as an increasingly promotional retail environment. Earnings came in above our guidance range, primarily due to lower incentive costs resulting from the below-plan top line performance.\nTotal sales for the period were $4.6 billion versus $4.8 billion in the prior year period. Comparable store sales were down 7% compared to a robust 15% increase in last year's second quarter, which was our strongest period of 2021. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended July 30, 2022, were $1.11 on net income of $385 million. These results compared to $1.39 per share on net earnings of $494 million for last year's second quarter.\nFor the first 6 months, earnings per share were $2.08 on net income of $723 million. These results compared to earnings per share of $2.73 on net earnings of $971 million in the first half of 2021.\nSales for the 2022 year-to-date period were $8.9 billion with comparable sales down 7% versus a strong 14% gain in the first half of 2021. Shoes and Men's were the strongest merchandise areas during the quarter, while Florida and Texas were the top-performing regions, mainly due to the outperformance of our border and tourist locations. We are making merchandising adjustments to meet changing customer demand. That said, the actions we have taken thus far were unable to offset the mounting financial pressures on our low- to moderate-income consumers and the impact on our business from an increasingly promotional retail environment.\nSimilar to the first quarter, dd's DISCOUNTS performance in the second quarter continued to be well below Ross's, mainly due to today's escalating inflationary pressures that are having a larger impact on dd's lower-income customers. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were up 55% versus the same period in 2021. While average store inventory during the quarter were up 15% versus last year, we operated with very similar levels when compared to pre-pandemic.\nPackaway merchandise represented 41% of total inventory versus 30% in the same period of the prior year when we used a substantial amount of packaways\\\\ to meet robust consumer demand. Additionally, supply chain congestion continued to ease during the second quarter, resulting in above-plan early receipts of merchandise that we stored in packaway and will flow to stores throughout the fall season. Looking ahead, we expect these early receipts to wane and to have the appropriate inventory levels in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to store growth. Our 2022 expansion program is on schedule with the addition of 21 new Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the second quarter. We remain on track to open a total of approximately 100 locations this year comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores. Now Adam will provide further details on our second quarter results and additional color on our updated outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022.\n\nAdam M. Orvos\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales were down 7% for the quarter as a decline in the number of transactions versus the prior year was partially offset by an increase in the size of the average basket. Second quarter operating margin was 11.3% compared to 14.1% in 2021. This decline was due to a combination of deleveraging effect on expenses from the decrease in same-store sales, higher markdowns and ongoing headwinds from higher freight costs that did not begin to escalate until the second half of 2021.\nThese expense pressures were partially offset by lower incentive costs that were much higher last year when we significantly outperformed our plans. We also saw a decline in COVID expenses versus last year's second quarter. Cost of goods sold during the period increased by 320 basis points. Merchandise margin declined 205 basis points due to both higher ocean freight costs and markdowns. Distribution costs increased 85 basis points due to a combination of unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses and deleverage from our new distribution center, while occupancy and domestic freight rose by 55 and 35 basis points, respectively.\nPartially offsetting these higher costs were buying expenses that improved by 60 basis points, again due to lower incentives. SG&A for the period levered by 40 basis points as deleverage from the lower comparable sales was more than offset by lower incentive and COVID costs.\nDuring the second quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $235 million. As previously announced, we expect to buy back $950 million of common stock during fiscal 2022 under our 2-year $1.9 billion repurchase program that extends through fiscal 2023.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2022. As Barbara noted in today's press release, given our recent results as well as the increasingly unpredictable macroeconomic landscape in today's more promotional retail environment, we believe it is prudent to adopt a more conservative outlook for the balance of the year. We are now forecasting comparable sales for the 13 weeks ending October 29, 2022, to decline 7% to 9% on top of a strong 14% gain last year.\nFor the fourth quarter, same-store sales are planned to be down 4% to 7% versus a 9% increase in the last quarter of 2021. As noted in our press release, if the second half performs in line with these updated sales assumptions, earnings per share for the third quarter is projected to be $0.72 to $0.83 versus $1.09 last year and $1.04 to $1.21 for the fourth quarter compared to $1.04 in 2021. Based on our first half results and second half guidance, earnings per share for fiscal 2022 are now planned to be in the range of $3.84 to $4.12 versus $4.87 last year.\nNow let's turn to our guidance assumptions for the third quarter of 2022. Total sales are forecasted to decline 4% to 7% versus the prior year. We expect to open 41 locations during the quarter, including 29 Ross and 12 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. Operating margin for the third quarter is planned to be in the 7.8% to 8.7% range versus 11.4% in 2021, primarily reflecting the deleverage on the same-store sales decline. In addition, merchandise margin is forecast to be pressured by ongoing increases in ocean freight costs. We are also projecting higher markdowns to right-size our inventory levels given the lower revenue forecast and adjust pricing as we expect an increasingly promotional retail environment.\nLastly, third quarter operating margin also reflects unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs. Interest expense is estimated to be approximately $400,000. The tax rate is projected to be about 24% to 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 345 million.\nFinally, I want to emphasize that Ross continues to be in a strong financial position with significant resources to manage through today's challenging economic and retail landscape. Our healthy balance sheet includes $5.2 billion in total liquidity with $3.9 billion in cash and $1.3 billion in untapped borrowing capacity. We also continue to return large amounts of cash to stockholders with a cumulative total of $1.4 billion expected to be paid out under our stock repurchase and dividend programs in 2022. Now I will turn the call over to Barbara for closing comments.\n\nBarbara Rentler\n\nVice Chairman & CEO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Adam. We are facing a very difficult and uncertain macroeconomic environment that we expect will continue to strain our customers' discretionary spending. Though 2022 will likely remain a challenging year for our Company, we believe our value-focused business model and our strong financial position will enable us to manage through these economic pressures and rebound over time. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.",

Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.\nAs noted in today's press release, we are disappointed with our lower-than-expected first quarter results. We knew 2022 would be a difficult year to predict, especially the first half when we were facing last year's record levels of government stimulus and significant customer pent-up demand as COVID restrictions eased. The external environment has also proven extremely challenging as the Russia-Ukraine conflict has exacerbated inflationary pressures on the consumer not seen in 40 years. As a result of these factors, our first quarter results underperformed our expectations.\nTotal sales for the first quarter were $4.3 billion with comparable store sales down 7% on top of a robust 13% gain in the first quarter of 2021 that were versus 2019. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended April 30, 2022, were $0.97 on net income of $338 million.\nThe quarter includes an approximate benefit of $0.06 per share from the favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in subsequent quarters. These results compare to $1.34 per share on net earnings of $476 million for the 13 weeks ended May 1, 2021.\nMen's was the strongest merchandise area during the quarter, while Florida was the top-performing region. dd's DISCOUNTS performance in the first quarter trailed that of Ross, as the significant benefit of last year's stimulus and escalating inflationary pressures had a larger impact on lower income households. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were up 57% versus the same period in 2021, mainly from higher packaway inventory.\nPackaway merchandise represented 43% of total inventories versus 34% last year when we used a substantial amount of packaway to meet robust consumer demand. Additionally, supply chain congestion eased somewhat during the first quarter, resulting in the early receipt of merchandise that we stored in packaway and will flow to stores later in the year. Average store inventories during the quarter were up, though we still operated with significantly less inventory in store than we did pre-pandemic.\nTurning to store growth. Our 2022 expansion program is on schedule with the addition of 22 new Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the first quarter. We remain on track to open a total of approximately 100 locations this year, comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores.\nNow Adam will provide further details on our first quarter results and additional color on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022.\n\nAdam M. Orvos\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales were down 7% for the quarter as average basket growth was more than offset by the decline in transactions versus the prior year. First quarter operating margin of 10.8% was down from 14.2% in 2021, mainly due to the deleveraging effect of the same-store sales decline, along with ongoing cost pressures from higher freight and wages that began to escalate in the second half of 2021.\nAs Barbara commented earlier, the quarter benefited from the favorable timing of expenses, most of which were in gross margin. Cost of goods sold in the first quarter increased by 295 basis points due to a combination of factors. Merchandise margin declined 170 basis points, primarily due to higher ocean freight costs. Domestic freight rose 80 basis points while occupancy delevered 40 basis points on the same-store sales decline. Distribution costs increased 25 basis points, mainly due to wage actions taken last year. These unfavorable items were partially offset by buying expenses that improved by 20 basis points. SG&A for the period rose 50 basis points due to higher wages and the deleveraging effect of lower comparable sales.\nDuring the first quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $240 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $950 million in stock for the year.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2022. As Barbara noted in today's press release, given our first quarter results and today's increasingly uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, we believe it is prudent to adopt a more conservative outlook for the balance of the year. We are now forecasting comparable sales for the 13 weeks ending July 30, 2022, to decrease 4% to 6% on top of a very strong 15% gain in the prior year period. Second quarter earnings per share are projected to be $0.99 to $1.07 versus $1.39 last year.\nOur guidance assumptions for the second quarter of 2022 include the following: Total sales are forecast to decline 1% to 4% versus the prior year. We plan to open 29 locations in the second quarter, including 21 Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. Operating margin for the second quarter is planned to be in the 10.4% to 10.8% range, down from 2021 due to deleverage on lower same-store sales and ongoing expense headwinds that are expected to continue through the first half of 2022. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $15 million. The tax rate is projected to be about 25%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 348 million.\nFor the full year, we are now planning comparable store sales to decline 2% to 4% and earnings per share in the range of $4.34 to $4.58. As Barbara mentioned, this reflects our continued expectation for sales and profitability to improve as we move through the balance of the year.\nNow I will turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments.\n\nBarbara Rentler\n\nVice Chairman & CEO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Adam. Looking ahead, while the landscape in early 2022 has been tougher than expected and the year may prove to be more difficult than initially anticipated, we remain confident in our ability to successfully navigate through this period. We have shown in the past that our value-focused business model has served us well in both healthy and more uncertain external climates and believe the current challenging conditions will be no different. Despite the slower-than-expected start to 2022, we operate in an attractive sector of retailing. Our mission continues to be delivering the best bargains possible to leverage our favorable market position. As demonstrated by our long successful track record, we believe our steadfast focus on the execution of this core strategy will be the key driver of our success.\nAt this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.",

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2020 Form 10-K and fiscal 2021 Form 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nBarbara Rentler\n\nVice Chairman & CEO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Betty Chen, Vice President, Investor Relations. We will begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2021 performance, followed by our outlook for '22 and the longer term. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.\nAs noted in today's press release, we achieved strong sales results in the fourth quarter despite the negative impact from both the surge in Omicron cases during the peak holiday selling period and continued supply chain congestion. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2022, were $1.04 on net income of $367 million. This compared to $1.28 per share on net earnings of $456 million for the 13 weeks ended February 1, 2020. Total sales for the fourth quarter were $5 billion with comparable store sales up 9% versus the same period in 2019. For the 2021 fiscal year, earnings per share were $4.87 on net income of $1.723 billion, up from $4.60 per share on net earnings of $1.661 billion in 2019.\nTotal sales for 2021 rose 18% to $18.9 billion with comparable store sales up 13%. Now let's turn to additional details on our fourth quarter results. For the holiday selling period, the best performing larger merchandise areas were children's and men's while the Midwest and Southeast were the strongest regions. Similar to Ross, dd's discount trends remained solid during the period. However, their profitability was also negatively impacted by cost pressures related to freight, wages and COVID. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were up 23% versus 2019, mainly from an increase in-transit merchandise due to longer lead times from the industry-wide supply chain bottlenecks. Average store inventories were down slightly versus 2019, while packway merchandise represented 40% of total inventories versus 46% 2 years ago. As noted in today's release, we are pleased to report that our Board recently authorized a new 2-year program to repurchase up to $1.9 billion of our common stock through fiscal 2023. This authorization replaces the $850 million remaining under the prior buyback we announced in May of last year.\nA total of $650 million of common stock was repurchased under the previous program in fiscal 2021. The Board also increased our quarterly cash dividend by 9% to $0.31 per share to be payable on March 31, 2022, to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2022. The increases to our stock repurchase and dividend program reflects our ongoing commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns as well as our confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and projected future cash flows. Now Adam will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and additional color on our outlook for fiscal 2022.\n\nAdam M. Orvos\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales increased 9% for the quarter. This gain was driven by growth in the size of the average basket, partially offset by a decline in transactions. Fourth quarter operating margin of 9.8% was down 350 basis points from 13.3% in 2019, mainly due to ongoing expense headwinds. Cost of goods sold increased 210 basis points due to a combination of factors. Domestic freight rose 100 basis points and distribution costs increased 70 basis points primarily due to the previously mentioned supply chain challenges in addition to higher wages. Merchandise margin declined 50 basis points due to higher ocean freight costs while buying expenses grew 20 basis points. Occupancy levered 30 basis points on higher sales volume.\nSG&A for the period rose 140 basis points. Again, due to pressure from the holiday-related pay incentives plus higher wages and COVID costs. Total net COVID-related expenses for the quarter were approximately 35 basis points with a higher impact to SG&A than cost of goods sold.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for fiscal 2022. As Barbara noted in our press release, 2022 is a difficult year to predict for numerous reasons. We are up against last year's record government stimulus and the lifting of COVID restrictions that led to unprecedented consumer demand, which fueled extraordinary sales gains in the spring of 2021. In addition, we continue to face industry-wide supply chain headwinds as well as external risks from the effects of inflation both on consumer demand and on costs within our business. As a result, comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ending January 28, 2023, are planned to be flat to up 3% versus a 13% gain in 2021.\nEarnings per share for 2022 are projected to be $4.71 to $5.12 compared to $4.87 in 2021. This reflects our expectation for sales and profitability to improve as we move through the year given the substantial cost increases we incurred in the fall of 2021. Our guidance assumptions for the 2022 year include: total sales are forecast to grow by 2% to 6%. We plan to return to our more normal opening cadence of 100 new locations in 2022, comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd's discounts. As usual, we expect to close about 10 older stores.\nOperating margin for the full year is planned to be in the 11.6% to 12.1% range, down slightly from 2021 due to deleveraging on lower same-store sales gains and again, ongoing expense headwinds, especially in the first half of 2022. Net interest expense is estimated to be $70 million. Depreciation and amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $560 million for the year. The tax rate is projected to be about 24% to 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $348 million.\nIn addition, capital expenditures for 2022 are planned to be approximately $800 million. This outlay will fund further investments in our supply chain to support long-term growth and in technology to increase efficiencies throughout the business in order to maximize our prospects to capture profitable market share going forward.\nLet's now turn to our guidance for the first quarter. In addition to the aforementioned stimulus benefits and strong pent-up demand early last year, we also faced larger headwinds from higher freight and wage costs early in the year. As a result, we are forecasting comparable store sales for the 13 weeks ending April 30, 2022, to be down 2% to down 4% on top of a 13% gain for the 13 weeks ended May 1, 2021.\nEarnings per share for the 2022 first quarter are projected to be $0.93 to $0.99 versus $1.34 in the prior year period. The operating statement assumptions that support our first quarter guidance includes the following: total sales are forecast to be down 2% to up 1% versus last year's first quarter. We plan to add 30 new stores, consisting of 22 Ross and 8 dd's discounts during the period. We project first quarter operating margin to be 10.2% to 10.6% compared to 14.2% last year. The expected decline reflects the deleveraging effect from the negative same-store sales assumption as well as ongoing expense pressure from freight and wage costs early in the year.\nNet interest expense is estimated to be $19 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 25% and diluted shares are forecast to be about $350 million. Now I will turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments.\n\nBarbara Rentler\n\nVice Chairman & CEO, Ross Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Adam. As mentioned in our press release, given consumers increased focus on value and convenience, we have seen favorable sales trends in both our new and infill market stores. As a result, along with the large number of retail closures and bankruptcies over the last several years, we now believe that Ross dress for Less can expand to about 2,900 locations, up from our prior target of 2,400 and that dd's DISCOUNTS can eventually become a chain of approximately 700 stores versus our previous projection of 600. This represents an overall 20% increase in our forecasted potential to 3,600 stores, providing substantial runway for expansion relative to our year-end store count of 1,923 locations.\nWe operate in attractive sector of retail and our mission continues to be delivering the best bargains possible to leverage our favorable market position. Looking at 2023 and beyond, we are targeting a return to double-digit earnings per growth driven by a combination of same-store sales gains, operating margin improvement accelerated new store openings and our ongoing stock repurchase program.\nIn closing, we especially want to thank our approximately 100,000 talented associates throughout the company whose dedication has enabled us to successfully navigate through the unprecedented challenges of the past 2 years. We believe their continued efforts will enable us to capitalize on our opportunities for future sales and earnings growth while also delivering strong returns to stockholders over the coming years.\nAt this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.",

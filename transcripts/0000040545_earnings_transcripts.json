At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Dustin, and I will be your conference coordinator today. If you experience issues with the webcast slides refreshing, or there appears to be delays in the slides' advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Blaire Shoor, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\n\nThanks, Dustin. Welcome to GE Aerospace's third quarter 2025 earnings call. I'm joined by Chairman and CEO Larry Culp and CFO Rahul Ghai. Many of the statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and website, those elements may change as the world changes. Additionally, Larry and Rahul, consistent with prior quarters, will speak to total company and corporate financial results and guidance on a non-GAAP basis. Now, over to Larry.\n\nBlaire, thank you. Good morning, everyone. At GE Aerospace, our purpose is simple: we invent the future of flight, lift people up, and bring them home safely. Every moment, nearly a million people are flying with our technology under wing, an incredible responsibility that we take seriously. FlightDeck, our proprietary lean operating model, is how we turn strategy into results. Our exceptional third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate FlightDeck in action. We're making meaningful progress to accelerate delivery of our services and products to meet robust customer demand. Our commitment to ongoing investments in LEAP durability and the future of flight is centered on delivering value to our customers. Guided by our purpose, our team is energized every day to define flight for today, tomorrow, and the future. Let's take a closer look at our third quarter performance.\n\nOrders were up 2%, with solid growth in commercial services, partially offset by the timing of equipment orders in commercial equipment and defense. Year-to-date, orders are up 13%, with services up 31%. In the third quarter, revenue grew 26%, and profit was $2.3 billion, also up 26%, driven by strong deliveries across aftermarket, OE, and defense. This supported 44% growth in EPS to $1.66 and over 130% free cash flow conversion. In Commercial Engines and Services, or CES, we're servicing and growing the industry's most extensive commercial installed base. Services demand remains robust, with orders up 32% and services revenue up 28%, as improved material availability helped fulfill customer demand, driving total CES operating profit growth of 35% year on year. In Defense and Propulsion Technologies, or DPT, we're improving delivery of our leading platforms while developing mission-critical technology.\n\nWe delivered very solid results with higher output, supporting revenue growth of 26%, with profit up 75%. Given our year-to-date results combined with our fourth quarter expectations, we're raising our full-year guidance across the board. I want to thank our team and our supplier partners for delivering for our customers and for another quarter of strong performance. Shifting to slide five, we continue to experience significant demand for our services and products, and we're encouraged by how FlightDeck is taking hold across the supply chain to deliver on our roughly $175 billion backlog. Much of this improvement is due to the progress within our technology and operations team, bringing together our safety, quality, engineering, supply chain, and manufacturing teams to hardwire problem-solving, resulting in an improved delivery for our customers.\n\nOur team is working better cross-functionally to deliver improved outcomes, in turn, accelerating the same type of collaboration with our supply base. For example, this quarter, we partnered with a critical supplier to address several key constraints utilizing FlightDeck tools such as problem-solving, 5S, and standard work. This resulted in the supplier improving first-time yields meaningfully, in turn, delivering a more than 2X increase in their output. Our priority suppliers also continue to improve shipments against their targets, shipping more than 95% of committed volume for the third consecutive quarter. Greater stability enables us to meet our commitments. As a result of these actions, material input from our priority suppliers continues to grow, up 35% year over year and up high single digits sequentially.\n\nWe continue to advance on our durability roadmap with our next iteration of the LEAP 1A HPT blade now in production, and that will further enhance output. As you can see, operational momentum is building, leading to significant growth. CES services revenue was up 28%, with internal shop visit revenue up 33% and spare parts revenue up more than 25% year over year. Total engine deliveries were up 41% year over year and 18% sequentially. Commercial units were up 33%, including record LEAP deliveries, up 40% year over year in the third quarter. Year-to-date, commercial units were up 19%, with LEAP up 21%. Based on this progress, we now expect to grow LEAP deliveries more than 20% for the full year, up from our prior outlook of 15% to 20%. Defense units were up 83% year over year, marking the second consecutive quarter of defense output exceeding 80% growth.\n\nAdditionally, while CFM56 continues to fly for longer and with LEAP's fleet size expected to triple by 2030, FlightDeck is also helping us expand our capacity and capabilities to reduce turnaround times and improve shop visit output, two top priorities to meet the demands of our customers. For example, we've made progress with LEAP turnaround time at our Malaysia MRO shop. Our team there improved flow and delivered a 30% reduction in engine disassembly time. As a result of actions like these, total LEAP internal shop visit output grew by more than 30% in the third quarter. We're also investing in incremental capacity to support our customers' growing fleets. This quarter, our ZEOS MRO facility in Poland completed its first LEAP shop visits, and our LEAP third-party MRO network also continues to grow rapidly, with external shop visits up roughly twofold.\n\nIn addition, we collaborated with our leasing partner for LEAP to reduce the time it takes to redeploy spare engines between customers, resulting in improved spare engine availability. We're also investing nearly $1 billion in our supply chain to expand capacity, and we're counting on our suppliers to also make like investments to support the growth ahead. While this is progress, we know there's much more work to do to improve LEAP turnaround times to meet customer expectations. We're accelerating our use of FlightDeck, taking lessons learned and applying them across our network to deliver a better experience for our customers. This quarter clearly marked another step forward, with year-to-date commercial services revenue and total engine deliveries both up 25%. We're well-positioned to ramp further as we go into 2026.\n\nTurning to slide six, one of the FlightDeck behaviors that guides our company is to be customer-driven in all that we do. Earlier this month, at our GE Aerospace Research Center, we had the opportunity to share how our experience across 2.3 billion flight hours and our roughly $3 billion of annual R&D investment is enabling continuous improvement in our field performance. For reference, we've posted these materials on our Investor Relations website, and I encourage you to take a look. We're applying insights from our experience and investments to improve reliability and durability of our products as time on wing remains critical for our customers. For example, the lessons learned from 15 years of enhancing the GEnx durability over 2X are being applied to LEAP to achieve the same level of improvement.\n\nWe're increasing our investments in LEAP services technologies, such as our analytics-based maintenance, which predicts the optimal time for a shop visit and repairs, which reduce reliance on new material, benefiting both cost of ownership and turnaround times. Combined with our progress on delivery, we're actively working to meet customer expectations on LEAP. We're also applying similar lessons from GEnx and LEAP durability to our next generation of engines. We just launched our second dust test on the GE 9X, which will continue to mature the design pre-entry into service. This builds upon over 30,000 cycles of testing, including 9,000 endurance cycles, which will make the GE 9X the most tested engine in our history. Earlier this month, we began similar dust testing on next-generation HPT blades for our RISE Compact Core development. This marks the earliest we've ever started this type of testing and development.\n\nWhile we're investing in Compact Core to mature RISE technologies, there could be applications of these learnings for today's fleet as well. We recently announced the first-ever Chief Mechanic and Architect for our open fan technology, making durability a top priority in engine design with an uncompromising commitment to safety. Our focus on delivering for our customers across current and future platforms is driving success in the marketplace. A couple of key wins this quarter. Of note, Korean Air announced the largest fleet commitment in its history, with 103 Boeing aircraft powered by GEnx, GE 9X, and LEAP 1B engines, plus long-term services. We also secured a commitment from Cathay Pacific for GE 9X engines to power 14 additional 777Xs, bringing their total commitment to 35 777X aircraft powered by our GE 9X.\n\nThese wins build upon our solid backlog, and we're sold out in effect both on LEAP and GEnx through the rest of this decade. Stepping back, we know our customers are counting on us to deliver reliability, predictability, time on wing, and at the right cost of ownership. With FlightDeck, we're making daily progress to meet those objectives, supporting their and our growth. Rahul, over to you.\n\nLarry, thank you. Good morning, everyone. GE Aerospace delivered another strong quarter, marked by robust services growth and an improvement in engine deliveries, driving substantial earnings and free cash flow. Revenue was $11.3 billion, up 26%, with both segments growing over 25%. Operating profit was $2.3 billion, up 26%. Services volume, price, and productivity were partially offset by OE growth, investments, and higher corporate cost. Operating margins were flat at 20.3%, with margin expansion in both segments offset by corporate cost timing. Adjusted EPS was $1.66, up 44%, from increased operating profit, a lower tax rate, and a reduced share count. Free cash flow was $2.4 billion, up 30%, from higher earnings with over 130% conversion. Working capital and AD&A combined increased by roughly $300 million from increased inventory. Cash flow from long-term service agreements continued to be favorable, and day sales outstanding declined three days year over year.\n\nYear-to-date, revenue is up 21%, and operating profit is up more than $1.5 billion, from 25% growth in commercial services. We have delivered $5.9 billion of free cash flow, up nearly $1.3 billion year over year at 115% of net income. Given the momentum during the first nine months, we are poised to deliver another solid year. Going deeper into the drivers of 44% year-over-year EPS growth, increase in operating profit drove nearly $0.35 or 70% of the improvement in EPS, with increased segment profit in CES and DPT partially offset by higher corporate and other costs of roughly $300 million. The increase in corporate was primarily from timing of reserves for environmental, health, and safety expenses. Eliminations were roughly $140 million, up about $30 million year over year.\n\nAdditionally, our tax rate declined from approximately 20% to 15% from benefits of long-term planning projects and timing of favorable audit settlements, improving EPS by $0.10. Impact from stock buyback actions and reduction in interest expense also contributed to EPS growth. Taking a closer look at our businesses, starting with CES in the quarter, orders were up 5%, with services up 32% and equipment down 42% due to timing of some wide-body and regional orders shifting from Q3 to Q4. Revenue was 27%, and with services up 28%, internal shop visit revenue grew 33% from higher volume, wide-body work scopes, and price. Spare parts sales were up over 25% as improved material availability supported increased output. Equipment revenue grew 22%, with engine deliveries up 33%, including LEAP up 40%. This more than offset a sequential and a year-over-year decline in spare engine ratio.\n\nLife of program, the spare engine ratio for LEAP remains in low double digits. Profit was $2.4 billion, up 35%. Services margins were strong, driven by higher volume, price, and a favorable shop visit and spare parts mix. This more than offset the impact of higher install deliveries, including GE 9X shipments and an increase in R&D spend. Segment margins expanded 170 basis points to 27.4%, with services revenue growth, mix, and price more than offsetting OE growth and impact from adverse mix. Year-to-date, CES has delivered revenue growth of 24%, operating profit of $6.6 billion, up $1.7 billion year over year, with margin expansion of 210 basis points, while delivering around a 20% increase in engine shipments. Moving to DPT, orders were down 5% due to timing across quarters. Defense book-to-bill remained above 1 in the quarter and is 1.2 year-to-date.\n\nOur total DPT backlog is at $19 billion, up $1.5 billion year over year. Revenue grew 26% in the quarter. Defense and systems revenue was up 24%, driven by higher engines volume, up 83% year over year, and improved pricing. Propulsion and additive technologies grew 29%, with all businesses growing over 20%. Profit of $386 million was up 75% year over year. Higher volume in defense and avio, customer mix, price, and lowered losses at additive offset continued investments and inflation. Margins expanded 380 basis points to 13.6%. Year-to-date, DPT has delivered 11% revenue growth, $1 billion of profit, up 27% with 170 basis points of margin expansion. Turning to guidance on slide 11, given the strong year-to-date performance and trajectory entering the fourth quarter, we are raising our full-year guidance across the board. We expect revenue to grow high teens, up from our prior outlook of mid-teens.\n\nAt CES, we now expect growth of low 20s, up from our prior outlook of high teens. This is driven by higher services revenue, which we now expect to grow low to mid-20s, up from high teens. We continue to expect equipment to grow high teens to 20%. We now expect DPT growth of high single digits, up from mid to high single digits previously. Operating profit is now expected to be in a range of $8.65 to $8.85 billion, up $400 million at the midpoint from the prior guide. CES operating profit is now expected to be in a range of $8.45 to $8.65 billion, up $450 million at the midpoint from prior guide. This reflects the drop through from roughly $1 billion improvement in services revenue in the second half versus our prior guide and favorable services mix.\n\nWe expect DPT profit to be in the $1.2 to $1.3 billion range, up $50 million at the midpoint versus the prior guide, reflecting year-to-date performance from improved deliveries. Corporate cost and eliminations are expected to be roughly $1 billion. Additionally, we are improving our interest expense and tax rate outlook for the year and now expect interest expense of approximately $850 million and tax rate of 17.5%. Taken together, we are raising our EPS guidance to $6 to $6.20, up $0.40 at the midpoint from the prior guide. We are also raising our free cash flow guidance to $7.1 to $7.3 billion, up $500 million at the midpoint, primarily from higher earnings. We are all set to close out another excellent year in 2025 and well-positioned for continued growth heading into 2026. With that, Larry, back to you.\n\nRahul, thank you. I'm encouraged by our progress this quarter, which builds upon our leadership positions across both commercial and defense and, in turn, supports the improved financial outlook we're sharing today. GE Aerospace has sustained competitive advantages. With the industry's largest fleet, 78,000 engines and growing, we have accumulated over 2.3 billion flight hours and have certified seven commercial engine programs in the last 20 years. This experience base keeps us close to our customers and provides unmatched insights on performance, making us the partner of choice. We use these insights to continuously improve our services and products, delivering reliability, predictability, time on wing, and lower costs of ownership. We offer the best performing products under wing across our narrow-body, wide-body, regional, and defense platforms.\n\nOur world-class engineering teams, combined with roughly $3 billion in annual R&D investment, drive next-gen technology to improve durability, efficiency, and turnaround times, along with advanced defense capabilities. Through FlightDeck, we're turning strategy into results with a relentless focus on safety, quality, delivery, and cost, always in that order. The GE Aerospace team is poised to deliver exceptional value to our customers and shareholders, and I'm confident in our path ahead. Let's open it up to questions.\n\nBefore we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Dustin, can you please open the line?\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone. If you wish to withdraw your question or your question has already been answered, please press star one. Our first question comes from the line of Sheila Tagliabue from Jefferies. Please proceed.\n\nGood morning. Good morning, Larry. Rahul Ghai.\n\nHow are you, Sheila?\n\nThank you. Maybe if we could peel back the layers behind the services performance, up 25% year-to-date, which is pretty phenomenal, and on a dollar basis, up $750 million sequentially Q3 versus Q2. How much of that is pure volume unlock through FlightDeck and the supply chain versus tariff price surcharges or any other factors that you would say play into it, and why the step down sequentially in Q4?\n\nYeah. Sheila, let me start. I agree with you. We had a really strong quarter on services. We were expecting high teens growth for the year, and year-to-date results, we are at about 25%. Now we've raised the outlook for the year to be low to mid-20s growth. The improved outlook is both in our shop visit revenue and in the spare parts. A lot of that from the strength that we observed in the third quarter. If I start with the shop visits, you know we've had year-to-date growth of, call it, 22%. What's driving that, as you hinted at, is improved material availability is driving higher volume. That's a big piece of that. Along with that, you know the work scopes continue to increase. That's helping as well. The demand environment just continues to be strong.\n\nI mean, year-to-date, our inductions have outpaced output even with the results that we have delivered. This improvement in output is especially visible in LEAP that is up 30% year-to-date. Part of that is the incremental capacity that we've set up for LEAP. On the spare parts, the year-to-date results have been equally strong. You know growth of more than 25%. Orders have remained strong, as Larry mentioned. You know our orders, services orders growth of greater than 30% year-to-date. The improved material availability is now helping us, you know, achieve those orders and execute on the demand that we are seeing. As we look at the fourth quarter, our backlog still remains strong. 90% of the spare parts that we need to ship in the fourth quarter are in the backlog, which is 15 points higher than where we have been historically.\n\nReally strong external LEAP shop visits up 2X is helping. You know mid-single-digit growth in total worldwide shop visits and CFM56 is helping. All that. You know, again, as we look at that, it set us up for really well, not only for 2025 but also for 2026. Now, as we think about the fourth quarter, we typically have a seasonal step down in our third quarter to fourth quarter revenue, largely driven by spare parts because you don't expect the same level of improvement on material availability, a little bit of seasonality in demand. Still, if you step back and look at the full year, you know, really strong year, and you know, versus where we were in July, more than $1 billion of revenue increase in the services revenue. That's a large part responsible for the incremental $450 million of guidance raised on profit for CES. Thank you.\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Doug Harded from Bernstein. Please proceed.\n\nYes, sir. Good morning. Thank you.\n\nMorning, Doug.\n\nMorning, Doug. You've been talking about the improvement in the margin outlook for LEAP on the services side to get up to sort of services overall margins once you get out to 2028. That's a strong trajectory, but could you talk about what gives you confidence in that? You're still in the very early days of PRSVs, and I would expect really understanding what the cost is for full shop visits. How do you think about that 2028 LEAP services margin, and how does price and cost factor in?\n\nDoug, I would say that the roadmap to 2028 with respect to LEAP really is something that we're looking to manage every day, really a combination of the field performance that you spoke to and, frankly, what we're doing in our own operations with FlightDeck to make sure we not only have the material availability, the improvements of which you see here in the third quarter financial results, but also in the underlying operational data points that Rahul just mentioned a moment ago. As we project that forward, we've been making the improvements in the supply base, in the field performance, witnessed the durability kit with the 1A that's now in the field, very much, and the cost reductions as well, be they productivity, which material availability really does unlock in our shops, very much in line with our expectations.\n\nThere's a lot of work to do between now and 2028. I think given the multiple levers that we have to pull and the underlying product improvements, that we have the conviction not only behind the strength of today's results, but the roadmap from here, both in terms of the eyes of investors, as you just framed it, as well as customers.\n\nYeah.\n\nRahul, anything you'd add there?\n\nLarry, just maybe a couple of things to add here, Doug. Larry spoke about the FlightDeck improvement. We spoke about all the improvements that we are driving this year in LEAP output. As we see ourselves till 2030, we expect this 30% year-over-year internal shop visit growth to continue, right? The volume is going to be a big piece of that. As you think about the external channel, we spoke of, I think Larry spoke earlier in his prepared remarks about the external channel being up 2X year over year. That unlocks the spare parts revenue stream for us. That's helping. We also spoke about the investments that we are making on repair technology. That reduces the cost of the shop visit in addition to unlocking our shop visit output. All those things are helping, and durability is kind of hanging in there.\n\nI think with the introduction of the durability kit, we are very confident of getting to CFM56 levels of performance on LEAP 1A and then soon on 1B as we look forward to 2028. All those things are what gives us confidence about the trajectory that we have on LEAP. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Miles Walton from Wolff Research. Please proceed.\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nGood morning, Miles.\n\nI was hoping to touch on capital deployment. The operations are all going fantastic. You're generating a ton of cash. The stock price is reflecting it. Where and how do you balance capital deployment, share repurchase in particular at this point vis-à-vis your stock price? You haven't slowed down your pace. I imagine that gives us a good indication that you still think there's good value there. Is the dial going to turn towards M&A at any point, do you think, in the near future?\n\nMiles, I would say that the capital allocation approach that we and the board have taken since the spin is very much intact. I don't really see that changing materially anytime soon, right? We've talked about what we've described as a balanced approach. First and foremost, making sure we're reinvesting in the business to drive the technology improvements we've talked about here already on this call, which you know well, and the footprint required to support the growth. Of course, we are going to return capital to shareholders and reserve some when those M&A opportunities, large or small, come along that make sense. We're proud of the fact that we've increased our shareholder returns since the spin up, what, 4X.\n\nAs we said back in the summertime, we've increased our return of cash to shareholders to $24 billion in the 2024 to 2026 period, which is, I think, up 20% from where we were at the spin. From an M&A perspective, we want to make sure we're looking at anything and everything that might make sense in the neighborhood. Investors should continue to see from us a disciplined approach where we really look to strategic fit, then operational value add, and in turn, financial returns. Your question, I think, recognizes the tremendous capacity that we have. Again, organic reinvestment, return of capital to shareholders will be the first two priorities. That gives us still, I think, ample room, given the cash flow projections that we have here, to look at things that fortify our existing positions.\n\nYou saw here in the quarter something that we're really excited about, our $300 million investment in Beta Technologies, a company that some people are well aware of, others maybe not so much. We really like the team. We like the underlying technology and our collaboration to co-develop a hybrid electric turbo generator we think will yield benefit to both of us, both in defense applications and ultimately in the commercial space.\n\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please proceed.\n\nThank you very much. Good morning, everyone.\n\nMorning, Seth.\n\nI wanted to zero in on the spares performance a little bit within services, given our, I think, our usual starting point for how to think about spares is like departure growth. Outpacing that by a bit, and also dramatically outpacing the outlook that you had for 2025 at the start of the year. When we think about what's driving that, is it all material availability? Is there a part of that that comes from outfitting LEAP shops out in the network? If so, what's the tail on that that allows spares growth to exceed that underlying departure level? Also, given the mix of engines that do internal shop visits versus the mix of engines that are not on internal plans, should we think about CFM56 being the main driver of spares growth?\n\nYeah. Seth, let me start here. I think you had a lot of the data points that actually drove the performance in your question here. If you start unpacking that, I think if you look at the spare parts performance, obviously, we spoke to the orders growth. Orders have remained really strong. What's driving the orders growth besides the increase in departures where you started is a lot of pent-up demand. If you look at the number of shop visits that will be done in 2025 globally, worldwide shop visits, that's still below where we were in 2019. The worldwide shop visits still have not recovered the 2019 level. There's a lot of pent-up demand here on volume, and that's a big piece on why the total demand is outpacing the departures growth. The second is the increase in work scopes.\n\nWe've been talking about increase in work scopes both internally and externally. If you look at GE 90 as an example, the GE 90 is now going, like 70% of the shop visits haven't gone in for a second shop visit. We're beginning to see the second shop visits come through, and that could be 60% to 70% heavier than the first shop visit. The increase in work scopes is a big piece. The same thing's happening on LEAP. The same thing's happening on GEnx. You spoke about material availability. I think that's an unlock here as well because we've spoken about a delinquency continuing to increase. Our output has been increasing, but we are still behind on meeting demand. That continued even into this quarter, even with the spare parts growth we've had. I think all of that is driving this.\n\nAs we look forward into 2026, we still expect that, we expect departures growth of where we have been in 2025, kind of 3% to 4%. The number of engines that will come off wing are going to be up double digits. We do expect this difference between departure growth and spare parts demand to continue for a while, just given everything I've said, plus the engines that are going to come off wing. Hopefully, that answers the question. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Scott Deutschel from Deutsche Bank. The line's open.\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nGood morning, Scott.\n\nRahul, would you be able to share any of your current thinking on 2026 at this point, particularly as it relates to CES revenue growth, then margins as well? Also, I guess, just more broadly on anything you think is important for us to keep in mind as we sharpen the pencil on 2026.\n\nOkay. Let me start and Larry, please jump in here. As we think about 2026, Scott, firstly, and especially on the commercial side, the environment today feels better than where we were three months ago, right? Three months ago, we were expecting second-half departures growth to be kind of flat to maybe low single digits. Now it's solidly in the 3% to 4% range. I think the air traffic growth has stabilized. 2026 feels a little bit better than where we were a couple of months back. The more important part here, and this goes partially back to Seth's question a minute ago, is the basic algorithm of the demand and performance on the CES business has not changed. Install base is growing, right, both on the wide body and on the narrow body side.\n\nAs I said in response to Seth's question, the number of engines that need a shop visit is projected to be up double digits in 2026, just based on the number of cycles that they've already flown. That'll add to the demand that's out there. The work scopes on wide body, you know, low single digit kind of net price increase that we are expecting, which seems reasonable. We do expect the services business to continue to our overall growth. As we think about specifically on the 2026 growth, we don't expect a repeat of the 2025 performance. We don't expect 2025 growth to be, you know, 2026 growth to be kind of at the 2025 levels. It'll start normalizing towards our double-digit levels that we had projected over the medium term. On the new business, the new equipment business, obviously, the backlog is very strong.\n\nWe expect, call it, 2,000 LEAP engine shipments and then incremental GE 9X shipments here because our volume assumptions on GE 9X have not changed since we were together back in July. We do expect GE 9X losses to kind of double on a year-over-year basis or more than double on a year-over-year basis as we think about 2026. That'll offset some of the positive drop through that we will see from services. DPT, I think we expect continued kind of mid-single-digit revenue growth, some margin expansion that we outplayed back in July. You put all that together, productivity is a plus, but we're facing inflation. We have the GE 9X losses. We expect kind of margin expansion opportunities to be limited here. We are optimistic as we look at 2026. We expect revenue growth, strong revenue growth, profit growth, cash.\n\nWe think of 2026 kind of as a step along the way to 2028. That's our current thinking. Obviously, we'll put a sharper point on it. Larry, anything to add?\n\nNo, just maybe that, right? We're just in the process of wrapping up our strategy reviews. We'll spend the fourth quarter working through the details of the 2026 budget. I think Rahul did a nice job there providing the general contours of that work that is underway. We'll take the board through it at the end of the year, and then we'll come back at earnings and talk about 2026 in more detail. It's basically our practice here. I think net-net, we're more or less in line with the 2028 framework we talked about back in July, with a lot of good tailwinds in terms of the environment and clearly operational momentum building with FlightDeck. Put those two dynamics together, I think that's what you're going to see come January.\n\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nYeah, hey, good morning, everyone.\n\nGood morning, Ron.\n\nMaybe just changing gears a little bit. You called out the work you all are doing on the hybrid electric turbo generator and the implications that might have for defense. Your defense business grew quite well during the quarter and also last quarter. Can you speak to maybe, you know, can we pull back and get some detail on kind of what you all are doing in defense and maybe what, you know, from an R&D perspective? Maybe more importantly, and this is just really a question you'd ask the other way around, what lessons have you all learned in commercial, given the size of the fleet and all the experience you have with commercial engines that you can then apply in the defense world where most other defense contractors just don't have that experience base?\n\nRon, if I maybe take those in reverse order, a lot of the work that you see or a lot of the work that we've referenced vis-à-vis supply chain with our team at FlightDeck courses through the results both on the commercial side and on the defense side, right? We talk about a quarter where you've got revenues up 26%, profit up 75%. Of note, the defense engine output was up 83%. We hung an eight-handle on that for the second quarter in a row, I believe. That really speaks, I think, to the strength of the backlog there, maybe some of the underperformance a year ago, but the just outstanding work that the teams have done, leveraging a lot of what we've done in commercial and in turn, the shared supply base.\n\nWhen we look at what we could do, if you will, more commercially, I think we are keen to take advantage of the moment at the Pentagon to share some of our best practices with respect to moving at pace through development cycles, perhaps in how we think about sustainment models to be creative and be responsive to some of the investment and budgetary realities that are out there. Ron, you know well that the investment that we've seen that we've put into the business, both government-funded and our own, has been concentrated on next-gen platforms, be they sixth-gen propulsion in conjunction with the NGAP program with an eye toward both the opportunities with the Air Force and the Navy, but everything that we're doing to upgrade the Apaches and the Blackhawks with the ITAP, the T901 engine. There's a lot that's in progress with respect to future platforms.\n\nI think some real opportunities not only to fulfill this incredible backlog that we have in defense, but at the same time, rethink some of the business models, either internal to our customers or in collaboration with them. Here and now, making sure that we are reducing the delinquency, servicing the backlog, as Rahul mentioned a moment ago. Fortunately, the good work that's driving the results on the commercial side are helping us out a great deal on the defense side as well.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stoller from Vertical Research. Please proceed.\n\nThanks so much. Good morning.\n\nGood morning, Robert.\n\nQuick question about Larry. You mentioned durability a number of times in your initial comments. I just wondered, following up from that, how the initial performance has been on that new blade on the LEAP 1A, and how long is it going to take to roll that blade out across the install base. Thank you.\n\nWe're very pleased with the performance of the durability kit on the LEAP 1A, the new blade of which is at the heart of that durability kit. We think that will drive a 2X improvement. You know, think 8,000 cycles in harsh environments, think 17,000 cycles in neutral environments. So far, so good. No surprises in that regard given the testing. We're in the certification process on the LEAP 1B equivalent and are expecting to see that come through the pipeline in the first half of next year. I think, again, we're encouraged by what we are seeing in that regard. It's probably a multi-year effort, Robert, to upgrade the install base. Certainly, having the LEAP 1A durability kit in production helps in that regard. We're tending to the aftermarket now and we'll do the same thing with Boeing once we're on the other side of certification.\n\nI'd say no surprises to date. A lot of work still ahead of us, but fundamentally encouraged by the impact that we'll have on durability and, in turn, the performance for our customers.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from TD Cowen. The line's open.\n\nThanks. Good morning, guys.\n\nMorning, Gautam.\n\nGood morning.\n\nI was wondering if you could elaborate on where you're seeing the greatest improvement in supply chain material availability because it's been pretty consistent year to date. Has it been any breakthroughs? If you could just give us some color inside baseball, please. Thanks.\n\nIt's hard to say that we have seen a breakthrough. I really think it is the cumulative and compounding effect of all the good work that's been underway with intensity and urgency over the last 18-plus months, particularly with the supply base. If you segment where we're seeing that improvement, wide body versus narrow body, legacy platforms versus new platforms, large suppliers that you would know by name, some of them they call my own, versus smaller companies you may have never heard of, I can't pull any major theme out because we depend on all of them. This has been a universal challenge as the airframers have been ramping, the aftermarket, given airline demand doing the same, and again, a third stream in the form of defense demand pulling on us and our supply chain.\n\nI think the common denominator is where we've been able to go in around these priority suppliers, which are either current constraints or anticipated bottlenecks, and really getting out on the factory floor, staring down a problem on a machine, an assembly line, whether it be throughput, whether it be yields, what have you, and really driving deep problem solving that's truly collaborative, our best engineers with our supplier's best engineers, not trying to negotiate there on the factory floor, but to identify the problem, contain it in the short term, and put it in permanent corrective action going forward. There are fits and starts that we manage in that regard every day, every week. I think we've gotten better at that.\n\nGoing forward, we want to be not just excellent in that near-term problem solving, but we want to make sure we're investing time and talent in getting out ahead of those sorts of issues, both in the medium and long term. As we look at readiness going into 2026, let alone some of the longer-term conversations that we might have, say, with Airbus as they talk about rate 75 and the path there as Boeing now has the latitude to go up to the next rate break, making sure that we've got visibility and that we're communicating the same with our airframer partners is just critical, right, for our planning purposes and theirs. No one breakthrough other than just the relentless application with urgency of our FlightDeck tools deep into the supply base wherever we have a constraint or bottleneck. It's that simple and that hard.\n\nDustin, we have time for one last question.\n\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Scott Mikas from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nMorning, Larry and Rahul.\n\nGood morning.\n\nQuick question on commercial aftermarket revenue growth. Historically, for the industry, it's been strongly correlated with flight activity and ASK growth. The commercial services revenue growth has continued to reaccelerate despite the deceleration in ASK growth. Has anything structurally changed about the business model that could cause your aftermarket growth to decouple or sustainably outperform ASK growth over the long term? Is it simply just strength driven by heavier work scopes, better throughput because of a healthier supply chain and the FlightDeck productivity?\n\nYeah, Scott. I think Seth had a similar question earlier in the call. I think some of the things that I said earlier, I'll kind of touch upon. A lot of this, with the disconnect that we're seeing with our demand outlook and the departures growth, goes fundamentally back to the pent-up demand on shop visits, right? As I said earlier, shop visits in 2025 are going to be below 2019 levels. The increase in work scopes that we are seeing, especially on the widebody side, both on GE90, on GEnx, as those migrate to the next level of shop visit, that's a big piece of that. The growth of our external LEAP channel, we spoke earlier about LEAP channel, LEAP external shop visits being up 2X in the quarter, right?\n\nAs we think longer term for the year, we expect LEAP external shop visits to be in the mid-teens, slightly above that range. As we project that for 2030, we expect that to be 30%, right? That will drive a huge amount of spare parts growth as not only do the LEAP shop visits ramp, but also the participation of external channel grows. You combine that with a little bit of price increase that we drive every year. I think those are the fundamental reasons why we are seeing this increase in demand. It's pent-up demand, work scopes, and then growth of the external channel.\n\nLarry, any final comments?\n\nBlaire, thank you. Yeah, just to close, GE Aerospace is an exceptional franchise with enduring competitive strengths and a clear path for continued value creation. Our updated outlook today reflects growing confidence in that trajectory as we deliver for our customers, our shareholders, and the flying public. We appreciate your time this morning and your interest in GE Aerospace.\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Speakers, please stand by for your post-conference.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Liz, and I will be your conference coordinator today. If you experience issues with the webcast slides refreshing or there appears to be delays in the slide advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Blaire Shoor from the GE Aerospace Investor Relations Team. Please proceed.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks, Liz. Welcome to GE Aerospace's 2025 Investor Update and Q2 2025 Earnings Call. I'm joined by Chairman and CEO Larry Culp and CFO Rahul Ghai. Today, we will be sharing an update on our second quarter 2025 results, financial guidance for 2025, an outlook for 2028, followed by a Q&A session. As usual, many of the statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our view of the world and our businesses as we see them today.\nAs described in our SEC filings and website, those elements may change as the world changes. Additionally, Larry and Rahul will speak to total company and corporate financials as well as our guidance and outlook on a non-GAAP basis. With that, I'll hand it over to Larry.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks Blaire, and we appreciate everyone joining us today. The GE Aerospace team is guided by our purpose to invent the future of flight, lift people up, and bring them home safely. At any given moment, nearly 1 million people are flying with GE Aerospace technology under wing. That is a significant responsibility that our 53,000 employees carry with great pride.\nWe use Flight Deck, our proprietary lean operating model, to continuously improve safety, quality, delivery, and cost, always in that order, as we strive to provide unrivaled customer service and deliver our roughly $175 billion backlog.\nBefore we dive in further, I want to acknowledge the tragedy of Air India Flight 171. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives. Since June 12, our focus has been and remains on supporting our customers and providing technical support to the regulators.\nWhile we were looking forward to a broader update with you in Paris, Rahul and I are here today to share our Q2 results and our increased outlook. We'll create additional opportunities later this year to share more of the operational details we expected to cover with you in Paris.\nTurning to the next slide. Safety is and always will be foundational to everything we do through decades of experience, learning, and continuous improvement. We've built our reactive, proactive, and now predictive safety processes. GE Aerospace was the first manufacturer to have its Safety Management System, or SMS, accepted by the FAA. We established our SMS a decade before the agency proposed requiring it. The system encourages our employees to report safety concerns voluntarily and ensures that they are thoroughly evaluated.\nSMS, together with our quality management system, are the foundation of our safety culture. While our approach to continuous improvement helps us drive safety up the value chain, Flight Deck further standardizes our own processes to support safety investigations leading to identifying corrective actions faster. We're also enhancing engine inspections to begin at the part level, extend through manufacturing, and continue into the aftermarket.\nNow we're deploying AI-enabled tools to further improve inspection accuracy and consistency, helping to predict potential safety threats. Everyone at GE Aerospace owns safety and we never compete on safety.\nTurning to Slide 5. GE Aerospace is an exceptional franchise. As a global aerospace leader in propulsion, services, and systems, we're well positioned to benefit from favorable long-term market trends across both commercial and defense. Our Commercial Engines and Services business, or CES, is servicing and growing the industry's most extensive commercial installed base.\nWe're proud to be underway on three out of every four commercial flights, demonstrating our unmatched scale and scope across the world's most successful and innovative aircraft platforms. Our Defense and Propulsion Technologies business, or DPT, powers 2/3 of all US military, combat, and helicopter fleets. DPT offers both the leading defense programs of today while developing mission critical technology for the future.\nLet's take a closer look at GE Aerospace today.\nAs the industry's largest and growing engine fleet, our business model is highly resilient, largely due to our balanced exposure across narrow body, widebody, regional, and defense platforms. CES has more than 49,000 engines in service and growing. In 2024 we delivered a particularly strong year with $27 billion of revenue growing 13% with robust services, demand, and performance supporting higher profit. About half of our revenue comes from narrow by platforms, while widebody represents 35%.\nIn DPT.\nWe have more than 29,000 engines in service. 2024 was a solid year with nearly $10 billion in revenue up 6% and profit up double digits. Our defense and systems business accounts for roughly 2/3 of DPT revenue, including over 70% of revenue from US customers and around 30% internationally. Propulsion and additive technologies represents the remaining 1/3, with exposure to commercial programs and localized European defense capabilities.\nNotably, 70% of our total revenue comes from recurring, predictable, and highly profitable services, including 3/4 of CES revenue and more than half of DPT revenue. This represents a significant growth opportunity as our commercial installed base continues to grow at a low-single- to mid-single-digit compounded growth rate through the end of the decade. Services also enable us to live the customer experience and strengthen our relationships, seeing and hearing their needs firsthand while shaping our product roadmaps to ensure alignment with their future priorities.\nTurning to Slide 7.\nGiven macroeconomic dynamics, we're watching demand near term. This quarter departures grew nearly 4% in line with our expectations for 2025. We're still planning for low single digit departures growth, taking a more conservative view on the second half.\nBroadly speaking, we support promoting free and fair trade, including the duty free environment that has long fueled the US aerospace sector, leading to more than 1.8 million US jobs and a $75 billion annual trade surplus. We commend the administration for the US UK Trade Deal eliminating tariffs on the aerospace sector and view this deal as a strong framework for future trade agreements.\nLonger term, GE Aerospace is operating from a position of strength. Our robust orders over the last several quarters have increased our commercial services backlog to now over $140 billion, supporting growth for years to come.\nAcross the commercial sector specifically, we see strong fundamentals. Air traffic growth is expected to outpace global GDP, especially in Asia Pac and the Middle East, and new aircraft builds and airline expansions remain healthy, supporting the growth of our installed base.\nOn the defense side, we see solid momentum globally toward modernization and localization. Domestically, we're pleased. The reconciliation package includes funding for key defense propulsion initiatives with more than $1 billion for sixth generation aircraft programs.\nInternationally, we're expecting faster growth than in the US. Largely in response to rising global tensions and the evolving geopolitical landscape.\nOverall, we expect the market to grow at a mid single digit compounded growth rate through 2028, reaffirming our strong trajectory.\nMoving to slide 8.\nOur vision is clear to be the company that defines flight for today, tomorrow, and in the future. For today, we're ramping up services and equipment to support our customers' fleets while fulfilling strong demand for new engines. For tomorrow, we're expanding capacity and capabilities to deliver on while growing our backlog. This includes expanding our supply chain and service networks, and investing in technologies to further enhance engine performance.\nFor the future, we're building the technological foundation that will define the future of flight across both commercial and defense.\nFlight Deck is a systematic approach to running our company, translating strategy into outcomes while advancing our culture.\nLet me share here a few examples of Flight Deck in action to support our Multi-Year Services and Equipment Ramp. Earlier this year, we launched a new technology and operations team to hardwire and accelerate the Flight Deck enhancements we made last year, often in partnership with our suppliers. The team is providing greater stability and transparency to our demand signals and stronger collaboration to help identify and then break constraints. This helps our suppliers deliver today while investing to support the ramp in the future.\nWe're also removing waste within our own operations with a focus on improving output and turnaround times.\nTake our largest MRO site in Celma, Brazil, which is responsible for 1/4 of our global volume. Here, the CFM56 fan module has been the key constraint to reaching our turnaround time target.\nA cross-functional team used value stream mapping and implemented flow lines to reduce lead time by over 30%. Now CFM56 turnaround time at Celma is below 80 days.\nAdditionally, our recently deployed AI-enabled blade inspection tool is improving inspection accuracy and consistency while reducing inspection time by roughly 50%.\nImprovements like this are driving turnaround times closer to 90 days for GEnx and CFM56 in our larger shops. That said, we have more work to do on our other platforms, and finally, we're expanding capacity with the LEAP installed base expected to roughly triple, and GEnx to roughly double by 2030. We're growing our LEAP third party MRO network which includes six premier partners, and this quarter we saw significantly higher third party LEAP shop visits.\nAdditionally, last year we announced we'll invest more than $1 billion in our MRO and component repair facilities over the next five years. We've added XEOS in Poland in partnership with Lufthansa Technik to our MRO network, which inducted its first LEAP engine earlier this year. We're investing more than $1 billion across our US factories and supply chain infrastructure to support growth. Overall, we expect to grow internal and external capacity by approximately 40% by the end of the decade.\nThe impact of Flight Deck and our technology and operations team combined is delivering better operational outcomes with substantial momentum. In Q2, material input at our priority supplier sites was up 10% sequentially. Stability also continued to improve with suppliers delivering more than 95% of committed volume, up nearly twofold versus early last year. This contributed significantly to Q2 output. CES services revenue was up nearly 30% year-over-year, supported by internal shop visit revenue up more than 20%, and spare parts revenue up over 25%.\nTotal engine deliveries were up 45% with commercial up 37%, including LEAP up 38%, and defense up 84%.\nThrough the first half, we've delivered 12% growth in commercial units, including LEAP, up 10%, and 37% growth in defense deliveries.\nOverall material input improvement has resulted in higher inventory as we accelerate output and grow LEAP deliveries 15% to 20% here in 2025. But I do want to pause here and just thank our teams and our suppliers who are working hand in hand to deliver for our customers both near term and longer term.\nWe move to slide 11. We've won some sizable deals so far in 2025.\nI'd like to highlight a few. Qatar Airways announced a significant expansion of their fleet with a deal for over 400 GEnx engines, marking the largest widebody win in GE Aerospace history. IAG announced an agreement for 32 Boeing 787 aircraft powered by GEnx for British Airways. This further builds upon our growing backlog for GEnx and our life of program win rate now stands at 75%.\nIn defense, the US Air Force awarded a $5 billion contract for our F110 engines to meet the evolving needs of allied operators.\nToday we have more than 1,600 commercial and defense engines in backlog, and we're effectively sold out through the rest of this decade.\nTurning to slide 12, GE Aerospace is a business with tremendous competitive advantages built on decades of experience and significant investment.\nWith the world's largest installed base of engines, we've accumulated over 2.3 billion flight hours, providing us with unmatched insights on performance, opportunities for improvement, and future breakthroughs. Add to that our R&D investment of approximately $3 billion in 2025, or 6% to 8% of revenue per year. We're well positioned to enhance our foundational and current generation platforms while inventing the future of flight.\nHere's a specific example. Composite fan blades, a technology that only GE Aerospace and our partners have in service today.\nCompared to traditional metal blades, these lighter and stronger fan blades were first introduced on the GE90. Now with over 140 million flight hours on more than 2,500 engines in service, these blades are helping us deliver industry-leading departure reliability.\nOur experience with the GE90 along with GEnx and LEAP has informed the GE9X development with fourth generation composite fan blades. These blades contribute to the platform's overall performance with enhanced durability and fuel burn.\nAnd finally, we're designing composite fan blades for the CFM RISE Program, combining 30 years of experience with continued investment to help deliver the next step change in durability and efficiency. More on that in a moment, but let me first share with you how our current generations of engines is ramping with customer needs in mind.\nLooking at slide 13, durability and reliability are the top priorities to ensure consistent performance for our customers. Leveraging our experience over multiple product generations, we're maturing technologies to deliver meaningful durability gains. Take the GEnx for example. We launched the platform back in 2011 and released our durability package back in 2021. This resulted in a more than two and a half times increase in time on wing, supporting increased utilization.\nToday, the fleet leader in hot and harsh environments is approaching 4,000 cycles and still running. This means customers are keeping engines on wing about five years between shop visits and even longer in neutral environments. This has been a differentiator for us in the marketplace, underpinning our 90% plus win rate since 2023. Through our hot and harsh experience here, we've refined durability testing to replicate dust challenges, innovate effective fixes, and validate them.\nWe're the only engine manufacturer able to leverage this extensive wide body experience for narrow body engines, which has accelerated the LEAP learning curve. Getting to mature time on wing faster, the LEAP-1A durability kit released late last year that includes the upgraded HPT blade is now incorporated into all LEAP-1A deliveries and shop visits. This will improve time on wing by more than twofold, matching our industry-leading CFM56 performance.\nNext up, we're working with Boeing to certify the LEAP-1B durability kit in H1 2026, but we haven't stopped there. As we tested the upgraded HPT blade, our teams leveraging Flight Deck found further design improvements which are already certified and set to enter production in H2 2025, further enhancing HPT blade producibility.\nThese durability enhancements have supported a win rate of over 70% on the A320 family since 2023.\nTurning to Slide 14, we're also using our experience to enhance new engine platforms before they enter service. Starting with the GE9X, the most tested engine in GE Aerospace history with more than 30,000 cycles, the equivalent of six years of commercial flying. Drawing on our Gen X and LEAP experience, this is the first time we've completed dust testing prior to launch, which has informed product enhancements such as the second iteration of the HPT blades.\nImportantly, we're ensuring that the GE9X is as close to maturity as it can be at launch.\nWe're also progressing the CFM RISE program, our most ambitious and transformative technological effort underway to date. We've completed over 350 program tests with an early focus on durability. This includes advancing new HPT blade cooling technology and testing full-size fan blades along with more than 3,000 endurance cycles. In early this year, at the Airbus Summit, we outlined our vision for the future of propulsion with Open Fan technology.\nAirbus and CFM teams continue to work together on engine and airframe integration as we look forward to engine ground-level and flight tests this decade.\nBig picture, we're continuously applying learnings and improving durability to advance new programs, ensuring we deliver the best performing engines for our customers.\nSpending another moment on CFM RISE, which will be a game changer for customers prioritizing safety, durability, and efficiency. Looking at the Open Fan architecture. First, on safety. Leveraging our experience with composite fan blades, the Open Fan will spin slower at 1/6 the speed of a traditional jet engine. This helps provide a safe flying experience even without a nacelle, and we also expect will result in a quieter engine than today's LEAP.\nTurning to durability, RISE's Open Fan architecture gains efficiency through the fan system rather than the core. This reduces the need to push the core to higher temperatures as much as a ducted engine, a key driver of today's engine removals. Finally, efficiency. Our customers need at least a 20% reduction in fuel burn to support investments in next-generation technology. In our view, the Open Fan is the most promising path to accomplish this step. Change in efficiency.\nWhen it comes to delivering greater durability and fuel burn, we won't compromise on either, as we recognize both are critical for our customers. With RISE, we believe we can accomplish the genius of the LEAP and meeting customer needs for durability and delivering fuel efficiency.\nTurning to slide 16, we're pursuing similar generational advancements in military propulsion. In the US, we completed testing on the XA100 adaptive cycle engine, demonstrating significant gains in thrust and range. Building on that success, we're now progressing to the XA102, aligned with the US Air Force's Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion, or NGAP, program.\nImportantly, earlier this month Congress funded $750 million for the F/A-XX through the reconciliation bill in the coming years and the US Navy recognized its need for a sixth generation fighter is the only platform capable of delivering the combination of range, stealth, advanced sensors, and standoff capabilities necessary to operate across mission sets in highly contested environments. We stand ready to deliver and encourage the Pentagon to move forward with this important program that Congress has already funded.\nThrough Avio Aero. We represent Italy as an equal propulsion partner with the UK and Japan in the Global Combat Air Program, a next-gen indigenous European fighter. We're actively investing to support a targeted 2035 entry into service, and at the same time with Kratos, we're advancing propulsion technologies for affordable unmanned aerial systems by the end of the decade.\nAnd to accelerate development of advanced hypersonic propulsion systems. We recently announced significant investments in our test infrastructure at select manufacturing sites, enabling us to conduct higher Mach mission-relevant testing.\nInventing the future of flight has always motivated the GE Aerospace team. We're building upon our leadership positions across both defense and commercial.\nShifting to the outlook on slide 17, Rahul will cover the second quarter results momentarily, but so far in 2025, we're off to an excellent start, enabling us to raise both our near- and longer-term outlook.\nFor 2028. We're raising our outlook for profit and free cash flow by $1.5 billion versus our prior view, driven by strong operating and commercial services performance.\nWe expect to sustain strong adjusted revenue growth at a double-digit compounded rate, which will be supported by robust demand for services and equipment. We expect to drive meaningful operating leverage over that period with adjusted EPS reaching roughly $8.4. Operating profit is expected to reach approximately $11.5 billion with margins expanding to more than 21%, and we expect to generate substantial free cash flow of at least $8.5 billion with conversion around 100%.\nAll in, this represents operating profit growth of more than $3 billion compared to our updated 2025 guide, driven by commercial services. We're well-positioned for continued value creation for years to come. Let me pass it over to Rahul.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nLarry, thank you and good morning everyone. Starting with the results, we had a strong second quarter with improvement across all key metrics. Orders were up 27%. Revenue was over $10 billion, up 23%, with CES growing 30% and DPT up 7%. Profit was $2.3 billion, up over $400 million or 23%, driven by services volume and price which supported margins reaching 23%.\nEPS of $1.66 was up 38% from profit growth, a favorable tax rate, lower interest expense, and a reduced share count. Free cash flow was $2.1 billion, nearly doubling over last year. Looking closer at our businesses, CES delivered an excellent quarter with demand remaining robust. Orders for services were up 28% and equipment was up 26%. Continued demand combined with material input improvement drove meaningful revenue growth. Service revenue was up 29% with spare parts revenue up more than 25% from higher volume and price.\nThis included strong CFM56 shop visit growth and higher LEAP third party shop visits.\nInternal shop visit revenue grew more than 20% from higher output, increased work scopes, and price. This included LEAP internal shop visit volume growth of over 20%. Equipment revenue grew 35% with spare engine ratio down sequentially, and year- over-year. As expected.\nProfit was $2.2 billion, up 33% primarily from services volume. CES margins expanded 50 basis points to 27.9%, moving to DPT. Higher output supported a solid quarter. Orders were up 24% year-over-year with defense book-to-bill of 1.2x. Revenue grew 7% with defense and systems up 6%, and propulsion and additive technologies up 9%. Profit was roughly $360 million, up 5% on a tough compare. Volume, productivity, and price more than offset self-funded next-gen investments and inflation; margins declined 20 basis points to 14.1% at the mid-year mark.\nWe've delivered high-teens revenue growth, $1 billion of operating profit growth, and nearly $800 million of higher free cash flow. Given the strength of our first half results and our expectations for remainder of the year, we are raising our 2025 guidance across the board.\nWe now expect total revenue growth of mid teens up from low double digits. With the absence of reciprocal tariffs in China thus far, we currently see reduced risk for spare engines and spare part deliveries, and material availability is improving, supporting higher spare parts growth. Therefore, we are increasing revenue growth expectations for commercial services to high teens and commercial equipment to high teens to 20%. This supports total CES revenue growth of high teens. Our DPT expectations are unchanged from mid to high single digit revenue growth.\nFor total operating profit, we now expect to be in a range of $8.2 to 8.5 billion, up $350 million at the midpoint versus our April guide from improved services outlook, and we now expect adjusted EPS of $5.60 to $5.80, growing over 20% at the midpoint year-over-year, reflecting higher operating profit and a reduced tax rate.\nAdditionally, as we shared in April, heightened tariffs are resulting in additional costs for us and our supply chain. We are continuing to make progress on our operational plans to reduce the impact. Assuming that reciprocal tariffs are implemented after the current pause, we still expect the net impact of tariffs to be roughly $500 million in 2025, which we are offsetting through cost controls and pricing actions.\nWe now expect free cash flow to be in a range of $6.5 to 6.9 billion, up from $6.3 to 6.8 billion, driven by our improved profit outlook. With this raise, we expect to grow operating profit by over $1 billion for second year in a row with free cash flow conversion remaining solidly above 100%.\nNow as we look at the longer term outlook on slide 20, win rates continue to be strong, backlog is at record levels, we are making operational progress to improve durability and delivery, and defense spending remains resilient. With this backdrop, we are expecting that the improvement in 2025 guidance will carry through to our 2028 outlook. Starting with revenue, we now expect double-digit growth on an annualized basis between 2024 and 2028.\nThe main drivers will be growth in commercial installed base largely from LEAP and GEnx, an increase in work scopes as our fleets mature, supporting 25% growth in widebody revenue per shop visit, favorable mix in defense with rising international defense shipments, and mid single-digit growth or low single-digit net price increases. Higher revenue will support double-digit profit growth with profit reaching approximately $11.5 billion in 2028.\nThis growth, plus benefits from share buyback and a lower tax rate, will drive mid-teens EPS growth, and we expect to convert 100% of net income to free cash flow, reaching roughly $8.5 billion of cash by 2028. Our updated outlook for profit and free cash flow both represent a raise of $1.5 billion versus our prior outlook.\nOn Slide 21. Looking closer at our profit growth drivers between 2025 and 2028, starting on the left at our new 2025 profit midpoint of $8.35 billion, the most significant driver of profit growth will be nearly $8 billion of commercial services revenue growth between 2025 and 2028. This will be partially offset by a mid-teens increase in equipment revenue, including higher LEAP and GE9X shipments and the normalization of spare engine ratio.\nWe expect incremental GE9X losses of a few hundred million dollars in 2028 versus 2025. Given higher volume, DPT revenue growth of mid-single digits at improving margins will also contribute to profit growth.\nGiven ongoing supply chain constraints, we expect material inflation to stay elevated, but pricing actions should more than offset that impact, and we are leveraging Flight Deck to drive two points of productivity annually as we reduce waste by lowering the non-productive and overtime in our shops, and increase output per employee. At the same time, we're stepping up R&D investments to improve LEAP durability, support the GE9X ramp, and advanced technologies supporting the future of flight.\nOverall, these actions will add more than $3 billion of profit between 2025 and 2028. Despite the introduction of a new widebody platform and significant new product ramps, double-digit annualized growth in services will support margin expansion.\nLet's unpack commercial services revenue in slide 22. As you can see, both narrowbody and widebody are well positioned to deliver sustainable growth. Today, CFM engines power approximately 75% of industry's narrowbody flights. This share continues to increase as the LEAP fleet is expected to grow roughly 3x by 2030. Narrowbody revenue is exceeding our prior expectations, driven by LEAP growth and the extended longevity of the CFM56 fleet.\nAs a result, we now expect narrowbody revenue to grow at a low double-digit CAGR, and 2028 revenue to be approximately 15% higher than our expectations last March.\nOur widebody business remains a significant differentiator. We currently power more than half of industry's departures. We expect to maintain this position with GE9X, doubling its installed base by the end of the decade and continued utilization of GE90 fleet and the introduction of GE9X. We anticipate widebody services revenue will grow at high single digit CAGR through 2030, including GE9X at a low double digit CAGR.\nTaken together, the strength of our foundational fleets, combined with our installed base growth, supports the annualized double digit services revenue growth.\nMoving to slide 23 on Commercial Services revenue growth and how that will translate into significant profit improvement. Narrowbody profit is expected to rise over 70% primarily from LEAP, with CFM56 continuing to contribute meaningfully, and by the end of the decade we expect LEAP and CFM56 profit to reach parity, reflecting the maturity and the scale of the LEAP program.\nWidebody profit is expected to grow more than 40%, supported by installed base growth and higher work scope shop visits for both GE90 and GEnx. We also expect contributions from productivity, pricing, and favorable mix as external shop visits increase. Even with LEAP shop visit volume growing at a 25% CAGR through 2030, we expect CES margins to stay at current levels as you're offsetting the impact of LEAP with better performance on other platforms.\nAltogether, we expect services profit to grow over 50% between 2024 and 2028, with contributions from both foundational and current generation programs.\nGoing deeper into the outlook for our foundational fleets on slide 24. Currently, approximately 40% of the CFM56 fleet has yet to undergo a first shop visit, and a majority of the operators anticipate keeping these engines in service well into the 2000s. This sustained demand is resulting in fewer retirements. We expect retirements of around 1.5% in 2025, rising to 2% to 3% in 2026 before normalizing at 3% to 4%.\nIncreased shop visit activity, which we expect to peak in 2027 with approximately 600 additional shop visits through 2028 compared to our outlook last March.\nWe expect a gradual decline in volume post 2027 to roughly 2,000 shop visits by the end of the decade. With this shop visit outlook, we expect CFM56 revenue peaks in 2018, underpinned by increased work scopes and pricing. We are seeing similar dynamics with GE90. Continued strong demand for freighter aircraft, coupled with a more gradual widebody production ramp, is extending the services demand across this fleet.\nWe now expect internal shop visits for GE90 to grow through 2028, representing approximately 100 incremental visits compared to our outlook last March. As a reminder, widebody shop visits can be more than 2x the revenue of a narrowbody shop visit, so this is a significant contributor to higher revenue. In addition, the scope for widebody shop visits typically increases by about 50% during the second shop visits.\nWith approximately 70% of the GE90 fleet yet to undergo a second shop visit, this dynamic is contributing to higher growth. Better performance from both CFM56 and GE90 is a key driver of our improved outlook compared to last March.\nAnother significant contributor to our profit outlook is the growing LEAP aftermarket on slide 25.\nOverall, the LEAP install base will approximately triple by the end of the decade, with internal shop visits growing roughly at the same pace. Beyond revenue, we are focused on improving the profitability of services as the program matures. Touching on a couple of ways we are improving performance. First, we expect external shop budgets to grow from 10% of the total in 2024 to 15% in 2025 to 30% by the end of the decade. This increased volume drives spare part sales and offers a mix benefit.\nSecond, we expect to continue benefiting from catalog price increases. More importantly, we've significantly improved pricing in new service contracts as we move past launch. While these increases take time to materialize in the financials, higher shop visit pricing, combined with improved time on wing, will support improved services profitability.\nWe continue to expect approximately 70% of LEAP shop visits to be performed by CFM, split equally between our JV partner Safran and us. To further reduce shop visit cost, we are investing in repair technology, which typically costs roughly 50% less than new parts. This offers customers significant economic benefit, while also reducing turnaround time as we do not have to wait for new material.\nYear to date, we have developed over 200 new repairs for LEAP and 1,000 repairs across the commercial engines business. Our goal is to more than double the number of LEAP-specific repairs by 2028. For context, we've developed nearly 3,000 repairs over the lifetime of the GE90 program, and we are targeting a similar number for LEAP at maturity.\nThese actions give us confidence that we can navigate the impact from CFM56 retirement and that LEAP will not only equal CFM56 profit by the end of the decade, but the profitability levels will continue to improve beyond that. Now let's turn to how we plan to continue converting this profit growth into cash. We added approximately $3 billion of inventory between 2023 and 2024, and as a result, our inventory turns declined by about half a point.\nThe majority of this increase is due to trapped inventory material we purchased but can't yet use because we don't have all the parts needed to complete a shop visit or deliver an engine. As material availability and stability improve, we expect inventory turns to begin recovering. We see a clear opportunity to improve at least one full turn from 2024 to 2028.\nWe'll get there by reducing work in progress and raw material inventory, driven by better flow and continued implementation of a pool-based system with our suppliers. If you look to the right-hand side of the page, you will see a growing installed base and increasing flight departures are fueling strong growth in billings. Take LEAP, for example. Billings are expected to grow 2.5x between 2024 and 2028. For GEnx, we expect 1.5x increase over the same period.\nGiven shop visit growth, the cash flow from contract assets will not contribute at the same levels as the last couple of years, but billings growth on these contracts continues to support cash flow growth. This gives us a clear roadmap to sustain cash conversion at or above 100% through 2028. To summarize, GE Aerospace is a business with solid operational and financial fundamentals.\nRevenue growth will be driven by positive secular trends, our growing installed base, and our best in class products, technology, and people. Profit growth will be driven by volume, productivity, and price, offsetting the typical headwinds associated with new product introductions. Given this strong profit and cash performance, we have ample opportunity to compound shareholder returns. I'll now pass it back to Larry to cover capital allocation and share some closing remarks.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nLarry, Rahul, thank you pulling this all together on slide 27 as Rahul just walked you through. Our operating performance and robust commercial services outlook underpins our increased guidance of sustainable revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth. 2024 was a strong year with approximately $1 billion more in operating profit than we had originally expected at the start of the year. In 2025, we're again performing ahead of our expectations and raising guidance across all key metrics.\nCompared to our 2024 Investor Day outlook, this represents an increase of more than $1 billion in operating profit. Importantly, we expect this momentum extends into 2028, with operating profit growing more than $3 billion and free cash flow growing over $1.5 billion versus 2025. We're also leveraging our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation to support mid-teens EPS growth.\nWith respect to capital allocation, our principles remain the same. First, we will invest in the business to support growth in current and future programs. Next, we have a bias toward returning cash to shareholders, and expect we'll return more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders through 2026. Last year we shared plans to return roughly $19 billion of cash to shareholders between 2024 and 2026. Between dividends and buybacks, now subject to board approval, we're increasing that to $24 billion, including about $19 billion of buybacks, and roughly $5 billion of dividends.\nAt roughly 30% of net income, this is 20% higher than what we discussed a year ago. Beyond 2026, we expect to return at least 70% of free cash flow annually through a combination of dividends and buybacks.\nFinally, we're open to opportunistic bolt-on M&A with a high threshold for strategic, operational, and financial fit.\nWe believe this balanced and disciplined approach best supports our goal of compounding long-term shareholder returns.\nTo close on slide 29, our strong operational and financial foundation supports our increased outlook, and our sustained competitive advantages will propel us to new heights. We have a diversified fleet of preferred platforms across the narrowbody, widebody, and defense sectors. What we do and how we do it matter. Front and center are safety, quality, delivery, and cost, always in that order. Our services and technology offer industry-leading operational reliability, including greater efficiency, extended time on wing, and faster turnaround times.\nWe serve the industry's largest fleet of 78,000 engines with unrivaled customer service and flight support. This keeps us close to our customers through decade-long life cycles, building meaningful relationships, and making us the partner of choice.\nOur talented engineering teams continue to develop breakthrough innovation to support our existing fleet, and advanced next generation technology.\nFlight Deck supports us in delivering results and lasting value for our customers and shareholders.\nWe're still far from reaching our full potential, yet we couldn't be more optimistic about our path ahead. We appreciate you joining us for this extended call on both the quarter and our revised outlook. With that, I'll throw it back to Blaire for questions.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nBefore we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question, so that we can get to as many people as possible. Liz, can you please open the line?\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone. If you wish to withdraw your question or your question has already been answered, please press star one one again.\nOur first question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector and Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, Scott.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector and Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nRahul. The high end of the 2025 guide implies second half EBIT nearly $500 million lower than the first half. Over the last few years, the second half EBIT has actually been trending around $400 million higher than the first half. Your guide essentially has nearly a $1 billion spread versus the seasonality you've demonstrated over the last few years. I understand there's this GE9X headwind this year, but it is a very stark difference versus typical earnings cadence. Just wondering if you can reconcile that second half EBIT decline for us.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah, Scott, let me try. Larry, please jump in here. Scott, first, we're having a good year, right? Raised our revenue growth expectations from low double digit to mid teens, so about $900 million of increase in revenue at the midpoint with about $350 million of profit increase at the midpoint versus April. We had a better second quarter than we expected. If you look at a $350 million split, $350 million profit increase, it is split between what our overperformance in the second quarter and raising our expectations for the second half of the year.\nThe first half, second half thing, we've been, you know, we expected a strong start for the year this year, and we've been striving to have a more linear year than we did in 2024.\nGiven the OE ramp in the second half of the year, including 9X shipments, we expected a couple of million dollars of headwind versus the prior year and also expected a lower spare engine ratio in the second half. The corporate expenses also typically step up in the second half of the year. You can see that in the corporate expenses in the first half versus what we are projecting for the full year. There is an R&D step up between the first half and second half as well. These expectations around all these factors have not changed from where we were back in April.\nWe are maintaining some conservatism around departures that Larry mentioned in his prepared remarks, which impacts our expectations for spare part sales in the second half.\nEven with that, we're kind of expecting a mid-teen services revenue growth in the second half. If you look at all of that, we should still see strong year-over-year profit growth in the second half at the midpoint of the guide. Overall, we feel better about the year than we did back in April. If you step back, it should be another year of more than $1 billion of profit growth and $1.025 billion at the high end.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector and Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank.\nYou.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Good presentation. I wanted to touch on two assumptions if I could. One is the pricing assumption through 2028, 2024 to 2028, and the low single digit assumption there. What would that imply for the go forward period 2026 through 2028? It would seem like it would imply no pricing. On the retirement step up to 3% to 4%, can you just give us some baseline as to for the last decade, CFM56 has been running about 1.5%? Is there a prior period where you'd put this as similar, where you'd have that quick of a step up in retirement rates?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nMyles maybe I'll speak to price and Rahul can take retirements. I think if you just step back for a moment, I think you know, well, our pricing philosophy, we make significant investments in next generation platforms, obviously provide a lot of value to our customers while taking on considerable risk. We really try to price more broadly with appropriate returns around those commitments in mind. I think the way we looked at price here is really.\nTo have price more than offset inflation in 2025 between what we're doing in CES services, you know, call it up at a mid single digit level on a net basis. That includes spare parts, right, where in some instances we might do a little bit better than that. It's really dependent on which program we're talking about. I think as we look forward.\nWe're probably looking at something on a mid single digit basis at a gross level, low single digit on a net basis, at least with respect to spare parts. Also, keep in mind that as we move past launch, I think Rahul touched on this in his prepared remarks. We anticipate to see better pricing dynamics, and fundamentally it's all about moving beyond launch. Right. LEAP is well into the life cycle now, but it does take time to see that fall through. Typically, call it eight years thereabouts post an agreement to really see that in the P&L.\nA lot of volume here, work scope expansion in a number of areas, a little bit of price, that's how you get to that double digit top line number that we're looking at between now and 2028. Rahul, did you want to talk to retirements?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah, I can talk retirements. Myles, you're right. I mean, the last couple of years have been really low. I mean, even this year, through the first six months of the year, retirements for CFM56 have been running below where we were in 2024. If I remember correctly, 2024 was below 2023. The retirements have been trending extremely low. As you would expect, as the fleet ages, this should pick up, right? That's been our expectation. Now, we've been proven wrong on that one before.\nUltimately, what it comes down to is what do you expect in new aircraft deliveries and where you expect departure growth to be. What's built into our assumptions is that both Airbus and Boeing kind of reach their stated goals over the next three to four years.\nIf you add up what Airbus aims to deliver and you add up what Boeing aims to deliver, that leads to about a 6% to 7% increase in, you know, installed base growth right over where, you know, 19,000 to 20,000 narrow body aircraft that are flying today. You say, okay, the departures, we expect the departures to be up, call it 3% or so, you know, low single digits, and you can say 3% to 4%. That gets us to our ratio of 3% to 4% somewhere in that zone.\nNow, we don't have a precise insight into that number, but I think we decided, Myles, so that everybody understands our fundamental assumptions going into what we are projecting for CFM56 shop visits, because that's the fundamental driver of where the shop visits are going to be and the number that we'll see. So that's our.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nThank you, Myles.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, guys.\nThank you.\nMaybe if we could talk about.\nLEAP aftermarket profitability. It's been a major contributor to CES performance year to date. Can you talk about, you talked about profits equal in the 2030 timeframe, which based on the revenue buckets you give, would mean margins pretty close to CFM56 levels. If you could talk a bit about the margin profile across CSAs and external for LEAP and how that progresses today to 2028 to 2030.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah, sure.\nWe, you know, overall we're very pleased with how LEAP is progressing. Right. If you, you know, we're kind of hitting our key milestones here for LEAP both on financial performance and operational performance, and the share has been higher than what we expected. Financially, we've always targeted the program to break even this year, and that's on track. We expected OE to break even next year. That's on track.\nObviously, the installed base, as we said in our prepared remarks, we expect the installed base to be up 3x. If you look at fundamental what are the drivers of LEAP service profitability, I would say there are a few. One, as the LEAP shop visits grow.\nWe will leverage our fixed investments in the MRO shops at a greater rate. The fixed cost will get utilized at a higher rate. Therefore, that should help improve the profitability. The second is around price. You know, we spoke about kind of the mid single digit growth, low single digit pricing on CLP, plus the pricing discipline that we've been driving for pricing new shop visits. That's the second piece in the LEAP puzzle. The third, I would say, is the growing aftermarket channel.Again, I said that earlier. We expect about 30% of the shop visits to be external.\nBy the time we get to 2030, that drives the spare parts revenue stream, which is now beginning to grow as we get into 2025, but will continue to expand. The last piece is going to be repairs. I mean, I think we spoke about it in our prepared remarks as well. You saw that when we were together in Celma, you know, some initial work that we started to do around that. You know, that's the final piece, and I think you put all that together. We are seeing good progress on LEAP service profitability in 2025, and I think that will continue to improve as we get into the outer years.\nProfit equals CFM56 margins. Profit equals CFM56 by 2030. Overall, I would say the LEAP service margins should start approaching our overall service margins by the time we get into that time frame.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nGood morning. Thank you.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, Doug.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nI'd like to discontinue on that topic because when you look out, first I wanted to make sure to clarify when you said LEAP services profitability should be comparable to overall service profitability or specifically to CFM56. I guess the question I have is you're at the very early stages in terms of performance restoration, shop visits, so a lot of the heavy work. How do you get comfortable in projecting what, you know, so far out, five years out, to really have the confidence you're going to be able to get to those margins that are like CFM56?Yeah. Well.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace",
    "content2": "Doug, just to clarify my comment.\nHere.\nWhen Sheila asked about the service margins, our comment was that LEAP service margins should equal overall service margins, not CFM56. Right. Just to clarify that, they should be close to the overall service margin levels. That's one. Second, if you look at the trajectory, and I can start and Larry can jump in here, I mean, part of that is improvement in LEAP durability. If you see the improvement here that we've seen over the last couple of years, everything that we've been speaking to and driving to, we've been hitting those milestones.\nObviously, LEAP-1A durability is now at CFM56 levels for everything that we are shipping now and everything that we are overhauling in our MRO shops. That's one.\nIf you look at our trajectory on GE90 or GEnx, you know, 60% to 70% of those fleets are under a long term service agreement, and the profitability on those programs is above our overall service profitability. We have enough experience with these long term service agreements that, you know, we can do this, we can do it right. We're conservative in how we model it. With improvement in durability, that's the, you know, that's the remaining piece of the puzzle, which we feel much better about today than we did a couple of years ago. Larry, anything you want to add?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nNo, I think you hit it right. We try to model conservatively up front, continue to push product performance, witness the durability kit with LEAP, and make sure that we are executing not only from a safety quality perspective, but from a delivery cost perspective. Whether it be the fixed cost leverage you talked about, the variable cost improvements we ought to get from repairs, let alone the turnaround effect we see from repairs, there are a whole host of things that help the bottom line, put it all together. You get our outlook here at least through 2028.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nVery good. Thank you.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nThank you, Doug.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Scott Mikus with Melius Research.\n\nScott Mikus\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Melius Research\n\nMorning, Larry and Rahul.\nNice quarter and good presentation.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks, Scott. Good morning.\n\nScott Mikus\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Melius Research\n\nI wanted to ask a question about the new HPT blades and the LEAP-1A and LEAP-1B that should result in better margins on both, just through spare part sales, but also by extending the time on wing for the CSA contracts. I'm just wondering how long are you expecting it to take to retrofit the roughly 9,000 plus LEAPs that are already delivered? As those retrofits happen, should we expect you to be booking favorable contract margin reviews as those retrofits ramp up?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nScott, maybe just a couple of key markers here. Again, we received certification for the durability kit for the LEAP-1A late last year. I think Rahul mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're now fully in production both with Newmake and in the aftermarket. We're not going to go out necessarily and try to upgrade everybody overnight. That will be a multi-year process as the field of engines come in for their next shop visit. Think years, not months in that regard.\nClearly, as we talk about the LEAP installed base growing by, what, a factor of 3 between now and 2030, all of those as will be covered. We updated the outlook here for the durability kit for the LEAP-1B.\nThinking about early next year, we'll go through a similar process in feathering that in both with respect to Newmake and in the aftermarket, and again with respect to the fleet that's out there, upgrade those as they come in. You put that together, I think we are again encouraged with the outlook here, in part because of the improved durability performance. We know that's top of mind for customers, but in turn, we also are going to have a more producible blade that is going to help us.\nIt's already helping us on the LEAP-1A deliver better output. Part of the services revenue number, even in the quarter here up 29%, is a function of improved supply chain performance to include, but not limited to, the new HPT blade.\n\nScott Mikus\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Melius Research\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Seth Seifman with JP Morgan.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thanks very much and good morning.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nMorning, Seth.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nI wanted to ask about the trajectory of margin going into next year given kind of the step down that's implied for the second half. When we think about, you know, we look at it 2028 and we see something that's, you know, above where we are this year and last year. There's a starting point potentially in the second half of this year that's considerably lower. How do we think about how we bridge there kind of from the second half of this year through 2026 and then getting to that destination in 2028?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah, Seth, as we think about 2026 first, there's tons of momentum coming out of 2025. You know, we spoke earlier about improved our revenue expectations, we improved our profit expectations, and you know, part of that is just driven by our supply chain improvements. Part of that is driven by the macro environment being slightly better than what we thought back in April. It's a combination of factors that's allowing us to improve our 2025 outlook, and those things should continue into 2026 as well. Now as you think about 2026 specifically.\nWe take the different pieces of our business on commercial equipment, sufficient backlog extends multiple years. As Larry said in his prepared remarks, we kind of sold out through the end of the decade. We are not expecting a big disruption. We expect to kind of stay the course here with improving our engine output and improving shipments. On the commercial services side, there is some uncertainty in the environment, but it feels a lot better than it did three months ago. Right.\nMore importantly, as you think about our business, our basic growth algorithm of the business has not changed. Right.\nOn the services side, even in an uncertain economic environment, you know, you talk about, you know, LEAP installed base growth, you talk about LEAP share of cycles being up almost six points versus where we were in 2023, you know, the number of engines coming off wing that is going to be up in 2025, that's going to be up in 2026, you know, and that is irrespective of number of cycles they're going to fly now, that's just the number of cycles they've previously flown. That is good as well.\nWe are increasing the wide-body work scopes, you know, combine that with a mid single-digit price increase. All that gives us reasonable confidence about our service business as we think about 2026 and achieving the growth targets that we've outlined.\nOn DPT, you know, it should be steady. You know, business got $20 billion backlog today, so that should be good as well. While the economy may play a role here, I think overall we feel good. In regards to your question around second half to 2026, I just would not index too much on a quarter or a half, right, because there are factors that can impact performance. If you look at the second half, I think we spoke earlier about corporate expenses being more skewed towards the second half, R&D being.\nStepping up here between first half and second half. Same thing you take with the 9X shipments. They're all sitting in the second half versus being split throughout the year. I would, you know, as you think about run rating into 2026, I think the full year is a better baseline just to normalize those things, and then you project forward.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat, thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Gavin Parsons with UBS.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks, guys. Good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nMorning.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYou know, obviously strong CES order growth in the quarter, but you still do have that conservatism in the second half of the year that you talked about. Is that informed by behavior changes from airlines, your conversations with customers, or just erring on the side of caution? You know, as MAX and LEAP deliveries ramp up, are you hearing any fleet planning changes in terms of retirements from your customers?\nThanks,\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGavin. I would.\nTo the first question, I don't think we've got a tremendously different perspective on the second half here today than we did 90 days ago.\nRight.\nWe've got a second quarter where departures were in line with the first, up 4%. We watch that on a daily basis. We've said for the full year we think we'll end up being up low single digits, which would suggest a flattish, slightly up back half. I don't think our commentary in that regard is too far out of line with.\nWhat you're hearing from the airline. Some have suggested maybe that's a touch conservative. We've been called worse. We'll take that. I think with respect to skylines, I don't think we've seen any change in customer behavior, whether it be what we're doing with Boeing on the MAX, on the widebody platforms, with Airbus on the neo.\nThose backlogs are real. Those annual step ups in production are where we're focused.\nAt every turn. We haven't really seen that evolve or change. In many respects, you put that together, it's what undergirds the outlook. The improvement in the outlook for 2028. Right. The foundational platforms are going to be used for longer, be it in the narrow body or the wide body space. We know we have a lot of not only demand to service, but momentum in doing so as we think about how Flight Deck is helping us improve deliveries.\nAnytime you print a new LEAP engine increase of 45% year-over-year, you know you've got momentum. Again, shout out to the supply base. They're working hard, working well, working with us. In terms of customer behavioral changes, we really haven't seen much new or different in that regard over the last 90 days.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nI appreciate it.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey. Yeah, good morning, guys.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGoodmorning, Ron.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nIt seems like since the Paris Air Show, the discussion around RISE has changed. It really does seem like you all feel much more confident in the technology and in the program. In fact, you know, your competitors, you know, trying to say, no, no, no, that won't work. It really does seem like there's flags getting put in the ground. I guess broadly, what makes you all feel so good about RISE today? If it doesn't end up being an unducted fan, is there a ducted option?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nRon, we're really looking forward to putting the full team on stage in Paris. I think everybody understands why we adjusted that original plan and are here in an abbreviated form.\nI'm glad you think we planted the flag. It was a flag we planted several years ago at the air show, but we were going to be as full throated in Paris as hopefully we are today with respect to our confidence, and our optimism about the RISE development program, technology development program. Just as a reminder for everybody, and in particular the open fan architecture, why to your first question, do we feel so good about it?\nI think it's really a combination of all the progress that we're making in the labs. Again, I'll underscore technology development, but we now have over 350 program tests at the module subsystem level that is not only focused on that propulsive efficiency gain we talk so much about, but also durability.\nTo be able to again leverage everything that we've done, not only in predecessor wide body platforms, but narrow body here as well, I think just sets us up to have confidence to go with this architecture. More to come. This is a multi-year effort, ground test, flight test, all of that. I think when you combine that with what we're hearing from so many in the industry who understand the pivot to relying more on propulsive than thermal efficiency.\nWe had Mohamed Ali, who runs technology and operations, up on stage in Toulouse just a couple of months ago talking about the joint work we're doing with Airbus in that instance, and their own thoughts around what that next generation aerobody is going to require in the latter part of the next decade. We're all in.\nRon, on Open Fan, not to be strident about it, but really to just make sure that we're making the investments today and all the underlying technology components that are going to deliver on that next generation narrow body propulsion platform that the industry will need.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThanks.\nGood morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nMorning, David.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning,\nDavid\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nwanted to ask a couple questions on the OE side of things, I.\nGuess, first of all, starting with 9X, the production rate assumptions that are underlying your, your loss forecast on the 9X.\nIf you can give us some detail.\nWhat you're assuming for LEAP deliveries.\nOut in 2028, and then how much you think you know better LEAP profitability.\nOn the OE side, and GEnx profitability can offset some of that incremental GE9X headwind.\nThanks.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nOkay.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nI'm taking notes here, David, as I'm trying to answer the question.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nThere are a few there. I think he started on the 9X and thus the 777X. Maybe it's context. Right. We're excited to be underway. We have started shipping engines to Boeing and are working with them, as you would imagine, on EIS. I think we're encouraged by what we hear from customers. Right. Witness the 60% win rate versus competition. We've got over 1,000 engines now in backlog, so the market really wants to see this.\nPlatform, this engine come forward. We know that at EIS, it will be the most tested engine, really, in the company's history. We've got over 30,000 cycles behind us now, 8,000 endurance cycles. That's a significant test regimen. Again, leveraging what we've learned, particularly in hot and harsh environments, we've got over 1,600 dust ingestion tests that are behind us. We continue to learn and iterate there. I think we're on our second generation, both the HPT blades and the CMC nozzles.\nA lot happening in this regard. Rahul, maybe you can hit some of the modeling assumptions, but we're excited to be underway, and I think this is going to be a winning platform in the marketplace.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah, absolutely. On the losses, I think Larry touched on some of the trends that are underpinning this, David. We shipped our first engines to Boeing last year, and we're increasing our shipments to Boeing this year and in 2025.\nAll in the second half of the year. These are initial shipments with kind of the highest losses. We do expect a couple of hundred million dollars of profit headwind in 2025, and that is no change to prior expectations. Now we're working to get the cost down. We expect to take about 30% of the cost out by the time we hit the 50th unit, another 30% out by the time we get to the 250th engine. We will start moving past kind of, you know, peak losses, which we expect a year after.\nEntry into service for the, for the platform. Right. Which we are still expecting that to be in 2026.\nSo.\nAs you think about the 2028 guidance that we provided, you know, the losses per engine start to come down. Still, since the volume is still growing, we do expect the losses to be a few hundred million dollars higher in 2028 versus where we are in 2025. You're seeing then we move past that, and we expect the program to get profitable as we get into the 2030s. That's our expectation of the LEAP trajectory. I think, Larry, sort of a question on LEAP volume, if you want to take that.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah, I think David was asking about 28, if I heard him correctly, just maybe to back up for a moment. I think we're again encouraged by the momentum we've got not only here in the quarter, but in the half, right, quarters. Up new make 38% for the first half, year-over-year, up 10. I think that as we generate more momentum with Flight Deck, as past the labor disruption they had in the second quarter, we're still confident around our deliveries for this year. We've said previously we'd be up 15% to 20%.\nNo change in that outlook here in 2025. That puts us, I think, on a path to deliver, what, 2,500 LEAPs in 2028. Plenty of work to do not only with Safran, but all of our suppliers. That's what we're here for. I think we can look at the second quarter and the first half and point to a number of signs of improving performance.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks for hitting them all.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGlad we caught them all.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, Cowen\n\nThanks.\nGood morning and nice presentation, guys.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nMorning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nThank you. Good morning.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, Cowen\n\nI was wondering if you could elaborate on the state of the supply chain.\nYou guys have given us good updates.\nIn the past, how that's progressing.\nWhere the pinch points still are, also.\nIf you could just comment on your.\nExpectations of gross inflation over the supply chain, inflation over the forecast period. Thanks.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nSure. Well.\nYou know, again, I think with the proof points that we've shared this morning, not only in terms of output, but also input, I think we're really encouraged by what we're able to do with Flight Deck and as a function of this new organizational construct that we put in place earlier this year, let alone what we're seeing from an input perspective from suppliers. I can remember vividly a year ago when we weren't necessarily getting what we needed in terms of volume, but the variability around delivery to expectations, to commitments, rather, was all over the place. That's just.\nHard enough to ramp. When you don't have that visibility, that certainty, it's even harder. That's why we call out not only the 10% sequential improvement first quarter to second quarter, just in sheer volume that we're getting from our critical support. Again, when we say our priority or critical supplier, we're really talking about 12 companies across 18 sites. For them to be delivering to their commitments in the 95% range just makes life a whole lot easier. Frankly, what I'm most excited about, you don't see in these numbers. We see it day in, day out.\nJust the way our supply chain, our engineering, and our quality teams have come together to be quicker, to be deeper in our technical problem solving, and to have, frankly, a higher level of expectation with respect to countermeasures, both short and long term, all the while taking that to the supply base, who I think by and large would hopefully tell you.\nOutside of our earshot that they're working with a different GE Aerospace, that we're more constructive, we're more collaborative.\nWe want to be their best customers, right, because we know there's no way we serve the airlines and the airframers who depend on us without having the best possible supply base in the world. Again, a lot of proof points here. What I see qualitatively supports that all the more. We need to do more in the second half than we did in the first half. We need to do more next year than we did this year. We'll be talking about this for a while. I don't want anyone to think, okay, well, check the supply chain box, that's done, anything.\nAgain, lots of proof points that suggest we're all moving in the right direction.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nTo hit your other point on inflation, Gautam, I think it goes hand in hand with what Larry said about the continued ramp that we need to see from our suppliers. The material delivery environment is expected to remain tight. You know, we're not expecting that this magically gets better. You see the ramp that we need to deliver on, both on the OE side and on the aftermarket side. I mean, you think about where Boeing and Airbus, the benchmarks that they are putting on.\nIn the market, the expectations will be up 50% to 60% from where we are in terms of total aircraft output in the next three years or so. You combine that with the aftermarket growth that we need to deliver on and the defense market. We expect the supply chain environment to remain tight, and that drives a higher inflationary environment than we've seen in the past. We are really not expecting any let off in the inflation that we have been seeing here over the last couple of years. We're expecting a consistent environment from where we are.\nAs you said, as we were walking through the profit drivers for 2028, we are expecting that overall, given what we've outlined in pricing this morning, the pricing will cover inflation. That's the building blocks for the 2028 profit.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nI think as we improve those deliveries, Rahul, not only in terms of volumes but just the improved linearity, right, I think about the labor productivity we saw in the second half, or, excuse me, the second quarter. I think about a number of our key facilities like Lynn that have gotten off to a very good start here in July, right. Just with those inputs coming in at a higher level, coming in more predictably in a more linear fashion, we're just able to mitigate some of that material price inflation so much more effectively than we saw in 2024 or 2023.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nAnalyst, Cowen\n\nThank you, guys.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nVP and Investor Relations, Citi\n\nHey, good morning, everybody.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nVP and Investor Relations, Citi\n\nHey, Larry, I'm going to just go back to some of the comments that you made about the international defense outlook. I think you used the word localization maybe in your words. Just kind of curious how you think the company is going to participate in the growth of European defense budgets that we're likely to see over the next decade. Do you need to find additional partners to take advantage of this growth? Do you need to make some investments either organically or inorganically in the region to assure that you are local enough in the views of the Europeans to take on some of this new work? Thanks.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nWell, I think that with respect to Europe in particular, but even more broadly, the optimism we have around defense growth is going to be fundamentally within defense and systems, and it will really be around these existing programs that we've got really across the board, both in rotorcraft, and in combat jets, trainers as well.\nThose increased budgets, I think, play into our existing footprint very well. It's a little bit of what you see with the F110 agreement as well. Frankly, those international contracts tend to be priced a bit better.\nThey're structured more like commercial agreements than not. We get not only the revenue but the margin hit. Part of what we don't get to show you, I think today, doing this virtually as opposed to having the team on stage in Paris, is putting the spotlight on Avio Aero, which is our native European defense position in Italy. Very strong position with the MOD there, with exposure to the Eurofighter, Eurodrone, GCAP, all of the core programs there.\nThey'll be a focal point for us here as we go forward. Are we open to other partnerships, other arrangements? Of course.\nFrankly, we like where we are positioned today, both from a US base as well as from Avio, and know that again, given the backlogs, I think both Rahul and I have pointed to, we're going to have a good growth trajectory on top of or before we get any additional major orders from any of those customers, be it again in Europe or more broadly.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nVP and Investor Relations, Citi\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nAerospace & Defense Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah, hi, good morning, Larry and Rahul.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nI wanted to ask about the 15% higher revenues associated with narrowbody services through 2028. Just curious if you could parse that out a bit and specifically from a couple of angles, one sort of sounds like much of that is CFM56. And I'm wondering if you've seen within that any fundamental change in airline spending, like greater percentage of engines seeing a second or third shop visit, or how much of this is really just supply chain unlock and better turnaround times, and your ability to obviously get better flow through.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah, it's a great question, Ken. So, I think what you're touching on. Let me, if I just step back for a second before I get into the narrow body. You know, what we did this morning is we improved our services outlook from where we were back in March of last year by, call it, $4 billion. And that's a combination of two things. One, we improved our.\nExpectations of growth in the future. We went from high single-digit growth expectation to a double-digit growth expectation expectation. That's coming from a higher starting point in 2024. So you put both of them together, you know, the services revenue are up, you know, approximately $4 billion from where we were back in March of last year. That is a fairly broad-based improvement in outlook, Ken. It's coming both from narrowbody and from widebody. So if you're getting into the narrowbody where you were a second ago.\nI think that there are kind of two things that are driving the narrowbody improvement. One, as we said earlier, we're seeing 600 incremental shop visits for CFM56 between now and 2028 than where we were back last year.\nSo that is fewer retirements, you know, and also just the airlines keeping their fleets longer. I mean, as you see, even some of the lessors talk about it. They talk about the fact that they are renewing leases at kind of close to 90 to 95% from where they were just 30 to 40% a few years ago. So these fleets are just continuing to fly longer, and that's what we're seeing. Also seeing an increase in LEAP installed base. Right. So the LEAP installed base is growing, and that is driving an improvement in outlook.\nSo the narrow body, the combination of both CFM56 and LEAP, and the same thing is happening on the widebody side as well. I mean, wide body, you saw we spoke about the GE90 share as it's being 100% share as it's higher kind of the growth and installed base there.\nSo it's the exact same replica on the widebody side. So I think it's a fairly broad-based improvement in outlook that's giving us that incremental $4 billion of revenue versus where we were in March, and overall about $8 billion of revenue growth on services between now and 2028, which is driving the profit.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nLiz, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThis question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning everyone.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nMorning Noah.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning. Noah.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\ncan you hear me okay? I just landed in the airport. It's a bit noisy.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nLoud and clear. Hopefully you were on a GE engine.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nI was powered by the LEAP-1B. So that's, that's a win.\nI wanted to ask, you know, we've been in this world where air travel growth has been decelerating. Aftermarket growth has not. You know, part of that is the aging of the fleet. A lot of that is pent up demand that's being created by part component labor availability and then the pricing that that creates. All of which you've alluded to to different degrees. And so I was, I wonder if you can quantify the duration of the pent up demand. Will it take you one, two, three years to get through that?\nAnd when you built the 25 to 28 framework, are you assuming all of that pent up demand and the price that comes with it versus did you just assume the normal core algorithm of the fleet becomes the shop visits in a normal world?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nWell.\nIt's a hard question to answer quantitatively.\nI think you touched on many of the factors that work in the business's favor. And our favorite, you didn't touch on our increased share cycles. Right. Which helps leverage off the underlying installed base growth. And not only are some of these foundational platforms like the CFM56 or the GE90 staying in service longer, they're approaching those higher caliber shop visits as well, which is another positive mix effect. But I think with respect to the outlook here.\nNo, it's really, I think, looking at what we can, what we need to do to satisfy that $175 billion backlog. Right. Which is maybe the one quantitative way that catches most of what we've just touched on. And in turn, we're clearly going to be working that down over the next three years. Is whatever is pent up there flushed in three years, five years? I think that's hard to tell. Right. So many moving pieces. But again, even in this environment.\nTo look at that backlog, to see what we're seeing on the part of customers with respect to existing fleets, let alone their skylines, their fleet plans, we come forward today with a revised update, largely on the back of the confidence born of that backlog in their plans.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, and Larry, maybe if I could sneak one in on the OE side just since I'm last here, it's sort of been asked, but just has something specifically and singularly broken wide open in the supply chain improvement process. You sound a lot better. You know, we see the Boeing numbers are finally clicking into the rates they've talked about, maybe even a little faster than they last said.\nWas there one bottleneck that's now solved, or is this just sort of the triangulation of the many different efforts that have been ongoing?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nNo, I wish it would have been one bottleneck. We had stopped talking about this a long time ago.\nRight.\nBut it's a moving target because the volumes keep increasing, thankfully, and it's never been about one commodity, one supplier again. We wish it were so simple, I think, in terms of what we can control between Flight Deck and our new technology and operations organization.\nWe're better at deploying lean principles. We've got an outstanding team working more closely together, deep in the organization, deep with suppliers to put those tools to their highest and best use. Again, that's why we cite the input progress. You see that, in turn, in the output numbers that we've cited throughout the call here. But more to do. We'll be talking about supply chain again, I think, for rather the next several years. I'm really encouraged and frankly proud of what our team has done.\nAgain, a shout out to the supply base has been there virtually every step of the way. We all know we have this wonderful opportunity to satisfy that existing backlog while inventing the future of flight. We'll wrap here and we'll get back to work.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nLarry, any final comments?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nBlaire, thanks. And thanks to you and the team for preparing this so well, particularly twofold. Now, what was going to be in Paris and here this morning? No, I would just say that again. We think GE Aerospace is an exceptional franchise with real tremendous competitive advantages. The updated outlook that we provided here reinforces our optimism about our path ahead, and we think we're well positioned to deliver significant value creation for shareholders. We went long today, but we really do appreciate the time you invested in the presentation and obviously your interest in our company.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Liz, and I will be your conference coordinator today. If you experience issues with the webcast slides refreshing or there appears to be delays in the slide advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Blaire Shoor from the GE Aerospace investor relations team. Please proceed.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks Liz. Welcome to GE Aerospace's Q1 2025 Earnings Call. I'm joined by Chairman and CEO Larry Culp and CFO Rahul Ghai. Many of the statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and website, those elements may change as the world changes. Additionally, Larry and Rahul, consistent with prior quarters, will speak to total company and corporate financial results and guidance today on a non-GAAP basis. Larry, over to you.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nBlaire, thanks and good morning everyone. While a lot has happened since January, we at GE Aerospace remain focused on our purpose. Our team works daily to invent the future of flight, lift people up and bring them home safely. Those last four words ring true to us given right now there are nearly a million people in the sky. With our technology under wing. This is an incredible responsibility and one that we take very seriously.\nWith safety at our core, we're advancing our vision to be the company that defines flight for today, tomorrow, and the future. Today we're focused on service and readiness, keeping our customers' fleets flying. For tomorrow, we're delivering the ramp and executing our $170 billion+ backlog. And for the future, we're advancing the technology that will define the future of flight across both commercial and defense. With approximately $3 billion in annual R&D spending.\nFlight Deck, our proprietary lean operating model, is how we translate that strategy into results. Launched a year ago, we're activating Flight Deck to deliver for our customers and create long-term value for our shareholders.\nTurning to Q1, GE Aerospace delivered a strong start to the year. Orders were up 12% and revenue grew 11% with double-digit growth in both services and equipment. Profit was up $2.1 billion, up 38% with contributions from both segments leading to margins of 23.8%. Overall, we delivered $1.49 of EPS, up 60% year-over-year and free cash flow was $1.4 billion.\nIn Commercial Engines and Services, or CES, we're servicing and growing the industry's most extensive commercial installed base. Services strength continued, with orders up 31% and revenue up 17%, driving total operating profit growth of 35% year-over- year.\nIn defense and propulsion technologies, or DPT, we're improving the delivery of our leading defense programs while developing mission-critical technology. The Q1 was solid, with defense units growing 5% and profit increasing 16%. My thanks go out to all of our 53,000 employees around the world for delivering once again for our customers.\nMoving to Slide 5.\nGE Aerospace supports efforts to revitalize domestic manufacturing, and it's why we're investing $1 billion in US manufacturing this year and hiring over 5,000 US workers. At the same time, we support promoting free and fair trade that ensures the continued strength of the US aerospace industry. Our industry has a nearly $75 billion trade surplus, the highest trade balance of any sector, and exports more than $135 billion of products each year. This is possible because the global aviation sector has long operated without tariffs on civil aircraft engines and avionics.\nAs the US administration engages in discussions with its trade partners, we'll continue to advocate for an approach that reestablishes zero-for-zero tariffs in the aviation sector and ensures a level playing field for the US aerospace industry.\nIn the meantime, heightened tariffs will result in additional costs for us and our supply chain. We're leveraging available programs the administration is providing businesses such as duty drawbacks along with other strategies to optimize our operations, like expanding foreign trade zones. With those actions, we expect to reduce the tariff costs to roughly $500 million.\nWe're taking additional actions to offset this remaining impact. This includes controlling costs while maintaining investments in key priorities and pricing actions. Departures remained favorable in the quarter, up 4%, in line with our expectations. Given strong orders growth over the last several quarters, our commercial services backlog has grown out to over $140 billion. We've had a lag in converting those orders to revenue given the broader supply chain dynamics. Our spare parts delinquency continues to increase, unfortunately.\nUp over 2x year-over-year, and our internal shop visit slots are full with a healthy pipeline of engines which have been removed but not yet inducted into our shops. So far, Q2 departures are shaping more or less in line with Q1. We're taking a more cautious approach and embedding a slower H2 in our estimate, resulting in departures up low single digits for the full year. This includes a reduction in North American departures, which make up about 25% of the total.\nSo to step back, while the broader environment is certainly uncertain, we are watching demand closely, and we're operating from a position of strength. The actions we're taking, combined with our robust backlog, position us well to maintain our full-year guidance.\nShifting to Slide 6, we're focused on meeting the aftermarket and OE ramp to deliver for our customers. Demand continues to outpace supply, and we're utilizing Flight Deck to tackle supply chain constraints head-on. In the Q1, material input at our priority supplier sites was up 8% sequentially, which supported CES services revenue up 17% year-over-year.\nWhile defense units were a bright spot up 5%, total engine units were down 6% with LEAP down 13%. This was lighter than we expected from the slower start to material inputs in January and the lead times to complete new engines. We drove significant improvement in material input in February and March, giving us confidence that we will accelerate output in Q2.\nIn partnership with our suppliers, we're leveraging Flight Deck to deliver our priority. Suppliers continue to improve shipments against their committed targets, which increase both year-over-year and sequentially. In the Q1, they delivered shipping more than 95% of their committed volumes. Our new Technology and Operations organization has hit the ground running. In March, we hosted a supplier symposium to share our near- and longer-term growth outlook across both services and OE. This helps our suppliers with required transparency and stability. They need to make critical investments to support the ramp and a forum for discussing key challenges in doing so.\nImportantly, we know these joint efforts with our suppliers work. Last quarter we shared that a joint Kaizen with one of those priority suppliers achieved a 50% increase in output in just one week. Now at the end of the Q1, the same team has delivered a 3x increase quarter-over-quarter.\nAdditionally, LEAP remains an important growth area with the fleet expected to more than double by the end of the decade. We're continuing to expand capacity to support aftermarket demand. LEAP external shop visits grew over 60% in Q1, demonstrating the rapid growth in the third-party network.\nAlso, all engine shipments to Airbus now incorporate the durability kit, including the upgraded HPT blade, which was approved back in December, enables the LEAP-1A to achieve CFM56 levels of time on wing. We're also shipping those same blades to MRO shops to support upgrades of the existing fleet. The upgraded HPT blades incorporate a simpler design requiring less capacity, improving process yields, and ultimately supporting higher output. Critical additional benefits that will support achieving the 15% to 20% growth in LEAP deliveries we expect in 2025.\nWe're already seeing improvement in our overall output through April and remain confident we'll accelerate in 2025 and longer-term.\nTurning to Slide 7, in Q1, we saw continued demand for both our services and products. At CES, we secured multiple agreements for our customers' growing fleets. We secured entry commitments from ANA for both our narrowbody and widebody platforms. They selected LEAP and GEnx engines to power 13 A321neos, up to 22 737 MAXes, and 18 787-9 aircraft as part of their fleet upgrade. Additionally, we received a commitment from Malaysia Aviation Group for 60 CFM LEAP engines plus additional spares to power 30 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.\nIn the widebody segment, Korean Air announced an agreement for up to 30 Boeing 787-10s and 20 777-9s with our GEnx and GE9X engines underwing. In defense, budgets are increasing globally, and customers are selecting our leading programs. We received a contract from the US Air Force valued up to $5 billion. This supports foreign military sales for the F110 engines which power the F-15 and the F-16 aircraft operated by allies around the world.\nAt the same time, we're strengthening our leadership position with continued investments starting with the RISE program. We recently completed a second endurance test campaign on the high-pressure turbine blades earlier in the development process than ever before. This demonstrated improved durability and fuel efficiency, key customer priorities for the future of flight. We also completed the initial ground runs for the T901 engine on a US Army Black Hawk helicopter, a major milestone toward delivering a more powerful mission-ready aircraft and one that puts us on a path to a flight test.\nFinally, we successfully completed the detailed design review for the XA102 adaptive cycle engine, working toward production of a full-scale model. This is a critical milestone supporting the US Air Force's next-generation Adaptive Propulsion program. We were also pleased to see President Trump's award of the F-47 and the administration's commitment to advance this important program. Our progress on advanced engines positions us well with the administration's efforts to maintain military air superiority. So overall, we're focused on executing our sizable backlog while investing in the technology building blocks that will define the future of flight. Rahul, over to you.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nThank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. We started out 2025 with a strong Q1 marked by significant top-line and EPS growth. Orders were up 12% and revenue was up 11%, both led by commercial services. Profit was $2.1 billion, up $600 million or 38%, driven by services volume, favorable mix, and price. Margin expanded 460 basis points to 23.8%.\nEPS of $1.49 was up 60% from profit growth, a favorable tax rate, and a lower share count from buyback actions. Free cash flow was $1.4 billion, down 14% and in line with our expectations. Working capital was the source, primarily from contract assets. Inventory increased to prepare for higher output and to tackle ongoing material availability challenges. This was partially offset by payables.\nGiven our operational and financial strength, we continue to expect to deploy over $8 billion of cash to shareholders in 2025 through dividends and buybacks. We remain well-positioned to drive significant shareholder returns while continuing to invest in growth, innovation, and focused M&A.\nLooking closer at our businesses starting with CES. In the quarter, orders were up 15% with services up 31% while equipment was down 13% given a tough compare.\nRevenue was up 14%, led by services up 17%. Spare parts revenue was up more than 20% from higher volume and price. Internal shop visit revenue grew 11% from higher shop visit output, increased work scopes, and widebody mix. Equipment grew 9% with favorable customer mix and price offsetting unit deliveries that were down 9% while still elevated. The spare engine ratio stepped down sequentially in line with expectations, and the LEAP life-of-program spare engine ratio remains in low double digits.\nProfit was $1.9 billion, up 35% from services volume, mix, and price. This more than offset inflation, increased R&D, and a year-over-year change in estimated profitability on long-term service agreements of approximately $100 million, primarily from the estimated impacts of tariffs. CES margins expanded 420 basis points to 27.5% overall, a very strong start for CES largely driven by services.\nMoving to DPT. Orders were flat year-over-year with services up 14% while equipment was down. Given the significant growth in Q1 of last year, Defense demand remains robust with a book-to-bill of 1.4x. Revenue grew 1%. Defense and Systems revenue was flat. Defense unit growth of 5% and price were offset by lower services revenue. Propulsion and Additive Technologies grew 1%. Services volume and price offset lower internal shipments from our planned lower start in equipment sales. Profit was up 16% driven by customer mix, productivity, and price. This was partially offset by self-funding of next-generation investments and inflation. Margins improved 160 basis points to 12.7%. Stepping back, DPT delivered a better-than-expected Q1. Shifting to corporate costs, including eliminations, was about $70 million. This was down over 40% or approximately $55 million, mostly driven by expenses down roughly $40 million.\nNow moving to our guidance on Slide 11, Q1 exceeded expectations given stronger spare parts sales and services mix, which should continue. We have a robust backlog supporting our growth for several years, and we're taking actions to offset the impact from tariffs and to help us in navigating the uncertainty in the environment. Operationally, we are performing better than we expected on the January earnings call, but given the macroeconomic backdrop, we are holding our guidance across the board. Therefore, we continue to expect low-double-digit revenue growth, profit of $7.8 to 8.2 billion, EPS of $5.10 to 5.45, and free cash flow of $6.3 to 6.8 billion. We're also maintaining our segment guidance.\nUnpacking the moving pieces. We have included the following in our guidance. Recognizing the dynamic background, we are preparing for tariffs that could persist through year-end with 10% tariffs remaining in place, and then reciprocal tariffs resuming after the 90-day pause. As Larry mentioned, we expect roughly $500 million of cost after our operational actions to minimize the tariff impact. From there, we expect to primarily mitigate this remaining $500 billion through SG&A cost controls and price increases. We are maintaining our R&D spend for the year.\nRegarding the macro environment, given the ongoing uncertainty in the second half, we are adjusting some of our full-year expectations.\nWe now expect low-single-digit full-year departure growth down from mid-single-digit in January. Given the tariffs in place, we've reduced spare parts and spare engine sales for the year to that region. This demand is not foregone as the customers in China still have needs for services and spare engines, but they may be delayed. We are maintaining our full-year spare parts guidance for low-double-digit growth given the stronger start to the year and nearly 90% of spare parts in backlog for Q2.\nWe expect minimal impact on internal shop visit revenue, which represents roughly 60% of our total services revenue. Given our backlog, pent-up demand, and limited risk to shop visits pushing out, overall, we continue to expect low-double-digit to mid-teens services growth. We have not factored in a slowdown in airframer delivery schedules, further tariff escalation, or a global recession into our guidance. We remain confident in our ability to deliver another year of strong results. With that, Larry, I'll turn it back to you,\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nRahul, thank you. We're encouraged by our strong start, which combined with the actions we're taking puts us well on our way to achieving our full-year guide. CES is on track for another year of significant growth and we expect continued solid performance at DPT.\nGE Aerospace has sustained competitive advantages. We have a diversified fleet of preferred platforms across the narrowbody, widebody, and defense sectors. At the core of everything we do is safety, quality, delivery, and cost, always in that order.\nOur services and technology offer industry-leading operational reliability including greater efficiency, extended time on wing, and faster turnaround times. We serve the industry's largest fleet of 70,000 engines with unrivaled customer service and flight support. This keeps us close to our customers through decades-long life cycles, building meaningful relationships and making us the partner of choice.\nOur talented engineering teams continue to develop breakthrough innovation to support our existing fleet and advance next-generation technologies, and Flight Deck supports us in delivering results and lasting value for our customers and shareholders. These differentiators, combined with our growing backlog, will not only help us manage the near-term, but enable us to deliver long-term value with that. Blaire, let's go to questions.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nBefore we open the line. I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Liz, can you please open the line?\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone. If you wish to withdraw your question, or your question has already been answered, please press star one one again. Our first question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you. Good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, Doug.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nLarry, you talked about tariffs at the outset, and tariffs in aviation really aren't good for anybody. You said that you're advocating a return to that zero-tariff approach. But I wonder if you can comment some on the interactions that you've had or perhaps others in the industry have had with the administration in order to advocate for that point of view for aviation. And perhaps you can say, are there any thoughts you have about how this might play out over time, scenarios that may be possible given the uncertainty right now?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nWell, Doug, I think it's easier to speak to the first part of that than the second part. We have spoken to a number of people, senior people within the administration, including the President. We have been, I think, full-throated in our support of the administration's efforts to support American competitiveness and revitalize American manufacturing. We're well aligned in that regard. But it's easy to overlook the $75 billion trade surplus the sector enjoys largely on the back of this tariff-free regime that we've had since 1979. So all we have suggested as the administration works through a myriad of issues is that they consider the position of strength that the country enjoys as a result of this tariff-free regime and to consider re-establishing the same.\nThere are a whole host of potential scenarios here, Doug, that we could take on operationally. I won't take your time to go through them. There is uncertainty. None of us, I think know for sure how this plays out. But as Rahul walked through a moment ago, I think what we've basically assumed here is that what we're dealing with is what we'll see through the rest of the year. We've knocked down a good bit of the gross effects through the actions like duty drawbacks and foreign trade zones. But we're still staring at the better part of $0.5 billion of headwind in 2025. And in turn that's where the cost control actions and the price actions that we touched on here give us additional offset opportunities.\nBut as we work those operationally, rest assured we will continue to advocate in the best ways possible on behalf of the industry.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, Larry and Rahul, and thank you. Maybe just sticking on the tariffs topic if that's okay. Very good start to both CES and DPT. Total profit beat of $250 million. Even baking in $100 million of impact from tariffs in Q1, and you talked about a $500 million net impact. How do we think about the margin cadence in Q2 and the second half as we think about those tariffs coming in?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nRight. No Sheila. So let me start and Larry can jump in here. Listen, we've had a good start here. Q1 came in better than what we expected. And as we think about the year, and we mentioned this in January, we did expect a strong start to the year. We were aiming for a more linear year than we had last year, and given the OE ramp was a little bit back-end-loaded, we have GE9X shipments in the back half of the year, and then lower spare engine ratio, and including step-up in corporate expenses. So we had expected that we'll have a stronger first half, and we've seen that in the Q1.\nAs we think about the Q2 to get to your question, we do expect that momentum to continue into the Q2, and what we are thinking for Q2 right now, given where we are in April, is that the GE Aerospace revenue growth to be better than what we delivered in Q1, and the profit dollars for the Q2 to be flat to sequentially up from Q1 and decently up on a year-over-year basis. This will be primarily driven by services, and we expect similar revenue growth in services as we did in the Q1. As I said on the call, you know, more than 90% of the spare parts are in the backlog, which is a similar position that we were in in January for Q1.\nAftermarket growth in the Q2 will be partially offset by a higher OE growth. Now, as we think about the second half of the year, you know, a lot more uncertainty given the volatility around the macro trends that we've spoken to. But we've embedded a certain amount of conservatism in our guide around departures that we spoke about and issues arising from the tariffs in China. So given that we've reduced our expectations for spare engines and spare parts deliveries to China, now some of them will get diverted to other customers but will probably still be an impact. And we've also factored in the potential slowdown in departures in North America. But overall we are holding the low-double-digit spare parts growth for the year just given the start that we've had.\nIf you put all that together, you know, we should still see year-over-year profit growth in the second half. Should be a very, very good year for us. Overall, as we sit here today, Sheila, we feel better about the year, even with the tariffs, even with the macroeconomic uncertainty than we did back in January, and knowing that where we are in the world right now, we'll be back together in June at the Paris Air Show and we'll give you an update there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, David.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Barclays\n\nSo just wanted to dig in a little bit on that second half of the year assumption on departures. It looks like you're assuming basically no departure growth in the second half of the year, is that right? And what are you specifically assuming in a flat departure scenario for spares, and a follow-up there on shop visits? I know you talk about you've got a lot of backlog on shop visits, but how long would you think that departures can stay relatively flattish before you start to see an impact in terms of shop? Is it just from, you know, retirement picking up and so on? Thanks.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nDavid, you touched on a number of the variables there. Again, the mid-single-digit outlook for departures that we saw, we talked about back in January, held up quite well in the first, and it looks like just looking at this morning's data that that continues to be the case. We often I think maybe over-index on the dynamics in the US market. We know there's some cross-border traffic softening Canada, the US, even Europe to the US, but broadly, when you look around the world, departures are holding up pretty well. Rahul, I used the word conservatism earlier. I think we're just taking a conservative view with respect to the second half. US departures could, could soften. We may see some adjustments elsewhere. We'll leave the detailed planning to the airlines.\nBut again, I think we know that it will take some time for that to impact us. Not that we will be immune for the calendar year, but when you look at past downturns, it has taken Q2, Q3, Q4, sometimes longer for that departure slowdown to really impact activities. I think that's why we've highlighted the strength of the spare parts order book that we have in hand. Again, 90% of Q2 already in place. And with the engines that are off-wing either in our shops today, waiting to come in the shop, or waiting to be delivered to us, that would take us well into the fall. So we don't like the fact that we've got such delinquencies in place. We want to serve our customers better.\nBut it does, I think, support the underlying strength of the backlog and the delinquency as we look at our opportunities to execute and deliver through the rest of this calendar year. But again, there's uncertainty here. We're taking what we think is a cautious view, and we'll be watching it very, very closely.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nResearch Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nYeah, good morning guys.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nResearch Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nI was wondering if you could elaborate on your pricing strategy and how it might differ from normal years. Are you going to wait till kind of mid-year to enact spare price increases? What's different as you approach pricing offset the tariffs this year?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nSo Gautam, we are doing this. There are two pieces to this. You know, we will do our typical kind of catalog price increases that we do, you know, late in the summer. Again, our thinking around that has not changed. We are still aiming for that mid-to high-single-digit price increases on our spare parts later that summer, which is consistent with where we were in January. So that expectation has not changed. Now that typically translates into kind of mid-single-digit at the overall services level for us, you know, after sharing with the revenue share partners and everything else.\nThe pricing benefit on the remaining service contract is lower than what we see on the spare parts, as you know. But overall I think that expectation has not changed. I think what we alluded to on the tariffs was a temporary surcharge for recovering the cost that we are feeling right now. Now we're trying to offset that with all the things that we spoke about, that Larry spoke about even a minute ago to Doug's question. So we're trying to manage through that and then we're going to take some SG and cost control actions, and whatever's left, we'll share that in some way, shape, or form to a tariff surcharge, and hopefully that doesn't. It's not a permanent thing, and we can take those away as soon as the tariffs end. So that's our thinking right now.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director and Aerospace and Defense Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah, hi. Good morning everybody.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, Ken.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director and Aerospace and Defense Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, Larry or Rahul. I just wanted to see in the Q1 really strong spare parts purchasing. Can you comment if you expected or saw any pre-buys there specifically in China or elsewhere, perhaps maybe ahead of the tariffs or other factors? And as part of that over 20% growth, can you give any granularity on maybe widebody versus narrowbody dynamics or specifically LEAP versus CFM56?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nSo Ken, no pre-buys. I mean, typically we don't see that in January. I think we kind of knew that. I think as we go back to the Q1 earnings call, we said 90% was in the backlog, and we are sitting in a similar situation here in the Q2 as we said a couple of times here. So no pre-buys. I think the departures were up 4%. They're hanging in there, were up 4% in the Q1. They're hanging in at that level even in the Q2 through April and through the forward schedules that we are seeing in May. So clearly that trend is continuing.\nNo pre-buy. Now in terms of the widebody, narrowbody, and on LEAP versus CFM56, obviously LEAP is growing faster, right? We expected more than 30% shop visit growth on LEAP, and within that 30% shop visit growth, the external channel. We expect the external channel this year to be about 15% of our total shop visit revenue versus kind of 10% last year. So within that you can see the external channel beginning to pick up, and that is driving the LEAP spare parts revenue growth for CFM56. We continue to expect kind of, you know, mid-single-digit shop visit growth which will drive the CFM56 revenue. So LEAP is clearly going faster here than CFM56 on a percentage basis.\nNarrowbody widebody, I think that, you know, obviously LEAP is driving a little bit higher percentage growth, but we're seeing good, good growth even on the widebody side, especially as GE90 and GEnx get into heavier work scopes.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, Rahul. Maybe for you, the equipment gross margins in the quarter is another quarter of positive gross margins. I think 12% even better than the 8% you had last quarter despite a lower spare engine ratio. I'm just curious, is there anything structural going on with respect to the razor-razorblade model and making money maybe on, on new equipment or is there something else under the surface you could give some color to?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah, so Myles, a couple of things there. One, the number that you have is obviously at the total GE Aerospace level versus CES. Just keep that at the back of your mind. As you, as we, as you saw Defense, we did say higher revenue growth. I mean the units were up 5% in Defense. So that, that helps. The Defense business does contribute to that margin profile because those units are profitable now. Within CES, our OE volume was a little bit lower, and as you saw, the spare engine ratio did come down sequentially, but was still elevated. That will keep coming down as the year progresses, but in line with what we had projected at the beginning of the year. So nothing abnormal there and really no change, broadly speaking, to the razor-razorblade model. Now widebodies are obviously those platforms.\nAre now profitable for the OE business. So that is helping here as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Noah Popanak with Goldman Sachs.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning everyone.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nHey, Noah. Good morning.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nFew questions on cash flow and its deployment. To what extent was the quarter ahead of the free cash plan, and if it was, how much of that is pure outperformance versus quarterly timing? And then I wanted to ask on the duty drawback, how long does it take to recover and what does that mean for cash flow? And then in terms of its deployment.\nHow does the current environment change your thinking in terms of being more aggressive or more conservative on capital deployment?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nMaybe we could take those in reverse order. Noah, I think as Rahul said in our prepared remarks, we continue to think that in 2025 we'll have more than $8 billion of total returns between the dividend and the buyback. As you would appreciate, given the comments this morning and the conviction we have about the outlook.\nWe'll be thoughtful. We'll be opportunistic, we do have, I think it's close to $3 billion of remaining authorization to buyback once that $7 billion that we planned for this year has been utilized. So we've got some latitude, some flexibility in that regard with respect to the duty drawback.\nNormal course we would see.\nThat cycle somewhere, call it four or five months.\nWe'll see how things play out in this environment. But that'd be a good planning assumption.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nNoah, for the on the Q1 cash, we basically came in in line. I think we expected kind of at the levels we had, working capital was positive in the quarter. You saw the inventory build that we had, you know, it was down a little bit year-over-year just given the timing of cash tax payments and some of the employee liabilities that we had. But again, nothing unusual or unexpected. As you sit here for the Q2, we do expect to have a strong Q2 on cash. It should be sequentially up from Q1 and we expect more than 100% conversion for the Q2.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, Scott.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nRahul, in your last Investor Day deck, you had this chart that showed price increases on both LEAP OE and LTSA contracts. And I think it compared pricing from prior to 2018 to pricing in 2022 and 2023. And the step-up was something to the tune of 100%, I think. I guess. Can you characterize how much of that 100% increase in price you've seen at this point in the income statement versus how much is still just sitting in the backlog and remaining to be seen? Thank you.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nNo, Scott, you're right. So let me take that in two pieces. One, I think you're right. The shop visit prices are going up, and that's just basically the end of launch-period pricing. Right? I mean, we've been, obviously, as we were in the 2019 to 2021 timeframe, it was a very different time period. We were in that initial stages of launch. As we've come out of that, the LEAP shop visit pricing has gone up since then.\nBut as we think about that price increase that we put in place, that takes a few years for it to show up in a P&L as you mentioned, just given the timing of contract and obviously with the delays in aircraft deliveries, that cycle is a little bit elongated. So while the price we are implementing price increases for the shop visits and the portfolio accretion is at the higher price, that has not really showed up in our P&L just yet. So that will take another couple of years before it starts showing up. And those contracts that we have signed recently, they go into effect.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nVice President and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thanks very much. Good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, Seth.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nVice President and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nMorning. Wanted to follow-up question on the drawbacks, I guess. How do you think about those working through the supply chain?\nDo suppliers take care of all of that themselves? Does any of it go through you? Do you anticipate, given that some of them might not be as well capitalized, some need to support them, or perhaps on the flip side, given the amount of inventory that you have there.\nIs maybe an opportunity to draw a little bit less right now, and basically how you're thinking about managing the supply?\nChina in light of the tariffs?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nWell, Seth, I would say.\nBig picture.\nThere's a tremendous amount of work going on with the new Tech and Ops organization to strengthen our overall working relationship with the supply base, large and small.\nI appreciate your comment about our current inventory levels. I don't think we're looking to make an adjustment here given some of the uncertainty, because we know with the backlog that we are challenged to deliver both OE and aftermarket for the rest of this decade. We're going to need that inventory and we want to strengthen the supply base, and we're going to be looking to find ways in which we can do that amid this uncertainty. Clearly, for the suppliers with whom we've got firm-fix contracts.\nThat additional burden will be borne by them. We'll work through, where appropriate, right adjustments in our overall arrangements with them. Clearly, we've got some bigger suppliers. We've got our partnership with Safran as well, where it's a different dynamic. So there are a lot of, there are a lot of moving pieces here, and that's probably why we wanted to take the step that we did this morning to include a good bit of that as best we know it today, into the forward guide. Right again to Doug's earlier question. We'll be advocating for a position which we believe to be very much aligned with President's America First trade agenda.\nBut to the extent that things don't change, to the extent that the reciprocal tariffs kick in in the back half, we want to make sure we're ready hand-in-hand with our suppliers, large and small, in addition to taking the cost and price actions that we referenced. But it's a fluid situation. I think that's part of what I suspect we'll be talking about through the course of the spring and summer here, not the least of which is at Paris. As we work our way through this along with everybody else.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nSeth, just to add maybe two points to what Larry said, one, we've learned a lot here, right, over the last month or so since we started working.\nThe offsetting actions and understanding what programs are there that we can utilize to offset the growth impact. We are sharing that with our supply base and helping them understand what we know today.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nVice President and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nRight.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nI'm sure we'll learn from them as well as we compare notes. So that's one. And the second, to your point about the duty drawbacks, they can claim the duty drawbacks for everything that we export, but obviously we will provide them the documentation and the support they need to avail of that program.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nDirector, Citi\n\nHey, good morning, everybody.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nDirector, Citi\n\nI just wanted to ask a bigger-picture question on the defense side of things. We've seen kind of a flurry of executive orders come out of the White House, and most recently.\nWe got one related to the potential to rewrite Federal Acquisition Regulation.\nSo I just wanted to get a sense from you all on what impact that might have on the industrial base. The administration seems to be pitching this as, quote-unquote, kind of cutting red tape and speeding up the acquisition process. But I'm wondering if that's always a good thing or are there going to be some unintended consequences that we should be on the lookout for as we look at this kind of rewrite of FAR.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah. So, Jason, I don't know if we know exactly what's on your mind, but the couple that I'm aware of or we are aware of here, and we could take it offline if that doesn't get to your question, which is I think there are two pieces. One is the FMS reform to support and deliver more efficiently and effectively our export to our allies. And we at GE Aerospace are fortunate to be in a position where we have several highly-capable programs that have a lot of international demand, whether it's Blackhawks, Apaches, F-16s, and soon to be exported, the F-15EX. So all these improvements allow us to get our products in the hands of our allies, and that's a really welcome improvement. So we appreciate everything that's done and that will help support our growth, but also that of the broader industry.\nThen, you know, the other improvements in requirements and acquisition processes to define the requirements, you know, so that elimination of any bureaucratic issues there also supports us. So, and then, you know, few other things that are about loss programs and all that. Now, again, we don't have a ton of that in our portfolio, so that does not directly impact us. But, again, I think holding the industry accountable for its performance is not a bad thing.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.\n\nRonald Epstein\n\nManaging Director, Aerospace & Defense, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Maybe a little different angle on the tariff question. How are you all thinking about rare earths and some of the rare metals that you need either directly in what you do or what your suppliers need? Given some of the changing rules in China, do you have it inventoried or do you have alternative ways to source it? How are you thinking about that?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nAs you would imagine, we've been thinking about that a lot. I'm sure everybody else in the space has between alternate sources and inventory positions, both our own and with our supplier partners.\nWe don't currently see any real issues here. There's some things that we'll continue to work through.\nWe'll see how this is resolved from a trade negotiation perspective. But that's not high on our worry list at the moment.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Scott Mikus with Melius Research.\n\nScott Mikus\n\nDirector of Aerospace, Defense and Space Research, Melius Research\n\nMorning, Larry.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nMorning, Scott.\n\nScott Mikus\n\nDirector of Aerospace, Defense and Space Research, Melius Research\n\nHey, Larry. I just wanted to ask a quick question on the pricing dynamics. So pricing in the aftermarket has been very healthy the past several years, but now airlines are seeing softening demand for travel. The departures at least seem to be holding up for now. So I'm just wondering how are you thinking about balancing the price increases to offset tariffs and inflation while avoiding demand destruction so engines aren't seeing premature retirements?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nThere's clearly a balancing act here. I think what we've always tried to do is really adhere to a handful of principles with respect to making sure we share in the value that we create, are compensated for the risks that we take on, and obviously deliver adequate returns on the investments, the long-term, long-cycle investments that we make. I think Rahul talked about how we're going about some of the longer-term actions both around some of the new programs like LEAP, how we're approaching the CLP, the spare parts pricing later this year, and the surcharges, the hopefully temporary surcharges vis-à-vis the tariffs. So all of that's in play. And again, we need to balance that out in the right way given the competing priorities here.\nBut I think we're optimistic that we can do that smartly, fairly, constructively with our customers around the world and do so in a way that doesn't, you say, disrupt demand.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nLiz, I think we will wrap it up there. Larry, any final comments?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nBlaire, thank you. Just to close, our customers in the flying public are counting on us. We know that, and we're confident in our ability to deliver. The GE Aerospace team is up to that challenge. We continue to increase our deliveries of services and products, keeping safety and quality top of mind while developing the technologies for the future. We appreciate your time today and your interest in GE Aerospace.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Liz, and I will be your conference coordinator today. If you experience issues with the webcast slides refreshing or there appear to be delays in the slide advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Blaire Shoor Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks, Liz. Welcome to GE Aerospace's Q4 and full year 2024 earnings call. I'm joined by Chairman and CEO Larry Culp and CFO Rahul Ghai. Many of the statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and website, those elements may change as the world changes. Additionally, Larry and Rahul, consistent with prior quarters, will speak to total company and corporate financial results and guidance today on a non-GAAP basis. Now, over to Larry.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nBlaire, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Head of Investor Relations, that has a nice ring to it, Blaire. I hope everybody saw our announcement last week relative to Blaire's promotion. She's excited. We're excited. 2024 was a year for the history books at GE Aerospace. In April, we became a standalone public company, the culmination of GE's multi-year transformation.\nNothing has been more front and center than our purpose: inventing the future of flight, lifting people up, and bringing them home safely. Those last four words remain our top priority, with nearly a million passengers in flight at this very moment, with our technology under wing. We launched Flight Deck, our proprietary lean operating model, to better serve our customers through our relentless focus on safety, quality, delivery, and cost, in that order.\nSeeing our teams in action through the year with Flight Deck from Malaysia to Wales to Asheville, and elsewhere truly was energizing. Commercial momentum continued as we signed several key services agreements and received orders for more than 4,600 commercial and defense engines. In narrow bodies, this included American Airlines' commitment for 85 new Boeing 737 MAX jets powered by our LEAP-1B. In wide bodies, we were honored to add a new GEnx customer, British Airways. And in defense, we received an order from the Polish Armed Forces for 210 T700 engines to power the 96 Boeing AH-64E Apache Guardian helicopters. To close the year, we received certification of the LEAP-1A HBT durability kit.\nCombined with the three prior durability enhancements that are performing well in the field, it's designed to increase LEAP time on wing by more than twofold current levels and achieve parity with the CFM56's performance today. Just this week, in fact, we shipped our first retrofit engines to customers with the new hardware. It's also easier to produce, supporting our output trajectory going forward. At the same time, we've advanced significant technology milestones that will propel GE Aerospace into the future.\nOur RISE program with CFM completed more than 250 tests on our way to developing a full-scale open fan engine. We recently announced that in collaboration with Boeing, NASA, and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, we will model the integration of an open fan engine design on an aircraft wing. Our defense team successfully demonstrated a hybrid electric propulsion system rated at 1MW with the US.\nArmy. This represents a meaningful increase in power generation, enabling us to advance hybrid electric propulsion applications. But perhaps more important than what we accomplished in 2024 is how we did it. And my thanks this morning go out to our entire team for their unwavering commitment to delivering for our customers. GE Aerospace delivered a standout year financially, with revenue up double digits, profit up $1.7 billion, and free cash flow of $1.3 billion. And we finished strong, surpassing our most recent guide. In Q4, robust demand continued.\nOrders were up 46%, and revenue grew 16%, with double-digit growth in services and equipment for both orders and revenue. Profit was up nearly 50%, and EPS more than doubled. Free cash flow was up over 20%, with conversion above 100%.\nAt Commercial Engines and Services, our Q4 orders were up 50%, revenue was up 19%, and profit increased 44% while deliveries progressed. For the full year, demand remained robust, with services orders up 30%, total revenue up double digits, and profit up 25% to $7.1 billion. In Defense and Propulsion Technologies, Q4 orders were up 22%, and defense units nearly doubled sequentially. For the full year, revenue was up 6%, and profit increased 17% to $1.1 billion. Looking ahead to 2025, we're maintaining this momentum as we aim to deliver another year of substantial revenue, EPS, and cash growth. We expect departures growth of mid-single digits and increased military spending.\nThis supports solid low double-digit revenue growth, including growth in CES and DPT. We expect profit in the range of $7.8 billion-$8.2 billion.This combined with a lower share count will translate to EPS in the range of $5.10 to 5.45, up 15% at the midpoint. For free cash flow, we expect to generate $6.3 billion-$6.8 billion, with conversion remaining robust above 100%. And given the strength of our balance sheet, we're increasing our share repurchases to $7 billion and planning to raise our dividend by 30%, subject, of course, to board approval.\nOverall, GE Aerospace is, I believe, an exceptional franchise with a tremendous financial profile. Stepping back, between 2023 and 2025, taking the midpoint of our guide, we expect to grow profit $2.5 billion and free cash flow nearly $2 billion over this two-year period. Today, we're focused on keeping our customers' fleets flying and delivering on our new engine backlog. Our team is using Flight Deck to tackle supply chain constraints head-on.\nFrom the first half to the second half of 2024, we delivered meaningful improvement as material inputs increased 26% across our priority supplier sites. This, in turn, supported CES services revenue growth of 17% and engine unit growth of 18%, with defense and commercial both up double digits, including LEAP up 12%. We're encouraged by our progress more recently in the Q4, where CES services revenue increased 12% year-over-year, supported by expanded shop visit work scope and spare parts growth. But this was lighter than we expected due to lower internal shop visit volume given material constraints.\nTotal engine units improved up 3%, with defense up 20%. But commercial was roughly flat, with LEAP down 5%. We'll need to drive further sustainable improvements to meet 2025's demand, and this is exactly where Flight Deck is so important.Earlier last year, our priority suppliers shipped only half of their committed targets to us. Today, they're shipping over 90% of the committed volume. At a recent joint Kaizen with a priority supplier, we focused on eliminating waste, achieving a 50% increase in output, 50%.\nAnd throughout 2024, we deployed over 550 of our supply chain and engineering resources into that same supply base, demonstrating that we're at our best when we're operating as one team. Building off this momentum, we're bringing together our engineering and supply chain teams into one new organization, Technology and Operations, which will be led by Muhammad Ali. With shared accountability across the full value chain, this cross-functional team will enable faster problem-solving to help improve deliveries. These actions, combined with our close alignment on demand schedules, will enable higher material inputs in 2025 and, importantly, beyond.\nFinally, we've expanded LEAP aftermarket capacity by approximately 40% in 2024. This will support the growing fleet of 3,300 LEAP-powered aircraft, with now 10,000 engines in backlog. Here's how. First, we're eliminating waste and reducing turnaround time using Flight Deck. For example, our on-wing support team redesigned the LEAP engine flow, increasing output by 50% for the year. This contributed to LEAP internal shop visit growth of more than 20% in the Q4 alone.\nSecond, we're investing more than $1 billion in our internal MRO facilities over the next five years. We're growing our repair technologies, which will help lower the cost of ownership and provide faster turnaround times. Our recently opened Services Technology Acceleration Center here in Ohio will be a key enabler in deploying repairs across our global MRO network. And third, we're strengthening our LEAP third-party network.\nLast year, five premier MROs completed around 10% of total LEAP shop visits. This is critical experience for them as their volume increases further in 2025. Overall, we're entering 2025 with a stronger foundation to service and deliver our engines faster, with the highest possible levels of safety and quality. Turning to slide seven, demand for our services and products remains robust, highlighted by orders up 46% in Q4. At CES and narrow bodies, El Al Israel Airlines confirmed its commitment for 20 737 MAXs with LEAP-1B engines under wing. We've also extended service contracts, including a 10-year engine maintenance agreement with Fly Dubai for their CFM56-powered aircraft.\nNotably, the Airbus A321XLR, powered by our LEAP-1A engines, completed its inaugural commercial long-haul flight. Our engines are providing airlines with greater route flexibility and overall operational efficiency.In wide bodies, Royal Jordanian announced an order for 18 GEnx-1Bs, plus spares to power their expanded Boeing 787-9 fleet. China Airlines also announced an agreement for 10 Boeing 777-9s with the GE9X under wing. In DPT, we're building on our leading defense programs.\nWe received orders under a contract with the US Army valued up to $1.1 billion for the continued production of T700 engines through 2029. The new T700s will power the Sikorsky H60, the Bell H-1, and the Boeing AH-64 platforms. In addition to expanding our extensive install base, we're enhancing our customer solutions. We signed an agreement to acquire Northstar Aerospace, a leading manufacturer of mission-critical gears and shafts. Northstar will be highly complementary to our Avio Aero business, providing a US-based presence in this market and adding new programs and capabilities to deliver complex flight-critical parts.\nStepping back, I couldn't be prouder about what we're building at GE Aerospace as we advance flight for today, tomorrow, and the future. Rahul, over to you.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nThank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. We closed out 2024 with another strong quarter. Orders were up 46%, with significant demand for both services and equipment. Revenue was up 16%, with growth in CES and DPT. Profit was $2 billion, up 49%, driven by services volume, favorable mix, and price. Margins were up 450 basis points to 20.1%. EPS of $1.32 more than doubled from profit growth and a reduced tax rate. Free cash flow was $1.5 billion, up 21% from higher earnings. Working capital was a source, primarily from long-term service contract billings. While accounts receivables increased, day sales outstanding were down five days year-over-year.\nGiven the ongoing material availability challenges, inventory increased, although at a lower rate than prior quarters. For the year, orders were up 32%, including services orders up 30%. Revenue was up 10%, with growth in both segments. Profit increased 30% to $7.3 billion, with margins expanding 330 basis points to 20.7%, driven by commercial services. EPS increased 56% to $4.60, from significant profit growth, a lower tax rate, and the absence of preferred dividend. Free cash flow was up almost 30% to $6.1 billion, with conversion over 120%.\nTaken together, we delivered significant growth across all key metrics, both in the Q4 and the year. Looking closer at our businesses, starting with CES, in the Q4, orders were up 50% as services demand remained robust while equipment accelerated. Our recent wins build on our backlog of $154 billion, with about 90% of that backlog in services.\nRevenue was up 19%, with services up 12%, driven by Shop Visit revenue, higher spare parts, and price. Internal Shop Visit revenue, representing around 60% of services revenue, grew double digits. Increased work scopes, higher pricing, and engine mix more than offset Shop Visit volume that was down 3% due to material constraints. Spare parts revenue, representing roughly the other 40%, was up from higher volume and price. Equipment grew 38%. While we made progress, supply chain constraints impacted total deliveries, down 2%, including LEAP down 5%.\nFor the year, LEAP deliveries were down 10%, in line with our latest expectations. Lower volume was more than offset by customer mix and price. In addition, given our growing fleets with high utilization, we caught up on spare engine deliveries to support airline fleet stability.\nAlthough the spare engine ratio was elevated in the Q4, overall LEAP life-of-program ratio through 2024 remains in low double digits. Profit was $2.2 billion, up 44%, as spare parts volume, increased shop visit work scope, mix and price more than offset inflation and investments. Margins expanded 490 basis points to 28.2%. Overall, CES delivered strong full-year results, with orders up 38%, revenue up 13%, and profit growing 25% to $7.1 billion. Margins expanded 250 basis points to 26.2%. Moving to DPT, orders were up 22%, primarily driven by defense and systems. D\nemand remains strong here as well, with defense book-to-bill of 1.2x for the Q4 and the full year. Our backlog for the segment is now at $18 billion, up more than $1.5 billion year over year. Revenue grew 4%. Defense and systems revenue was up 6%, driven by higher engine deliveries and price, partially offset by lower services.Defense units were up 20% year-over-year, with more than 90% Q4. Propulsion and Additive Technologies, or PAT, grew 2%, as lower commercial volume at Avio was more than offset by growth in other PAT businesses.\nProfit was up 2%, driven by improved pricing and productivity, partially offset by investments in next-gen engines and inflation. Margins were down 20 basis points. Overall, a strong finish, as full-year orders were up 10%, revenue grew 6%, and profit was up 17% to $1.1 billion, with margin expansion of 110 basis points. A moment on corporate. We made substantial progress to ensure our operations reflect the needs of GE Aerospace as a standalone company. Corporate cost, including eliminations, was about $860 million for the year. Eliminations increased by $100 million to approximately $470 million from higher internal volume in PAT.\nExcluding eliminations, cost was down over 1/3 to roughly $400 million, driven by lower functional expenses and higher interest income. We also fully exited our remaining stake in GE HealthCare this quarter. For the year, we returned more than 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, including $5 billion of share buyback and a dividend of around 30% of net income. Based on the strength of our performance and balance sheet, GE Aerospace is well-positioned to compound shareholder returns for long term. Switching to our 2025 guide, starting with CES, we expect mid-teens revenue growth for the segment. We're now expecting services to be up low double digits to mid-teens, up from our prior view of low double digits.\nAt the midpoint, we expect internal shop visit revenue to be up from higher work scope, improved pricing, and high single-digit shop visit volume growth, which has pushed to the right from 2024. We continue to expect low double-digit spare parts revenue growth from mid-single-digit air traffic growth, and pricing. We expect equipment up high teens from growth in engine volume, including LEAP deliveries up 15% to 20%, and pricing, more than offsetting negative engine mix. We expect $7.6billion-$7.9 billion of profit at CES, reflecting the benefit of services growth. This will be partially offset by the impact from increased R&D investments and higher 9X deliveries in the second half of the year. We also expect a lower spare engine ratio.\nIn DPT, we expect mid- to high single-digit revenue growth with increased defense units and profit in the range of $1.1billion-$1.3 billion.Higher defense deliveries are partially offset by self-funded investments in the first half. Corporate costs are expected to be less than $1 billion. Eliminations are expected to grow as internal PAT volume grows. In total, we expect another year of low double-digit revenue growth for the company, with profit in the range of $7.8billion-$8.2 billion, up about $750 million or 10% at the midpoint over 2024.\nTurning to slide 12, we expect EPS to be in the range of $5.10-$5.45, up roughly 15% at the midpoint. About 80% of the improvement will be from higher profit. The balance will come through a reduction in the tax rate, which is expected to improve to below 20%. The benefit from share repurchases, including the $5 billion executed in 2024 and an additional $7 billion expected in 2025.\nWe expect to generate $6.3billion-6.8 billion of free cash flow, with year-over-year growth primarily from higher earnings. Contributions from working capital and ADNA combined year-over-year will be more than offset by higher CapEx and cash tax payments. Overall, we expect another year of conversion that is solidly above 100%. Taken together, GE Aerospace is poised for another year of growth ahead. With that, Larry, I'll turn it back to you.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nPerfect. Thank you. 2024 clearly was a strong first year for us as GE Aerospace. We grew revenue, earnings, and cash significantly, along with returning over $6 billion to shareholders. That performance was underpinned by our competitive advantages. Our platforms are preferred by customers across the narrow body, wide body, and defense sectors. Our industry-leading services and technologies provide the highest levels of operational reliability, including greater efficiency, time on wing, and faster turnaround times.\nAt the core of everything we do is safety, quality, delivery in that order. We're focused on unrivaled customer service and flight support across the industry's most extensive installed base with 70,000 engines. Our breakthrough innovations in both commercial and defense pave the way for more sustainable flight. Flight Deck, which connects our strategy to our results, enables us to deliver and create exceptional value for our customers and our shareholders. We believe our path forward is clear. We're well-positioned to deliver another year of substantial growth and deploy over 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Before we wrap our prepared remarks, I'd like to take a moment to express our support for all of those impacted by the fires in Southern California.\nSeeing our CF6, CFM56, and T700 engines powering many of the planes battling the fires, we feel a deep connection to our commitment to safety and hope that those fires can be contained soon. Blaire, shall we go to Q&A?\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nBefore we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Liz, can you please open the line?\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone. If you wish to withdraw your question or your question has already been answered, please press star one one again. Our first question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector of A&D Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning,Scott.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector of A&D Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nRahul, can you refresh us on what the 2025 guide is assuming with respect to LEAP OE profitability?\nAnd then when LEAP OE achieves break-even, do you foresee the profit trajectory flatlining from there, or is it reasonable to think the LEAP OE could be a profit center in its own right as time goes on and you benefit from some of these recent pricing gains and operational efficiency initiatives?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah. Thank you. Absolutely, Scott. So let me start, and Larry can add. Obviously, it's been a really good year for LEAP overall. I can start with answering your question, and Larry can comment on the operational improvements that we've driven here in LEAP. So first, Scott, it was a milestone year for LEAP. LEAP services became profitable in 2024, and the program becomes even break-even in 2025, with OE following a year later in 2026. So that was our prior expectation that continues to be our expectation today.\nAs we look at LEAP, how it performed during the year, the profitability for the program tended to be better than initial expectations from higher external spare parts volume, better pricing, lower warranty expenses as some of those fixes are going in, and more shop visits than we had initially expected. That's our expectation. The key milestone for 2025 is that our profitability and margins for the program are getting better from increase in shop visits and higher external spare parts volume. The OE performance improves despite more number of engines that we're going to ship. Just to comment on the external services volume, in 2024, external shop visits were just north of 10%. We expect that to increase to 15% in 2025.\nOn a sold basis, the shop visits that we have sold, about 25% of the shop visits are non-GE Safran shop visits. And that will help future profitability. So overall, listen, the program is on the right trajectory. And as the program kind of breaks even this year, OE becomes profitable next year. I think the services growth trajectory that the program has with the installed base, it's just going to power the program. So we expected LEAP to be kind of in CFM56 levels by 2028. Maybe CFM is performing a little bit better. But that's the trajectory that the program is on, that sometime in late towards the end part of this decade, LEAP and CFM are delivering the same amount of profit for the company. Are there anything you want to add here?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nOh, I think you've covered the landscape there. Clearly, much of what we've talked about, Scott, just already this morning with respect to managing the supply base sets us up, particularly as we think about the ramps with LEAP. We would expect LEAP new units to be up 15% to 20% this year, more to come after that, right? So that installed base growth, that aftermarket opportunity that Rahul was really talking about is really a function of what we're doing currently with the installed base, excuse me, the supply base.\nThat, of course, coupled with the progress that we made with the HBT at the end of the year on the 1A sets us up, I think, even more strongly in the marketplace. And we know the engines performing well in the market. I think we increased our share of cycles, what, 300 basis points in 2024.So we have a lot of good things in front of us. It's still, in many respects, early days for LEAP.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Miles Walton with Wolfe Research.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, Miles.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nAnd congrats, Blaire. Well-deserved. At the start of 2024, you were looking for about $1 billion of operating profit growth in 2025 versus 2024. The new guidance, Rahul, as you mentioned, is $750 million of growth. I'm not oblivious to the fact that you blew away the 2024 base number, but curious, just as you look at that sequential climb to 2025, what in the base profit of 2024 didn't translate into 2025? Thanks.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nSo Miles, listen, if you step back and you look at kind of the numbers that you alluded to, we were sitting in March 2024 expecting to get to about $7.2 billion, $7.2, $7.3 billion of profit by the end of 2025. And that was up, call it a billion and a half, billion six from where we ended 2023. Now, as we sit here today, as Larry said in his prepared remarks, we're going to add about $2.5 billion of profit in the two-year period. So that's about 1/3 better than what we thought just nine months ago. So the business is performing extremely well. Now, as you think about the 2025 profit, call it $800 million year-over-year at midpoint of $750 million and $1 billion at the high end.\nSo first, we spoke about the corporate eliminations, up about $100 million from elimination of from higher PAT volume. So that's one thing. But put that aside, we expect CES profit to be up about $700 million at the midpoint. And the biggest driver of profit growth within CES is the drop-through that we're getting from the services revenue that we expect to be up to about $3 billion up year over year at the midpoint of the guide. And we expect services margins to be flat despite with LEAP getting to be a greater share of that services revenue as other things, productivity, pricing, and all that is offsetting the LEAP mix impact. And to offset the services within CES will be the impact from OE, about split 50/50 between the R&D step-up and the increase in 9X shipments.\nWe expect 9X to be about a couple of hundred million dollars of headwind in 2025 as we ramp the number of engines that we are shipping. Spare engine ratio is expected to come down gradually as well here in 2025. That's the CES landscape. In DPT, listen, given the growth in backlog, 1.5 billion, so call it close to about 10% backlog growth in 2024, we expect mid- to high single-digit revenue growth. That's going to translate into profit. With margins expanding about 70 basis points at the midpoint of the guide. Overall, listen, should be a good year. To get to the high end of the $1 billion that you referenced, I think we just need services to be a little bit better and perform at the high end of the guidance.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.\n\nRonald Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, yeah. Good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, Ron.\n\nRonald Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nQuestion for you. On the 9X. When we think about that, I mean, 777X is back in flight test. Are there other opportunities for that engine beyond the 777X?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nRon, I would say that at this point in time, we're fully focused on helping our friends in Seattle get this plane launched. So we're obviously proud to be under wing. We think it's going to be a great wide-body program over time. Delighted to see, as you mentioned, flight testing resume. We started to ship engines to Boeing. So we've got work to do clearly, but the customer feedback relative to that aircraft and that engine continues to be quite strong. We've got nearly, what, 1,000 engines now in backlog.\nAnd I'd like to think that with the delays, we've made good use of that time with respect to just additional testing. It's probably going to end up being the most tested engine in our history. We're approaching 2,500 cycles. In fact, we've got a second dust test engine, critical in harsh and hot environments, underway. And we're already on our second iteration of HBT blades, let alone the CMC nozzle designs. So we're focused on that at the moment, but excited about that backlog and ultimately EIS.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, Larry and Rahul, and congrats, Blaire.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, guys. And maybe I wanted to focus back on CES margins in Q4, just given the performance was so stellar at 28%.\nEven on slower expected services growth, given the internal shop visit volume hasn't quite turned the corner. So when we think about the 2025 outlook and Rahul, I know you talked about this a little bit, services, you raised the guidance here from just one month ago to low to mid-teens. Can you talk about the moving pieces as you think about just the mix of spares, parts versus internal, and how the different engines are contributing to that? And maybe if you could just talk about the cadence throughout the year as well.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nAll right. So Sheila, let me start, and obviously, if I don't hit anything, come back and make sure we answer the question. Listen, CES had a good quarter, better than what we had expected.\nFavorable services mix, Sheila, as you mentioned, the shop visit volume wasn't exactly where we needed to be, but spare parts did better. And again, as we had kind of managed the supply chain challenges that we are encountering, those parts are fungible, and we kind of move them around every quarter to make sure that we are supporting our airline customers. So there's always a little bit of tension between external spare parts volume and internal shop visits. So the mix skewed towards spare parts in the quarter. And then engine mix was favorable as well. As we said in our prepared remarks, we caught up on the spare engines that we had not delivered in the first three quarters. So we caught up here in the fourth quarter.\nBut overall, listen, we expect spare engine ratio for LEAP through 2024 is in low double digits. So it'll gradually come down, but we're not expecting a steep drop-off here. So as you think about 2025, Sheila, within CES, we do expect spare parts to remain strong here. Given where the external market is, we expect the departures to be up kind of mid-single digits. And then all the pricing changes that we implemented last year, that we're thinking about the summer, get spare parts to be kind of up low double digits. And the shop visit revenue, we're expecting shop visit revenue to be up mid-teens. And that's going to come from high single-digit shop visit volume growth.\nYou combine that with the work scopes that are increasing, like the wide-body programs like GE90 going for the second shop visit, GEnxs coming for the first shop visits versus a quick turn earlier, and then LEAP. So work scopes are increasing, and then modest price increases baked into that service portfolio. So that's kind of the landscape of the CES revenue growth. That is going to drive the profit in response to Miles' question earlier. Now, we're going to come out of the gate strong here, Sheila, within CES especially. The primary driver for that is, A, the GE9X shipments are more towards the back end of the year. But we are entering the year for spare parts with about 90% of that revenue in our backlog. So we'll have a strong quarter here to start with in our spare part sales.\nWe expect shop visits to grow as well. Then we had the CMR of over $200 million in one Q of last year. We're not expecting that to repeat. So we'll start the year strongly on profit. And revenue for the quarter for CES should be kind of in line with what we are expecting for full year. Hopefully, that answers the question, Sheila.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Doug Harnett with Bernstein.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGood morning. Thank you.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, Doug.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nI want to just follow up a little more on the commercial services growth because when you talk about low double digit, the mid-teens next year, that's a little better than you were talking about before or this year. But can you talk about where that's coming from?\nBecause wide-body versus narrow-body, and then is the constraint, in other words, could you go higher if you can resolve these supply chain issues?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nDoug, as you would imagine, it's a broad-based demand strengthening that we see. Could we go higher? We've got work to do with the supply chain to execute on what Rahul just walked everybody through. But there is more pent-up demand there, right? We've got the backlog. An unhelpful level of that is, in many respects, delinquent. So if we could continue to deliver the sequential improvements in inputs combined with the progress I know we're making in our own shops, I wouldn't say no, but we've got work to do to deliver what we just outlined. But again, it won't be a demand challenge for us in 2025, we believe. We don't want to take it all for granted. But given the environment, given the backlog, it really is about operational execution. That's where we're focused.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nThanks so much. Good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood afternoon. Good morning.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nJust a question on the LEAP. You're expecting 15% to 20% growth, as you and Rahul said, that you expect the spares ratio in that to come down. So looking at the remnant of those engines, how are you expecting the split to go between Airbus and Boeing in 2025?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nWell, we don't get into that level of detail publicly, but I think we are, as you would imagine, in frequent contact with all of our customers, particularly those two vis-à-vis the intentions they have for 2025. I think we are well aligned to support both of them as they step up production this year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much. And good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nI wanted to ask about the, in terms of spares growth, you kind of talked about departures and price. One of the other things kind of curious about is provisioning of third-party shops to do more LEAP maintenance over time, the degree to which that's happened, the degree to which that's still in front of us, and affects kind of the spares growth trajectory, and maybe also the CapEx that you're doing and how you think over time that plays into the amount of LEAP work that will be done internally versus externally.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nSo Seth, let me start, and Larry can jump in here. Obviously, as we're coming out of the gate here, most of the shop visits have been internal.\nAs you said, about 90%, give or take, were shop visits that we performed within Safran and GE. The external network is beginning to step up. We have five external partners. They're beginning to get volume. We spoke about the Akasa win with one of the third-party MRO partners that we have last quarter. So those visits are stepping up, and they've been stepping up sequentially as the year has gone up. So as we think about 2025, we expect about, call it 15-ish% of our shop visits to be external. And then, as I said earlier, about 25% of the shop visits that we have sold are going to which are to be performed by our third-party MRO partners. And then that'll gradually grow up as we get into 2030 and beyond. So that's the trajectory we are on. And within that, obviously, spare parts will grow.\nSpare parts sales will grow as more shop visits are performed externally. So the margins on the program will get better because of that dynamic. But overall, listen, even on the services side, on our internal service contracts, just given all the durability improvements that Larry just mentioned, our margins on our internal work that we are performing are very stable. I mean, we've had a couple of good years of service profitability results here on our own service contracts. So feel good about that as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, David.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nJust wanted to touch on the free cash flow forecast for 2025, Rahul. Maybe if you could go into it, looks like you're assuming neutral-ish overall working capital, maybe a slight tailwind.\nHow are you thinking that kind of breaks out between inventory, LTSA cash, ADNA, just those moving pieces within working capital?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah. So David, most of the cash growth in 2025 is going to be driven by our earnings. Working capital and ADNA combined should be a positive contributor. Within working capital, the inventory build-up should be less than what we had in 2024. I mean, in inventory, we added about $1.5 billion of inventory in 2024. We're obviously not expecting to add the same level. Now, again, our primary objective is to increase our deliveries, and we will do what it takes. But with the improvement in deliveries, we do expect that some of the inventory that we've built up will start getting liquidated.\nThe flip side of that is the contract assets, which was a very favorable contributor in 2024, will not be as favorable in 2025, just given the increase in shop visits. So still a positive, but not as much of a positive. So that's kind of within the working capital. Now, ADNA, overall, we ended at about $300 million of outflow in 2024, which was consistent with what we thought at the beginning of the year, a little bit more skewed towards the fourth quarter. But expect overall ADNA outflow to be at the same level, maybe marginally higher. So that's kind of expectation on ADNA. And then the positive contributions from working capital and ADNA will be offset by we expecting higher cash tax payments next year and a step up in CapEx.So conversion still solidly above 100%, maybe a little bit lower than what we had in 2024.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHey, good morning, everybody. And Blaire, congratulations on the elevated role. Well-deserved.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning,\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nLarry. And Rahul. Hey, good morning, everybody. Rahul and Larry, why don't you just spend a few minutes on labor productivity across the company, and where you think you are relative to pre-pandemic levels, and what you think it's going to take for the company to get back to the productivity that it was seeing prior to the pandemic, and just how much of that is actually in your control and how much of it is dependent on external suppliers getting you what you need on time. Thanks.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nJason, I think that as I look back on 2024, everything that we saw come through the financials, everything we saw visiting a number of our operations, just ample evidence that the Flight Deck principles and tools really are helping us go in, put the operators at the center of all we do, and just drain the waste out of their daily work. That, to me, is the heart of productivity, labor productivity. Unfortunately, that work that we see with our own eyes hasn't fully translated into either better on-time delivery performance or labor productivity for the very reason that you touched on. I don't want this to sound in any way defensive.\nThe progress that we're making with those material inputs that we referenced in the prepared remarks, the sequential first half, second half up 26%, coupled with the higher predictability, the higher reliability of those inputs, north of 90% now for the critical suppliers, will enable us to have more predictable, more linear flow through our factories, through our repair shops, such that I think we'll actually do better from a labor productivity. It's hard to quantify how much, if you will, labor lack of productivity comes as a result of our delivery challenges on the inbound side. But as we work those, I think we sit here fully expecting to be able to deliver better labor productivity in 2025 and certainly from there.\nOur next question comes from Gavin Parsons with UBS.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nDirector of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, UBS\n\nHey. Morning, guys.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nDirector of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, UBS\n\nI'd love to just kind of go further into supply chain a little bit. It sounds like it's getting better. You've got the LEAP-1A blade certified, but internal shop visits were still down in Q4. Just maybe if you could go into where the bottlenecks or the pain points still are and if that's a linear improvement through 2025 or if that's a step function at some point on an unlock. Thank you.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nWell, I don't think we have much by way of new news in that regard. The challenge remains as it has with 15 or so critical suppliers that we're working intensely with. I think we mentioned yet again today that we've got well over 500 of our own people embedded in the supply base working to identify and eliminate constraints, thus unlocking the output that we need.\nI think as we look at 2024, the progress that we made in hindsight is significant, but it came in fits and starts, right? It was a game of inches, if you will. I think that will continue to be the case in 2025. There's no step function improvement necessarily sitting out there. On the HBT blade, certainly the LEAP-1A durability kit will help. But more broadly speaking, it really is working through the entirety of the supply base to make sure they're clear on our demand signals that those are being properly deployed and that we're working through whatever capacity constraints, bottlenecks, and the like that they may have in their own operations. And that, to me, is really what's so critical. And that'll be fundamental to how we support Boeing this year as they ramp particularly on the 737 MAX. And the same goes with Airbus.\nAnd we know we're working very hard, well-aligned with Airbus as we both march toward their rate 75. So a lot to do. It won't be linear, but I think we have tremendous confidence that we're coming into 2025 far better prepared for the ramp than we were coming into 2024. And the final thing I'll say is that we often talk about the ramp wholly focused on new make. The work we do with our supply base helps us support the airframers, but it's often the same parts and the same suppliers that feed into the aftermarket. So I would just caution anyone about over-indexing on that, say, that 15% to 20% increase in LEAP new make in 2025. The demands on the supply base are going to be in excess of that, again, because we also need to support the aftermarket with those same partners.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nGavin, just to add to what Larry just said, just as we think about 2025 here and as we're coming out of the gate, you saw the sequential improvement in our engine output in Q4. We expect that kind of continuously sequential improvements as you go through the year. But what that translates into is a little bit more growth on a year-over-year basis as we get into the second and third quarters, because that's where we had some challenging quarters last year because we started out well coming out of the gate in Q1. So how that translates for our overall business and just to add to what I said to Sheila's question earlier about how CES is going to perform, I think the same applies to DPT as well.\nDPT is going to have a little softer start here in Q1, given the first quarter was pretty strong for DPT, but a little slower start in DPT, plus some of the internal investments that we are making in the business to support the new programs. So if you step back and look at the company overall, we expect overall full year revenue for the first quarter to line up with what we are expecting for full year for the company. Our profit to be flat, maybe sequentially down a little bit versus what we did in the fourth quarter as we go from Q4 to Q1, perhaps it could be flat to maybe slightly down, but strong growth on a year-over-year basis and margins should expand in the quarter as well.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nLiz, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThis question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.\n\nRobert Spingarn\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace, Defense and Equity Research, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning.\n\nRobert Spingarn\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace, Defense and Equity Research, Melius Research\n\nLarry, maybe I can finish off with a high-level strategic question. Some would argue that RTX's ability to bundle Pratt's propulsion technology with Collins' offering in avionics and structures could provide them with a competitive advantage when bidding for work packages on future aircraft programs. Your balance sheet's in great shape. This is evidenced by your updated cash deployment plans this morning. And since you're going to generate a lot of cash over the next five years, is there any desire to expand the business beyond propulsion through organic or, more particularly, inorganic means? Thank you.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nI think we will stand by our capital allocation framework that we shared almost a year ago now with respect to how we think we will deploy not only our cash flows and our cash reserves in 2025, but going forward. We certainly have ample resources.\nBut again, just to reiterate, we're going to have a strong bias toward shareholder returns. Doesn't mean that we will exclude M&A, but as you saw with the North Star announcement, much of what we'll do will be small tuck-ins and adjacencies. I don't think I've ever, in this role at this company or elsewhere, publicly commented on specific situations, and I think I'll hold to that again here this morning. But we appreciate and understand the question.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nLarry, any final comments?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nBlaire,I would just wrap up to say the team all around the world delivered standout results in 2024, and clearly the finish there in the fourth quarter was no exception. I hope everybody on the call heard how excited we are about the year ahead as we work to meet what we believe to be historic industry demand and deliver for our customers.\nWe certainly appreciate your time today and your interest in GE Aerospace.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Liz, and I will be your conference coordinator today. If you experience issues with the webcast slides refreshing or there appears to be delays in the slide advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Blaire Schoor from the GE Aerospace investor relations team. Please proceed.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks Liz. Welcome to GE Aerospace's second quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm joined by Chairman and CEO Larry Culp and CFO Rahul Ghai. Many of the statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and website. Those elements may change as the world changes. Now over to Larry.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nBlaire thanks, and hello everyone from London near the Farnborough International Airshow for GE Aerospace's first earnings call. As an independent company, GE Aerospace is an exceptional franchise with the industry's largest and growing commercial propulsion fleet, and is the rotorcraft and combat engine provider of choice. Our installed base is 70,000 commercial and defense engines supports our aftermarket services business representing about 70% of our revenues. That's recurring, resilient, and keeps us close to our customers.\nOur purpose has never been clearer: to invent the future of flight, lift people up, and bring them home safely. Those last four words, bring them home safely, is a serious responsibility at any point. There are 900,000 people in the sky with our technology under wing, which is why safety and quality are at the center of everything that we do. Our teams around the world understand it is our top priority and paramount in Flight Deck, our proprietary lean operating model.\nHere at Farnborough, the conversations we're having are energizing and focused on both the opportunities and the challenges the industry is facing as we work together to meet historic demand and build more sustainable solutions. We've had a productive few days, including wide-body commitments from Turkish Airlines and National Airlines for GE90 engines and Japan Airlines for GEnx engines. We're also honored to have British Airways, a new GEnx customer, committing to six new Boeing 787s powered by our engines. The GEnx engine offers a 15% lower fuel burn compared to the CF6 and best-in-class time on wing, resulting in a 70% life-of-program win rate on the 787 platform. In narrowbodies, we're pleased the LEAP-powered Airbus A321XLR was certified by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, or EASA, just last week.\nThe A321XLR marks the fifth member of the A320neo family aircraft powered by LEAP engines with expected entry into service later this year. LEAP, the narrow-body engine of choice, offers 15% better fuel efficiency than the CFM56 and will deliver mature levels of time on wing later this year. In regionals, Embraer and GE Aerospace extended our agreement for new CF34 engine deliveries through the end of this decade. This agreement strengthens our partnership as the sole source engine on the E175 and supports the continued growth of regional jets.\nKeeping an eye towards the future this week at the show, we've shared a number of updates about the CFM RISE program. RISE is the suite of pioneering technologies including Open Fan, compact core, hybrid electric systems, and alternative fuels. We continue to mature these technologies, moving from component level evaluations to more module level tests. For example, with our partner Safran, we've demonstrated the aerodynamic and acoustic performance of the Open Fan design with more than 200 hours of wind tunnel tests. Additionally, we've announced a new agreement with the US Department of Energy to expand supercomputing capabilities which will further advance Open Fan design. The Open Fan is the most promising engine technology to help the industry reduce emissions, designed to meet or exceed customer expectations for durability and deliver a step change in fuel efficiency.\nTurning to some of the key takeaways on our second quarter performance, our team delivered double digit growth across orders, operating profit, and free cash flow, while revenue was impacted by lower output. With Flight Deck, we're well positioned to accelerate actions to deliver on our priorities for today, tomorrow, and in the future.\nIn Commercial Engines and Services, or CES. Air traffic trends remain positive, supporting our services growth and overall profit, which was up more than 20%. Profit growth was driven by 14% internal shop visits growth and improved pricing. In Defense and Propulsion Technologies, or DPT. We delivered very strong profit growth, up more than 70%, year over year. Services growth in defense and systems, and profit improvement in propulsion and additive technologies drove this increase. Overall, a very solid quarter and first half. And my thanks go out to the entire global GE Aerospace team.\nDay in, day out, we're focused on delivering for both our airline and airframer customers who simply want and need more of our products and services. While we've made progress in services this quarter, our new engine output was disappointing, down 20% sequentially. It's a clear challenge that we're facing head on, accelerating the use of Flight Deck in partnership with our suppliers as we work to solve the ongoing supply chain constraints. Last quarter we shared that the common denominator impacting growth across both services and new engines is constrained material supply. With 80% of material input shortages tied to nine suppliers across 15 supplier sites, this remains our focus today. We've deployed more than 550 of our engineering and supply chain resources into the supply base to use Flight Deck to work hand in hand with our suppliers to identify and resolve constraints.\nWe've made significant improvements in many areas. At more than 2/3 of these sites, material flow more than doubled sequentially and is currently no longer constraining deliveries. We're grateful for their collaboration, but there's still more to do in the second half and we've sharpened our focus on a subset of the remaining priority sites that are still constraining out our output. We're making some progress, but not enough to meet demand. I've personally visited several of these sites and I'm confident we can partner with our suppliers to drive faster progress. For example, earlier this month we partnered with one of the priority suppliers in a joint Kaizen focused on addressing a key constraint. Our supply chain and engineering teams jointly leverage Flight Deck to identify action plans to improve throughput significantly aligned with our needs for second half deliveries.\nThese actions resulted in a double digit material input growth here so far in July versus the second quarter average, so a promising start. Overall, we're not yet at a desired state, but we're counting on these joint action plans and continuous improvement to achieve our second half ramp. So far in July relative to April, we've seen overall higher engine output stability and reduced variability. We're also deploying Flight Deck aggressively in our own operations to improve safety, quality, delivery, and cost. And in that order, we've made solid progress in support of our airline customers. For example, our internal shop visit output improved 15% sequentially, and nowhere has this improvement been more visible than with LEAP. We've continued to decrease our turnaround time for LEAP shop visits to 86 days compared to roughly 100 days in 2023. This yielded a 9% increase in LEAP internal shop visits sequentially.\nWe're also investing both organically and inorganically to meet the expected growth in shop visits as the LEAP fleet doubles by 2030, as we announced last week. Over the next five years, we're planning to invest $1 billion in our MRO facilities around the world to increase capacity and introduce new technologies to further reduce turnaround time and costs. This includes a recent agreement to acquire a dedicated LEAP test cell, unlocking a key constraint in our shop visit output.\nOverall, I am encouraged by our progress, but by no means satisfied. I'm confident that in the second half we'll increase engine delivery significantly and continue to grow shop visits in support of our customers.\nIn the quarter. While output weighed on revenue, GE Aerospace delivered significant profit and free cash flow growth. Demand remained strong with orders up 18%. Revenue was up with growth in both segments. Services growth combined with price more than offset the lower engine shipments. Our operating profit was $1.9 billion, up 37% year over year from services growth, price, and favorable mix. Operating margins expanded 560 basis points to 23.1%. Both operating profit and margin were up significantly at CES and DPT.\nAdjusted EPS was $1.20, up more than 60% year over year. This improvement was driven by increased operating profit combined with a lower tax rate. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion, up nearly 20%, driven by higher earnings, which more than offset inventory growth from the supply chain constraints I mentioned a moment ago. Halfway through the year, we're well positioned with earnings and free cash flow both up significantly year over year, and free cash flow conversion of nearly 120%, giving us confidence to raise our full-year profit and cash guidance. This continued profit and free cash flow growth, combined with returning approximately $25 billion of available cash to shareholders, will continue to compound returns. Now over to Rahul for the details on our segment results and our guidance.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nThank you Larry and good day everyone. Starting with CES, air traffic growth remained robust with departures up 9% year to date, and we continue to expect to be up high single digits for the full year. Passenger departures are expected to be up high single digits as narrowbody remains solid with LEAP up nearly 30% in the second quarter, more than 3x that of overall narrowbody market. Dedicated freight departures are now expected to be up mid single digits versus a prior expectation of low single digits.\nMoving to CES. second quarter results sustained commercial momentum, drove significant orders growth up 38% this quarter. Both services and equipment were up more than 35% with strong spare parts demand. Revenue grew 7% with services volume and price more than offsetting lower engine deliveries.\nServices grew 14% from mid teens. Internal shop visit growth with strength in time and material visits and improved pricing. As expected, year on year shop visits grew more than spare parts. Equipment revenue declined 11% from 26% lower engine shipments. This was partially offset by customer mix and price. Supply chain constraints impacted shipments across both narrowbody and widebody with LEAP down 29%. Profit was $1.7 billion, up 21%, with margins expanding 320 basis points driven by improved performance in services from higher volume, pricing, and mix. Lower engine shipments and improving LEAP services profitability were also supported profit and margin expansion. This more than offset the impact of lower spare engine deliveries and increased investments that impacted equipment profit.\nTaking a step back at CES, we delivered a strong first half with services revenue up 13% and overall segment profit up nearly 20%. Turning to DPT, the sector remains resilient with US defense spending expected to grow low single digits and international up mid single digits with Flight Deck. We are focused on running this business better to deliver more predictably while continuing to invest in the future of combat. We recently achieved a significant milestone delivering two T901 engines for the US Army's Improved Turbine Engine Program or ITEP for integration and testing on the UH-60 Black Hawk. The T901 engine will ensure that warfighters have the performance, power, and reliability necessary to maintain significant advantage on the battlefield for decades to come. Turning to our results, orders were down 25% primarily due to timing of orders in Defense and systems.\nDefense book to bill was 0.9 in the quarter and 1.0 for the first half. Revenue grew 1%. Defense and Systems revenue was down 6%. Engine deliveries were down approximately 60% from supply chain challenges and a tough year over year compare when we delivered significantly higher units. This more than offset product pricing and services growth.\nPropulsion and additive technologies grew 16% with growth across several businesses from higher output and improved pricing. Profit was $344 million up more than 70% year over year with margins expanding 580 basis points from higher output, favorable product mix, productivity, price, and the absence of program-related costs.\nThrough the first half of the year, DPT delivered high single digit revenue growth and significant operating profit improvement. The business remains well positioned to deliver growth over the medium term with a backlog of nearly $17 billion. Spending a moment on corporate adjusted cost and intercompany eliminations, were roughly $130 million down nearly 40% year over year. This $80 million improvement is from actions taken to streamline our cost structure, accelerate elimination of wind down costs, and favorable interest income that more than offset higher intercompany eliminations. As part of our continued efforts to simplify and focus on our core, this quarter we completed the sale of Electric Insurance. We also reached an agreement to sell the licensing business and a reinsurance agreement to exit a block of our life and health insurance business. Combined, these actions will result in proceeds of roughly $700 million of investing cash flow.\nLooking ahead. Given the strong results and the momentum in our business, we are raising our profit and cash guidance. We are reducing our revenue guidance given lower engine output expectations.\nGrowth is now projected to be up high single digits due to lower equipment revenue in CES. We now expect CES equipment revenue to be up high single to low double digits from prior guidance of up high teens. This includes our updated full year LEAP output expectations of flat to up 5% year over year. We continue to expect CES services to grow mid teens, putting overall growth of CES at low double digits to mid teens.\nConsistent with prior guidance, we expect DPT growth of mid- to high-single-digits. Operating profit is now expected to be in a range of $6.5 to 6.8 billion, up $250 million at the midpoint from prior guidance with margin expansion year over year. This improvement is primarily from CES, with operating profit now expected to be $6.3 to 6.5 billion from $6.1 to 6.4 billion previously, reflecting improved services performance and impact of lower equipment sales. DPT profit guidance is unchanged, and corporate cost and intercompany eliminations are now expected to be below $900 million from approximately $1 billion previously. Our expectations for interest, expense, and tax rate are unchanged, and we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance range to $3.95 to $4.20, up more than 50% year over year at the midpoint from higher profit growth.\nWe are also raising our free cash flow guidance to $5.3 to $5.6 billion with above 100% conversion of net income given profit growth. While we still expect to reduce working capital for the year, the improvement is expected to be lower given the impact of supply chain challenges to inventory. Overall free cash flow is up approximately $700 million, year over year, at the midpoint. All in, GE Aerospace is positioned for significant revenue, profit, and free cash flow growth with strong conversion in 2024. Larry, back to you.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nRahul. Thanks as we take flight. As GE Aerospace, we have sustained competitive advantages with a tremendous value proposition with the industry's largest and growing fleets. Our platforms are preferred by customers across the narrowbody, widebody, and defense sectors. We're aiming to provide industry-leading reliability and durability, prioritizing SQDC in that order. This means delivering unmatched time on wing and faster turnaround times for our customers with our deep domain expertise and engineering talent, commitment to innovation, and capacity to invest. We're poised to deliver breakthrough technologies in both commercial and defense. And with Flight Deck as our foundation, we'll deliver for customers and create exceptional value for shareholders. All in, we expect to grow operating profit to approximately $10 billion in 2028 and generate free cash flow in excess of net income, creating compounding returns.\nWe're making meaningful progress to advance our strategic priorities in service of our customers, employees, and shareholders, while keeping an eye towards the future and paving the way with innovation for more sustainable flight. Now, Blaire, let's go to questions.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nBefore we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Liz, can you please open the line?\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star 11 on your telephone. If you wish to withdraw your question or your question has already been answered, please press star 11 again. Our first question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.\n\nRobert Spingarn\n\nManaging Director and Lead Research Analyst, Melius Research\n\nGood afternoon.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nMorning, Rob.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nHey, Rob.\n\nRobert Spingarn\n\nManaging Director and Lead Research Analyst, Melius Research\n\nI don't know who wants to take this one, but I wanted to ask you, just given the slower ramp on the narrowbody programs as well as the durability issues on the geared turbofan, we've seen airlines extending the lives of older aircraft and engines, are we getting to the point where some of your CFM56 customers are talking about increasing the work scope of their third shop visits or maybe even doing a fourth shop visit?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nWell, Rob, I think that you really put your finger on one of the important underlying dynamics here, not only in the quarter, but as we think about the second half and even the next few years. The CFM56 is clearly still the workhorse of the industry. I mean, if we look at utilization at a time when people thought we might begin to see a little bit of a fade, utilization year over year is consistent with the CFM56. Delighted to see the LEAP up 4 points from a share perspective. So overall GE narrow body powered propulsion is probably north of 70%. So I think the CFM is going to have a longer life in many fleets and clearly that's going to help us in the aftermarket, both from a volume and from a scope perspective.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah, Rob, just to maybe add a little bit to what Larry said, just given the dynamics that he mentioned and you mentioned earlier, we are expecting that the peak shop visit that we had previously projected in 2025 and then we start to see the sequential downtick in 2026-2027 is what we said at Investor Day. Now, as we sit here today, we do expect that, you know, shop visits probably plateau at that 2025 level for maybe another couple of years and then start declining. So definitely we are seeing that.\nThe program, the platform, is getting used and the shop visits will be higher for an extended period of time, and we will see third shop visits and that we're seeing that even with, you know, some of the lessors coming out and commenting that they've, you know, the leases are getting extended beyond 14, 15 years for another four or five years. So we will definitely see what you just said.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning. Apologies for the background noise. I'm actually here at the show. I was hoping Larry or Rahul, you could comment on the 15 supplier sites and nine suppliers that seem to be the source of the bulk of the delays in parts, and where that was last year. And maybe just if you can bucket the types of products we're talking about at those 15 sites. Thanks.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nMyles, we could hear you loud and clear. We're not too far away, I suspect. I think if you go back to April, what we said was 3/4 of the challenge with respect to deliveries was really rooted in these 15 supplier sites again with nine different companies. And rather than finger point, our mindset was we're going to problem solve. And we've gone in deeply again with Flight Deck to really try to understand these constraints at the core.\nThe slide that you see in the deck I think is evidence that that approach, that collaborative problem solving rather than finger pointing, is really yielding results. We didn't expect that we would see blanket impact immediately, but to be able to point to 2/3 of those sites showing strong, nearly doubling of their sequential outputs inputs to us, I think really tells us something, right, that this approach is going to have impact. Unfortunately, we didn't have all of the impact that we would have liked across those 15. We need everybody's oar in the water, if you will. We need everybody contributing, particularly with respect to new engine deliveries.\nBut I think, given what we have seen here in July, the way that we're working across different commodity classes shows us that this approach is a better way to get more, not only here in the third quarter or the second half, but as we think about what is a multi-year ramp, right? The airframers that we talk to here at Farnborough, certainly in the airlines as well, no one loves the fact that a new narrow-body order may not be delivered until 2029 or 2030. So it's all about the ramp. We've got years in front of us, thankfully. What a wonderful business challenge to have. But I really like the way our suppliers have met us here. Embrace the tools.\nWe just need more time working in this fashion in order to have the full effect that we, our airframer and our airline customers all desire.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi, good morning, Mary and Rahul. How are you?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood, thank you Sheila.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nMaybe if I could ask about the CES margins, which were pretty awesome. So just looking at the LEAP deliveries in the quarter, Q1 versus Q2, Q2 had 70 less LEAP deliveries in the quarter, so about a $10 million profit swing, depending upon your loss assumption there. So CES margins of 27% in Q2 versus Q3 versus Q1 of 23% implies that the core service margin improved about 1,000 to 1,500 basis points, depending on what you want to choose. So 25% to 35% plus. So what drove that? Despite shop visits being better than spares, and how do we think about the second half progression?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah. Now, Sheila, it was a good quarter for CES. Overall OE volume was weak, as you pointed out, but the service revenue recovered really nicely. The overall services growth was kind of in line with what we had projected for full year. So it kind of came in exactly what we were thinking. The drop through from services was very strong. The shop visits skewed towards time and material work, and then the work scopes were heavier as well. That, you know, helped both revenue and the profit on those shop visits. This, along with pricing and customer mix, helped the services profit growth. In equipment, the engine shipments were lower. Within equipment, you know, we also reduced our spare engine deliveries and higher investments.\nSo that kind of offset the impact of the lower engine shipments. Overall OE profit was more flattish than anything else. Now, as we look at the trends in H1, that gave us the confidence here to raise profit expectations for the full year by call it $150 to 200 million at the midpoint of the guide.\nNow, what's driving that are two things. One, the services growth that we just mentioned, all the things that we are seeing. We projected that favorability to now flow through into the second half as well, both with work scopes and some of the customer mix being favorable. And then we lowered our OE revenue output, but call it $600, $650 million at the midpoint of the guide. And that is helping profit. So that is where you see our CES profit up for the year $150 to 200 million dollars. And the margins for CES will be kind of at this level, will be flattish for the year. And that is despite this being the first year of 9X shipments. So really, really happy with the way the CES business is coming along.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nThanks. Good morning. Good afternoon.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nMorning, David.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nLarry, can you just maybe dig into this? You know the lower LEAP shipments in the quarter. I know you're talking about things progressing with these nine suppliers, but at the same time, obviously deliveries were way down the quarter. I would imagine they were 100, 125 short of kind of your internal expectations. So can you kind of just square that things are getting better, but deliveries were a lot lower than expected. Thanks.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nDavid, I don't want to repeat what I said earlier. I do think one of the things to keep in mind is that there is a timing dynamic relative to when we receive various inputs and when in turn we convert that into an engine that we can deliver.\nBe it to Airbus or to Boeing. Right. So April was challenging in a number of ways. We didn't have the recovery in May that I think we had hoped we might see. Underlying the quarter, though sequentially, was the net improvement that I mentioned, and that has only continued to build here in July. We haven't seen that somewhat typically slow start to a quarter that I was concerned about. So there's really nothing more I can say about why the new unit deliveries, LEAP included, were disappointing.\nIt is what it is. Where we're focused as we think about the rest of the year is how do we deliver more and how do we deliver more reliably. You'll note that we are adjusting our outlook for LEAP deliveries this year on a full year basis. We now think we will be somewhere between flat and up 5%, obviously lower than where we thought, but still showing modest growth. And more importantly, I think given what we're doing Flight Deck in the supply base, the expectations we have not only for more inputs, but in turn more outputs, positions us to be at a healthier, more stable, higher exit rate come the end of the year. That's where we're focused. That's what we're sharing with our customers. Work to do. Work I think this team knows how to do.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much and good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nMorning, Seth.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nI wondered just to kind of follow up on that last question and thinking about the progression on the delivery side. I think, you know, need a pretty significant increase off of the Q2 equipment revenue level to get to the guide for the year. You know, is there, is it going to be possible to make much progress in Q3? Should we expect much more significant progress in Q4, and any other color that could you can provide about the sequential dynamics across the company?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nSeth, let me start by just kind of maybe talking a little bit about how we think the back half will shape up. And Larry can add if there's anything more on the delivery side. You know, listen, overall as you look at our first half to second half growth. First half, you know, we've delivered about 9% growth, and it's kind of in line with what we are projecting for the full year. So our year over year growth is going to look similar between first half and second half. The year over year growth will be higher in the fourth quarter as both services and OE ramp.\nSo we'll see that now in terms of profit and drop through. The margins will be higher in Q3 versus Q4 since the 9X shipment impact is going to be primarily in the fourth quarter, and corporate expenses will be higher in the fourth quarter as well. So we expect the third quarter margins to be kind of flattish.\nYear over year since we had a strong Q3 last year. So now if you take a look at kind of getting to how Q3 looks operationally, we've had a better start to Q3. I think Larry mentioned that in his prepared remarks. The number of engines we've shipped here in third quarter, in the first month of third quarter in July, are significantly higher than what we delivered in the first three weeks in April. So we are seeing sequential progress. And then if you look at the material input and as we compare the material input through the first three weeks in July versus the first three weeks in April, even for these suppliers that have been constraining output in the second quarter, we've seen a significant improvement. So that's going to allow us to drive the sequential improvement here in the third quarter\nSo I think we are off to a good start. We have more work to do here for sure. But you know, July has been encouraging.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nAnything to add?\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nYeah. Hey, good morning. Thank you guys.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning. Good results.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks Gautam.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nThank you.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nSo I was curious just to follow. Culp, could you talk a little bit about how much inventory you're actually absorbing incrementally in the guidance, and maybe if you can speak to what your strategy is with the supply chain, given some folks are constrained, but some folks are probably ahead given the lower LEAP projection relative to the start of the year. Are you in the process of slowing down some folks?\nIf you could just talk about that. Inventory dynamics and what you're absorbing incrementally and any color you can provide? Thanks.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nWell, maybe we'll just take those in reverse order and I'll start. I think that. We really aren't trying to slow down. In a meaningful way. We're really trying. The way I think about it is we're trying to make sure that we're calibrated with respect to what we need from everybody. Because as you point out, different folks are in different places, as we think about the back half, as we think about 2025, as we think about 2026. I think part of why this has been so challenging, and maybe even head scratchingly so for some, is that the industry was dialed down to almost zero in the pandemic. And what we don't want to do, and the reason we do carry probably more inventory today will at year end than we would like, is we don't want to turn down the folks that are performing well unduly as we calibrate the ramp rates with those that will in all likelihood pace us.\nSo we've taken a view that in some instances. The inventory is in effect an investment. With the supply base for ourselves to make sure that we've got a more predictable ramp. Remember, a lot of lean is rooted in flow and flow really is around availability. To the extent that we've got some folks that are performing, we don't want to, if you will, penalize them as we think about all that we're going to need from them not only over the next six months, but frankly over the coming years.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nGautam, you'll see that in our queue. I think you're spot on. We've seen significant inventory growth here in the first half of the year, close to $1.2 billion of inventory growth, which is, call it, $0.5 billion higher than what we grew in the first half of last year. Significant headwind here. Now with the improvement in output that we are projecting here for the second half of the year, we do think that while inventory will grow in the second half of the year, obviously the pace of growth will slow down significantly here, and then it won't be as much of a headwind as it was last year in the second half of the year.\nSo it has been a challenge, but again, as Larry said, that is something we've been trying to manage, and you know, manage it as appropriately as we can. But the good news is, despite the buildup of inventory growth in the first half of the year, we still had 120% conversion. So strong cash growth; cash was up about $1 billion year over year in the first half. So we kind of absorbed it, we managed it, and try to do better in the second half.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good afternoon. Good afternoon.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nHey, Scott.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, Larry. Not to beat a dead horse, but just following up on Myles' earlier question, I was wondering if you could offer some more detail on those, I guess six or so remaining supplier sites that are the key bottlenecks at this point. Basically trying to understand if we're down to the investment castings and forging suppliers at this point or if it's a broader set of bottlenecks. And I appreciate not wanting to point any fingers, but just trying to get a sense for whether there's something in common undergirding this remaining set of suppliers. Thanks.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nScott. I think you've heard me pretty clearly. I appreciate that. I think the common denominator is frankly, we all need to do better, and we need to be more collaborative and fully in problem solving mode. That's the mindset that we have at GE Aerospace. I'm convinced while that takes different forms at different suppliers, that is where every one of those nine suppliers across those 15 sites are. Some made more progress than others. But it's a long race. This was not a 90-day sprint. This is a marathon. And regardless of where folks are, from a commodity category perspective, from a geography perspective, publicly held, privately held, it just doesn't matter, right? We've got to get the teams in, we've got to go deep, we've got to get into the granular operational detail to solve those problems, unlock those constraints, increase capacity.\nRaise yields, much as I think we have been doing. Picked up the pace a bit here, I think, in the second quarter and just need to do a lot more of that broadly in the second half.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner and Senior Equity Analyst, Vertical Research\n\nThanks very much. Good afternoon.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood afternoon Robert.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner and Senior Equity Analyst, Vertical Research\n\nJust following on from your earlier comments, Larry, and your confidence in GE's ability to deliver new engines in the second half, what's your confidence in the relative forecasts of the airframers and also their broader supply chain also catching up and delivering the parts?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nWell, I think we'll leave to our customers' commentary on everything they're managing. We're focused on what we can manage. Right. I think that the updated guide here, the color around LEAP specifically, is certainly that of high confidence. It wouldn't come out of our mouths. It wouldn't be in our prepared remarks otherwise. But again, work to do, work we're encouraged by with respect to the second quarter impact, the start to July as well. We've got a lot of work in front of us. We've got many days to do that work. That's where this team is focused completely, I can assure you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning everyone.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, Noah.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nYou show on slide 17 that the CES services orders are growing much faster than revenue and the absolute dollar levels are much higher.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nI guess.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nEventually, overall, aftermarket has to normalize. As we fully recover air travel growth.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nWhat's behind that? How much of that is the LEAP? And you know, does that suggest that CES services growth can actually accelerate next year versus this year?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nNo, no, you're right. I mean, we had a good second quarter on orders. We had a good first half. I mean, services orders were, you know, kind of, as you said, mid-30s for the second quarter, up 30% or so for the first half. You know, strong book-to-bill here.\nIn the first half of the year, on top of a good book-to-bill we saw in 2023. So the momentum is definitely there on the services side. And you know, as you look at the back half of the year, we are expecting the services growth to be a little bit higher in the second half than in the first half, both on the shop visits and on spare parts, on a year-over-year basis. So we delivered 9% internal shop visit growth in the first half of the year. And if you look at our low to mid teens guidance on shop visits, that would imply that shop visits will be closer to high teens in the second half of the year, on a year-over-year basis. So that's what we are projecting.\nBut overall, listen, mid-teens services growth, and that is consistent with what we think the future years will look like. I think that's what we had when we look at our 2025 outlook. We were projecting continued strong services growth. So it's good to see the strong orders growth. Good to see, as Larry said earlier, LEAP gaining share on the overall air traffic departure side as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Gavin Parsons with UBS.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nDirector of Equity Research, UBS\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nDirector of Equity Research, UBS\n\nI mean, I guess to Rob's question earlier on, extending life of older engines, clearly strong demand for both growth and new aircraft. But there's been a couple airline profit warnings over the last week or two. So I just wanted to ask if you've had any early indications from your discussions with customers, whether it be relating to fleet planning, sensitivity to pricing, or any other changes. Thanks.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGavin. As you would imagine we follow all of that pretty closely. Both well in the US, here in Europe, and globally. We really have not seen any effect on our business. Rahul's comments a moment ago. We'll remain watchful but don't anticipate that. Again, I think to the, to the earlier question. With services orders up 36% in CES in the second quarter, that's the way our customers are speaking to us. I look at where we are here in the third quarter just in terms of how much of the spares activity we have in backlog.\nI think it's in the 90% range at this point. Well positioned very early here in the quarter. Again, I would just also point to the utilization that we see on the CFM56. Still strong, no real change.\nThis year, and the uptake, the upshot of the leap, taking four points of market share. So GE-powered narrow body activity remains strong. Just take the comments that were out here in Europe yesterday. It seemed to be more pricing-oriented than anything else. So we'll keep a weather eye out. But right now our challenge, our struggle, is to keep up with this exceptionally strong demand both in the aftermarket and again with new make.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nGood morning, everybody.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nMorning, Jason.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nLarry, I was wondering if you could just spend a few more minutes on the RISE and maybe provide an update on some development milestones there and how the customer conversations are going at this point. You mentioned that you're showcasing the engine there at Farnborough. I'm just curious what?\nYou think customer acceptance is shaping up to look like at this point?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nJason. I would say that customer interest seems to only build with the passage of time. This is now the third air show in a row that I've attended with the RISE engine, the Open Fan engine front and center here. Obviously, when we talk about RISE, we're really talking about an umbrella of different technology programs. Not only the Open Fan, but also our compact core work, our hybrid electric activity, and everything we're doing on SAF. But with respect to Open Fan, I think what we've been sharing with people is that we had a very good first ingestion test with the Open Fan blade. In the first quarter, we are starting our second endurance campaign.\nOr test with the high pressure turbine airfoils. And there's been a lot of work with respect to the hybrid electric elements of that architecture. Work that, as you may know, we do with NASA. I mentioned, I think, earlier the wind tunnel testing that we've done here in Europe in conjunction with Airbus.\nSo there are, I think, over 200. I think maybe it's 250. Component-level tests, module-level tests that we have behind us. This is still a technology development effort, make no mistake about it right.\nWe've got a long way to go. But what's interesting, particularly here in Europe, virtually every airline CEO that I talk to starts the conversation with sustainability and very keen to get our views on SAF compatibility, but also ahead of SAF capacity being available at scale, what are we going to do to enable the next generation of narrowbodies? And we go hard and fast to RISE, talk about the progress that we're making with Open Fan. And I think that is a story that continues to build enthusiasm and support because we know that the ultimate target, that 20% step up in propulsive efficiency in emissions reduction really is the future of flight.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have time for one last question.This question will come from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo.\n\nMatt Akers\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nMorning, Matt.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning Matt.\n\nMatt Akers\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nI wanted to ask what are kind of your latest thoughts on LEAP? Kind of break-even timing, just given volumes are running a little bit lower than we thought, and it sounds like you're deploying a lot of resources to work through some of these supplier issues. Just curious if that timing has shifted at all.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah, Matt, timing has not shifted. So we expected LEAP to be profitable here in 2024 and the program to be break even in 2025. And LEAP services in fact shaping up a little bit better than what we originally thought as we started the year and we mentioned that in our prepared remarks. So, you know, that's how the overall program is shaping up. You know, we're making the progress on durability that we, that we were expecting, you know, the LEAP stacking better than CFM56 at this stage of the life cycle. We are expecting LEAP performance to be in line with CFM56 performance on the A320s by the end of the year. So that is obviously a huge milestone given all the improvements we've been driving. You know, the HPT blade was the last thing that was in.\nWe expect that to happen here in the fourth quarter. We've completed more than 3,500 tests on that. 3,500 hours of testing on that. So that's going really well. So all in, I think LEAP's progressing exactly the way we would have liked. Services dragging a little bit better. Program should break even next year.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nLarry, any final comments?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nBlaire, thank you. I think just to close, the GE Aerospace team is going to stay grounded in our responsibility that we share to live the purpose to invent the future of flight, to lift people up and bring them home safely. So we really appreciate your time today, and of course your interest in GE Aerospace.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\nGood day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the GE Aerospace second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Liz, and I will be your conference coordinator today. If you experience issues with the webcast slides refreshing or there appears to be delays in the slide advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Blaire Schoor from the GE Aerospace Investor Relations team. Please proceed.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks, Liz. Welcome to GE Aerospace's second quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm joined by Chairman and CEO Larry Culp and CFO Rahul Ghai. Many of the statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and website. Those elements may change as the world changes. Now over to Larry.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace",
    "content2": "Blaire thanks, and hello everyone from London near the Farnborough International Airshow for GE Aerospace's first earnings call as an independent company. GE Aerospace is an exceptional franchise with the industry's largest and growing commercial propulsion fleet and is the rotorcraft and combat engine provider of choice. Our installed base of 70,000 commercial and defense engines supports our aftermarket services business, representing about 70% of our revenues. That's recurring, resilient, and keeps us close to our customers. Our purpose has never been clearer. To invent the future of flight. Lift people up and bring them home safely. Those last four words, bring them home safely, is a serious responsibility at any point. There are 900,000 people in the sky with our technology under wing.\nWhich is why safety and quality are at the center of everything that we do. Our teams around the world understand it is our top priority and paramount in Flight Deck, our proprietary lean operating model.\nHere at Farnborough. The conversations we're having are energizing and focused on both the opportunities and the challenges the industry is facing as we work together to meet historic demand and build more sustainable solutions. We've had a productive few days, including wide-body commitments from Turkish Airlines and National Airlines for GE90 engines and Japan Airlines for GEnx engines. We're also honored to have British Airways, a new GEnx customer, committing to six new Boeing 787s powered by our engines. The GEnx engine offers a 15% lower fuel burn compared to the CF6 and best-in-class time on wing, resulting in a 70% life-of-program win rate on the 787 platform in narrowbodies. We're pleased the LEAP-powered Airbus A321XLR was certified by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency or EASA just last week.\nThe A321XLR marks the fifth member of the A320neo family aircraft powered by LEAP engines with expected entry into service later this year. LEAP, the narrow-body engine of choice, offers 15% better fuel efficiency than the CFM56 and will deliver mature levels of time on wing later this year.\nIn regionals, Embraer and GE Aerospace extended our agreement for new CF34 engine deliveries through the end of this decade. This agreement strengthens our partnership as the sole source engine on the E175 and supports the continued growth of regional jets.\nKeeping an eye towards the future this week at the show, we've shared a number of updates about the CFM RISE program. RISE is the suite of pioneering technologies including Open Fan, compact core, hybrid electric systems, and alternative fuels. We've continued to mature these technologies, moving from component level evaluations to more module level tests. For example, with our partner Safran, we've demonstrated the aerodynamic and acoustic performance of the Open Fan design with more than 200 hours of wind tunnel tests. Additionally, we've announced a new agreement with the US Department of Energy to expand supercomputing capabilities which will further advance Open Fan design. The Open Fan is the most promising engine technology to help the industry reduce emissions, designed to meet or exceed customer expectations for durability and deliver a step change in fuel efficiency.\nTurning to some of the key takeaways on our second quarter performance, our team delivered double digit growth across orders, operating profit, and free cash flow, while revenue was impacted by lower output. With Flight Deck, we're well positioned to accelerate actions to deliver on our priorities for today, tomorrow, and in the future.\nIn commercial engines and services, we're CES. Air traffic trends remained positive, supporting our services growth and overall profit, which was up more than 20%. Profit growth was driven by 14% internal shop visits growth and improved pricing. In defense and propulsion technologies, DPT, we delivered very strong profit growth, up more than 70% year over year. Services growth in defense and systems and profit improvement in propulsion and additive technologies drove this increase. Overall, a very solid quarter and first half, and my thanks go out to the entire global GE Aerospace team.\nDay in, day out, we're focused on delivering for both our airline and airframer customers who simply want and need more of our products and services. While we've made progress in services this quarter, our new engine output was disappointing, down 20% sequentially. It's a clear challenge that we're facing head on, accelerating the use of Flight Deck in partnership with our suppliers as we work to solve the ongoing supply chain constraints. Last quarter, we shared that the common denominator impacting growth across both services and new engines is constrained material supply. With 80% of material input shortages tied to nine suppliers across 15 supplier sites, this remains our focus today. We have deployed more than 550 of our engineering and supply chain resources into the supply base to use Flight Deck to work hand in hand with our suppliers to identify and resolve constraints.\nWe've made significant improvements in many areas. At more than 2/3 of these sites, material flow more than doubled sequentially and is currently no longer constraining deliveries. We're grateful for their collaboration, but there's still more to do in the second half, and we've sharpened our focus on a subset of the remaining priority sites that are still constraining our output. We're making some progress, but not enough to meet demand. I've personally visited several of these sites, and I'm confident we can partner with our suppliers to drive faster progress. For example, earlier this month we partnered with one of the priority suppliers in a joint Kaizen focused on addressing a key constraint. Our supply chain and engineering teams jointly leverage Flight Deck to identify action plans to improve throughput significantly aligned with our needs for second half deliveries.\nThese actions resulted in a double-digit material input growth here so far in July versus the Q2 average, so a promising start. Overall, we're not yet at a desired state, but we're counting on these joint action plans and continuous improvement to achieve our H2 ramp. So far in July relative to April, we've seen overall higher engine output stability and reduced variability. We're also deploying Flight Deck aggressively in our own operations to improve safety, quality, delivery, and cost. And in that order, we've made solid progress in support of our airline customers. For example, our internal shop visit output improved 15% sequentially, and nowhere has this improvement been more visible than with LEAP. We've continued to decrease our turnaround time for LEAP shop visits to 86 days compared to roughly 100 days in 2023. This yielded a 9% increase in LEAP internal shop visits sequentially.\nWe're also investing both organically and inorganically to meet the expected growth in shop visits as the LEAP fleet doubles by 2030, as we announced last week. Over the next five years, we're planning to invest $1 billion in our MRO facilities around the world to increase capacity and introduce new technologies to further reduce turnaround time and costs. This includes a recent agreement to acquire a dedicated LEAP test cell, unlocking a key constraint in our shop visit output.\nOverall, I am encouraged by our progress, but by no means satisfied. I'm confident that in the second half we'll increase engine delivery significantly and continue to grow shop visits in support of our customers.\nIn the quarter, while output weighed on revenue, GE Aerospace delivered significant profit and free cash flow growth. Demand remained strong with orders up 18%. Revenue was up with growth in both segments. Services growth combined with price more than offset the lower engine shipments. Our operating profit was $1.9 billion, up 37% year over year from services growth, price, and favorable mix. Operating margins expanded 560 basis points to 23.1%. Both operating profit and margin were up significantly at CES and DPT.\nAdjusted EPS was $1.20, up more than 60% year over year. This improvement was driven by increased operating profit combined with a lower tax rate. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion, up nearly 20% driven by higher earnings, which more than offset inventory growth from the supply chain constraints I mentioned a moment ago. Halfway through the year, we're well positioned with earnings and free cash flow both up significantly year over year, and free cash flow conversion of nearly 120% giving us confidence to raise our full year profit and cash guidance. This continued profit and free cash flow growth, combined with returning approximately $25 billion of available cash to shareholders, will continue to compound returns. Now over to Rahul for the details on our segment results and our guidance.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nThank you, Larry, and good day, everyone. Starting with CES, air traffic growth remained robust with departures up 9% year to date, and we continue to expect to be up high single digits for the full year. Passenger departures are expected to be up high single digits as narrowbody remains solid with LEAP up nearly 30% in the second quarter, more than 3x that of overall narrowbody market. Dedicated freight departures are now expected to be up mid single digits versus a prior expectation of low single digits.\nMoving to CES's second quarter results, sustained commercial momentum drove significant orders growth up 38% this quarter. Both services and equipment were up more than 35%, with strong spare parts demand. Revenue grew 7% with services volume and price more than offsetting lower engine deliveries.\nServices grew 14% from mid-teens internal shop visit growth, with strength in time and material visits and improved pricing, as expected year on year. Shop visits grew more than spare parts. Equipment revenue declined 11% from 26% lower engine shipments. This was partially offset by customer mix and price. Supply chain constraints impacted shipments across both narrowbody and widebody, with LEAP down 29%. Profit was $1.7 billion, up 21%, with margins expanding 320 basis points, driven by improved performance in services from higher volume, pricing, and mix. Lower engine shipments and improving LEAP services profitability also supported profit and margin expansion. This more than offset the impact of lower spare engine deliveries and increased investments that impacted equipment profit.\nTaking a step back at CES, we delivered a strong first half with services revenue up 13% and overall segment profit up nearly 20%. Turning to DPT, the sector remains resilient with US defense spending expected to grow low single digits, and international up mid single digits. With Flight Deck, we are focused on running this business better to deliver more predictably while continuing to invest in the future of combat. We recently achieved a significant milestone delivering two T901 engines for the US Army's Improved Turbine Engine Program or ITEP for integration and testing on the UH-60 Black Hawk. The T901 engine will ensure that warfighters have the performance, power, and reliability necessary to maintain significant advantage on the battlefield for decades to come. Turning to our results, orders were down 25% primarily due to timing of orders in defense and systems.\nDefense book-to-bill was 0.9 in the quarter and 1.0 for the first half. Revenue grew 1%. Defense and Systems revenue was down 6%. Engine deliveries were down approximately 60% from supply chain challenges and a tough year-over-year compare when we delivered significantly higher units. This more than offset pricing and services growth.\nPropulsion and additive technologies grew 16% with growth across several businesses from higher output and improved pricing. Profit was $344 million, up more than 70% year over year with margins expanding 580 basis points from higher output, favorable product mix, productivity, price, and the absence of program related costs.\nThrough the first half of the year, DPT delivered high single digit revenue growth and significant operating profit improvement. The business remains well positioned to deliver growth over the medium term with a backlog of nearly $17 billion. Spending a moment on corporate adjusted cost and intercompany eliminations, were roughly $130 million, down nearly 40% year over year. This $80 million improvement is from actions taken to streamline our cost structure, accelerate elimination of wind down costs, and favorable interest income that more than offset higher intercompany eliminations. As part of our continued efforts to simplify and focus on our core, this quarter we completed the sale of Electric Insurance.\nWe also reached an agreement to sell the licensing business and a reinsurance agreement to exit a block of our life and health insurance business. Combined, these actions will result in proceeds of roughly $700 million of investing cash flow.\nLooking ahead. Given the strong results and the momentum in our business, we are raising our profit and cash guidance. We are reducing our revenue guidance given lower engine output expectations.\nGrowth is now projected to be up high single digits due to lower equipment revenue in CES. We now expect CES equipment revenue to be up high single to low double digits from prior guidance of up high teens. This includes our updated full year LEAP output expectations of flat to up 5% year over year. We continue to expect CES services to grow mid teens putting overall growth of CES at low double digits to mid teens.\nConsistent with prior guidance, we expect DPT growth of mid- to high-single-digits. Operating profit is now expected to be in a range of $6.5 to 6.8 billion, up $250 million at the midpoint from prior guidance with margin expansion year over year. This improvement is primarily from CES with operating profit now expected to be $6.3 to 6.5 billion from $6.1 to 6.4 billion previously, reflecting improved services performance and impact of lower equipment sales.\nDPT profit guidance is unchanged, and corporate cost and intercompany eliminations are now expected to be below $900 million from approximately $1 billion previously. Our expectations for interest expense and tax rate are unchanged, and we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance range to $3.95 to $4.20, up more than 50% year over year at the midpoint from higher profit growth. We are also raising our free cash flow guidance to $5.3 to $5.6 billion with above 100% conversion of net income given profit growth. While we still expect to reduce working capital for the year, the improvement is expected to be lower given the impact of supply chain challenges to inventory. Overall free cash flow is up approximately $700 million year over year. At the midpoint. All in, GE Aerospace is positioned for significant revenue, profit, and free cash flow growth with strong conversion in 2024.\nLarry, back to you.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nRahul, thanks. As we take flight as GE Aerospace, we have sustained competitive advantages with a tremendous value proposition with the industry's largest and growing fleets. Our platforms are preferred by customers across the narrowbody, widebody, and defense sectors. We're aiming to provide industry-leading reliability and durability prioritizing SQDC in that order. This means delivering unmatched time on wing and faster turnaround times for our customers. With our deep domain expertise and engineering talent, commitment to innovation and capacity to invest, we're poised to deliver breakthrough technologies in both commercial and defense. With Flight Deck as our foundation, we'll deliver for customers and create exceptional value for shareholders. All in, we expect to grow operating profit to approximately $10 billion in 2028 and generate free cash flow in excess of net income, creating compounding returns.\nWe're making meaningful progress to advance our strategic priorities in service of our customers, employees, and shareholders while keeping an eye toward the future and paving the way with innovation for more sustainable flight.\nNow, Blaire, let's go to questions.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nBefore we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Liz, can you please open the line?\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone. If you wish to withdraw your question or your question has already been answered, please press star 11. Again.\nOur first question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood afternoon. Morning, Rob.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nHey Rob.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nI don't know who wants to take.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nThis one, but I wanted to ask you, just given the slower ramp on the narrowbody programs as well as the durability issues on the geared turbofan, we've seen airlines extending the lives of older aircraft and engines. Are we getting to the point where some of your CFM56 customers are talking about increasing the work scope of their third shop visits, or maybe even doing a fourth shop visit?\nWell, Rob, I think that you really put your finger on one of the important underlying dynamics here, not only in the quarter, but as we think about the second half and even the next few years. The CFM56 is clearly still the workhorse of the industry. I mean, if we look at utilization at a time when people thought we might begin to see a little bit of a fade, utilization year over year is consistent with the CFM56. Delighted to see the LEAP up 4 points from a share perspective. So overall GE narrow body powered propulsion is probably north of 70%. So I think the CFM is going to have a longer life in many fleets, and clearly that's going to help us in the aftermarket, both from a volume, and from a scope perspective.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah, Rob, just to maybe add a little bit to what Larry said, just given the dynamics that he mentioned and you mentioned earlier, we are expecting that the peak shop visit that we had previously projected in 2025 and then we start to see the sequential downtick in 2026, 2027 is what we said at Investor Day. Now as we sit here today, we do expect that, you know, shop visits is probably plateau at that 2025 level for maybe another couple of years and then start declining. So definitely we are seeing that.\nThe program, the platform is getting used, and the shop visits will be higher for an extended period of time, and we will see third shop visits, and that we're seeing that even with, you know, some of the lessors coming out and commenting that they've, you know, the leases are getting extended beyond 14, 15 years for another four or five years. So we will definitely see what you just said.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning. Apologies for the background noise. I'm actually here at the show. I was hoping, Larry or Rahul, you could comment on the 15 supplier sites and nine suppliers seem to be the source of the bulk of the delays in parts and where that was last year, and maybe just if you can bucket the types of products we're talking about at those 15 sites. Thanks, Myles. We could hear you loud and clear. We're not too far away, I suspect. I think if you go back to April, what we said was 3/4 of the challenge with respect to deliveries was really rooted in these 15 supplier sites, again with nine different companies. Rather than finger point, our mindset was we're going to problem solve. We've gone in deeply again with Flight Deck to really try to understand these constraints at the core.\nThe slide that you see in the deck I think is evidence that that approach, that collaborative problem solving rather than finger pointing, is really yielding results. We didn't expect that we would see blanket impact immediately, but to be able to point to 2/3 of those sites showing strong, nearly doubling of their sequential output inputs to us, I think really tells us something, right, that this approach is going to have impact. Unfortunately, we didn't have all of the impact that we would have liked across those 15. We need everybody's oar in the water, if you will. We need everybody contributing, particularly with respect to new engine deliveries.\nBut I think, given what we have seen here in July, the way that we're working across different commodity classes shows us that this approach is a better way to get more, not only here in Q3 or H2, but as we think about what is a multi-year rep.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nRight.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nThe airframers that we talk to here at Farnborough, certainly in the airlines as well, no one loves the fact that a new narrow body order may not be delivered until 29 or 30. So it's all about the ramp. We've got years in front of us, thankfully. What a wonderful business challenge to have. But I really like the way our suppliers have met us here, embraced the tools, and we just need more time working in this fashion in order to have the full effect that we, our airframer, and our airline customers all desire.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nHi, good morning. Mary and Rahul, how are you?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood, thank you.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nSheila, maybe if I could ask about the CES margins, which were pretty awesome. So just looking at the LEAP deliveries in the quarter, Q1 versus Q2, Q2 had 70 less LEAP deliveries in the quarter, so about a $10 million profit swing depending upon your loss assumption there. So CES margins of 27% in Q2 versus Q3 versus Q1 of 23 implies that the core service margin improved about 1,000 to 1,500 basis points, depending on what you want to choose. So 25% to 35% plus. So what drove that? Despite shop visits being better than. And how do we think about the second half progression?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah. Now, Sheila, it was a good quarter for CES overall. You know, OE volume was weak, as you pointed out, but the service revenue recovered really nicely. And, you know, the overall services growth was kind of in line with what we had projected for full year. So it kind of came in exactly what we were thinking. And the drop through from services was very strong. The shop visits skewed towards time and material work, and then the work scopes were heavier as well. And that helped both revenue and the.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nProfit on those shop visits.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nThis, along with pricing and customer mix, helped the services profit growth. In equipment, the engine shipments were lower. But within equipment, we also reduced our spare engine deliveries and higher investments. So, and that kind of offset the impact of the lower engine shipments. So overall OE profit was more flattish than anything else. Now, as we look at the trends in first half, that gave us the confidence here to raise profit expectations for the full year by, call it, $150 to 200 million at the midpoint of the guide.\nNow, what's driving that are two things. One, the services growth that we just mentioned, all the things that we are seeing, we projected that favorability to now flow through into the second half as well, both with work scopes and some of the customer mix being favorable. And then we lowered our OE revenue output, but call it $600, $650 million at the midpoint of the guide. And that is helping profit. So that is where you see our CES profit up for the year, $150 to 200 million. And the margins for CES will be kind of at this level, will be flattish for the year. And that is despite this being the first year of 9X shipments. So really, really happy with the way the CES business is coming along.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks. Good morning. Good afternoon.\nMorning, David.\nLarry, can you just maybe dig into this? You know the lower LEAP shipments in the quarter. I know you're talking about things progressing with these nine suppliers, but at the same time, obviously deliveries were way down the core. I would imagine they were 100, 125 short of kind of your internal expectations. So can you kind of just square that things are getting better. But deliveries were a lot lower than expected. Thanks.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nDavid, I don't want to repeat what I said earlier. I do think one of the things to keep in mind is that there is a timing dynamic relative to when we receive various inputs and when in turn we convert that into an engine that we can deliver.\nVia to Airbus or to Boeing. Right. So April was challenging in a number of ways. We didn't have the recovery in May that I think we had hoped we might see. Underlying the quarter, though sequentially, was the net improvement that I mentioned, and that has only continued to build here in July. We haven't seen that somewhat typically slow start to a quarter that I was concerned about. So there's really nothing more I can say about why the new unit deliveries, LEAP included, were disappointing.\nIt is what it is. Where we're focused, as we think about the rest of the year, is how do we deliver more and how do we deliver more reliably. You'll note that we are adjusting our outlook for LEAP deliveries this year on a full year basis. We now think we will be somewhere between flat and up 5%, obviously lower than where we thought, but still showing modest growth. And more importantly, I think given what we're doing with Flight Deck in the supply base, the expectations we have not only for more inputs but in turn more outputs positions us to be at a healthier, more stable, higher exit rate come the end of the year. That's where we're focused. That's what we're sharing with our customers. Work to do. Work I think this team knows how to do.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks very much and good morning. Morning Seth.\nI wondered just to kind of follow up on that last question and thinking about the progression on the delivery side. I think you know, need a pretty significant increase off of the Q2 equipment revenue level to get to the guide for the year. You know, is there, is it going to be possible to make much progress in Q3? Should we expect much more significant progress in Q4, and any other color that could you can provide about the sequential dynamics across the company.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nSeth, let me start by just kind of maybe talking a little bit about how we think the back half will shape up. And Larry, you can add if there's anything more on the, on the delivery side. You know, listen, overall as you look at our H1 to H2 growth, H1, you know, we've delivered about 9% growth and it's kind of in line with what we are projecting for the full year. So our year over year growth is going to look similar between H1 and H2. The year over year growth will be higher in Q4 as both services and OE ramp.\nSo we'll see that now in terms of profit and drop through the margins will be higher in Q3 versus Q4, since the 9X shipment impact is going to be primarily in the fourth quarter, and corporate expenses will be higher in the fourth quarter as well. So we expect the third quarter margins to be kind of flattish.\nYear over year since we had a strong Q3 last year. So now if you took a look at, you know, kind of getting to how Q3 looks operationally, we've had a better start to Q3. I think Larry mentioned that in his prepared remarks. The number of engines we've shipped here in the third quarter in the first month of the third quarter in July are significantly higher than what we delivered in the first three weeks in April. So we are seeing sequential progress, and then if you look at the material input and as we compare the material input through the first three weeks in July versus the first three weeks in April, even for these suppliers that have been constraining output in the second quarter, we've seen a significant improvement. So that's going to allow us to drive the sequential improvement here in the third quarter.\nI think we are off to a good start. More work to do here for sure. You know, July has been encouraging. Anything to add?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGot it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nHey, good morning. Thank you guys. Good morning. Good results.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks, Gautam. Thank you.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nI was curious, just to follow.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nCulp, could you talk a little bit?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nAbout how much inventory you're actually absorbing incrementally in the guidance, and maybe if you can speak to what your strategy is with the supply chain, given some folks are constrained, but some folks are probably ahead given the lower LEAP projection relative to the start of the year. Are you in the process of slowing down some folks?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nIf you could just talk about that?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nInventory dynamics and what you're absorbing incrementally and any color you can provide. Thanks. Well, maybe we'll just take those in reverse order and I'll start. I think that.\nWe really aren't trying to slow down in a meaningful way. We're really trying. The way I think about it is we're trying to make sure that we're calibrated with respect to what we need from everybody. Because as you point out, different folks are in different places. As we think about the back half, as we think about 2025, as we think about 2026. I think part of why this has been so challenging, and maybe even head-scratchingly so for some, is that the industry was dialed down to almost zero in the pandemic.\nWhat we don't want to do, and the reason we do carry probably more inventory today will at year end than we would like to, is we don't want to turn down the folks that are performing well unduly as we calibrate the ramp rates with those that will in all likelihood pace us. So we've taken a view that in some instances.\nThe inventory is in effect an investment with the supply base for ourselves to make sure that we've got a more predictable ramp. Remember, a lot of lean is rooted in flow and flow really is around availability. To the extent that we've got some folks that are performing, we don't want to, if you will, penalize them as we think about all that we're going to need from them, not only over the next six months, but frankly over the coming years.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nGautam, you'll see that in our queue. I think you're spot on. We've seen significant inventory growth here in the first half of the year, close to $1.2 billion of inventory growth, which is, call it, $500 million higher than what we grew in the first half of last year. So significant headwind here. Now, with the improvement in output that we are projecting here for the second half of the year, we do think that while inventory will grow in the second half of the year, obviously the pace of growth will slow down significantly here, and then it won't be as much of a headwind as it was last year in the second half of the year. So it has been a challenge. But again, as Larry said, that is something we've been trying to manage and manage it as appropriately as we can.\nBut the good news is despite the buildup of inventory growth in the first half of the year, we still had 120% conversion. So strong cash growth, cash was up about $1 billion year over year in the first half. So we kind of absorbed it, we managed it and.\nTry to do better in the second half.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nHey, good afternoon. Good afternoon.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nHey Scott.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nHey Larry. Not to beat a dead horse, but just following up on Myles' earlier question, I was wondering if you could offer some more detail on those, I guess six or so, remaining supplier sites that are the key bottlenecks at this point. Basically, you know, trying to understand if we're down to the investment castings and forging suppliers at this point or if it's a broader set of bottlenecks. And I appreciate not wanting to point any fingers, but just trying to get a sense for whether there's something in common undergirding this remaining set of suppliers. Thanks.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGod, I think you've heard me pretty clearly. I appreciate that. No, I think the common denominator is frankly we all need to do better, and we need to be more collaborative and fully in problem solving mode. That's the headset that we have at GE Aerospace. I'm convinced while that takes different forms at different suppliers, that is where every one of those nine suppliers across those 15 sites are. Some made more progress than others. But it's a long race, right? This was not a 90 day sprint. This is a marathon. And regardless of where folks are, from a commodity category perspective, from a geography perspective, publicly held, privately held, it just doesn't matter. Right.\nWe've got to get the teams in, we've got to go deep, we've got to get into the granular operational detail to solve those problems, unlock those constraints, increase capacity, raise yields, much as I think we have been doing. Picked up the pace a bit here, I think, in the second quarter and just need to do a lot more of that broadly in the second half.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks so much. Good afternoon.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood afternoon, Robert.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nJust following on from your earlier comments, Larry, and your confidence in GE's ability to deliver new engines in the second half, what's your confidence in the relative forecasts of the airframers and also their broader supply chain also catching up and delivering the parts?\nWell, I think we'll leave to our customers commentary on everything they're managing. We're focused on what we can manage. Right. I think that the updated guide here, the color around LEAP specifically, is certainly that of high confidence. It wouldn't come out of our mouths. It wouldn't be in our prepared remarks otherwise. But again, work to do, work I think we're encouraged by with respect to the second quarter impact, the start to July as well. But we've got a lot of work in front of us. We've got many days to do that work. That's where this team is focused completely, I can assure you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. Good morning, Noah.\nYou show on slide 17 that the.\nCES services orders are growing much faster than revenue and the absolute dollar levels are much higher.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nI guess.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nYou know, eventually overall aftermarket has to normalize.\nAs we fully recover. Air travel growth.\nWhat's behind that? How much of that is the LEAP and.\nDoes that suggest that CES services growth can actually accelerate next year versus this year?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nNoah, you're right. I mean, we had a good second quarter on orders. We had a good first half. I mean, services orders were kind of, as you said, mid-30s for the second quarter, up 30% or so for the first half. Strong book to build here.\nIn the first half of the year on top of a good book-to-bill we saw in 2023. So the momentum is definitely there on the services side. And as you look at the back half of the year, we are expecting the services growth to be a little bit higher in the second half than in the first half, both on the shop visits and on spare parts on a year-over-year basis. So you know, we delivered 9% internal shop visit growth in the first half of the year. And if you look at our low to mid teens guidance on shop visits, that would imply that shop visits will be closer to, you know, high teens in the second half of the year on a year-over-year basis. So that's what we are projecting.\nBut you know, overall, listen, mid-teens services growth, and that is consistent with what we think, you know, the future years will look like. I think that's what we had when we look at our 2025-2020 outlook, you know, we were projecting continued strong services growth. So it's good to see the strong orders growth, good to see, as Larry said earlier, you know, LEAP gaining share on the overall air traffic departure side as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Gavin Parsons with UBS.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning. Good morning.\nI mean, I guess, to Rob's question earlier on, extending life of older engines, clearly strong demand for both growth and new aircraft. But there's been a couple airline profit warnings over the last week or two. So I just wanted to ask if you've had any early indications from your discussions with customers whether it be relating to fleet planning, sensitivity to pricing, or any other changes. Thanks Gavin. As you would imagine.\nWe follow all of that pretty closely. Both, well, in the US here in Europe, globally.\nWe really have not seen any effect on our business. And Rahul's comments a moment ago.\nWe'll remain watchful but don't anticipate that. Again, I think to the, to the earlier question with services orders up 36% in CES in the Q2, that's the way our customers are speaking to us. I look at where we are here in the Q3 just in terms of how much of the spares activity we have in backlog. I think it's.\nIn the 90% range at this point. So well positioned very early here in the quarter. Again I would just also point to the utilization that we see on the CFM56, still strong, no real change.\nThis year, and the uptake, the upshot of the LEAP taking four points of market share. So GE-powered narrow-body activity remains strong. Just take the comments that were out here in Europe yesterday; it seemed to be more pricing-oriented than anything else. So we'll keep a weather eye out. But right now, our challenge, our struggle is to keep up with this exceptionally strong demand both in the aftermarket and again with newmake.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, everybody.\nMorning, Jason.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nLarry, I was wondering if you could?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nJust spend a few more minutes on the RISE and maybe provide an update on some development milestones there and how the customer conversations are going at this point. You mentioned that you're showcasing the engine there at Farnborough. I'm just curious what.\nYou think customer acceptance is shaping up to look like at this point.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nJason.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nI would say that customer interest seems to only build with the passage of time. This is now the third air show in a row that I've attended with the RISE engine, the Open Fan engine, front and center here. Obviously, when we talk about RISE, we're really talking about an umbrella of different technology programs. Not only the Open Fan, but also our compact core work, our hybrid electric activity, and everything we're doing on SAF. But with respect to Open Fan, I think what we've been sharing with people is that we had a very good first ingestion test with the Open Fan blade. In Q1, we are starting our second endurance campaign.\nOur test with the high pressure turbine airfoils, and there's been a lot of work with respect to the hybrid electric elements of that architecture. Work that, as you may know, we do with NASA. I mentioned, I think, earlier the wind tunnel testing that we've done here in Europe in conjunction with Airbus.\nThere are, I think, over 200. I think maybe it's 250.\nComponent level tests, module level tests that we have behind us. This is still a technology development effort, make no mistake about it.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nRight.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nWe've got a long way to go. But what's interesting, particularly here in Europe, virtually every airline CEO that I talk to starts the conversation with sustainability and very keen to get our views on SAF compatibility, but also ahead of SAF capacity being available at scale, what are we going to do to enable the next generation of narrowbodies? And we go hard and fast to RISE, talk about the progress that we're making with Open Fan. And I think that is a story that continues to build enthusiasm and support because we know that the ultimate target, that 20% step up in propulsive efficiency in emissions reduction really is the future of flight.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nWe have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThis question will come from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nHi, good morning guys. Thanks for the question. Morning, Matt. Good morning. Matt, I wanted to ask what are.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nKind of your latest thoughts on LEAP?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nKind of break-even timing just given volumes are running a little bit lower than we thought, and sounds like you're deploying a lot of resources to work through some of these supplier issues. Just curious if that timing has shifted at all.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSVP and CFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah, Matt, timing has not shifted. So we expected LEAP to be profitable here in 2024 and the program to be break even in 2025. And LEAP Services, in fact, shaping up a little bit better than what we originally thought as we started the year. And we mentioned that in our prepared remarks. So, you know, that's how the overall program is shaping up. You know, we're making the progress on durability that we were expecting, you know, the LEAP tracking better than CFM56 at this stage of the lifecycle. We are expecting LEAP performance to be in line with CFM56 performance on the A320s by the end of the year. So that is obviously a huge milestone given all the improvements we've been driving.\nYou know, the HPT blade was the last thing that was in, and we expect that to happen here in Q4. We've completed more than 3,500 tests on that. 3,500 hours of testing on that. So that's going really well. So all in, I think LEAP's progressing exactly the way we would have liked. Services dragging a little bit better. Program should break even next year.\n\nBlaire Shoor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nLarry, any final comments?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nBlaire, thank you. I think just to close, the GE Aerospace team is going to stay grounded in our responsibility that we share to live the purpose to invent the future of flight, to lift people up and bring them home safely. So we really appreciate your time today, and of course, your interest in GE Aerospace.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Liz, and I will be your conference coordinator today. If you experience issues with the webcast slides refreshing or there appears to be delays in the slide advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winiger, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\n\nSteve Winiger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks, Liz. Welcome to GE Aerospace's Q1 2024 Earnings Call. I'm joined by Chairman and CEO Larry Culp and CFO Rahul Ghai. Many of the statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filing and website, those elements may change as the world changes. With the spinoff of GE Vernova successfully completed earlier this month, GE Vernova will report its results separately on 25 April 2024. While included in our consolidated Q1 results, we're focusing on today's commentary and Q&A primarily on GE Aerospace. Now, over to Larry.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nSteve, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first earnings call as GE Aerospace, now a pure-play global leader in propulsion, services, and systems. We're wholly focused on our aerospace and defense customers, serving the 900,000 passengers in the air right now with our technology under wing. It's an incredible responsibility for our teams globally and why we take safety and quality so seriously.\nWe'll come back to GE Aerospace in a moment, but before we do, we'll talk about GE on a consolidated basis, which is how we operated for the first few months of this year. Just three weeks ago, on 2 April 2024, we completed GE Vernova's spin and launched GE Aerospace, ringing the bell at the New York Stock Exchange after the successful spin of GE HealthCare last year. It was a proud moment that we celebrated with our teams around the world.\nThis marked a new beginning following the completion of GE's multi-year transformation that strengthened our businesses both financially and operationally. Thanks to the GE team, we significantly improved our financial position, reducing debt by more than $100 billion since 2018, and enhanced our operational execution by embracing lean with a relentless focus on safety, quality, delivery, and cost in that order to better serve our customers.\nTogether, we built a strong foundation for our three independent companies that to date have increased shareholder value nearly fivefold. Now, GE begins again. Three industry leaders fit for purpose for the next century plus and ready to put their stamps on the world.\nGE HealthCare, GE Vernova, and GE Aerospace each carry forward GE's innovative spirit, customer focus, and passion to build a world that works, fully focused on their respective missions to lead precision health, the energy transition, and the future of flight. None of this would have been possible without the important work of our teams. I want to express again my sincere gratitude to our incredible people whose unmatched passion and talent have made this achievement possible.\nThank you. We turn to slide four. We had an exceptionally strong last quarter as GE. In the Q1, orders were up substantially in both GE Aerospace and Power. Revenue was up 10% organically, with all segments contributing to the growth. Equipment and services were up across both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova.\nAdjusted operating profit was $1.5 billion, up more than $600 million, with 300 basis points of organic margin expansion. This was largely driven by pricing and volume, which more than offset investments and inflation. Adjusted EPS was $0.82 up more than three times year-over-year. And free cash flow was $850 million, up more than five times, or $700 million, driven by higher earnings and a continued reduction in working capital. In all, a very strong performance for GE, reflecting real momentum at both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova.\nAnd now, the day has come where we bring our full focus to GE Aerospace. Our commercial propulsion fleet is the industry's largest and youngest, thanks to our world-class engineering and services teams. And in defense, we're proud to be the rotorcraft and combat engine provider of choice, powering 2/3 of these aircraft worldwide.\nA massive part of our business is in aftermarket services, representing 70% of our $32 billion in revenue. Importantly, as we meet higher levels of demand today, services enable us to better understand how our technologies are performing, and we use that intelligence to help shape our future product roadmaps. Turning to our performance, GE Aerospace had a solid start to the year.\nIn Q1, we delivered double-digit revenue and profit growth, as well as margin expansion in both businesses, with free cash flow doubling year-over-year. Overall, we have great confidence in our forward trajectory. We're raising our full-year operating profit guidance and see a path to our $10 billion operating profit target by 2028. Turning to slide six.\nAs you heard from us last month at our Investor Day, we're keeping our strategy simple, focused on today, tomorrow, and the future, with safety and quality first. Enter FLIGHT DECK, our proprietary lean operating model to ensure focused execution as a public company. Fundamentally, it's a systematic approach to running our businesses to deliver exceptional value as measured through the eyes of our customers.\nAnd it's the best way we know to operationalize flight safety at GE Aerospace in combination with our Safety and Quality Management Systems. Starting with today, we're focused on service and readiness, keeping our customers' fleets flying. We're experiencing a tremendous demand cycle for services as more people fly and fly more often. In the quarter, GE CFM departures were up low double digits, and we're revising our expectations upward for the year.\nThe onus is on us to meet this demand, and with FLIGHT DECK, we're maintaining the highest standards of safety and quality, with greater predictability and speed. Easy to say, hard to do. A key priority in our services business is improving turnaround times to increase our shop visit output. We're making progress with LEAP, a significant driver of shop visit growth this year.\nFor example, at our Malaysia site, a joint GE Aerospace and Safran team collaborated to reduce average LEAP test cell hours by 30% per engine, and they're working toward a 50% plus improvement by year-end. As a result, the team has closed 95% of a 100-engine gap in test capacity so far, while optimizing LEAP baseline test time, eliminating interruptions, and reducing network variation.\nActions like these are improving our shop turnaround time, which for LEAP was down to approximately 90 days this quarter, a 10% reduction versus our roughly 100-day average last year. While there's more work to do, we're focused on getting engines back in the hands of our customers faster without compromising safety or quality. For tomorrow, we remain focused on delivering on the ramp. This quarter, total engine deliveries improved up 9% year-over-year, including defense up over 50%.\nHowever, these deliveries were short of our objectives due largely to continued material availability challenges. Thus, we have intensified our efforts working with our suppliers to problem-solve these issues. Here is where FLIGHT DECK is key. Currently, we can track about 80% of our largest delivery challenges back to 15 supplier sites.\nWe're deploying more than 550 engineers and supply chain resources, up 25% from last year, working with them to improve quality and delivery performance. For example, we're problem-solving with one of our tier-one suppliers by going to Gemba at their most constrained supplier. We are shoulder to shoulder with them, leveraging FLIGHT DECK, and working together to identify and break constraints such as labor shortfalls, manufacturing yield issues, identifying alternate material types for raw material shortages, and improving flow and lead times.\nAs a result, that constrained supplier recently improved output by more than 25% and is no longer pacing deliveries. We also recently announced we're investing more than $650 million in both our manufacturing facilities and our supply chain this year, reflecting our commitment to strengthening quality and increasing production to better support our customers' long-term needs.\nAt the same time, both airlines and our defense customers are expanding and modernizing their fleets and choosing to do so with us, adding to our $150 billion-plus backlog and continuing to build our installed base of engines and services. At the Singapore Airshow, Thai Airways committed to powering its new widebody fleet of Boeing 787 aircraft with our GEnx-1B engines.\nThe GEnx is now a cornerstone of the airline's long-term plan to open new markets and meet surging demand while working to achieve its environmental goals. American Airlines secured 85 new Boeing 737 MAX jets, which will be powered by our LEAP-1B. And easyJet made a commitment for more than 300 LEAP-1A engines for its fleet of 157 A320neo aircraft.\nIn our defense and propulsion technologies business, we won a new order for F414 engines to power additional KF-21 fighter jets for the Korean Air Force, continuing to build our international business. For the future, we're advancing the technology building blocks that will define the future of flight with more than $2 billion of R&D spending this year. For example, we're continuing to make progress with testing in our CFM RISE program.\nWe completed our first fan ingestion test with our full-scale RISE fan blade, and the results were extremely encouraging. On the defense side, in partnership with Sikorsky Innovations, our team is finalizing designs for a hybrid electric power systems test bed with a 600kW electric motor. This will support Sikorsky's plan to build, test, and fly a hybrid electric vertical takeoff and landing demonstrator with a tilt wing configuration.\nAltogether, we're running GE Aerospace with customer expectations front and center while delivering breakthrough innovation that will further shape the future of flight. And FLIGHT DECK ensures we work as one team, utilizing one operating model, implement one strategy, and ultimately yielding one culture. This will help us to lead the industry forward and advance our vision to be the company that defines flight for today, tomorrow, and the future. Now, let me hand it over to Rahul.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nThank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Glad you can fully share your enthusiasm as we embark on the next chapter of our journey as a standalone company. We will cover GE Aerospace's results on a standalone basis, the same as a full-year guide. Also, for simplification, our results will be prepared on a reported basis, and we are limiting non-GAAP free cash flow adjustments to spin-related matters.\nOverall, GE Aerospace delivered a solid start to the year with all headline metrics up double digits. Demand remained resilient. Orders grew 34%, with similar growth rates in both commercial engines and services, or CES, and defense and propulsion technologies, or DPT. Revenue was up 15% from pricing, spare parts volume, and an increase in widebody and defense engine deliveries. Operating profit was $1.5 billion, up 24%, with margins up 140 basis points to 19.1%.\nThe profit growth was driven primarily by price, growth in services volume, and favorable mix. Profit and margins were up in both CES and DPT. Adjusted corporate cost and elimination, including prior GE corporate cost, were $130 million, down more than 20% year-over-year. Post the GE Vernova spin-off, we expect to incur roughly $300 million for the remaining wind-down of GE corporate office and close to $250 million to set up standalone infrastructure for GE Aerospace.\nWe will continue to adjust these items from earnings and cash. Free cash flow was $1.7 billion, doubling year-over-year with higher earnings and working capital improvements offsetting AD&A outflow. Specifically, working capital was a source largely from strong collections and progress payments, while inventory was a headwind. The strength of our operational and financial fundamentals gives us confidence to return 70% to 75% of our available cash to investors.\nEarlier this month, we initiated a quarterly dividend at $0.28, a 250% increase. At our Investor Day, we announced a $15 billion share buyback, a testament to the strength of our balance sheet. Through our new capital return framework, we are well-positioned to create significant shareholder value while we continue to invest in growth, innovation, and focused M&A. Now, turning to CES and DPT results. Starting with CES, a $24 billion business with 70% of revenue generated from services.\nAs Larry mentioned, demand continues to be robust. For the year, we now expect departures to grow high single digits. Total departures are off to a stronger start versus our prior expectation, growing 11% in the quarter, with particular strength in China. We continue to expect departure growth to moderate throughout the year. We expect passenger traffic growth in high single-digit range for the year, a slight improvement.\nNarrowbody remains solid with increased CFM56 fleet utilization and significant LEAP growth. Further, we now expect freight demand to be up low single digits versus our prior expectation of down mid-single digits. Heightened geopolitical conflicts have increased the need for air cargo and improved its relative economics. As a result, commercial momentum continues. CES orders were up 34% this quarter. Both services and equipment were up double digits, largely driven by strong demand for LEAP and spare parts across our platforms.\nOverall, customer dynamics remain positive, with strong order books from both airlines and airframers. On narrowbody platforms, we won more than 300 LEAP-1B engines and a multi-year services agreement from Akasa Air. On widebody platforms, recent key wins included 90 GEnx engines for Thai Airways, 16 GE9X engines for Ethiopian Airlines, and 10 GEnx engines for LATAM Group.\nThis improving demand backdrop underscores our confidence in our annual guide and longer-term outlook. Now, looking at CES's Q1 results, revenue grew 16%, with volume up low double digits and the remainder driven primarily by higher price. Services growth of 12% was driven by pricing and strong spare part volume, which grew faster than internal shop visits that were up 3%, impacted by material input challenges.\nEquipment growth of 31% was driven by pricing and deliveries, which were up 2%, with higher widebody engine mix. LEAP shipments were roughly flat year-over-year given the supply chain challenges. As expected, spare engine shipments were down slightly. Profit was $1.4 billion, up 17%, with margins expanding 10 basis points from pricing, spare part sales, and mix.\nThis more than offset higher inflation investments and a change in estimated profitability on long-term service agreements on a mature platform, which negatively impacted both services revenue and profit by roughly $200 million. At CES, we are pleased with a strong start to the year, delivering significant growth and profit improvement. Turning to DPT, which includes both defense and systems and propulsion and additive technologies. This is roughly a $9 billion business where services make up approximately 55% of the revenue.\nLooking at the sector broadly, national defense budgets are growing, with US spending expected to grow low single digits and international spending up mid-single digits. Our defense customers' ask of us is clear: support their readiness while delivering more and more predictably. Turning to our Q1 results, orders were up 34%, underscoring strong demand and the quality of our franchise, with defense book-to-bill of 1.1x.\nRevenue grew 18%. Defense units deliveries grew by 45 engines on an easier compare. This, combined with pricing and growth in classified programs, increased defense and systems revenue by 17%. Propulsion and additive technologies grew 19%, primarily from growth at Avio and Unison to support GEnx and LEAP. Profit was $250 million, up 26%, with margins expanding 80 basis points. Volume and pricing, net of inflation, more than offset investments and defense equipment mix.\nIn all, improved delivery and pricing drove strong revenue and profit growth this quarter. Given our solid start and constructive outlook for the rest of the year, we are raising our full-year profit and cash guidance as outlined on slide 11. We continue to project at least low double-digit revenue growth. In CES, we still expect revenue growth of mid to high teens.\nIn services, we continue to expect mid-teens revenue growth, with shop visit output growing faster than spare part sales. We are anticipating reduced LEAP output in the range of 10% to 15% growth, but continue to expect overall equipment revenue growth of high teens from improving widebody mix. In DPT, we continue to expect mid to high single-digit revenue growth, primarily driven by equipment growth. Operating profit is now expected to be in a range of $6.2 to 6.6 billion, up from $6 to 6.5 billion previously.\nCES operating profit guidance is now expected to be in a range of $6.1 to 6.4 billion, up $100 million at the midpoint from favorable revenue dynamics. DPT profit guidance is unchanged. In corporate, we continue to expect cost and eliminations of about $1 billion, including $600 million of corporate expenses and roughly $400 million of eliminations.\nWe now expect margins to expand roughly 50 basis points for the year versus flat previously. Now, as a standalone company, we are initiating adjusted EPS in a range of $3.80 to $4.05, up more than 30% year-over-year. This includes Q1 adjusted EPS of approximately $0.92, up more than 40% year on year. On free cash flow, we expect higher profit to flow through to cash, delivering more than $5 billion, with conversion well above 100% of net income. Overall, we are encouraged by the strong start and the market environment that gives us confidence to raise our performance expectations for the year. Larry, back to you.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nRahul, thanks. We're clearly off to a solid start this year. If I close on slide 12, this captures the essence of GE Aerospace and what we take forward with us. We have an excellent franchise with sustained competitive advantages and a compelling value proposition. Our platforms are preferred by customers across narrowbody, widebody, and defense. Excuse me.\nWe're aiming to provide industry-leading reliability and durability, prioritizing safety and quality first, then delivery, finally cost. This means delivering unmatched time on wing and faster turnaround times for our customers. We're doing this across the industry's largest and growing fleets. With our deep domain expertise and talent, commitment to innovation, and capacity to invest, we're poised to deliver the breakthrough technologies of the future.\nAnd with FLIGHT DECK as our foundation to bring this all together, our team is poised to realize our full potential and deliver exceptional value for our customers and our shareholders. I've never been more confident in our path ahead as GE Aerospace. Before I pass it back to Steve for Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to recognize him and his many contributions to GE. As you know by now, today is Steve's last call with us after more than five years with the company, or put another way, after 22 earnings calls.\nHis dedication and partnership leading the investors' relations team and serving as a trusted strategic advisor to me and the rest of the leadership team here has been invaluable throughout our transformation. On behalf of myself and the entire team, Steve, we thank you and wish you the best of luck in your next chapter. I know Rahul would like to say a few words.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks, Larry. Steve, I want to personally thank you for your trusted advice and friendship as I joined the company and as we executed the launches of GE Aerospace and GE Vernova. Your strategic and operating depth and your collaborative style have been instrumental in our transformation. I know many on this call and on the calls in the year past are appreciative of your responsiveness to their questions and the work you have done to simplify our financial disclosures while communicating our transformation with clarity and candor. We wish you all the best, and I'll pass it back to you in the spirit of making you work till the last day for questions.\n\nSteve Winiger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nLarry, Rahul, thank you. I can't go on just yet without at least one quick comment. It's really been a true honor, privilege, and pleasure to serve with you and the rest of the teams at GE and GE Aerospace, a real masterclass for me. Thank you for always giving our investors and analysts a seat at the table. I'm deeply grateful, proud of the teams, and excited to see what comes next. I know the futures of GE Aerospace, GE HealthCare, and GE Vernova are bright indeed.\nNow, before we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts again and ask one question so we can get to as many people as possible. If we have extra time, we'll circle back around. We ask that you please save any GE Vernova questions until their earnings call later this week again. Liz, can you please open the line?\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone. If you wish to withdraw your question or your question has already been answered, please press star one one again. Our first question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. Congrats, Steve.\n\nSteve Winiger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nOne to Larry, Rahul, one to ask about the updated LEAP delivery guidance, now 10% to 15% down from 20% to 25%. Could you just dig into that a little bit? What drove that? Is that constraints on the supplier side? Is that Boeing taking down their schedule? What exactly went into that? Thanks.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah, I would say that that clearly is a change here in the update this morning. Dave and company are going to talk about their rates tomorrow, I'm sure, on their earnings call. So we'll lead that conversation with them. Rest assured, as we are with all of our customers, we're well calibrated and aligned with respect to what we need to do, what they need from us as we look forward. But I think all of us, particularly at this moment, before we talk about rates, always come back to make sure we're doing all that we can on the safety and quality fronts to ensure the best possible performance of our products, both as they're being manufactured and then, in turn, deployed in the field.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, yeah, good morning.\n\nSteve Winiger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nMorning, Ron.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nIf you could talk a little about the orders, I mean, they're up pretty spectacularly. Commercial Engines and Services are up 78%. Defense and Propulsion Technologies is up 72%. How much is that volume versus pricing?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nRon, I would say most of that is volume, and pricing helped across the board and showed up in our revenue growth, margin expansion, and in the orders outlook. But off a 34% increase in orders, I would say most of that is coming from base volume growth with price contributing as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThank you. Good morning, Larry and Rahul.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nAnd Steve.\n\nSteve Winiger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nCongratulations on elevating the investor relations team to the next level. So one for Larry or Rahul. With Q1 margins, you guys have done a really great job, 19%, 150 basis points above the prior guide. Sorry, the midpoint. Rahul, maybe if you could revisit the two points of margin headwind you pointed us to last quarter. You mentioned LEAP is lower on that unit volume, maybe about 40 basis poin ts of a tailwind versus your original guide. And then GE9X is probably consistent. So maybe if you could talk about the puts and takes along with the investment and timing to get us to that mid 17% range for the year.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nOkay. A couple of things in there, Sheila. So let me start with where you started, which was the two points of margin headwind that we had spoken to on the January call and on our Investor Day. So if you go back, we had expected two points of margin pressure from LEAP OE ramp, introduction of 9X, and the step-up in R&D to support LEAP durability, introduction of 9X, and develop the future of flight.\nNow, with the push out of LEAP volume, that headwind of the two points is marginally lower. But now, if you step back and look at our overall guide for the year, listen, strong start to the year. We are pleased with where we are. And that has given us confidence to raise guidance for the full year. And we expect the momentum to fully continue as we get into the Q2.\nOverall, for the first half, we are expecting about low double-digit revenue growth and about half of profit and free cash for the year. So, far more linear year than we've done in the past. Overall, as you step back and look at the full year, profit up $150 million at the midpoint of our guide to a range of $6.2 to 6.6 billion. Call it mid-teens profit growth and more than 30% EPS growth. So it'll be a good year if we deliver these numbers.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning and good luck, Steve. If I adjust CES for the $200 million long-term contract adjustment, the CES margins are up like 250 basis points year on year, despite this OE growth at 2x aftermarket growth. And I heard what you're saying a little on the spares exceeding shop visits. But is there anything else under the surface that really explains that kind of counterintuitive margin expansion?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nNo, listen, we had a good start in CES. $1 billion forward profit, margin expansion despite the CFM or the service profit adjustment that we had to make in the quarter. The big drivers here were pricing and customer mix, both on the equipment and on services. The mix shift in OE from LEAP to widebody mix helped. Also in services, our spare part volume growth was higher than shop visit growth.\nSo that mix shift in services was a contributor as well. Encouraging start. But as you go through the year, keep in mind that the equipment growth will ramp in the second half of the year. Equipment growth will also include 9X shipments. The services mix will skew back towards the shop visit growth, which we still expect to be maybe low- to mid-teens for the year.\nSo the second half profit growth on a year-over-year basis will be lower than the profit growth that we'll see in the first half. But overall, listen, good start in CES gives us confidence to raise the full year for CES in profit by about $100 million.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nThanks so much. Good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nJust following on from David's question on the LEAP, do these issues with ramping up the LEAP have positive implications for the CFM shop visit peak, which I think you've earlier estimated at 2025, and also the height of that peak potentially going forward?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nWell, I would say that we do see, I think, some knock-on positive effects in the aftermarket, both here in 2024, but also in some of our projections. I think it was just even last month at Investor Day, we talked about how retirements have been lower than we would have anticipated. Thus, that should yield 200 incremental shop visits in 2024 relative to what we anticipated.\nI think as long as capacity demand remains strong, I get a report every morning at 6:00AM. This morning showed our departures on a worldwide basis across all of our platforms up 7.8%. That's part of what Rahul alluded to in our prepared remarks with respect to our more optimistic outlook with respect to passenger demand. We know the airlines are looking to generate as much lift as they possibly can.\nAnd to the extent that they're paced by deliveries, retirements will slow, and that installed base will be worked. And fortunately, much of that came from our factories, and we're well positioned to support that. Does that push out the timing of perhaps peak CFM56? Yes, but it's early. And I don't think we're going to try today to pick a quarter in that timeframe as to when that might occur. But it's a positive dynamic forcing the aftermarket, both with existing platforms and increasingly with the LEAP.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. And congratulations, Steve. And thanks for all the help. Wanted to ask about shop visit growth and sort of any challenges around the guidance for the year and the level of visibility that you have, sort of starting off with 3% and needing to get to kind of at least a mid-teens type of number for the year. And that being constrained by various challenges in supply chain, and internal productivity, and kind of how much confidence you have around that ramp in shop visit growth.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nMorning, Seth. Clearly, if we're going to talk about a guide as we are this morning, there's a high level of conviction. But I think you've put your finger on what we are working on day in, day out here operationally. I think the financial numbers year-over-year are strong. But we know that we could have delivered. We could have executed on more shop visits in Q1 had we had more reliable, more predictable material flow into our shops.\nThat doesn't impact us as much in terms of spare parts. We don't need everything necessarily to move that product to customers, but we do in the case of a shop visit. Some of the FLIGHT DECK examples that I referenced, I think, give us real encouragement that the work we're doing with those top 5 or top 15 supplier sites is yielding progress.\nIf you look at what we've seen just here in April, we've had a stronger start to the Q2 in terms of shop visit activity, completed outputs than we did in January. That's one comparison that we focus on because we still are not as linear through the course of a quarter as we would like. And making good use of the first two, three, four weeks of a quarter is critical for us to be able to deliver the year-over-year let alone the sequential growth that we would like to see that's embedded here.\nAnd most importantly, what our customers need from us, given how active they're working these assets. So the supply chain topic is still relevant. I suspect we'll be talking about it again for the foreseeable future. But I'm very encouraged by the progress that we're making. We just need to make a whole lot more.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nUS Aerospace and Defense Analyst, RBC Capitals Markets\n\nHi, good morning, and congratulations, Steve.\n\nSteve Winiger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks, Ken.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nUS Aerospace and Defense Analyst, RBC Capitals Markets\n\nLarry or Rahul, you called out freight as a source of growth in the quarter. I think you raised your full-year outlook there from sort of previously down, maybe low single to now up low single as we think about the impact in CES. Is that just in relation to what we've seen in the Middle East? Are you seeing other fundamental changes that are giving more confidence there? How do we think about that impact specifically as we think about the CES business and where you're seeing that flow through?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nWell, Ken, you're spot on. We're taking that again, level set everybody, from an outlook that had us down mid-singles this year to now a positive low single-digit number. I think there is some influence here from what's happening in the Middle East. But I think we're just seeing a higher demand overall from an air cargo perspective. That will principally course through our widebody exposure more so than the single aisles. And I don't think we're going to quantify it here, but that's certainly part of what is behind the improved service outlook and thus the improved overall outlook for the rest of this year.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nKen, just to add to that, the direct impact all depends on the number of shop visits that kind of move into the year. I think that always takes time. So there's not a direct correlation here that may show up during the year. But overall, as we look over an extended period of time, as you look at 2024, 2025 combined, that will definitely be a positive driver. So we do expect the benefit from the higher freight departures to be in our financials. The question is probably not as much in 2024, more in 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nManaging Director and Government Services Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey, good morning. Congrats, Steve.\n\nSteve Winiger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks, Gautam.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning.\n\nGautam Khanna\n\nManaging Director and Government Services Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nSo you guys mentioned the lower LEAP production this year. I assume it's a function of lower 1B OE needs. But I was curious if you could just help us understand how we should think about the LEAP OE versus spares provisioning mix this year versus your prior expectations. And also wondering, given the lower rate on LEAP, are you going to be slowing down some of your LEAP suppliers? Or given the comments you made on the constraints within the supply chain, are you still pushing all these guys to continuously raise production, to work as hard as they can?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nWell, maybe we'll take those in reverse order. I'll speak to the supply chain, and Rahul can speak to where we are from a spares perspective. As I indicated, we're calibrated with both of our major narrowbody airframers. As we do that, we are always, in turn, calibrating with the supply base. And I think what we want to do in that work is make sure we're not overly indexed, if you will, on the next quarter or two.\nThough important, we want to make sure that we are preparing over the next several years to ramp, given the skylines that both of our major airframer customers enjoy today. A single aisle slot is a scarce commodity. If we were out looking for one today, we might not find it until the next decade.\nThat said, I think everybody, GE Aerospace included, is primarily focused on making sure from a safety and a quality perspective that we are in no way compromising as we think about the wonderful gift we have in the form of these robust supply lines. And that's been at the heart of the GE work, the lean transformation for years now. You hear us talk about SQDC, safety and quality, before delivery and cost. It's at the core of FLIGHT DECK and everything that we do. Rahul, spares?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nSo on the spare engines, Gautam, overall, our spare engine ratio came down slightly in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. We do expect the full-year spare engine ratio to be down as well versus 2023, kind of as we've communicated before. So really not a lot of change here from the change that we are making in the LEAP install engine output to translate into spare engine.\nSo we still expect the spare engine ratio to be down year-over-year. It'll keep coming down over the next couple of years, I would say, on a gradual basis, Gautam, just given where LEAP spare engine has been in the past. So we expect a continued decline here in the spare engine ratio over the next couple of years, gradually.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nMorning, Scott.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nMorning, Scott.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, Rahul. What does the 100% free cash flow conversion target for 2028 assume with respect to the proportion of new engines being sold on CSAs in that timeframe, particularly on LEAP? Mainly, I'm just curious if you're assuming LEAP mostly migrates to T&M by that time. Thanks.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nWe do expect, Scott, that as we go through the year, as we go through the decade, I should say, that there will be more T&M contracts. Keep in mind, as Russell spoke at Investor Day, our 2030 target for LEAP is we do about 60% or so of the shop visits between us and Safran, and 40% are done externally. And of that 60%, there will be a mix between CSAs and T&M.\nBut we are actively working to increase the T&M population. Our CBSA partners are standing up. They're helping us as well. So we would see a migration from CSAs to T&M contracts with about 60% of the shop visits done in-house here between Safran and GE Aerospace, and the remaining 40% being done by our channel partners.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.\n\nRobert Spingarn\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace, Defense and Space, Melius Research\n\nGood morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, Rob.\n\nRobert Spingarn\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace, Defense and Space, Melius Research\n\nCongrats to the team for this new chapter and getting through the spins. And congrats to you, Steve. I wanted to ask you, Larry, about RISE, just to change the topic a little bit. And the potential here to deliver 20% improvement in fuel consumption versus current engines. Both airframers appear interested in RISE. And if competing engine OEMs aren't providing an open-fan architecture, could we find ourselves in a position where RISE or CFM is the only engine provider for the next-gen narrowbodies? Or do you think that the need for competition changes that dynamic?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nWell, I think where we're focused today is really in two areas. One, making sure that we continue to advance the building blocks of the underlying technologies with that engine platform. And that's the work that we're spending a considerable amount of money on as part of that $2 billion R&D budget this year.\n\nSteve Winiger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nI'd say the other area is making sure that we are closely aligned with the airframers, not only with respect to giving them visibility on the progress that we're making in our technology roadmap, but also working with them as they think about their own product roadmaps into the future so that there is that collaborative symbiotic dynamic. How all that plays out, time will tell.\nBut as we have done over generations, we want to lead with innovation. We want to lead with technology. We want to be close to the airframers. I think everyone understands that we are going to need to see that type of 20% plus step function in efficiency in a next-gen platform. And as we have in the past, we intend to have GE Aerospace at the forefront.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHello. Can you hear me?\n\nSteve Winiger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nWe can.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nGood morning.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Sorry, it cut out on my end. Good morning, everyone. Let me add my congratulations to completing the spin. Steve, thanks a lot for all your help getting up to speed.\n\nSteve Winiger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nThank you.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nRahul, could you spend another minute on the free cash in the quarter and for the full year? If you're going to have any seasonality that looks like the company used to or the industry often does through the year, that number in Q1 would imply a lot of upside to the five. I know you highlighted working capital timing. It didn't look like that big of a number in the quarter on an absolute basis. Maybe it's just normally weaker. So yeah, I guess how much bigger is the greater sign on the five now than it was before? Or did you just truly have pure timing in the quarter?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah. So Noah, listen, good start on cash. Obviously pleased, we doubled our free cash flow at Aerospace year-over-year. I would say first, let's just talk about the quarter. Two main drivers here. One was earnings growth, and second was working capital improvement, which kind of offset the AD&A headwind. And working capital in the quarter was a source of cash versus a use of cash last year.\nSo that was a good turnaround from what we delivered. And the improvements we saw in the quarter came from our day sales outstanding that were down six days year-over-year, and then progress payments that we got from customers. Inventory continued to be a challenge given all the material availability. So our WIP levels are high, and the trapped inventory that we have increased as well. So overall, earnings growth and working capital kind of drove the Q1.\nNow, as you look at the full year, to your question on what's changed versus our prior guide, as I said in my prepared remarks, we do expect the incremental earnings growth that we are driving to flow through to cash. So we increased the midpoint of our profit by, call it, $150 million. So call it $100 million kind of post-taxes. Our free cash should be up by that.\nAgain, on a full-year basis, same drivers of free cash, earnings growth, and working capital improvement will continue to be the two big drivers. I think the things that we are watching here, Noah, as you go into the second half of the year, is going to be the inventory reduction that we can drive. So that's the one that's just given the supply chain challenges, given the demand dynamics with the airframers.\nSo we continue to watch our inventory levels, and can we drive the same level of inventory reduction that we had initially planned that we'd started the year? So again, good start. We expect about half the full-year cash to be in the first half of the year. And then we do think that the earnings increase that we've driven should flow through our cash as well. And greater than 100% conversion, well above 100% for the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo.\n\nMatt Akers\n\nSenior Aerospace & Defense/Government Services Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Hi, good morning, guys.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning.\n\nMatt Akers\n\nSenior Aerospace & Defense/Government Services Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, congrats, Steve. Can you touch a little bit more on the $650 million investment, just the benefits you expect to get from that? And it looks like there's a lot of additive manufacturing in there. You can just talk about that opportunity as well.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nWell, it really is a broad-based enhancement of our existing domestic footprint. I'm sure you've seen some of the line item details that were publicized locally across the country. I think more than anything, what we wanted to do was make sure we were supporting the fixed capital investments required to operationalize FLIGHT DECK to prepare for the capacity expansions. And in some instances, be it additive or in some other technologies like CMCs, that we were getting out ahead of demand to the fullest extent possible.\nAgain, back to the reality of skylines we talked about earlier. So that's what we'll do. That's kind of the announcement that we made here recently. I'm sure there will be follow-on announcements as we continue to invest. But the most important investments I think we make are those that we make in our people.\nAnd much of what we do from a training development perspective, especially vis-à-vis FLIGHT DECK is really geared toward making sure that the people who come in every day are able to do great work and put those fixed assets to their highest and best use.\n\nSteve Winiger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nHey, Liz, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThis question will come from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nUS Aerospace & Defense Analyst, Citi\n\nYeah. Same thing with Noah. Can you hear me all?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nWe can.\n\nSteve Winiger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nVery well.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nUS Aerospace & Defense Analyst, Citi\n\nYeah. Okay.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nUS Aerospace & Defense Analyst, Citi\n\nIt does go quiet right before you're allowed to put up the line. Hey, Steve, thanks for all of the help over the last year or so. And Blair, look forward to working with you. I'm sure you're listening in. Larry, a clarification point here, and then just a really quick question. On the clarification side of things, I think in your commentary about volume on LEAP during your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about supply chain being a bit of a constraint there.\nSo I want to make sure that that's the case in addition to whatever's going on with Boeing. And then on the question side of things, just kind of curious how the customer tone is these days on the narrowbody side with those airlines where you're competing for slots against the Pratt & Whitney engine. Whether the tone of those conversations is any more constructive for you in the competitive environment? Is looking more optimistic for you on head-to-head competition against the Pratt engine. Thanks.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah. I would say, as I think both Rahul and I have commented, that we're well calibrated with Boeing on the LEAP-1B requirements. We'll leave it to Dave and Brian to speak to the details tomorrow. I think as we look forward, not only with that engine, but others, the supply chain challenge that we've touched on in prior calls continues to be relevant. With respect to new business, I think if you look at our win rates, particularly in the narrowbody space over the last several years, we've been very encouraged by the sequential trend, the upticks that we have seen there. We will continue to work hard to earn the business that ought to come our way. No change in that posture whatsoever.\n\nSteve Winiger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nLarry, any final comments?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nSteve. Thank you. And again, thanks for everything. Yeah. Let me just close. I hope you see here that the GE Aerospace team is moving forward with a greater focus to invent the future of flight, to lift people up, and bring them home safely. And with FLIGHT DECK as our foundation, I'm confident we will realize our full potential in service of our customers, employees, and shareholders. We appreciate your time today and your interest in GE Aerospace.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Liz, and I will be your conference coordinator today. If you experience issues with the webcast slides refreshing or there appears to be delays in the slide advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nPlease proceed.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Electric\n\nThanks Liz.\nWelcome to GE's Q4 2023 Earnings Call. I'm joined by Chairman and CEO Larry Culp and CFO Rahul Ghai. We're also pleased to have GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik here to share additional insights on performance and business guidance. Many of the statements we're making are forward looking and based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today.\nAs described in our SEC filings and website. Those elements may change as the world changes.\nOver to Larry.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nSteve, thank you and good morning everyone.\nGE made tremendous progress in 2023 with excellent, excellent operating results, the successful spin of GE HealthCare, and the ongoing Lean transformation of our company. 2024 will be a momentous year as we launch GE Aerospace and GE Vernova in early April. Looking at our results, we more than tripled our earnings and generated almost 70% more free cash flow. In 2023, GE Aerospace drove double digit revenue, profit, and cash growth with continued strength in commercial engines and Services.\nGE Vernova delivered meaningfully better results as renewable energy and power together generated positive profit and free cash flow. In the year ahead, we expect both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova to continue on their respective upward trajectories.\nLet me spend a moment on each. GE Aerospace is an exceptional franchise with our fleet of 44,000 commercial engines and 26,000 rotorcraft and combat engines plus extensive aftermarket Services representing 70% of revenue. We live our purpose each day to invent the future of flight, lift people up and bring them home safely. It's a responsibility we take very seriously and our teams are focused on safety, quality, delivery, and cost, in that order in everything we do to support our customers in the industry.\nStrategically, today we're executing to meet customer needs for engines and Services despite the challenged supply chain environment. In the quarter, total engine deliveries were up 11% sequentially, including defense up over 60%.\nWe delivered 1,570 LEAP engines representing 38% growth. Yet with more to do going forward. As part of our Lean transformation, we're developing connected flow using model lines to improve deliveries by focusing on key constraints. We've reduced lead times, for example, over 40% our Ceramic Matrix Composite components, and in Services, we've improved LEAP shop visit turnaround times by double digits. Lean is not only helping us with delivery, but more importantly when it comes to safety and quality. The team in Rutland, Vermont used Lean problem-solving fundamentals to address recurring defects in our GEnx low pressure turbine blades. This improved first-time yield by more than 50%. Lean actions like these within our plant and in partnership with suppliers are driving improvements across GE Aerospace for tomorrow. We're building our $150 billion-plus backlog at the Dubai Air Show.\nGE Aerospace, along with our partners, received over 450 engine commitments and several service agreements across both wide bodies and narrow bodies. This included an Emirates order for 202 GE9X engines and spares, and a long-term Services agreement to power its upcoming Boeing 777X fleet. We're keeping our customers' fleets flying with durability and maintenance enhancements such as our LEAP-1A, a fuel nozzle cooling system that's on its way to fleet introduction. For the future, we're investing in R&D and developing next generation technologies. Recently, NASA selected GE Aerospace for phase two of the Hybrid Thermally Efficient Core program, which will significantly enhance fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.\nImprovements we'll leverage in our RISE rogram, and the National Defense Authorization Act authorized funding for the Adaptive Engine Transition program and the Next Generation Advanced Propulsion program, which will help provide cutting-edge future military capabilities.\nAll said, GE Aerospace is accelerating our progress with Lean and driving value long term, all in service of our customers who carry the 3 billion people traveling with our engines under wing each year.\nOver to GE Vernova. Our ambition is to electrify and decarbonize the world with our technologies helping to generate approximately 30% of the world's electricity, and where Services represent 65% of our backlog. Our incumbency and scale position us to lead. We've made a lot of progress at Vernova. I'll give you the high level framing and Scott's here today with additional color. Power delivered strong growth, profit, and free cash. Grid was profitable for the full year, and onshore delivered another quarter of profitability. Offshore remained challenging. But I really like the way we're using Lean along with better commercial selectivity, and underwriting to improve our outlook.\nGE Vernova will stand on its own soon. I'm proud of the team's work to strengthen these businesses. On a more personal note, I met Scott during my very first GE shop site visit. I have seen his leadership in action as he's led the team in executing the impressive turnaround at Gas Power and now the strong momentum building with our onshore and grid businesses. Importantly, Scott is an ardent student of Lean and I'm highly confident that he is the right person to lead GE Vernova into the future.\nTurning to slide three. With our stronger, more valuable businesses delivering now, GE Aerospace and GE Vernova are ready to go. We've assembled two extraordinary boards, bringing together domain expertise, diverse perspectives, and leadership experience to help GE Aerospace and GE Vernova rise to their sharper, more focused missions. We've also further simplified and strengthened our balance sheet, fully exiting our AerCap equity stake.\nLooking ahead, GE Vernova plans to publicly file its Form 10 next month. Then GE Vernova and GE Aerospace will host investor days on 6 March and 7 March respectively in New York City. Both teams are excited to share how we'll create greater value for our customers and shareholders alike. We hope to see many of you there.\nNow over to Rahul.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nThank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Turning to slide four, we'll speak to results on an organic basis. We closed out the year with another solid quarter. Orders were up across all segments, driven by Services up 24%.\nRevenue increased 13% with all segments up double digits. Adjusted operating profit was up 20%, supporting margin expansion of 50 basis points driven by volume and price net of inflation. This was partially offset by negative mix from higher equipment and investments in growth.\nAdjusted EPS was $1.03, up 56%. Free cash flow was $3 billion from stronger earnings and positive working capital, largely driven by progress collections including recent sizable orders. This was partially offset by payables including the actions we have taken to support our suppliers for the full year. Revenue increased 17%. Aerospace and renewables led the way, benefiting from robust demand, better execution, and pricing.\nServices was up 15% and equipment up 19%. Profit, EPS, and cash all finished above the high end of our guidance. Adjusted operating profit increased $2.5 billion to 5.7 billion. Adjusted margin expanded by over 300 basis points, driven by aerospace growth, sizable renewables improvement, and price across the three businesses, partially offset by inflation, or on long lead items, and investments in growth.\nAdjusted EPS increased more than $2, supported by strong profit growth and lower interest from debt reduction. Free cash flow was up over $2 billion to 5.2 billion, driven by significantly better earnings in 2023, working capital was a $1.6 billion source of cash from progress collections partially offset by inventory build given robust growth and continued supply chain challenges.\nA moment on corporate. We ended the year with just over $1 billion of cash use and adjusted costs of roughly $460 million. This improved year over year due to lower functional expenses and higher interest income. Overall, it represents significant progress since 2021 when costs were $1.2 billion. We are pleased to see digital turn profitable as the team prepares to formally join GE Vernova. Our industry-leading software helps utilities, grid operators, and others address the growing complexity of energy transition.\nGE Aerospace and GE Vernova are ready to go. The teams are fully staffed, and corporate headcount, which was close to 5,000 just a few years ago, stands at less than 200 people who will be with us into Q2 to execute the final spin. This temporary cost in the H1 2024 is embedded in GE Aerospace's full year guidance.\nStepping back, we are pleased with our performance in 2023. In 2024 on a standalone basis, we expect GE Aerospace and GE Vernova to grow revenue, profit, and cash. We will share more on business guidance shortly. Now turning to GE Aerospace this quarter, demand remained robust with GE and CFM departures growing high teens year over year. Orders were up 10% with solid Services and commercial engine orders. Revenue was up 12%, driven by commercial up 15%. Profit was up 8%, benefiting from increased Services volume and pricing net of inflation. This was partially offset by unfavorable equipment mix from the expected higher install and lower spare engine deliveries and higher investments. Reported margins were roughly flat year over year and down 70 basis points organically as unfavorable mix and investments offset higher volume and price net of inflation.\nIn commercial Services, revenue was up 23% from higher volume, pricing, and heavier work scopes. External spare parts increased with higher LEAP volume, and internal shop visits were up slightly.\nLean is enabling us to create new capacity to meet higher demand and decrease turnaround time and cost. For example, our MRO team in Prestwick, Scotland used Lean to remove 76 hours of waste from the engine disassembly process, which will help them to go from servicing 3.5 engines a week to five engines a week. Revenue grew 1%, with LEAP deliveries up 22%. As expected, our mix continued to shift towards install engines in defense. Book to bill was 1x, underscoring solid demand and the quality of our franchisees. Revenue was down 1%, driven by lower Services, while equipment grew double digits from higher combat engine deliveries. For the year, revenue was up 22%, commercial Services increased 30%, with external spare parts up significantly and internal shop visits up 10%. Commercial engines grew 21%, with total engine deliveries up 20% to 25% and spare engine ratio consistent with 2022.\nDefense grew 7% with book to bill of approximately 1.2x for the second consecutive year and orders were up 9%.\nProfit was $6.1 billion, increasing over $1 billion or 25% from Services growth and pricing net of inflation. This more than offset negative mix from higher LEAP volume and investment margins of 19.2% expanded 90 basis points on a reported basis and 50 basis points on an organic basis. Free cash flow of $5.7 billion increased approximately $800 million with improving earnings and working capital more than offsetting ADNA pressure. Now I'll hand it to Scott who'll cover GE Vernova.\n\nScott Strazik\n\nCEO, General Electric Vernova\n\nThanks, Rahul.\nIt's a pleasure to join you, Larry and Steve, on the last GE earnings call before we launch GE Vernova, a purpose-built company that's enabling electrification and decarbonization. We've built a strong, experienced leadership team, and we're excited to welcome Jessica Uhl to our leadership team as President of overseeing technology, innovation, and growth. I'm encouraged by what our team accomplished in 2023 as we deliver meaningfully better results now. Our renewable energy and power businesses combined drove double-digit revenue growth, were slightly profitable, improving profit over $1 billion, and generated $600 million of cash.\nAt renewable energy, our operational turnaround produced sizable improvement in the Q4. Orders were just over $5 billion, including the cancellation of a large offshore order that was originally booked in Q2 2023. Excluding this cancellation, orders grew over 20%, led by stronger onshore equipment and repower.\nWe also secured a record 2.4 gigawatt order to support Pattern Energy's SunZia Wind project, expected to be the largest wind project in US history. Revenue increased double digits, grid grew double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter. Offshore more than doubled as we deliver our existing backlog, and onshore grew, driven by North America equipment volume. Profit improved over $100 million as onshore and grid more than offset pressure at offshore. Looking at the year, orders were $23 billion, up over 50%, with revenue up 17%. Profit improved roughly $1 billion, driven by price, quality, and productivity in onshore and grid, plus the absence of last year's largely onshore-related charges. Free cash flow was negative $1.5 billion, which improved by over half a billion from better earnings and higher down payments.\nLooking closer at the businesses, at grid price and higher volume enabled full year profitability following three consecutive quarters of profit. While our backlog more than doubled to over $12 billion, with average margins and backlog increasing approximately 5 points. Lean is core here. Take our Pennsylvania facility that makes transmission circuit breakers. We increased flow and doubled production capacity, helping reduce product lead times by about 35%. This will speed up delivery to customers at a time when demand is rising. Onshore has been profitable for two consecutive quarters. North America equipment orders increased more than 70%. We've grown our global onshore equipment backlog roughly 40% and to nearly $9 billion, and approximately 70% of the backlog is North America. Importantly, margins in our total onshore equipment backlog expanded over 10 points due to continued selectivity and pricing.\nWe're delivering reliable, high-performing fleets with roughly 60% of our proactive enhancement in the field completed, with more to come. We streamlined our product lineup, focusing on higher-quality workhorse products, roughly 70% of 2023 volume. We're still increasing productivity and lowering fixed costs significantly. Offshore wind was challenging, with losses of roughly $1.1 billion in 2023. We're executing the existing backlog, improving productivity with Lean. We're starting 2024 with an equipment backlog down to roughly $4 billion, which we expect to largely complete over the next two years. Longer term, offshore wind should play a key role in the energy transition. The industry is beginning to reset, and while it does, we'll be highly selective on adding to the backlog.\nTurning to power, we delivered another strong year, led by gas power. Looking at the quarter, orders increased 4% with gas services growing double digits. Equipment orders declined largely as we exit steam new build, partially offset by higher aeroderivatives. Revenue was up 12%, driven by gas equipment. Revenue grew, driven by aeroderivative and heavy duty gas turbines. Services were strong with higher contractual outages and upgrades. Profit was over $750 million with low double digit margins, driven by Services strength. As expected, margins contracted given higher equipment volume in an individual.\nAdditional units may weigh on margins, but this drives long-term growth and higher-margin services. We're always focused on price and productivity to offset inflation. For the year, revenue grew 7%. We delivered 58 heavy-duty gas turbines with 14 HA's. Services were strong, up mid single digits, led by gas. Profit of roughly $1.4 billion grew by 10%. Importantly, gas achieved double-digit margins this year. Here, Lean is enabling higher productivity and growth. For example, our gas repairs team in Mexico created standard work to reduce cycle time and cost, decreasing lead time by 75% and operating hours per unit by 44%. This is helping us deliver faster for our customers. Free cash flow was over $2 billion, up roughly $200 million. Power continues to be a strong, reliable source of cash generation.\nWe're pleased with Power's performance, a strong, growing business where higher margin services comprise around 80% of the backlog. Now I'll turn it back to Rahul to discuss guidance.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nThanks, Scott. With the spin just around the corner, Q1 will be the last time our reporting combined GE results including GE Aerospace and GE Vernova. For this Q1, we expect high single-digit revenue growth driven by GE Aerospace, adjusted EPS of $0.60 to 0.65, more than doubling year over year, driven by profit improvement and the absence of preferred stock dividend, and free cash flow growth in line with net income growth. Our 2024 annual guidance reflects each business operating independently for the full year, incorporating standalone and other impacts that each will incur separately. I'll now hand it over to Scott and Larry to share the overall GE Vernova and GE Aerospace guides, and we will provide further details for both businesses in March. Scott, back to you.\n\nScott Strazik\n\nCEO, General Electric Vernova\n\nThanks, Rahul. GE Vernova is building momentum, expecting substantial profit and free cash flow growth in 2024. We see solid organic growth with revenue between $34 to 35 billion, up low to mid single digits from 2023, and adjusted EBITDA margin at the higher end of the mid single digits range, up from low single digit EBITDA margin in 2023.\nSupporting this outlook is continued price productivity and benefits from restructuring efforts. A few highlights: we expect gas power to remain strong, with continued Services growth and low double-digit margins. Onshore will continue to improve significantly, achieving high single-digit margins on roughly flat revenue from better mix, price, and cost out. Offshore will continue to execute our current backlog, with slight year-over-year improvement. Finally, grid will expand to mid single-digit margins, primarily from higher volume and price. Our guidance assumes roughly $200 million of standalone and $100 million of other ongoing carve out costs when converting from this year's expected operating profit margin for power and renewables combined to adjusted EBITDA margin for GE Vernova. Including these costs plus DNA, the difference is roughly half a billion dollars, or 1.5 points on free cash flow.\nWe expect $700 million to 1.1 billion from higher EBITDA and better working capital on a standalone basis, which includes absorbing our portion of the GE pension. Given the multi-decade secular tailwinds and stronger financial trajectory ahead, we are excited to launch GE Vernova and partner with our customers to lead the energy transition.\nWith that, back to Larry.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nAt GE Aerospace. We're also excited about 2024. We expect another year of solid revenue growth, at least low double digits, including mid to high teens growth in commercial, which includes high teens growth in engines, and mid teens growth in Services.\nMid to high single digit growth for defense and systems, including our propulsion and additive technologies business. On our current reporting basis, the guidance implies $6.6 to 7.1 billion of operating profit, improving double digits at the midpoint of the range on a standalone basis, including roughly $600 million of corporate and other standalone cost. This comes to approximately $6 to 6.5 billion of profit and implies flat margins year over year given the growth in LEAP, initial 9X shipments for the 777X platform, and other growth investments.\nFor free cash flow, we expect to generate over $5 billion, which remains well above 100% conversion, including standalone impacts.\nOur teams are looking forward to sharing additional insights and detail with you at our March investor days.\nIn closing, 2023 was an excellent year. GE Aerospace drove double-digit growth, and GE Vernova delivered substantially better results. Both are on track for continued growth in 2024.\nWhile our sights are on the future, we're proud of what we've accomplished. With over $100 billion in debt reduction behind us, and $7 billion returned to shareholders in 2023, we remain fully focused day in and day out on using Lean to improve how we serve our customers and deliver value for shareholders. Underpinning all of this is the GE team. My sincere thanks to all of you for the important work you did in 2023.\nI've never been more confident in the path ahead. We've created industry leaders that will carry GE's commitment to innovation and continuous improvement, while grounded in vital missions. At GE Aerospace, inventing the future of flight.\nAt GE Vernova, electrifying and decarbonizing the world. We're ready to go. Steve, over to you.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Electric\n\nThanks, Larry. Before we open the line, Liz, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question, so we can get to as many people as possible in the next 20 to 25 minutes, please open the line.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star 11 on your telephone. If you wish to withdraw your question or your question has already been answered, please press star 11 again.\nOur first question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nHey Myles, morning Myles.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nI was hoping to dig in a little bit on the commercial engines high teens growth, and maybe if you could break down a little bit, does it still include about 2,000 LEAP deliveries? Also, is the spares ratio similar to 2023? I know you mentioned 2023 was similar to 2022.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nMyles, I think from a CES or commercial engines and Services perspective.\nWe're going to see engines lead the way. Engines will be up high teens plus, and I think you're going to see Services in the mid teens area. Specific to your question, from a LEAP perspective, what we anticipate right now is a 20% to 25% increase in unit growth. I think we'll see installs get ahead of spares, so that spares ratio will begin to moderate more in line with the historic average of a typical life cycle. That's really where we are with respect to the narrow body specifics you have there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey guys, good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nGood morning Joe.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nFels like the end of an era. Yeah, as I said, feels like the end of an era. Way to go out on a good note.\nMy one question is for Scott. Scott, I'm just trying to bridge the free cash flow comments 2023-2024. Clearly, you guys have some numbers out on the slides, but the 2023 numbers look like it's not apples to apples, right? Like not burdened for corporate. It looks like you're expecting a pretty meaningful pickup in 2024. Maybe just talk to us about the puts and takes and what's embedded in the low and the high end of the guide for.\n\nScott Strazik\n\nCEO, General Electric Vernova\n\nYou bet, Joe. At the start, I mean we're proud of the $600 million of free cash flow that we generated with power and renewable segments in 2023. Now, as we get to an apples and apples basis, we need to back out from that reportable free cash flow, $600 million, our standalone and carve out costs of approximately $300 million. In addition to pension and some variables we're working through with taxes, that will all be clear in the Form 10 filing in the middle of February. Jumping off of that starting point, we expect to see real EBITDA growth that will drive free cash flow with it, from low single digit EBITDA growth to the high end of the mid single digit EBITDA range that we're talking about.\nIn addition to working capital continuing to be a source of cash that drives us up towards that $700 million to 1.1 billion of positive free cash flow at Vernova, the real drivers of the variability in that range come down primarily to two things. One is offshore wind execution and how quickly we install the wind turbines in both the Atlantic and the North Sea. Proud of the fact that we've got 14MW wind turbines in both cases continuing connected to the grid today. Really, the EDF timing of the transaction close on Steam is the two largest variables for us on that $700 million to $1.1 billion guide, with a lot of confidence that we go into 2024 expecting to see substantial improvement off of 2023.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah, hi, good morning. Maybe Larry, for the 2024 mid-teens commercial Services outlook, can you provide any more granularity on the implied assumptions, maybe for spare parts and price compared to other services, and then within that, maybe some comments on how much improvement in the lead turnaround times are embedded in the guide.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nKen, good morning. I think that what we're anticipating on the Services side is, in effect, mid single-digit departure growth really being the foundation. We will see, I think, internal shop visits grow more rapidly than we're likely to see spare parts. We're going to get pricing benefit, we're going to see work scope improvements, and that's really how you ladder up from that departures number to what we would expect to see in terms of mid teens Services growth.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nYeah, just to add a couple of dot points to that response. As Larry said, you know, departures are up 6%. You know, we are entering 2024 with you know, some catch up to do on our shop visits. Given the supply chain challenges in 2023, we could not get as many shop visits completed as we would have liked. As we enter 2024, given the demand outlook, given the increase in traffic, we are expecting our shop visits to be up kind of low double digits to mid teens. You know, adding to what Larry said on scope and pricing, that pushes our revenue from shop visits kind of towards the, you know, higher end of the teens, and then spares growth kind of moderates, and the spares growth will be below that of the shop visit growth. You combine all that, you get to that mid teens Services growth that we just mentioned.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nGood morning.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, just a question, maybe for Scott on the free cash flow again for Vernova. I just wanted to try and understand, you know, I think working capital is assumed as a source. Maybe help us understand kind of what the orders intake assumption is for Vernova this year. I think it was up 25% the orders in 2023.\nJust trying to see how much sort of orders growth this year or what kind of working capital inflow from orders you're expecting. On that free cash flow point separately, there must be some assumption for sort of interest, expense, and so forth within that cash guide. Just any framing around that, please.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nJulian, let me just kick it off and let me start with the second part first, then I'll hand it to Scott on the orders. You know, as you think about the free cash flow guide for Vernova, we'll definitely provide more details as Form 10 comes out and we have the investor days. Just keep in mind, as we've previously discussed.\nVast, vast majority of the GE debt will retain with GE Aerospace. There's not a lot of interest impact on GE Vernova. That's the way to think about the free cash flow for next year. More details to come on the capital structure. Scott, you want to take the order. Scott?\n\nScott Strazik\n\nCEO, General Electric Vernova\n\nYou bet, Rahul, thank you. Julian, I think to your point, to begin with, we had a big SunZia order with onshore wind in the Q4 across grid. There were a number of large HVDC orders with TenneT as an example. You can't expect in every year, in any quarter specifically, that we're going to see those types of transactions. Those we don't expect to see a repeat in 2024 versus 2023.\nWith onshore wind as an example, our largest renewables business, we see our customers actively investing and replenishing their project book right now. I mean, they really utilized all the projects they had prior to having clarity on the PTC. We do think the orders profile in 2024, much like the revenue and shipments profile, will be more back-end loaded than first-half loaded on onshore wind. With very active individual projects, orders are going to be more flattish than up, and on onshore.\nOn grid the one point I'd make is, although we aren't going to expect as much in large HVDC orders to the extent we had with TenneT in 2023, the reality is even if you back out the HVDC orders in grid, our second largest renewables business, our orders in grid grew by over 20% in 2023. Power transformers, as an example, a business we don't talk about as much, grew orders by 40%, and we expect to continue to see that strength. There may be less headline orders of the magnitude of a SunZia or the TenneT HVDC projects, but there's a lot of healthy demand across renewables that we expect to continue into 2024 that contributes towards our free cash flow generation continuing to be greater than 100% and that significant free cash flow growth that we just talked about.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, guys. Thank you.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nMorning Sheila.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, Larry, this one's for you. Maybe if you could just offer your perspective on the quality lapses we've seen across the industry. How does it change your approach in regards to ensuring the integrity of your own supply chains as the industry grapples with the LEAP challenges, obviously. You also mentioned initial GE9X production in 2024. How does that flow into your assumptions on free cash flow for things like inventory build?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nSheila, there's a lot there. I think from a let's take safety first. I'm strongly of the view that the industry.\nNot to speak for the industry, but having been close to this business for almost two years, everybody understands the solemn responsibility we have the world over. I think from a GE Aerospace perspective, as you and I have talked.\nThe operating framework, the Lean transformation that's been underway here, is very much rooted in an SQDC approach, safety framework first and foremost, before quality, before delivery, before cost. We not only talk that way, we work hard to make sure we operate that way day in and day out. Fortunately, at GE Aerospace, we have a long history of being hyper focused on safety. You go back, for example, to, I think, 2013. Our safety management system was really the first of its kind. We were the first OEM to implement such a scheme well before the FAA required the industry to do so. We have been building on that. That approach never assumes perfection, right?\nWe layer in all sorts of checks and audits, process capabilities to make sure that we're doing all that we possibly can to deliver safety, to deliver quality over time. That applies in the commercial realm. It applies on the defense side, legacy platforms, new platforms like LEAP and 9X. I'd also say that when we talk about our leadership behaviors of humility, transparency, and focus, that really helps undergird all of that work. Because if we have an opportunity to improve, if we miss something, we want folks to come forward, share that with us so we can get after it, get to root cause, and lay in corrective action. That's really the general approach from a 9X perspective. We do know that that will be a pressure on us in 2024. We're assuming EIS may have 2025.\nWe'll begin to ship engines in the back half of 2024. Really the beginning of the life cycle for that platform. We're thrilled to be underway on the 777X. It's an exciting platform, but it will be a financial headwind for us for the foreseeable future as we ramp not only the volumes, but obviously improve the overall cost structure of that business with an eye toward building the installed base and the service annuities that will come over time.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nYep. Sheila, just to add to that, on the free cash flow part of your question, you know, GE9X has been a headwind on free cash flow even in 2023 as we started bringing in inventory to start shipping this year, as Larry said, towards the back half of this year. It will continue to impact our free cash flow negatively to some extent, but it's not a material driver overall as you've seen, you know, greater than $5 billion of free cash flow for 2024, including absorption of the corporate pension, the interest expense.\nStill feel pretty good about the free cash flow for 2024, and the 9X is not a material driver of the free cash flow for the year.\n\nOperator\n\nYear.\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, good morning,\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nAndrew. Good morning.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYeah, good morning. Just one last time for me for GE. Yeah, a question for Rahul. Maybe just if you gave us an overview for the company into the Q1, maybe just detail by business for GE into the Q1, a little bit more color. Thanks.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nSure, Andrew. You know, if you look at the Q1 guide, aerospace is going to start the year strong, revenue up mid teens with the commercial growth rates in the Q1 kind of in line with what we are projecting for the full year. The margins on a business as usual, you know, kind of pre all the standalone expenses, we do expect margins to be flat to slightly up for the Q1 on a year over year basis for aerospace. For renewables, as Scott said, there will be profit improvement during the year, but that improvement will be more back end loaded as we start converting the higher margin onshore wind orders that Scott referenced in his prepared remarks. You know, we start shipping those orders that we got in 2023 into the second half of 2024.\nThere's a little bit of lag between order to revenue conversion, and the renewables improvement will be more back end loaded. The Q1 for renewables will look a lot like the Q4 for renewables, so think about, you know, roughly in the same zone. For power, you know, typical seasonality with low single digit growth, some margin expansion year over year in the Q1. You know, just one other point I want to make on the Q1 is that given that both Vernova and Aerospace teams are fully staffed up to become standalone public companies, and we are operating with a very, very small corporate staff, the historic corporate expense will now be fully absorbed in the two businesses, and the corporate expense in Q1 will be effectively zero.\nThe majority of that expense going to Aerospace, you know, and the balance to Vernova. The way to think about Q1 margins for both companies is just as we think through after absorption of incremental cost and, you know, just given in line with the reported margin guidance that we provided for full year. That's the way to think about the Q1 margins.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thanks very much and good.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nMorning. Good morning Seth.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nI don't want to kind of you know, you've just given us the 2024 guidance, so I apologize for jumping ahead here. When we think about the margin cadence in aerospace, apples to apples, kind of flattish as we go from 2023 to 2024, when you think about going to kind of the 20% that you talked about for 2025, how do we think about the key drivers as we bridge.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nYeah, sure, Seth. Listen, let's start with a really strong 2023, right? $1.3 billion of profit growth, 90 basis points of margin expansion, and better than what we said back in March, right, when we were expecting $5.5 billion of profit, flat margins year over year. The 2023 has shaped up a lot better than what we initially expected back in March. Now, as you look forward to 2024, I know you kind of skipped over that here, but double-digit profit growth.\nIn 2024, with the OE Ramp 9s introduction kind of pressuring the margin rate, it is exactly the step that we had thought in our minds on how 2024 would look when we were sitting back in March, right. We had said, Hey, 2024 will be a step along the way to 2025. Now, as we get to 2025, the biggest driver to profit growth between 2024 to 2025 will be the benefit from top line improvement. That is in line with what we've previously said, pricing that offsets inflation and productivity. Mix will continue to be an issue. LEAP OE volume ramps, LEAP services ramps, and even though LEAP services becomes profitable in 2024, it's still a margin headwind. Then 9X volume ramps in 2025 as well.\nIf you think about 2025, recall, we had said $7.5, $7.6 to $8 billion of profit on the current GE reporting, which translates to roughly about 20% margins, layering in about half a billion dollars of standalone public company expenses, EHNS cost, all the other things. We are thinking $7.1 to $7.6 billion of profit for 2025, which is in line with what we said back in March, just adjusted for the incremental expenses. We'll come back to that and talk more in March.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nGood morning everyone.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nHey, Andy.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nAndy. Good morning.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nScott. Maybe in terms of your 2024 margin expectations for Vernova, could you give us a little more color on the components? I think you mentioned onshore can reach high single digit margins with the second half ramp up, which would, I think, be meaningfully better performance than your initial expectations you set for the business in 2023 last year. Does that assume you get through most of your product reliability issues, and has price versus cost just been a bigger driver than you would have thought?\n\nScott Strazik\n\nCEO, General Electric Vernova\n\nAndy? You bet. I mean, if we go back to our original guide in 2024, going back to March, we're largely in line with the expectations there. If we take a step back, gas power is stronger than our expectations in March, onshore wind and grid are both stronger. To your point, we talked today about onshore wind being high single-digit margins in 2024, and grid being mid single-digit margins. Now, gas has already gotten to low double-digit margins and will continue to accrete. Offshore is tougher than where we were in March, and that's challenging. A little bit of that strength is in our three largest businesses, with gas, grid, and onshore representing about 80% of our revenue today. Also, taking into account that tough offshore backlog, we've got two more years to execute through that.\nWhen you think about our three largest businesses continuing to be stronger than where we were, while we really reduce our offshore backlog from $6 billion to approximately $4 billion in approximately two years to go, we see a clear pathway in 2024 to accrete margin. Also, then to continue to accrete a margin beyond as we liquidate the rest of the tough economics with offshore in 2025 and then find the oxygen to really share with you. Some of our smaller businesses we do not talk about as much, but you heard Rahul mention earlier the fact that our digital business returned to profitability, and we are really excited about some of those areas like Grid software that we will share more with you when we get to 6 March. Those really are the key dynamics of 2023 to 2024.\nLooking a little bit further out than even that.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Electric\n\nLiz, we have time for one last.Question.\n\nOperator\n\nThis question will come from the line of Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nHey Scott.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nGood morning Scott.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nRahul, you touched on it a bit in your answer to Seth's question, but can you give a bit more detail on the flat margins implied for GE Aerospace in 2024. And then for Larry, I was hoping you can give an update on your capital allocation priorities for 2024, including how share purchases fit in relative to debt pay down. Thank you.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nYeah, sure, Scott. You know, as we look forward to 2024, I think it's going to be another strong year, right? We've guided to $6.6 to 7.1 billion of profit on a current basis and then $6 to 6.5 billion on a standalone basis. This is after including, you know, EHS or the public company expenses, including, what, $100 million to support the wind down of GE corporate office, which will now be with us kind of through Q2. This implies about $750 million of profit growth, or low double digit at the midpoint of that growt.\nMargins we do expect those margins to be flat, about 2 points of margin pressure that we are expecting. More than half a point of that is coming from LEAP OE ramp, introduction of 9X engines, and the strong LEAP services growth. As I said to Seth earlier, even though LEAP services is turning profitable just as we would have expected, it is still negatively impacting the margins, and the rest of that 2 point headwind is coming from incremental R&D to support further improvement in LEAP durability, introduction of 9X, and then develop the next generation of products for the future of flight.\nThis margin pressure is completely offset with benefit from volume, productivity, the strong Services growth that we're expecting. Overall, again, it's a step that is in line with our expectations that we had laid out for the medium term outlook in March of 2023. Larry\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nScott, I don't know if you asked that relative to my GE role or my aerospace role. I suspect the latter, but just with the GE hat on for a moment, really no change at this point. We really want to make sure we see through the spin as I think both Rahul and Scott talked at the outset, feeling very good about Vernova's prospects here to be investment grade, confident in that outlook, and we want to see that through, set up both businesses. We will in early March in New York City share more at each of the investor days as to how we're thinking about not only the capital structures, but the capital allocation strategies for both businesses.\nI think at Aerospace you should assume that we're going to have a compelling dividend, that buybacks are going to be an important part of that overall effort beyond just covering dilution. We'll certainly look to do meaningful, value accretive M and A, the mix, the timing, those details to come. I really want the GE Aerospace board to have more time with those important questions, but we're looking forward to moving beyond deleveraging, playing more offense at Aerospace. I think while Scott's got a different hand to play, they're going to look to continue to certainly invest in organically in the opportunities that they have around the energy transition. Thank you.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Electric\n\nLiz, before we wrap, I want to remind folks that GE Aerospace will report GE's Q1 results in late April, with GE Vernova holding a separate call as a result, like we did with GE HealthCare. We'll focus our comments in late April on Aerospace, leaving GE Vernova commentary to Scott and his team. Larry, any final comments?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nSteve, thanks. Just to close the call, again, the teams delivered in 2023, both Aerospace and Vernova. We're really looking forward to what's ahead for both companies as independent entities. Before that day in early April, we hope to see many of you at the investor days in March. We appreciate your time today, your investment, and support of GE.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\nGood day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Electric Q4 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Liz, and I will be your conference coordinator today. If you experience issues with the webcast slides refreshing or there appear to be delays in the slide advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nPlease proceed.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Electric\n\nThanks Liz. Welcome to GE's Q4 2023 earnings call. I'm joined by Chairman and CEO Larry Culp and CFO Rahul Ghai. We're also pleased to have GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik here to share additional insights on performance and business guidance. Many of the statements we're making are forward looking and based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and website, those elements may change as the world changes. Over to Larry.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric",
    "content2": "Steve, thank you and good morning everyone.\nGE made tremendous progress in 2023 with excellent operating results, the successful spin of GE HealthCare, and the ongoing Lean transformation of our company. 2024 will be a momentous year as we launch GE Aerospace and GE Vernova in early April.\nLooking at our results, we more than tripled our earnings and generated almost 70% more free cash flow in 2023. GE Aerospace drove double-digit revenue, profit, and cash growth with continued strength in commercial engines and Services.\nGE Vernova delivered meaningfully better results, as renewable energy and power together generated positive profit and free cash flow. In the year ahead, we expect both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova to continue on their respective upward trajectories.\nLet me spend a moment on each. GE Aerospace is an exceptional franchise with our fleet of 44,000 commercial engines and 26,000 rotorcraft and combat engines, plus extensive aftermarket Services representing 70% of revenue. We live our purpose each day to invent the future of flight, lift people up, and bring them home to safely. It's a responsibility we take very seriously, and our teams are focused on safety, quality, delivery, and cost, in that order, in everything we do to support our customers in the industry.\nStrategically, today we're executing to meet customer needs for engines and Services despite the challenged supply chain environment. In the quarter, total engine deliveries were up 11% sequentially, including defense up over 60%.\nWe delivered 1,570 LEAP engines, representing 38% growth, yet with more to do going forward. As part of our Lean transformation, we're developing connected flow using model lines to improve deliveries. By focusing on key constraints, we've reduced lead times, for example, over 40% for our ceramic matrix composite components, and in Services, we've improved LEAP shop visit turnaround times by double digits. Lean is not only helping us with delivery, but more importantly, when it comes to safety and quality, the team in Rutland, Vermont used Lean problem solving fundamentals to address recurring defects in our GEnx low pressure turbine blades. This improved first time yield by more than 50%. Lean actions like these within our plant, and in partnership with suppliers, are driving improvements across GE Aerospace for tomorrow. We're building our $150 billion plus backlog at the Dubai Air Show.\nGE Aerospace, along with our partners, received over 450 engine commitments and several service agreements across both widebodies and narrow bodies. This included an Emirates order for 202 GE9X engines and spares, and a long-term Services agreement to power its upcoming Boeing 777X fleet. We're keeping our customers' fleets flying with durability and maintenance enhancements, such as our LEAP-1A fuel nozzle cooling system that's on its way to fleet introduction. For the future, we're investing in R&D and developing next generation technologies. Recently, NASA selected GE Aerospace for phase two of the Hybrid Thermally Efficient Core program, which will significantly enhance fuel efficiency and reduce emissions—improvements we'll leverage in our RISE program. The National Defense Authorization Act authorized funding for the Adaptive Engine Transition Program and the Next Generation Advanced Propulsion Program, which will help provide cutting-edge future military capabilities.\nAll said, GE Aerospace is accelerating our progress with Lean and driving value long term, all in service of our customers who carry the 3 billion people traveling with our engines under wing each year.\nOver to GE Vernova. Our ambition is to electrify and decarbonize the world with our technologies, helping to generate approximately 30% of the world's electricity, and where Services represent 65% of our backlog. Our incumbency and scale position us to lead. We've made a lot of progress at Vernova. I'll give you the high-level framing, and Scott's here today with additional color. Power delivered strong growth, profit, and free cash. Grid was profitable for the full year, and onshore delivered another quarter of profitability. Offshore remained challenging, but I really like the way we're using Lean, along with better commercial selectivity and underwriting, to improve our outlook.\nGE Vernova will stand on its own soon. I'm proud of the team's work to strengthen these businesses. On a more personal note, I met Scott during my very first GE site visit. I have seen his leadership in action as he's led the team in executing the impressive turnaround at Gas Power, and now the strong momentum building with our onshore and grid businesses. Importantly, Scott is an ardent student of Lean, and I'm highly confident that he is the right person to lead GE Vernova into the future.\nTurning to lide three, with our stronger, more valuable businesses delivering now, GE Aerospace and GE Vernova are ready to go. We've assembled two extraordinary boards, bringing together domain expertise, diverse perspectives, and leadership experience to help GE Aerospace and GE Vernova rise to their sharper, more focused missions. We've also further simplified and strengthened our balance sheet, fully exiting our aircraft equity stake.\nLooking ahead, GE Vernova plans to publicly file its Form 10 next month. GE Vernova and GE Aerospace will host investor days on 6 March and 7 March respectively in New York City. Both teams are excited to share how we'll create greater value for our customers and shareholders alike. We hope to see many of you there. Now over to Rahul.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nThank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Turning to slide four, we'll speak to results on an organic basis. We closed out the year with another solid quarter. Or`ders were up across all segments, driven by Services up 24%.\nRevenue increased 13% with all segments up double digits. Adjusted Operating Profit was up 20%, supporting margin expansion of 50 basis points driven by volume and price net of inflation. This was partially offset by negative mix from higher equipment and investments in growth.\nAdjusted EPS was $1.03, up 56%. Free cash flow was $3 billion from stronger earnings and positive working capital, largely driven by progress collections, including recent sizable orders. This was partially offset by payables, including the actions we have taken to support our suppliers for the full year. Revenue increased 17%. Aerospace and renewables led the way, benefiting from robust demand, better execution, and pricing.\nServices was up 15% and equipment up 19%. Profit, EPS, and cash all finished above the high end of our guidance. Adjusted operating profit increased $2.5 billion to $5.7 billion. Adjusted margin expanded by over 300 basis points, driven by aerospace growth, sizable renewables improvement, and price across the three businesses, partially offset by inflation on long lead items and investments in growth.\nAdjusted EPS increased more than $2, supported by strong profit growth and lower interest from debt reduction. Free cash flow was up over $2 billion to $5.2 billion, driven by significantly better earnings in 2023. Working capital was a $1.6 billion source of cash from progress collections, partially offset by inventory build given robust growth and continued supply chain challenges.\nA moment on corporate, we ended the year with just over $1 billion of cash use and adjusted costs of roughly $460 million. This improved year over year due to lower functional expenses and higher interest income. Overall, it represents significant progress since 2021 when costs were $1.2 billion. We are pleased to see digital turn profitable as the team prepares to formally join GE Vernova. Our industry-leading software helps utilities, grid operators, and others address the growing complexity of energy transition.\nGE Aerospace and GE Vernova are ready to go. The teams are fully staffed, and corporate headcount, which was close to 5,000 just a few years ago, stands at less than 200 people who will be with us into Q2 to execute the final spin. This temporary cost in the first half of 2024 is embedded in GE Aerospace's full year guidance.\nStepping back, we are pleased with our performance in 2023. In 2024, on a standalone basis, we expect GE Aerospace and GE Vernova to grow revenue, profit, and cash. We will share more on business guidance shortly. Now turning to GE Aerospace this quarter, demand remained robust with GE and CFM departures growing high teens year over year. Orders were up 10% with solid Services and commercial engine orders. Revenue was up 12%, driven by commercial up 15%. Profit was up 8%, benefiting from increased Services volume and pricing net of inflation. This was partially offset by unfavorable equipment mix from the expected higher install and lower spare engine deliveries, and higher investments. Reported margins were roughly flat year over year and down 70 basis points organically as unfavorable mix and investments offset higher volume and price net of inflation in commercial Services revenue was up 23% from higher volume, pricing, and heavier work scopes.\nExternal spare parts increased with higher LEAP volume, and internal shop visits were up slightly.\nLean is enabling us to create new capacity to meet higher demand and decrease turnaround time and cost. For example, our MRO team in Prestwick, Scotland used Lean to remove 76 hours of waste from the engine disassembly process, which will help them to go from servicing 3.5 engines a week to five engines a week. Revenue grew 1%, with LEAP deliveries up 22%. As expected, our mix continued to shift towards install engines in defense. Book to bill was 1x, underscoring solid demand and the quality of our franchisees. Revenue was down 1%, driven by lower Services, while equipment grew double digits from higher combat engine deliveries. For the year, revenue was up 22%, commercial Services increased 30%, with external spare parts up significantly, and internal shop visits up 10%. Commercial engines grew 21%, with total engine deliveries up 25% and spare engine ratio consistent with 2022.\nDefense grew 7% with book to bill of approximately 1.2x for the second consecutive year, and orders were up 9%.\nProfit was $6.1 billion, increasing over $1 billion or 25% from Services growth and pricing net of inflation, this was more than offset. This more than offset negative mix from higher LEAP volume and investments. Margins of 19.2% expanded 90 basis points on a reported basis and 50 basis points on an organic basis. Free cash flow of $5.7 billion increased approximately $800 million with improving earnings and working capital more than offsetting ADNA pressure. Now I'll hand it to Scott who'll cover GE Vernova\n\nScott Strazik\n\nCEO, General Electric Vernova\n\nThanks, Rahul. It's a pleasure to join you, Larry, and Steve on the last GE earnings call before we launch GE Vernova, a purpose-built company that's enabling electrification and decarbonization. We've built a strong, experienced leadership team, and we're excited to welcome Jessica Uhl to our leadership team as President overseeing technology, innovation, and growth. I'm encouraged by what our team accomplished in 2023 as we deliver meaningfully better results now. Our renewable energy and power businesses combined drove double-digit revenue growth, were slightly profitable, improving profit over $1 billion, and generated $600 million of cash this year.\nAt renewable energy, our operational turnaround produced sizable improvement. In the Q4, orders were just over $5 billion, including the cancellation of a large offshore order that was originally booked in Q2 2023. Excluding this cancellation, orders grew over 20%, led by stronger onshore equipment and repower. We also secured a record 2.4GW order to support Pattern Energy's SunZia wind project, expected to be the largest wind project in US history. Revenue increased double digits. Grid grew double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter. Offshore more than doubled as we deliver our existing backlog, and onshore grew, driven by North America equipment volume. Profit improved over $100 million as onshore and grid more than offset pressure at offshore. Looking at the year, orders were $23 billion, up over 50%, with revenue up 17%.\nProfit improved roughly $1 billion, driven by price, quality, and productivity in onshore and grid, plus the absence of last year's largely onshore-related charges. Free cash flow was negative $1.5 billion, which improved by over half a billion from better earnings and higher down payments. Looking closer at the businesses, at grid, price and higher volume enabled full year profitability following three consecutive quarters of profit, while our backlog more than doubled to over $12 billion, with average margins and backlog increasing approximately 5 points. Lean is core here. Take our Pennsylvania facility that makes transmission circuit breakers. We increased flow and doubled production capacity, helping reduce product lead times by about 35%. This will speed up delivery to customers at a time when demand is rising. Onshore has been profitable for two consecutive quarters. North America equipment orders increased more than 70%.\nWe've grown our global onshore equipment backlog roughly 40% to nearly $9 billion, and approximately 70% of the backlog is North America. Importantly, margins in our total onshore equipment backlog expanded over 10 points due to continued selectivity and pricing. We're delivering reliable, high-performing fleets with roughly 60% of our proactive enhancement in the field completed, with more to come. We streamlined our product lineup, focusing on higher quality workhorse products, roughly 70% of 2023 volume, and we're still increasing productivity and lowering fixed costs significantly. Offshore wind was challenging, with losses of roughly $1.1 billion in 2023. We're executing the existing backlog, improving productivity with Lean. We're starting 2024 with an equipment backlog down to roughly $4 billion, which we expect to largely complete over the next two years. Longer term, offshore wind should play a key role in the energy transition.\nThe industry is beginning to reset, and while it does, we'll be highly selective on adding to the backlog.\nTurning to power, we delivered another strong year led by Gas Power. Looking at the quarter, orders increased 4% with gas services growing double digits. Equipment orders declined largely as we exit steam new build, partially offset by higher aeroderivatives. Revenue is up 12% driven by gas equipment. Revenue grew, driven by aeroderivative and heavy duty gas turbines. Services were strong with higher contractual outages and upgrades. Profit was over $750 million with low double digit margins, driven by Services strength. As expected, margins contracted given higher equipment volume.\nIn an individual quarter additional units may weigh on margins, but this drives long-term growth in higher margin services. We're always focused on price and productivity to offset inflation. For the year, revenue grew 7%. We delivered 58 heavy duty gas turbines with 14 HA's. Services were strong, up mid single digits, led by Gas. Profit of roughly $1.4 billion grew by 10%. Importantly, Gas achieved double-digit margins this year. Here, Lean is enabling higher productivity and growth. For example, our gas repairs team in Mexico created standard work to reduce cycle time and cost, decreasing lead time by 75% and operating hours per unit by 44%. This is helping us deliver faster for our customers. Free cash flow was over $2 billion, up roughly $200 million. Power continues to be a strong, reliable source of cash generation. We're pleased with Power's performance.\nA strong, growing business where higher margin services comprise around 80% of the backlog. Now I'll turn it back to Rahul to discuss guidance.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nThanks, Scott. With the spin just around the corner, Q1 will be the last time our reporting combined GE results including GE Aerospace and GE Vernova. For this Q1, we expect high single-digit revenue growth driven by GE Aerospace, adjusted EPS of $0.60 to 0.65, more than doubling year over year, driven by profit improvement and the absence of preferred stock dividend, and free cash flow growth in line with net income growth. Our 2024 annual guidance reflects each business operating independently for the full year, incorporating standalone and other impacts that each will incur separately. I'll now hand it over to Scott and Larry to share the overall GE Vernova and GE Aerospace guides, and we will provide further details for both businesses in March. Scott, back to you.\n\nScott Strazik\n\nCEO, General Electric Vernova\n\nThanks, Rahul. GE Vernova is building momentum, expecting substantial profit and free cash flow growth in 2024. We see solid organic growth with revenue between $34 to 35 billion, up low to mid single digits from 2023, and adjusted EBITDA margin at the higher end of the mid single digits range, up from low single digit EBITDA margin in 2023.\nSupporting this outlook is continued price productivity and benefits from restructuring efforts. A few highlights: we expect gas power to remain strong with continued Services growth and low double-digit margins. Onshore will continue to improve significantly, achieving high single-digit margins on roughly flat revenue from better mix, price, and cost out. Offshore will continue to execute our current backlog with slight year-over-year improvement. Finally, Grid will expand to mid single-digit margins, primarily from higher volume and price. Our guidance assumes roughly $200 million of standalone and $100 million of other ongoing carve out costs when converting from this year's expected operating profit margin for power and renewables combined to adjusted EBITDA margin for GE Vernova. Including these costs plus DNA, the difference is roughly half a billion dollars or 1.5 points on free cash flow.\nWe expect $700 million to 1.1 billion from higher EBITDA and better working capital on a standalone basis, which includes absorbing our portion of the GE pension. Given the multi-decade secular talents and stronger financial trajectory ahead, we are excited to launch GE Vernova and partner with our customers to lead the energy transition forward. With that, back to Larry.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nAt GE Aerospace. We're also excited about 2024. We expect another year of solid revenue growth, up at least low double digits, including mid to high teens growth in commercial, which includes high teens growth in engines and mid teens growth in Services, mid to high single digit growth for defense and systems, including our propulsion and additive technologies business. On our current reporting basis, the guidance implies $6.6 to 7.1 billion of operating profit, improving double digits at the midpoint of the range. On a standalone basis, including roughly $600 million of corporate and other standalone cost, this comes to approximately $6 to 6.5 billion of profit and implies flat margins year over year, given the growth in LEAP, initial 9X shipments for the 777X platform, and other growth investments.\nFor free cash flow, we expect to generate over $5 billion, which remains well above 100% conversion, including standalone impacts.\nOur teams are looking forward to sharing additional insights and detail with you at our March Investor Days.\nIn closing, 2023 was an excellent year. GE Aerospace drove double digit growth and GE Vernova delivered substantially better results. Both are on track for continued growth in 2024.\nWhile our sights are on the future, we're proud of what we've accomplished. With over $100 billion in debt reduction behind us and $7 billion returned to shareholders in 2023, we remain fully focused day in and day out on using Lean to improve how we serve our customers and deliver value for shareholders. Underpinning all of this is the GE team. My sincere thanks to all of you for the important work you did in 2023.\nI've never been more confident in the path ahead. We've created industry leaders that will carry GE's commitment to innovation and continuous improvement while grounded in vital missions. At GE Aerospace, Inventing the Future of Flight.\nAnd at GE Vernova, electrifying and decarbonizing the world. We're ready to go. Steve, over to you.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Electric\n\nThanks, Larry. Before we open the line, Liz, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question so we can get to as many people as possible in the next 20 to 25 minutes. Please open the line\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star 11 on your telephone. If you wish to withdraw your question or your question has already been answered, please press star one one again.\nOur first question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nHey, Myles.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nMorning, Myles.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nI was hoping to dig in a little bit on the commercial engines, high-teens growth, and maybe if you could break down a little bit, does it still include about 2,000 LEAP deliveries? And also, is the spares ratio similar to 23? I know you mentioned 23 was similar to 22.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nMyles. I think from a CES or commercial engines and Services perspective.\nWe're going to see engines lead the way. Engines will be up high teens plus. I think you're going to see Services in the mid teens area. Specific to your question, from a LEAP perspective, what we anticipate right now is a 20% to 25% increase in unit growth. I think we'll see installs get ahead of spares, so that spares ratio will begin to moderate more in line with the historic average of a typical life cycle. That's really where we are with respect to the narrow body specifics you have there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey guys. Good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nMorning Joe.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nFeels like the end of an era. Yeah, as I said, feels like the end of an era. Way to go out on a good note.\nMy one question is for Scott. So Scott, I'm just trying to bridge the free cash flow comments 2023-2024, clearly you guys have some numbers out on the slides, but the 2023 numbers look like it's not apples to apples, right? Like not burdened for corporate. It looks like you're expecting a pretty meaningful pickup in 2024. So maybe just talk to us about the puts and takes and what's embedded in the low and the high end of the guide for 2024.\n\nScott Strazik\n\nCEO, General Electric Vernova\n\nYou bet, Joe. At the start, I mean, we're proud of the $600 million of free cash flow that we generated with power and renewable segments in 2023. Now, as we get to an apples-to-apples basis, we need to back out from that reportable free cash flow $600 million, our standalone and carve-out costs of approximately $300 million, in addition to pension and some variables we're working through with taxes, that will all be clear in the Form 10 filing in the middle of February. Jumping off of that starting point, we expect to see real EBITDA growth that will drive free cash flow with it, from low single-digit EBITDA growth to the high end of the mid single-digit EBITDA range that we're talking about.\nIn addition to working capital continuing to be a source of cash that drives us up towards that $700 million to 1.1 billion of positive free cash flow at Vernova. Now the real drivers of the variability in that range come down primarily to two things. One is offshore wind execution and how quickly we install the wind turbines in both the Atlantic and the North Sea. Proud of the fact that we've got 14-MW wind turbines in both cases connected to the grid today. And really the EDF timing of the transaction close on steam as the two largest variables for us on that $700 million to $1.1 billion guide. But with a lot of confidence that we go into 2024 expecting to see substantial improvement off of 2023.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah, hi, good morning. Maybe Larry, for the 2024 mid-teens commercial Services outlook, can you provide any more granularity on the implied assumptions, maybe for spare parts and pricing compared to other services, and then within that, maybe some comments on how much improvement in the lead turnaround times are embedded in the guide?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nKen, good morning. I think that what we're anticipating on the Services side is, in effect, mid-single-digit departure growth really being the foundation. We will see, I think, internal shop visits grow more rapidly than we're likely to see spare parts. We're going to get pricing benefit, we're going to see work scope improvements, and that's really how you ladder up from that departures number to what we would expect to see in terms of mid teens Services growth. Rahul?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nYeah, just to add a couple of dot points to that response, as Larry said, departures are up 6%. We are entering 2024 with some catch up to do on our shop visits. Given the supply chain challenges in 2023, we could not get as many shop visits completed as we would have liked. So as we enter 2024, given the demand outlook, given the increase in traffic, we are expecting our shop visits to be up kind of low double digits to mid teens. And you know, adding to what Larry said on, you know, scope and pricing, that pushes our revenue from shop visits kind of towards the, you know, higher end of the teens. And then spares growth kind of moderates, and the spares growth will be below that of the shop visit growth. But you combine all that, you get to that mid-teens Services growth that we just mentioned.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nGood morning.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, just a question maybe for Scott on the free cash flow again for Vernova. So I just wanted to try and understand, you know, I think working capital is assumed as a source. So maybe help us understand kind of what the orders intake assumption is for Vernova this year. I think it was up 25%, the orders in 2023.\nSo, just trying to see how much sort of orders growth this year or what kind of working capital inflow from orders you're expecting. And on that free cash flow point separately, there must be some assumption for sort of interest, expense, and so forth within that cash guide. So, just any framing around that, please.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nJulian, let me just kick it off and let me start with the second part first, and then I'll hand it to Scott on the orders. As you think about the free cash flow guide for GE Vernova, we'll definitely provide more details as Form 10 comes out, and then we have the investor days. But just keep in mind, as we've previously discussed, vast, vast majority of the GE debt will retain with GE Aerospace. So there's not a lot of interest impact on GE Vernova. So that's the way to think about the free cash flow for next year. More details to come on the capital structure. But Scott, you want to take the order. Scott?\n\nScott Strazik\n\nCEO, General Electric Vernova\n\nYou bet, Rahul, thank you. And Julian, I think, to your point, to begin with, you know, we had a big since the order with onshore wind in the Q4 across grid. There were a number of large HVDC orders with TenneT, and as an example, you can't expect in every year, in any quarter specifically, that we're going to see those types of transactions. So those, we don't expect to see a repeat in 2024 versus 2023. But with onshore wind as an example, our largest renewables business, we see our customers actively investing and replenishing their project book right now. I mean, they really utilized all the projects they had prior to having clarity on the PTC. And we do think the orders profile in 2024, much like the revenue and shipments profile, will be more back-end loaded than first-half loaded onshore wind. But with very active individual projects, orders are going to be more flattish than up, and onshore\nO grid. the one point I'd make is although we aren't going to expect as much in large HVDC orders to the extent we had with TenneT in 2023. The reality is even if you back out the HVDC orders in grid, our second largest renewables business, our orders in grid grew by over 20% in 2023. Power transformers, as an example, a business we don't talk about as much, grew orders by 40%, and we expect to continue to see that strength. So there may be less headline orders of the magnitude of SunZia or the TenneT HVDC projects, but there's a lot of healthy demand across renewables that we expect to continue into 2024 that contributes towards our free cash flow generation continuing to be greater than 100% and that significant free cash flow growth that we just talked about.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, guys. Thank you.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nMorning Shiela\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, Larry, this one's for you. Maybe if you could just offer your perspective on the quality lapses we've seen across the industry. How does it change your approach in regards to ensuring the integrity of your own supply chains as the industry grapples with the LEAP challenges, obviously. But you also mentioned initial GE9X production in 2024. How does that flow into your assumptions on free cash flow for things like inventory build?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nSheila, there's a lot there, I think. Let's take safety first. I'm strongly of the view that the industry.\nNot to speak for the industry, but having been close to this business for almost two years, everybody understands the solemn responsibility we have the world over. I think from a GE Aerospace perspective, as you and I have talked, the operating framework, the Lean transformation that's been underway here is very much rooted in an SQDC approach. Safety first and foremost, before quality, before delivery, before cost. And we not only talk that way, we work hard to make sure we operate that way day in and day out. Fortunately, at GE Aerospace, we have a long history of being hyper-focused on safety. You go back, for example, to, I think, 2013. Our safety management system was really the first of its kind. We were the first OEM to implement such a scheme well before the FAA required the industry to do so.\nAnd we have been building on that. But that approach never assumes perfection. Right. So we layer in all sorts of checks and audits, process capabilities, to make sure that we're doing all that we possibly can to deliver safety, to deliver quality over time. And that applies in the commercial realm. It applies on the defense side, legacy platforms, new platforms like LEAP and 9X. And I'd also say that when we talk about our leadership behaviors of humility, transparency, and focus, that really helps undergird all of that work. Because if we have an opportunity to improve, if we miss something, we want folks to come forward, share that with us so we can get after it, get to root cause, and lay in corrective action. So that's really the general approach from a 9X perspective.\nWe do know that that will be a pressure on us in 2024. We're assuming EIS may have 2025. We'll begin to ship engines in the back half of 2024. It's really the beginning of the life cycle for that platform. We're thrilled to be under wing on the 777X. It's an exciting platform, but it will be a financial headwind for us for the foreseeable future as we ramp not only the volumes, but obviously improve the overall cost structure of that business with an eye toward building the installed base and the service annuities. That will come over time.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nSheila, just to add to that on the free cash flow part of your question, you know we've GE9X has been a headwind on free cash flow. Even in 2023 as we started bringing in inventory to start shipping this year, as Larry said, towards the back half of this year. So it'll continue to impact our free cash flow negatively to some extent, but it's not a material driver overall as you've seen, you know, greater than $5 billion of free cash flow for 2024, including absorption of the corporate pension, the interest expense.\nThat you saw. Still feel pretty good about the free cash flow for 2024, and the GE9X is not a material driver of the free cash flow for the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi. Yes, good morning, Andrew. Good morning. Yeah, good morning. Just one last time for me for GE. But yeah, a question for Rahul. Maybe just if you gave us an overview for the company into the Q1, but maybe just detail by business for GE, into the Q1, a little bit more color.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nThanks. Sure, Andrew. So if you look at the Q1 guidelines, you know Aerospace is going to start the year strong revenue up mid teens with the commercial growth rates in the Q1 kind of in line with what we are projecting for full year, and the margins on a business as usual, you know, kind of pre all the standalone expenses, we do expect margins to be flat to slightly up for the Q1 on a year over year basis for Aerospace. For Renewables, as Scott said, there will be profit improvement during the year, but that improvement will be more back end loaded. As we start converting the higher margin onshore wind orders that Scott referenced in his prepared remarks, we start shipping those orders that we got in 2023 into H2 2024.\nSo there's a little bit of lag between order to revenue conversion, and so the renewables improvement will be more back end loaded. The Q1 for renewables will look a lot like the Q4 for renewables. So think about roughly in the same zone, and for power, typical seasonality with low single digit growth, some margin expansion year over year in the Q1. But just one other point I want to make on the Q1 is that given that both Vernova and Aerospace teams are fully staffed up to become standalone public companies, and we are operating with a very, very small corporate staff, and the historic corporate expense will now be fully absorbed in the two businesses, and the corporate expense in Q1 will be effectively zero. So majority of that expense going to Aerospace, you know, and the balance to Vernova.\nBut the way to think about Q1 margins for both companies is just as we think through after absorption of incremental cost, and you know, just given in line with the reported margin guidance that we provided for full year. So that's the way to think about the Q1 margins.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan.\n\nScott Strazik\n\nCEO, General Electric Vernova\n\nHey, thanks very much and good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nGood morning Seth.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nI don't want to kind of.you know, you've just given us the 2024 guidance, so I apologize for jumping ahead here. But when we think about the margin cadence in aerospace, you know, apples to apples, kind of flattish as we go from 2023 to 2024, when you think about going to kind of the 20% that you talked about for 2025, how do we think about the key drivers as we bridge that?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nYeah, sure, Seth. Listen, let's start with a really strong 2023, right? $1.3 billion of profit growth, 90 basis points of margin expansion, and better than what we said back in March, right, when we were expecting $5.5 billion of profit, flat margins year over year. So 2023 is shaped up a lot better than what we initially expected back in March. Now, as you look forward to 2024, I know you kind of skipped over that here, but double digit profit growth.\nIn 2024 with the OE ramp 9s introduction kind of pressuring the margin rate. But it is exactly the step that we had thought in our minds on how 2024 would look when we were sitting back in March and we had said, Hey, 2024 will be a step along the way to 2025. Now as we get to 2025, the biggest driver to profit growth between 2024 to 2025 will be the benefit from top line improvement. And that is in line with what we've previously said, pricing that offsets inflation and productivity. But mix will continue to be an issue in a LEAP OE volume ramps, LEAP services ramps. And even though LEAP services becomes profitable in 2024, it's still a margin headwind and then 9x volume ramps in 2025 as well.\nSo if you think about 2025, recall, we had said 7.5, $7.6 to $8 billion of profit on the current GE reporting, which translates to roughly about 20% margins, and layering in about $0.5 billion of standalone public company expenses, EHNs cost, all the other things, we are thinking $7.1 to $7.6 billion of profit for 2025, which is in line with what we said back in March, just adjusted for the incremental expenses. And we'll come back to that.\nAnd talk more in March.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nGood morning everyone.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nHey Andy.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nAndy. Good morning.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nScott. Maybe in terms of your 2024 margin expectations for Vernova, could you give us a little more color on the components? I think you mentioned onshore can reach high single-digit margins with the second half ramp up, which would I think be meaningfully better performance than your initial expectations you set for the business in 24 last year. So does that assume you get through most of your product reliability issues, and has price versus cost just been a bigger driver than you would have thought?\n\nScott Strazik\n\nCEO, General Electric Vernova\n\nAndy? You bet. I mean, if we go back to our original guide in 2024, going back to March, I mean, we're largely in line with the expectations there. But if we take a step back, gas power stronger than our expectations in March, onshore wind and grid are both stronger. And to your point, we talked today about onshore wind being high single digit margins in 2024 and grid being mid single digit margins. Now gas has already gotten to low double digit margins and will continue to accrete. But offshore is tougher than where we were in March and that's challenging a little bit of that strength in our three largest businesses with gas, grid, and onshore representing about 80% of our revenue today. But also taking into account that tough offshore backlog, we've got two more years to execute through that.\nSo when you think about our three largest businesses continuing to be stronger than where we were while we really reduce our offshore backlog from $6 billion to approximately 4 billion in approximately two years to go, we see a clear pathway in 2024 to accrete margin but also then to continue to accrete a margin beyond as we liquidate the rest of the tough economics with offshore in 2025 and then find the oxygen to really share with you. Some of our smaller businesses we don't talk about as much, but you heard Rahul mention earlier the fact that our digital business returned to profitability and we're really excited about some of those areas like grid software that we'll share more with you when we get to 6 March 2024. So those really are the key dynamics of 2023 to 2024.\nLooking a little bit further out than even that.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Electric\n\nLiz, we have time for one last.question.\n\nOperator\n\nThis question will come from the line of Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nHey Scott, good morning.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nRahul, you touched on it a bit in your answer to Seth's question, but can you give a bit more detail on the flat margins implied for GE Aerospace in 2024? And then for Larry, I was hoping you can give an update on your capital allocation priorities for 2024 including how share purchases fit in relative to debt pay down. Thank you.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, General Electric\n\nYeah, sure Scott. So you know, as we look forward to 2024, I think it's going to be another strong year, right? We've guided to six and a half, you know, $6.6 to $7.1 billion of profit on a current basis and then $6 to $6.5 billion on a standalone basis. This is after including, you know, EH&S other public company expenses including what $100 million to support the wind down of GE corporate office which will now be with us kind of through Q2. So this implies about a $750 million of profit growth or low double digit at the midpoint of that growth.\nMargins we do expect those margins to be flat, about 2 points of margin pressure that we are expecting. More than half a point of that is coming from LEAP OE ramp, introduction of 9X engines, and the strong LEAP services growth. And as I said to Seth earlier, even though LEAP services is turning profitable just as we would have expected, it is still negatively impacting the margins. And the rest of that two-point headwind is coming from incremental R&D to support further improvement in LEAP durability, introduction of 9X, and then develop the next generation of product for the future of flight. This margin pressure is completely offset with benefit from volume productivity, the strong Services growth that we are expecting.\nSo overall, again, it's a step that is in line with our expectations that we had laid out for the medium-term outlook in March of 2023. Larry?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nScott, I don't know if you asked that relative to my GE role or my aerospace role. I suspect the latter, but just with the GE hat on for a moment, really no change at this point. We really want to make sure we see through the spin, as I think both Rahul and Scott talked at the outset, feeling very good about Vernova's prospects here to be investment grade, confident in that outlook, and we want to see that through, set up both businesses. We will in early March in New York share more at each of the investor days as to how we're thinking about the not only the capital structures but the capital allocation strategies for both businesses.\nI think at Aerospace you should assume that we're going to have a compelling dividend, that buybacks are going to be an important part of that overall effort beyond just covering dilution. And we'll certainly look to do meaningful value accretive M and A, the mix, the timing, those details to come. I really want the GE Aerospace board to have more time with those important questions. But we're looking forward to moving beyond deleveraging, playing more offense at Aerospace. And I think while Scott's got a different hand to play, they're going to look to continue to certainly invest in organically in the opportunities that they have around the energy transtion. Thank you.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, General Electric\n\nLiz. Before we wrap, I want to remind folks that GE Aerospace will report GE's Q1 results in late April with GE Vernova holding a separate call as a result, like we did with GE Healthcare. We'll focus our comments in late April on Aerospace leaving GE Vernova commentary to Scott and his team. Larry, any final comments?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, General Electric\n\nSteve, thanks. Just to close the call, again, the teams delivered in 2023, both Aerospace and Vernova. We're really looking forward to what's ahead for both companies as independent entities before that day in early April. We hope to see many of you at the Investor Days in March. We appreciate your time today, your investment, and support ofGE.Ge.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Liz, and I will be your conference coordinator today. If you experience issues with the webcast slides refreshing or there appears to be delays in the slide advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE\n\nThanks Liz. Welcome to GE's Q3 2023 earnings call. I'm joined by Chairman and CEO Larry Culp and CFO Rahul Ghai. Some of the statements we're making are forward looking and based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes. Over to Larry.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE\n\nSteve, thank you and good morning everyone. Before we start, I want to reiterate that the GE team stands firmly with.Our employees, customers, and all those impacted.By the brutal Hamas attacks on Israel in the subsequent war. Our priority has been the safety ofGE employees in the region. We're doing everything possible to support them and their families.Last week, GE announced a $500,000 contribution to help with the humanitarian efforts for the many people in Israel, Gaza, and the surrounding areas impacted by these horrific events.Terrorism has no place in our society. Like so many, I'm devastated by the loss of lives, violence, and suffering of innocent people.\nTurning to the quarter, GE delivered a very strong performance and we're raising full-year guidance again. GE Aerospace continues to experience rapid growth driven by robust demand and solid execution largely in commercial engines and services. Another significant quarter for the team Our fleet of 41,000 commercial engines and.26,000 rotorcraft and combat engines continues to expand as we work to define the future of flight.\nToday we're navigating a still challenging supply chain environment to deliver for and support our customers. Year to date, commercial engine deliveries are.Up 30% across GE and Safran's MRO shops. This quarter we've improved LEAP quick turn shop visits over 30% year over year.And sequentially.For tomorrow, we're building our backlog and sales pipeline during unprecedented industry growth.\nRecently Air Canada ordered 36 GEnx-1B engines plus four spares. Building on GEnx's rich history is the.Fastest selling high thrust engine with over 50 million flight hours.For the future, we're investing in R and D and developing next-generation technologies.\nFor example, we're advancing full system testing for our hybrid electric systems at our Electric Power Center in Ohio.We're also collaborating with industry partners and NASA on an EcoDemonstrator program to measure sustainable aviation fuel impact on the environment, particularly high altitude emissions.\nOur growth opportunities extend beyond commercial. In defense, we're pleased the US Army.has accepted the first two T901 flight test engines for the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft prototypes. The T901 will also upgrade the US.Army's Apache and Black Hawk helicopters, providing 50% more power, reduced life cycle costs Lower fuel consumption. We've been selected for development work.On the cockpit voice and flight data recorder systems for the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft program.\nNext generation programs like these demonstrate how.GE's rotorcraft programs enable the military and our allies to take on more challenging missions today and in the future.We're pleased to see Congress recognizing.This important work by including funding for advanced engine development like the XA100 in both the House and Senate fiscal year 2024 defense appropriation bills.\nHowever, even with these strong results, we're far from satisfied. Through our lean transformation, we're making real.Progress improving flow and eliminating waste. For example, our team in Pune, India.Has increased output of LEAP high pressure turbine manifolds by 3x. But we need to do more, as do our suppliers. Given the pace of demand for both.Aftermarket services and new engine deliveries, there are pockets of improvement now. Material input increased double digits sequentially supporting spare parts delivery, which was up significantly year over year. We're working within our own plants and in partnership with our suppliers to deliver sequential improvements in output and turnaround times day by day, week by week.\nOver to GE Vernova, where performance is strengthening pre-spin at both renewable energy and power. Customers continue to invest in the energy transition, driving meaningful demand for our products and services. Grid and now onshore wind were both profitable this quarter, and we expect improved performance from here. Grid customers are increasing their infrastructure investments. Globally to connect renewables and improve reliability.\nYear to date, orders remain strong at more than three times revenue and with higher margins, which will support profitable growth through the decade. We've also increased selectivity, streamlined cost, and rationalized our industrial footprint, tracking toward full year profitability at GE Vernova.\nI really like the way the grid Team is using Lean to drive this turnaround and to deliver profitable growth.For example, across Power Transmission's 14 sites.Globally, we've reduced lead time by roughly 15% year to date and we're targeting a 20% reduction by year end.\nNow at Onshore, our strategy to focus.on fewer markets, pivoting more toward North America, where GE Vernova is the market leader, is working, and we're relying more on our workhorse products now representing 70% of equipment volume this quarter. These shifts are translating to 700 basis points of higher margins in backlog this year. We're still driving cost out fewer layers.Reducing headcount and empowering leaders closest to the operators.\nFinally, we're improving fleet reliabilityWe're now halfway through our enhancement program.In the field and expect to be roughly 60% complete by year end.As expected, offshore wind remains difficult this year with losses of roughly $1 billion in 2023.\nNext year we expect offshore will have similar losses but substantially improved cash performance. It's a tough $6 billion backlog that we're working our way through, which.We expect to largely complete over the next two or three years.\nMeanwhile, we're making operational progress with rising availability on the 800 installed MW of our 6 MW platform. Electricity is now being produced at Dogger Bank and we recently had the installation of our first Haliade-X turbines at Vineyard Wind.\nLooking forward, we've expanded Vic Abate's role to CEO of the entire wind business to leverage our progress in onshore and offshore.We're taking a similarly disciplined approach to. Writing new business like we've done over at Gas Onshore and Grid, with increased rigor on pricing terms, geographic exposure, and other risks. All in all, given power's continued strength and with our two largest businesses in.Renewables, grid, and now onshore delivering, plus our plan for offshore, we're highly confident.In successfully spinning off GE Vernova early.In Q2.\nAcross GE, I'm pleased with how we're operating as a simpler, more focused business at both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova.Another strong quarter, but plenty more to do.My thanks go out to the team for their dedication and commitment to serving our customers.\nIt's been nearly two years since we.Announced our intention to create three independent.Investment grade industry leaders, and now we're.Closing in on the final step.\nToday we announced plans to spin off GE Vernova and launch GE Aerospace in the beginning of Q2 2024.Both will be listed on the New.York Stock Exchange with GE Vernova as GEV and GE Aerospace carrying forward under GE.\nWe've made some important hires. Promotions to ensure we have the best teams leading these businesses forward At GE Aerospace, we've completed the functional. Leadership team, naming our heads of Corporate Affairs, Human Resources, legal, and treasury with experienced leaders from inside and outside. At GE Vernova, we added seasoned public company CFO Ken Parks. As I mentioned a moment ago, Vic Abate is now CEO of the Wind business.\nWe've also further simplified and strengthened our.Balance sheet by redeeming the remainder of our preferred equity and selling a portion of our AerCap shares for $2.7 billion of proceeds.Our balance sheet is well positioned to support the launch of two investment grade companies.\nWe're approaching some key spin milestones. GE Vernova will file a confidential Form.10 shortly, with the initial public filing.Expected in Q1.\nSoon we'll announce each company's Board of Directors and in early March, GE Vernova and GE Aerospace plan to hold investor.Days.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP Investor Relations, GE\n\nBuilding on our success at GE Healthcare, we're exactly where we want to be at the end of October for both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova.Now over to Rahul for more detail on our results.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE\n\nThank you, Larry.\nTurning to Slide 4, I'll speak to the quarter on an organic basis. Overall, we delivered meaningful growth across our headline metrics. Orders were up double digits, with services up 15%, driven by commercial aerospace, and equipment up 22%, with growth in all segments. Revenue increased 18%, benefiting from strong market demand, improved execution, and pricing. Aerospace was led by commercial services and engines. Renewables was led by grid and offshore and power from heavy-duty gas turbines, and aeroderivatives.\nAll segments contributed to adjusted margin expansion of 760 basis points. This included the absence of last year's wind-related charges and the benefits of volume, price net of inflation and productivity continued investments in growth.\nAdjusted EPS was $0.82, up almost $1 year over year. Excluding last year's wind-related charges. Adjusted margin still expanded 400 basis points, and EPS was up $0.59, or more than triple what we delivered last year. We generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow, up roughly $1 billion, largely driven by earnings. Working capital was a positive $400 million flow driven by Disciplined Receivables Management, while inventory remained inflated due to continued supply chain challenges.\nYear to date, free cash flow was $2.2 billion, up $2.5 billion, reflecting higher earnings, reduced working capital, and improved linearity. Switching to corporate results, improved significantly due to energy, financial services gain on sale from investments, and higher interest income.\nAlso, as we prepare to reduce costs as we prepare to become the standalone businesses for the year, we now expect expenses in the $500 million range at insurance, we completed our annual review of liability cash flow assumptions under the new accounting standard.\nThis resulted in an immaterial adjustment to earnings, indicating claims experience is consistent with our models. Given GE Aerospace's strength and GE Vernova's improvement, we are raising full year guidance and now expecting revenue growth of low teens up from low double digits. Adjusted EPS of $2.55 to 2.65, up $0.40 at the midpoint, largely from improvement in operating profit that we now expect to be in a range of $5.2 to 5.5 billion and free cash flow of $4.7 to 5.1 billion, up $550 million.\nAt the midpoint, largely from higher earnings and lower AD&A outflow now spending a moment on each business. Starting with GE Aerospace, demand remains robust with GE and CFM deliveries growing mid-teens year-over-year. Orders were up 34% with strong growth in both equipment and services.\nRevenue was up 25%, led by commercial engines and services up 29% and defense growing 8%. Profit grew over $400 million or more than 30%. Notably margins expanded 120 basis points to reach 20.4%. Higher services volume and pricing net of inflation more than offset investments and adverse mix in our commercial business. Services strength continued to drive profit, with services revenue up 31% from volume, pricing.\nHeavier work scopes. External spare parts were up more than 35% and internal shop visits grew 2% with supply chain constraints impacting growth. Commercial engines revenue grew 23% with LEAP deliveries up 12% year over year.\nWe are now planning for a 40 to 45% increase in LEAP deliveries this year, down from our 50% target at the beginning of the year.We now expect OE revenue to grow low to mid-20s, and services revenue to be up mid to high-20s for the year. In Defense, book-to-build remains strong this quarter, again greater than 1 and 1.3x year to date.\nHighlighting the strong demand, environment, and quality of our franchisees revenue grew high single digits with strength in Services and Edison Works offsetting lower unit deliveries. Based on GE Aerospace's year to date. Strength, we are raising revenue growth through the low 20s, and profit to be about $6 billion, up roughly $1.2 billion year over year, with free cash flow growth trending better than prior expectations.\nMoving to GE Vernova, Lean along with better underwriting selectivity and productivity is delivering stronger results.We mentioned earlier at grid, and now onshore at renewables. Orders grew again, up 3% this quarter.Up more than 80% year to date to nearly $18 billion.\nGrid orders increased over 50% this quarter, and while primarily an equipment business, today we are starting to grow grid services. That was up double digits this quarter in onshore North American equipment orders for the quarter were up nearly 40%, and year to date are up more than 2.5x over prior year.\nThe IRA continues to be transformative, establishing multi-year US demand visibility for future growth. Internationally, onshore orders were down meaningfully, but at better margins, consistent with our strategy of greater selectivity.\nRevenue grew 14%, grid increased with double Digit growth at each business. At onshore, North American equipment growth was. More than offset by lower repower and international equipment. At offshore, revenue more than tripled year over year, and grew sequentially with higher nacelle output.Profit improved from our turnaround efforts, excluding last year's elevated reserve.Renewables margin still expanded roughly 600 basis points driven by continued price and productivity.\nOnshore and grid margins expanded due to price and productivity, and grid margins also benefited from additional volume. For the year, renewables now expects low double-digit revenue growth.We are maintaining the guidance for significantly. Better year over year profit with onshore and grid improvement more than offsetting the offshore pressure. Turning to power, we delivered solid year over year revenue growth and margin expansion with seasonally lower outages.\nEquipment orders grew slightly as higher heavy duty gas turbines more than offset lower aeroderivative units. Services declined slightly as high single digit. Growth in gas transactional services was offset by aeroderivative and steam services. For the year, we still expect total services orders to grow low single digits.Revenue grew 9%, largely on price and Higher scope on heavy-duty gas turbine and aeroderivative equipment. Services grew again, up low single digits. Profit grew roughly 60% with 200 basis points of margin expansion driven by higher volume, pricing, and productivity, which more than offset inflation pressure. Year to date, power orders have grown low single digits.\nRevenue mid single digits and margins have Expanded over 100 basis points. This was led by services, including higher gas utilization, up low single digits Benefiting from a continued coal to gas switching, we also shipped 9 HA units this year and now have more than 47 GW of installed capacity.\nContinuing to extend our aftermarket services billings to $1 billion by mid-2020s. In the fourth quarter, power is well.Positioned for sequential profit growth from seasonally higher services volume for the year. Power continues to expect low single-digit revenue growth, with better year-over-year profit. Taken together, for GE Vernova, we are now expecting high single-digit revenue growth.Profit improvement of over $800.Million year over year.At the midpoint, we're raising the low. End of our profit guidance driven by both renewables and power now expect negative $300 million to negative $100 million of operating profit.\nAs we continue to expect flat to slightly improved free cash flow. Overall, we are really encouraged, proving with grid and onshore that we can deliver better results. This combined with Power's continued strong performance will drive meaningful profit and Cash Flow Improvement at GE Vernova next year.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Larry, Rahul.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE\n\nThank you. To summarize, GE Aerospace grew rapidly again as GE Vernova Renewables improved sequentially power continued to do well overall. A very strong quarter for GE. One that gives us confidence, and thus allows us to raise our full year guide. More importantly, we're poised to launch two innovative, global, service-focused industry leaders in less than six months. I'm proud of our team and even.More excited for what lies ahead. Steve, let's go to Q and A.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE\n\nBefore we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question.We can get to as many people as possible.Liz, please open the line.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone. If you wish to withdraw your question, or your question has already been answered, please press star one one again.\nOur first question comes from the line of Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector, Aerospace, and Defense Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning. Good morning. Rahul, is the lower LEAP delivery guide a function of softer narrow body deliveries at the airframers, or is this more related to challenges to your own production ramp up, and then how should we think about the impact of 2024? Thank you.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE\n\nYeah, let me start. Larry, I'm sure can add here.\nIt's primarily a function of our own.\nSupply chain challenges that we are having internally. You know, as we look at our supply chain environment, while we're working extremely hard, we are seeing an improvement in total material inflow. Supplier delinquencies still remain high.\nActually, we're up sequentialy about 25% from Q2 to Q3.\nThat is impacting our output on the other end. You know, for next year we're.\nStill expecting 40% to 45% improvement in LEAP deliveries from where we end this year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Morning, Nigel, just one question. Hi guys. I think, Larry, you mentioned offshore losses of about $1 billion this year. I think you mentioned similar next year.\nIs there still a pathway to breakeven to profit for renewables next year?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE\n\nYeah, you know, I would say, Nigel.\nWe're really pleased overall with renewables again, with onshore turning profitable in the quarter, with grid now profitable two quarters in a row, with the prospect of being profitable, I think, for the full year.\nThat really, I think, sets us up very well.\nOffshore will be difficult. That's what's behind those underlying numbers for this year and for next. I do think we're making the operational progress that we talked about, both the 6 MW and the new projects with Dogger Bank and with Vineyard.\nIt is a problematic financial profile. We'll work our way through the $6.\nBillion backlog over the next couple of years as we indicated. I think with the progress and the momentum we've got in grid, and with onshore, with power as well, we should deliver sequential improvement in profitability from here. Offshore will be difficult.\nI think what we're encouraged by, though is that the application of what we've done in the other businesses around selectivity? Is really relevant here.\nWe know the industry is ready for a reset. You've seen that in the comments from a number of folks in New York State over the last couple of weeks as well. We think we can make a much better business with offshore wind.\nWe're staring at some challenges that we need to address here in the fourth quarter and in 2024 for sure.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nVP and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning everyone.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE\n\nMorning.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE\n\nGood morning.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nVP and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nI wonder maybe Larry or Rahul.\nIf you could talk about the aftermarket expectations. You know, you said mid to high 20s this year, maybe kind of how that's changed or if it's changed between internal shop visits and spares, and then kind of, you know, how we interpret the big sequential growth in spares during the quarter? You know, is that a new sustainable level? Was that driven by pre buy ahead of a price increase? Is it mostly, you know, is it driven by the price increase itself? Maybe just to level set expectations on aftermarket?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE\n\nYeah. Let's start with the second part of the question first, Seth, and we'll go back to where you started. On the spare part revenue, spare part revenue was up about 35% or more than 35% this quarter.\nI would say three main things: volume, pricing, and increased work scope.\nYou know, volume growth continues from mid-teens departures in the quarter, and then stronger departure growth in the first half.\nWhich leads to volume in the third quarter. Also, keep in mind that it's less of a challenge to kind of ship spare parts versus completing a shop visitor or an engine that also helps with shipping spareparts when the volume is strong.\nThe second part I would say going.\nBack to pricing, we implemented a high single-digit price increase this quarter. We had pulled forward the price increase from the fourth quarter to the third quarter, so we got a couple of months of incremental price in the quarter, and then combine that with what Larry's been pushing for the last 12 to 18 months is just very, very strong pricing discipline.\nIt's not just about implementing a.\nPrice increase, it's also about managing the implementation of that price increase. I think we're doing a better job of that. The last thing I would say is the work scopes have been heavier both on the narrow bodies and on the wide bodies. Wide bodies, they're coming back to kind of second shop visits narrow bodies is primarily a phenomenon of customers kind of trying to constrain spending in challenging times, especially in China last year, as they're a little bit more cash, the departure is growing, their work scopes are increasing. I would say those are the three main levers of higher speed spare parts growth in the quarter, which was more than 35%.\nI would not attribute any of that to pre-CLP buy now as you look forward to the first part of your question between spare parts growth and shop visits, spare parts I would say are strong. We expect kind of mid-20s growth in the fourth quarter here, which will be in line with where the departures are, shop visits. I think for the year we are in that kind of low teens to mid teens category. I think that's what we are thinking right now given how challenging supply chain has been. You know, shop visits were up.\nA couple of points in the third quarter. We think, you know, for the year we kind of in the low teens to mid-teens range.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Morning.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE\n\nMorning, Julian.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE\n\nMorning.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nMaybe it's my question around.\nRenewables and sort of fully understand the offshore backlog, maybe just wanted to focus on.\nA couple of other things.\nOne was are you seeing any shift in the kind of new orders or new equipment orders picture in renewables just because it seems a tougher environment for project development and financing in general across different industries? Just wondered if your perspective on that had changed for the coming quarters, and sort of allied to that because of the working capital dynamics of renewables with customer advances and so on. Any thoughts around sort of what level of cash balance Vernova should have upon spin, and sort of any mix of GE versus external financing for that or funding for that cash balance?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE\n\nSure. Well, to start with, I think what we have seen through the course of the year, again, particularly with onshore and grid, is just.\nIncredibly healthy demand, despite the rate environment. Obviously, the incentives here, the incentives in Europe, the push with respect to the energy transition at large, really has kept us very busy. No change really whatsoever with respect to our commentary in that regard.\nI think as we look into the fourth quarter, as we look into 2024, any one project can move for various reasons, but I think we continue to.\nBe quite optimistic about the underlying demand that we see in those businesses. We know offshore has its own dynamics. Again, to the reset comment I made a moment ago, by and large, I think we're feeling very good about the demand environment.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE\n\nRight.\nJust to add to that, Julian, not only is the demand environment good.\nAs Larry kind of mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are seeing better.\nPricing and the selectivity, the strategy that.\nScott, Larry, Vic, or everybody's been pushing, come through our grid backlog. Margins were up about 3 points, and onshore backlog margins were up about 7 points in the quarter.\nThat should obviously help with through.\nThe turnaround efforts in 2024.\nStrong demand environment, good pricing on the renewables orders. Now switching to your second question on the cash balance. First and foremost, we do expect both.\nVernova Aerospace to be investment grade at spin. Right. That's kind of priority number one. As we announced back in September.\nThat we do expect that Vernova will.\nSpin in a net cash position.\nWe're working through our framework on.\nExactly what that number looks like. Obviously, what we want to do is you want to make sure that both.\nCompanies have enough operating cash at the time of spin.\nIn addition, what will also happen is, as you probably noticed in our 10-Q, we have about $2 billion of restricted.\nCash, and most of that is with.\nVernova right now as we think about where that cash balance is. As we think about the cash balances that spin, it'll be the restricted cash for both businesses, plus the operating needs of that business. There's enough cash on the balance sheet at GE to make sure that this happens.\nWe definitely don't need to tap.\nInto any external markets to make sure that both companies have enough cash at spending.\nWe'll give you an update as we get closer to spin.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\nGood morning, Larry and Rahul.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE\n\nMorning.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nSteve, maybe if I could ask about aerospace margins, you know, same as last quarter, very good. 194 year to date above 20% in the quarter just helped lift the guide up, which still implies a sequential step down. You know, the OE mix headwind with the 450 leads in the fourth quarter to hit the 1,650 is I guess a lot of it. Do you still expect 250 basis points of OE headwind this year? How does that filter into 2024 and the break even by 2026?\nThank you.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE\n\nOkay.\nIt's a multipart question, Sheila. I'm going to try to remember everything. If I forget, just please jump in here. You're right, I think we had a good quarter. 25% revenue growth, $400 million of profit growth, 120 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter continue to give us.\nConfidence to raise the year. What we did in the quarter.\nAs you saw in the guide, we raised the guide for the year by about $500 million of revenue, slightly more than $250 million of profit.\nAbout a 50% drop through for the incremental revenue.\nObviously, part of that is the higher services revenue, lower OE revenue that you referenced. As you kind of think about now what the fourth quarter looks like, as you go from third quarter to the fourth quarter, there is about $200 million of incremental OE revenue.\nEven though services revenue is still.\nStrong kind of mid teens, it is a lower sequential growth just given the.\nTiming of the spare parts shipment. That's impacting the quarterly margin dynamic a little bit. Having said all that, we still.\nExpecting low 20s% revenue growth in the year for GE Aerospace or a.\n$1.2 to 1.3 billion of profit.\nClose to a point of margin expansion as we end the year. It'll be a really, really good year. Now, as you pointed out, LEAP delivery is a little bit lighter than we had initially expected. Still, a pretty substantial ramp in the fourth quarter. We are expecting, based on the revised guidance that we just provided, about 15% growth from Q3 to Q4.\nA pretty big ramp year over year. Now some of the LEAP deliveries have.\nPushed out into 2024 and 2025.\nAs we think about the outer.\nYear margins, we had guided to about a point of margin headwind from LEAP.\nBetween 23% to 25%.\nThat would just be marginally higher.\nJust movement of LEAP engine shipments from 2023 to 2024. I don't know if I covered all the questions.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE\n\nGood morning, Deane.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nI was hoping we could get some.\nComments on the upside in free cash flow this quarter and the progress that you're making in having free cash flow more linear through the year. Looks like that's working. Any comments on the dynamics we should expect for free cash flow in the fourth quarter, any puts or takes.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE\n\nWell, Dean, thanks for noticing.\nRight. To be up a billion dollars in the quarter year over year, to be at, what, $2.2 billion here year to date. This was the time of the year in years past where we were kind of holding our breath waiting for all the cash flow in the year to come in, in the fourth quarter. I think what you see again is a much more linear approach to running the business, coupled with obviously steady demand through the course of the year, both at Aero and across Vernova. Much of what we've tried to do in moving away operationally from the year-end dynamics, let alone the.\nQuarter-end dynamics, I think, has borne some fruit.\nWe are far from a, shall I say, a perfectly level, loaded business at both Aerospace and Vernova. We know as we continue to make progress there will not only be the positive cash effects that you're pointing at, frankly, there's a lot of cost.\nWe think we can pull out over.\nTime as well as we drive greater linearity and have less month-end, quarter-end, year-end sprints, which we know we can do, but we rarely do efficiently.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE\n\nYeah. For the fourth quarter, just on that number question, just take the 4,751 midpoint, subtract our year-to-date number that Larry mentioned. Dean, you end up with a few billion.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Citigroup\n\nGood morning, guys.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE\n\nGood morning, Andy.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Citigroup\n\nLarry, could you give us more color on how you're thinking about the defense business at this point? It was up high, some digits in the corner. It does seem like you're having a better year this year. Have you turned the corner toward better operating performance in that business? Could you talk about the budgeting environment for that business moving forward?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE\n\nWell, I, Andy, I would say that.\nWe have made some progress, but we are far from satisfied. You clearly saw the high single-digit growth in the quarter, and now year to date, I think we'll be in that zone for the year. The supply chain challenges that we've talked about have made some of our equipment shipments somewhat lumpy, both with respect to our internal process yields and our material availability from our suppliers.\nIs. Still, it is still job one in this business.\nRight. I think if you look at what we've done inside of our own shops, we're really encouraged.\nBy the process improvements.\nThat we've been able to lay in. If you look at some of the delays that are a function of quality internally in the third quarter, we were at our lowest level in the last two years.\nStill plenty to do, that's a lot of progress.\nWe're adding capacity not only in production, but in our test cells, particularly up the road here in Lynn.\nWe have put even more people.\nInto the field with the supply base.\nRahul mentioned earlier some of the delays.\nThat we have seen in terms of on time performance by our suppliers, and that covers an array of commodities, be it just general raw materials, castings, forgings, valves, and the like. There's a lot of work to do to create that flow that Dean and I were talking about a moment ago. I think in terms of the top line environment, again, really encouraged by the progress that we're seeing with FARA, I think we are heartened by what the Congress is poised to do with respect to continuing to support the XA100.\nWe know as we look forward.\nJust given the dynamics in the world.\nThere's going to be plenty of opportunity.\nFor us, both on rotorcraft and in combat, to continue to grow this business. It's a business we don't talk a lot about. It may be a bit overshadowed by commercial, but that's not the way we're operating today.\nI think as we get ready.\nFor the Vernova spin, there'll be more time and attention paid externally on defense.\nI think the team is very.\nMuch looking forward to that.\nDoing a lot of good work, plenty.\nOf opportunities.\nWe need to execute better. Again, we need our suppliers hand in hand in that effort.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE\n\nGood morning.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nHey, could we just talk a little bit more about cash flow and kind of what you're thinking into next year? Like, the spirit of my question, Larry or Rahul, was, you know, we're still dealing with, you know, kind of a sizable difference between actual free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow. I think some of this is warranty and other things working through the system. Can you just elaborate a little bit on, you know, the factors in the disconnect, and can we get to maybe a normalization of these factors as we think about the independent companies in 2024?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE\n\nYeah, let me kind of, let's just spend maybe a minute on our free cash flow here.\nSo you know, first, as you look at our cash for the year, it's a really good year. I mean we're going to generate, you know, $4.9-ish billion of free cash at the midpoint, up from $3.1 billion that we, that we did last year.\nA lot of that is coming from earnings growth. Clearly that is a huge contributor and.\nYou know, that is helped by kind of lower interest payments.\nIf you look at our working.\nCapital performance continues to be really strong this year. I mean you've seen our year to date numbers, you've seen, you know, even as you project that into the fourth quarter, we are doing an exceptional job managing our day sales outstanding. So despite our.\nTop line revenue growth, we are still expecting that overall our AR balance will be neutral. Jeff, and the reason I say that it just kind of shows the opportunities that the business has for continued improvement.\nAnd then progress payments, contract assets continues.\nTo be as positive as well, given the strong growth environment.\nThe part I want to anchor on is a little bit on around inventory.\nGiven the supply chain challenges that we are having. Inventory, as you will see from our.\nQueue was up substantially in the quarter. Now we're expecting it to come down.\nSlightly as we get into the fourth.\nQuarter, but it will still be a substantial inventory build by the end of the year.\nSo, as we look forward into.\n2024 and 2025, that should start getting liquidated with improved supply chain performance.\nSo that is where I would say.\nThat is what gives us the confidence that this will be a continued good cash flow story. Now as you look overall, we'll be at about 160% plus of free cash flow to net income.\nPart of that is amortization.\nBut even if you take amortization out.\nIt's still 130, 130% free cash flow performance.\nSo it's still very, very strong.\nNow on your question, I think most.\nOf that, adjustments below the line are related to spin-related adjustments. I don't think there's anything and insurance.\nSpin-related restructuring costs and expenses, and some of that will obviously continue as we go into 2024 and maybe even a little bit into 2025. But after that, at least the spin and the.\nRestructuring cost should add.\nAnd.\nThe insurance is not a big number.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Multi Industry Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi, I didn't hear. I assume it's me. Good morning.\nGood morning. Okay, so just a question. On onshore wind capacity, how close are you to the maximum capacity in onshore wind? I think in the past we've shipped over 1,000 turbines in a quarter, but there have been capacity reductions. Just trying to understand how close you are to maximum throughput at this point.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE\n\nWith respect to Onshore Andrew?\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Multi Industry Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE\n\nYeah. You know, I would say that when.\nYou look at the backlog that we have and with what's in the sales pipeline.\nI wouldn't say that we are sold out, but there is.\nA limit to what we're going to be able.\nTo deliver in 2024 and 2025. I think our customers are mindful of that. It's a little bit why we have seen, I think, the level of activity thus far this year with an eye to not only deliveries this year, but 2024 and 2025.\nI'm always hesitant, Andrew, to talk about capacity, particularly in a business like this.\nAs truly being fixed because there's so much underlying process improvement that can unleash capacity. It's not strictly a function of, if you will, fixed capital investments that we've made. Not that we would be averse to that, but I think we wanted to really pare down the overall cost structure, not strictly an effort focused on manufacturing capacity, and really put ourselves in position.\nTo grow off a lower cost base.\nDo that in ways that will allow delivery to be an advantage and then gradually, smartly add any fixed capital that we might need. If you look at the underlying performance that the onshore wind team has delivered here in Q3, will deliver in Q4, it is poised to deliver in 2024 and beyond.\nYou see all that coming, coming home, which we're pleased to see, of course.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE\n\nTry to get a couple more in, Liz, if we can squeeze it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning guys. Hey, Joe. Joe. And so just sorry for the multi part question, but I guess just on the timing of the spin, early Q2 or the beginning of Q2. So is it right to expect it ahead of Q1 earnings? And then secondly on the profitability dynamics in both onshore and offshore wind, I'd love to hear any more details around the type of profitability you expect to exit on onshore wind this year. And then also with offshore, it seems like you're shipping more this year and.\nSo that seems to be a.\nGood sign that you're getting through more of your unprofitable backlog. Any comments around that would be helpful as well. Sure. I think to your first question, Joe, the answer is pretty simple.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE\n\nYes, we should be in a.\nPosition to bring forward Vernova ahead of our typical earnings announcement time frame in early in Q2. I would say with respect to onshore wind, again a lot of improvement. It will be a profitable H2, not, unfortunately, a profitable full year.\nWe've got a shot at doing that at grid as I mentioned earlier, but.\nI think as we look at 2024 in onshore, we should be in the low single digit range, with obviously the intention is we go through the budget cycle here in November and December to.\nSee if we can't put together a.\nCredible plan to do better. But that's the way I would think about it just given the back half.\nMomentum that we'll have entering into next year.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE\n\nJoe, just to kind of complete.\nThat picture, on renewables total, as Larry said, we expect at least onshore to be at least kind of low single digit margins.\nGrid would be kind of mid single digit range. Offshore, as Larry said in his prepared.\nRemarks.\nWe expect similar levels of losses next year. But if you put all that together.\nIt's still a pretty significant improvement year.\nover year on both profit and then even more so on cash. So that's what we're expecting. So you know we won't be too far off from the framework that Scott laid out at Investor Day for the renewables business.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE\n\nJoe, just to make sure we're.\nClear about the shipments, the progress that you're seeing at Dogger Bank and Vineyard Wind, operationally I think we're pleased to see that. I know our customers are to see those initial installations and the initial generation of power, however. Right. That progress is what triggers the revenue recognition, which in turn carries the losses.\nSo that's a little bit of what.\nIs operationally encouraging, but financially difficult to work our way through. So just wanted to clarify that point.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE\n\nLiz, let's make time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThis question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\nI'm assuming you can hear me.\nI wanted to follow up on aviation.\nMargins, which continue to outpace expectations. So I understand the mix headwinds are coming through maybe a bit more muted as the service business is doing better. But it also sounds like price, cost, and just efficiency continues to work in the company's favor. Can you talk about some of the.\nCompany specific actions that have been boosting or helping segment margins outside of just mix.\nDoes the current strength you're seeing change the way you think about the 20% target for 2025?\nThank you.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE\n\nSo you're right.\nI mean, there's lots of really good stuff happening in the company. You know, the price is clearly a positive for us. It was a positive price cost positive in 2022 in aerospace will be price.\nCost positive in 2023 in Aerospace.\nNot.\nOnly at the overall company level, but even at commercial and at defense.\nSo that you know, the business is doing really well on kind of getting the price increases and managing the inflation.\nWe made progress on productivity as well.\nSo that's the other part.\nNot to the extent that we would.\nHave liked, but it is progress and.\nWe are encouraged by even the underlying.\nProgress on productivity that is currently sitting in our inventory numbers that will roll through next year. So there is positive momentum on productivity. So all that is a positive. And as you think about kind of the 20% margin number for 2025, obviously.\nWe're still at the end of 2023.\nSo it's a couple of years away. But as you think about where we're going to end the year to 2025, we're going to end the year, call it a $6 billion of profit. We said between, call it between $6 and $8 billion of profit for 2025. So we still have a billion-ish of profit growth every year between 2024 and 2025. So that's a mid-teens profit growth which is pretty good.\nThe benefits of volume, price, productivity.\nWill be partially offset by this LEAP.\nHeadwind that you spoke about.\nWe start shipping 9X as well. So 9X, that's going to create some incremental pressure, and then we'll continue to invest in R&D. So that's.\nThe construct to get to the 20% margins.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE\n\nSo, Larry, any final comments?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE\n\nSteve, thank you.\nJust to close, appreciate everybody's time today.\nObviously very strong performance so far this year. A lot of progress toward the launches of both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova.\nAnd frankly I've never been more confident in our company's future.\nWe appreciate your time today and your.\nInvestment and support of our company.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\n[Audio Playing]\nGood day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Electric Q3 2023 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Liz, and I will be your conference coordinator today. If you experience issues with the webcast slides refreshing or there appears to be delays in the slide advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE\n\nThanks Liz.\nWelcome to GE's Q3 2023 earnings call. I'm joined by Chairman and CEO Larry Culp and CFO Rahul Ghai. Some of the statements we're making are forward looking and based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website. Those elements may change as the world changes. Over to Larry.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE",
    "content2": "Steve, thank you and good morning everyone. Before we start, I want to reiterate.\nThat the GE team stands firmly with.\nOur employees, customers, and all those impacted.\nBy the brutal Hamas attacks on Israel in the subsequent war. Our priority has been the safety of.\nGE employees in the region.\nWe're doing everything possible to support them and their families.\nLast week GE announced a $500,000 contribution to help with the humanitarian efforts for the many people in Israel, Gaza, and the surrounding areas impacted.\nBy these horrific events. Terrorism has no place in our society.\nLike so many, I'm devastated by the loss of lives, violence, and suffering of innocent people.\nTurning to the quarter, GE delivered a.\nVery strong performance and we're raising full year guidance again.\nGE Aerospace continues to experience rapid growth driven by robust demand and solid execution largely in commercial engines and services. Another significant quarter for the team.\nOur fleet of 41,000 commercial engines and 26,000 rotorcraft and combat engines continues to.\nExpand as we work to define the future of flight.\nToday, we're navigating a still challenging supply.\nLean environment to deliver for and support our customers.\nYear to date, commercial engine deliveries are.\nUp 30% across GE and Safran's MRO shops.\nThis quarter, we've improved LEAP quick-turn shop visits over 30% year over year and sequentially.\nFor tomorrow, we're building our backlog and.\nSales pipeline during unprecedented industry growth.\nRecently, Air Canada ordered 36 GEnx-1B.\nEngines plus four spares. Building on GEnx's rich history, it's the.\nFastest selling high thrust engine with over.\n50 million flight hours.\nFor the future, we're investing in R and D and developing next generation technologies.\nFor example, we're advancing full system testing.\nFor our hybrid electric systems at our Electric Power Center in Ohio, we're also collaborating with industry partners and NASA on an EcoDemonstrator program to measure sustainable aviation fuel impact on the environment, particularly high-altitude emissions.\nOur growth opportunities extend beyond commercial. In defense, we're pleased the US Army.\nHas accepted the first two T901 flight.\nTest engines for the future attack reconnaissance aircraft prototypes. The T901 will also upgrade the US.\nArmy's Apache and Black Hawk helicopters, providing 50% more power, reduced life cycle costs, and lower fuel consumption.\nWe've been selected for development work.\nOn the cockpit voice and flight data recorder systems for the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft program.\nNext generation programs like these demonstrate how.\nGE's rotorcraft programs enable the military and.\nOur allies to take on more challenging.\nMissions today and in the future.\nWe're pleased to see Congress recognizing.\nThis important work, by including funding for advanced engine development like the XA100 in both the House and Senate fiscal year 2024 defense appropriation bills.\nHowever, even with these strong results, we're far from satisfied. Through our lean transformation, we're making real progress improving flow and eliminating waste. For example, our team in Pune, India.\nHas increased output of LEAP high pressure turbine manifolds by 3x.\nBut we need to do more, as do our suppliers. Given the pace of demand for both.\nAftermarket services and new engine deliveries. There are pockets of improvement now.\nMaterial input increased double digits sequentially supporting.\nSpare parts delivery, which was up significantly year over year. We're working within our own plants and in partnership with our suppliers to deliver sequential improvements in output turnaround times day by day, week by week.\nOver to GE Vernova where performance is strengthening.\nPre-spin, at both renewable energy and power, customers continue to invest in the energy transition, driving meaningful demand for our products and services.\nGrid and now onshore wind were both.\nProfitable this quarter, and we expect improved performance from here.\nGrid customers are increasing their infrastructure investments.\nGlobally to connect renewables and improve reliability.\nYear to date, orders remain strong at.\nMore than 3x revenue and with higher margins, which will support profitable growth through the decade.\nWe've also increased selectivity, streamlined cost and.\nRationalized our industrial footprint, tracking toward full year profitability at grid.\nI really like the way the grid.\nTeam is using Lean to drive this.\nTurnaround and to deliver profitable growth. For example, across Power Transmission's 14 sites.\nGlobally, we've reduced lead time by roughly 15% year to date, and we're targeting a 20% reduction by year end.\nNow, at onshore, our strategy to focus.\nOn fewer markets, pivoting more toward North America, we're where GE Vernova is the market leader, is working and we're relying more on our workhorse products now representing 70% of equipment volume this quarter.\nThese shifts are translating to 700 basis points of higher margins in backlog this year. We're still driving cost out, fewer layers, reducing headcount, and empowering leaders closest to the operators.\nFinally, we're improving fleet reliability. We're now halfway through our enhancement program in the field and expect to be roughly 60% complete by year end.\nAs expected, offshore wind remains difficult this.\nYear with losses of roughly $1 billion in 2023.\nNext year we expect Offshore will have.\nSimilar losses but substantially improved cash performance.\nIt's a tough $6 billion backlog that we're working our way through, which we expect to largely complete over the next two or three years.\nMeanwhile, we're making operational progress with rising.\nAvailability on the 800 installed MW of our 6MW platform.\nElectricity is now being produced at Dogger.\nand we recently had the installation of our first Haliade-X turbines at Vineyard Wind.\nLooking forward, we've expanded Vic Abate's role to CEO of the entire wind business to leverage our progress in onshore and offshore.\nWe're taking a similarly disciplined approach to.\nWriting new business like we've done over at Gas Onshore and Grid, with increased rigor on pricing terms, geographic exposure, and other risks.\nAll in all, given power's continued strength and with our two largest businesses in.\nRenewables, grid, and now onshore delivering, plus our plan for offshore, we're highly confident.\nIn successfully spinning off GE Vernova early.\nIn Q2.\nAcross GE, I'm pleased with how we're operating as a simpler, more focused business at both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova.\nAnother strong quarter, but plenty more to do.\nMy thanks go out to the team for their dedication and commitment to serving our customers.\nIt's been nearly two years since we.\nAnnounced our intention to create three independent.\nInvestment-grade industry leaders, and now we're.\nClosing in on the final step.\nToday we announced plans to spin off.\nGE Vernova and launch GE Aerospace in the beginning of Q2 2024.\nBoth will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nYork Stock Exchange with GE Vernova as GEV and GE Aerospace carrying forward under GE.\nWe've made some important hires.\nAnd promotions to ensure we have the.\nBest teams leading these businesses forward.\nAt GE Aerospace, we've completed the functional leadership team, naming our heads of Corporate Affairs, Human Resources, Legal, and Treasury with experienced leaders from inside and outside. At GE Vernova, we added seasoned.\nPublic company CFO Ken Parks.\nAs I mentioned a moment ago, Vic Abate is now CEO of the wind business.\nWe've also further simplified and strengthened our balance sheet by redeeming the remainder of.\nOur preferred equity and selling a portion of our AerCap shares for $2.7 billion of proceeds.\nOur balance sheet is well positioned to.\nSupport the launch of two investment grade companies.\nWe're approaching some key spin milestones.\nGE Vernova will file a confidential Form 10.\n10 shortly, with the initial public filing.\nExpected in Q1.\nSoon we'll announce each company's Board of.\nDirectors, and in early March GE Vernova and GE Aerospace plan to hold investor days.\nBuilding on our success at GE Healthcare. We're exactly where we want to be at the end of October for both.\nGE Aerospace and GE Vernova.\nNow over to Rahul for more detail on our results.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nSenior VP and CFO, GE\n\nThank you Larry.\nTurning to slide four, I'll speak to the quarter on an organic basis.\nOverall, we delivered meaningful growth across our headline metrics.\nOrders were up double digits, with services up 15% driven by commercial aerospace, and equipment up 22% with growth in all segments.\nRevenue increased 18%, benefiting from strong market demand, improved execution, and pricing.\nAerospace was led by commercial services and engines. Renewables was led by grid and.\nOffshore and power from heavy-duty gas turbines and aeroderivatives.\nAll segments contributed to adjusted margin expansion of 760 basis points.\nThis included the absence of last year's.\nWind-related charges and the benefits of volume, price, net of inflation, and productivity.\nContinued investments in growth.\nAdjusted EPS was $0.82, up almost $1 year over year excluding last year's wind-related charges.\nAdjusted margin still expanded 400 basis points and EPS was up $0.59 or more.\nThan triple what we delivered last year.\nWe generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow, up roughly $1 billion, largely driven by earnings. Working capital was a positive $400 million.\nFlow driven by disciplined receivables management, while inventory remained inflated due to continued supply chain challenges.\nYear to date, free cash flow was.\n$2.2 billion, up $2.5 billion reflecting higher earnings, reduced working capital, and improved linearity.\nSwitching to corporate results, improved significantly due.\nTo energy financial services, gain on sale from investments, and higher interest income.\nAlso, as we prepare to reduce costs, as we prepare to become standalone businesses.\nFor the year, we now expect expenses in the $500 million range.\nAt insurance, we completed our annual review of liability cash flow assumptions under the new accounting standard.\nThis resulted in an immaterial adjustment to earnings indicating claims experience is consistent with our models.\nGiven GE Aerospace's strength and GE Vernova's.\nImprovement, we are raising full-year guidance.\nNow expecting revenue growth of low.\nTeens up from low double digits, adjusted EPS of $2.55 to $2.65, up $0.40 at the midpoint, largely from improvement in operating profit that we now expect to.\nBe in a range of 5.2 to.\n$5.5 billion and free cash flow of.\n$4.7 to $5.1 billion, up $550 million at the midpoint, largely from higher earnings and lower AD&A outflow.\nNow spending a moment on each business.\nStarting with GE Aerospace, demand remains robust.\nWith GE and CFM departures growing mid.\nTeens year over year.\nOrders were up 34% with strong growth.\nIn both equipment and services.\nRevenue was up 25%, led by Commercial.\nEngines and services up 29% and defense growing 8%.\nProfit grew over $400 million or more than 30%. Notably margins expanded 120 basis points to reach 20.4%. Higher services volume and pricing net of.\nInflation more than offset investments and adverse mix in our commercial business. Services strength continued to drive profit with services revenue up 31% from volume, pricing, and heavier work scopes.\nExternal spare parts were up more than.\n35% and internal shop visits grew 2%. With supply chain constraints impacting growth, Commercial engines revenue grew 23% with LEAP deliveries up 12% year over year. We are now planning for a 40% to 45% increase in LEAP deliveries this year, down from our 50% target at the beginning of the year.\nWe now expect OE revenue to grow low to mid-20s and services revenue.\nTo be up mid- to high 20s for the year.\nIn Defense, book-to-build remains strong this quarter, again greater than 1, and.\n1.3x year to date, highlighting the strong demand, environment, and quality of our franchisees. Revenue grew high single digits with strength.\nIn services and Edison Works, offsetting lower unit deliveries. Based on GE Aerospace's year-to-date strength, we are raising revenue growth to.\nThe low 20s and profit to be about $6 billion, up roughly $1.2 billion year over year, with free cash flow growth trending better than prior expectations.\nMoving to GE Vernova, lean, along with.\nBetter underwriting selectivity and productivity is delivering stronger results. We mentioned earlier at grid, and now onshore at renewables. Orders grew again, up 3% this quarter.\nUp more than 80% year to date to nearly $18 billion.\nGrid orders increased over 50% this quarter.\nWhile primarily an equipment business, today we are starting to grow grid services that was up double digits this.\nQ1 onshore North American equipment orders for the quarter were up nearly 40%.\nYear to date are up more than 2.5 times over prior year.\nThe IRA continues to be transformative, establishing multi year US demand visibility for future growth.\nInternationally, onshore orders were down meaningfully but at better margins consistent with our strategy of greater selectivity.\nRevenue grew 14%. Grid increased with double.\nDigital growth at each business.\nAt onshore, North American equipment growth was.\nMore than offset by lower repower and international equipment.\nAt offshore, revenue more than tripled year.\nover year and grew sequentially with higher nacelle output.\nProfit improved from our turnaround efforts excluding.\nLast year's elevated reserve.\nRenewables margin still expanded roughly 600 basis points.\nPoints driven by continued price and productivity.\nOnshore and grid margins expanded due to.\nPrice and productivity and grid margins also benefited from additional volume.\nFor the year, Renewables now expects low.\nDouble-digit revenue growth.\nWe are maintaining the guidance for significantly.\nBetter year over year profit with onshore and grid improvement more than offsetting the offshore pressure. Turning to power, we delivered solid year over year revenue growth and margin expansion with seasonally lower outages.\nEquipment orders grew slightly as higher heavy.\nHeavy-duty gas turbines more than offset lower aeroderivative units.\nServices declined slightly as high single digit.\nGrowth in gas transactional services was offset by aeroderivative and steam services.\nFor the year we still expect total.\nServices orders to grow low single digits. Revenue grew 9% largely on price and higher scope on heavy-duty gas turbine and aeroderivative equipment.\nServices grew again, up low single digits. Profit grew roughly 60% with 200 basis points.\nPoints of margin expansion driven by higher volume, pricing, and productivity which more than offset inflation pressure.\nYear to date, power orders have grown low single digits. Revenue mid single digits, and margins have.\nExpanded over 100 basis points. This was led by services, including higher gas utilization up low single digits, benefiting from a continued coal to gas switching.\nWe also shipped nine HA units this.\nYear and now have more than 47GW of installed capacity.\nContinuing to extend our HA services billings to $1 billion by mid-2020s in the.\nFourth quarter, Power is well positioned for sequential profit growth from seasonally higher services volume for the year. Power continues to expect low single digit revenue growth with better year over year profit. Taken together for GE Vernova, we are now expecting high single digit revenue growth.\nProfit improvement of over $800 million year over year. At the midpoint we're raising the low.\nEnd of our profit guidance driven by both renewables and power, and now expect.\nNegative $300 million to negative $100 million of operating profit.\nAs we continue to expect flat to slightly improved free cash flow.\nOverall, we are really encouraged, proving with grid and onshore that we can deliver better results.\nThis combined with Power's continued strong performance will drive meaningful profit and cash flow improvement at GE Vernova next year.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Larry.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE\n\nRahul, Thank you.\nTo summarize, GE Aerospace grew rapidly again. GE Vernova renewables improved sequentially and power.\nContinued to progress well overall. A very strong quarter for GE. One that gives us confidence and thus allows us to raise our full year guide.\nMore importantly, we're poised to launch two.\nInnovative global service focused industry leaders in less than six months.\nI'm proud of our team and even.\nMore excited for what lies ahead.\nSteve, let's go to Q and A.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE\n\nBefore we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question so.\nWe can get to as many people as possible.\nLiz, please open the line.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star 11 on your telephone. If you wish to withdraw your question or your question has already been answered, please press star 11 again.\nOur first question comes from the line of Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector, Aerospace, and Defense Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE\n\nGood morning.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector, Aerospace, and Defense Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nRahul, is the lower LEAP delivery guide a function of softer narrow body deliveries at the airframers? Or is this more related to challenges to your own production ramp up, and then how should we think about the impact of 2024? Thank you.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE\n\nLet me."

In the first half alone, earnings have now surpassed our full year 2022 results.\nGE Aerospace is growing rapidly as we execute on the ramp for our customers, and GE Vernova is strengthening pre-spin with record orders and improving profitability at renewable energy and continued margin expansion at power, based largely on year-to-date performance and expectations for continued strength in the second half. We're raising full-year guidance today. Big picture, there's a clear sense of progress, passion, and purpose within our businesses. This was particularly evident to me when I was in France last month at the Paris Air Show.\nGE Aerospace shared our bold vision to define flight for today, tomorrow, and the future during meetings with customers, suppliers, and investors. CFM's Rise Demonstrator program drew a lot of excitement as it aims to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by at least 20% compared to today's most efficient engines.\nI also saw our GE Vernova team for our onshore wind and grid operating reviews where we discussed opportunities and challenges with equal candor and transparency. We focus on how we grow these businesses profitably by applying real Lean at the point of impact to drive results. We're also seeing Lean's impact in our offshore wind facility in Saint-Nazaire where the team has reduced cycle times to assemble nacelle roofs by nearly 50% through multiple kaizens.\nSo while it's still early, I'm encouraged by examples like this across GE Vernova. Day in, day out, we're increasingly operating as GE Aerospace and GE Vernova, two industry leaders with large installed bases where services represent about 70% of GE Aerospace revenue and about half of GE Vernova revenue. In addition to attractive economics, services keep us close to our customers.\nWe understand the issues they're wrestling with and how our technology is performing, which shapes our future roadmaps. And with our businesses executing, we're advancing toward their launches as independent Investment Grade companies next year. When I reflect on how far we've come, it always starts with the team. So a big thank you to the entire global GE team. There's a lot to be excited about as we look forward to the rest of this year.\nBefore I turn it over to Carolina to take you through our results in detail, let me take a moment to welcome Rahul to his additional role as GE CFO this fall. Since joining GE Aerospace last year, he has quickly become an impactful and influential member of our GE Aerospace leadership team. And so, with our final spin approaching sometime in early 2024 and Rahul assuming the CFO job 1 September 2023, this is Carolina's last earnings call.\nShe has been a trusted strategic partner through significant deleveraging, improving our operating results, and building the financial foundation for our three independent companies. We're deeply grateful for her many contributions. So on behalf of the entire GE team and for me personally, Carolina, thank you.\n\nCarolina Dybeck Happe\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks Larry. It's truly an honor to be part of GE's ambitious transformation and I'm incredibly proud of the work this team has done to build lasting value. And a special thank you to our finance and DT teams for their extraordinary efforts.\nNow turning to slide three, which I'll speak to on an organic basis. In the second quarter, we delivered double-digit growth across all headline metrics. Orders increased 58%, up in all segments. Equipment was up significantly, led by renewables. This includes two large HVDC projects with TenneT at grid and higher margin orders at US onshore wind. Aerospace also up with solid defense engine orders. Services was up 21% with growth in all segments largely driven by commercial aerospace strength.\nRevenue increased 19% with both equipment and services up, also here. Aerospace led the way as LEAP engine deliveries nearly doubled and services grew. Renewables also grew led by onshore wind and grid with improved pricing. Adjusted margin expanded 160 basis points driven by volume, price, and productivity.\nThis was partially offset by mix, inflation, and investment. Taken together, adjusted EPS was $0.68, nearly double what we delivered last year, driven by profit growth in all segments and meaningful deleveraging. Free cash flow was $415 million, more than double what we delivered last year, driven by earnings growth. Looking at the flows, we reduced working capital from Q1 given the sequential revenue growth and preparation for large second half deliveries. Receivables and inventory reduced cash.\nThis was more than offset by progress payments and contract assets with utilization-driven billings. At both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova, we're implementing weekly cash management and already seeing some linear progress. Importantly, our first half free cash flow underscores this effort, up $1.5 billion year-over-year. This includes half a billion of dollars lower working capital than in 2022.\nNow, a moment on corporate adjusted costs, which were up year-over-year, primarily driven by non-repeatable 2022 timing benefits. We're preparing for standalone cost structures with functional headcount down 10% year to date. For the year, we continue to expect expenses in the $600 million range. We also continue to simplify and strengthen the business foundations. Prior to the launches of GE Aerospace and GE Vernova this quarter, we partially monetized our GE Healthcare stake.\nToday, we announced that we will call the remainder of the outstanding GE preferred stock in September, further simplifying our balance sheet and reducing financing costs. We took action to reduce our exposure to legacy liabilities. As we've disclosed for some time, our runoff Polish mortgage portfolio, Bank BPH, has been subject to ongoing litigation along with other Polish banks.\nWe approved the adoption of a settlement program, and associated with that, we recorded a charge of $1 billion in discontinued operations. Importantly, no incremental cash contributions from GE are required in connection with the charge as the current cash balances at Bank BPH are adequate.\nOverall, we're very pleased with our spin progress and first half, which includes adjusted EPS up more than three times compared to a year ago. So given the strength of GE Aerospace and the improvement at GE Vernova for the full year, we're now expecting revenue growth in the low double-digit range up from high single digits, $2.10 to 2.30 of adjusted EPS up from $1.70 to 2, and that includes $4.7 to 5.1 billion of operating profit. Finally, we now guide for a range of $4.1 to 4.6 billion for free cash flow up from $3.6 to 4.2 billion. On that happy note, back to you, Larry.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nCarolina, thank you. As many of you saw at the Paris Air Show, GE Aerospace showcased industry-leading solutions for both commercial and defense across propulsion systems and services. Our teams are delivering for customers both in services and by growing our large young fleet of 41,000 commercial engines and 26,000 rotorcraft and combat engines. Today, we're partnering with airframers, airlines, and lessors to drive stability and predictability as they ramp for tomorrow.\nWe're growing and optimizing our next-generation of engines. This quarter, for example, our defense team signed a historic MOU with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to produce jet fighter engines for the Indian Air Force. While our commercial business secured major deals with Riyadh Air, Jet2, and more for the future, we're developing next-generation technologies like RISE, hybrid-electric, and sustainable aviation fuels.\nAs a result of our efforts to embed lean and empower those closest to the action, I'm seeing greater intensity, discipline, and focus. For example, as we discussed in June, while supply chain and inflation challenges persist, we're using a lean tool called Plan for Every Part to implement pull and improve delivery. Sustaining lean efforts like this helped us increase sequential engine deliveries by 35% in Q2, including a 40% improvement in T700 from a 25% reduction in lead times.\nLooking at the market, departures have almost returned to pre-COVID levels. This rapid growth was evident in our quarterly results. Orders were up 37% with strength in commercial services and defense. Revenue was up 28% with equipment growing at double the services rate. Profit improved close to $350 million or nearly 30%. Margins contracted 30 basis points organically. Volume, pricing net of inflation, productivity were offset by unfavorable mix, increased investments, and the non-repeated positive contract margin adjustments last year.\nOnce again, commercial engines and services was particularly robust with 32% revenue growth. Commercial engines revenue grew 35% with LEAP deliveries up over 80% year-over-year and over 10% sequentially. We're on track for 1,700 LEAP deliveries this year. As expected, the LEAP spare engine deliveries ratio was higher than 2022, but we expect this to normalize in the second half, remaining roughly in line with 2022 for the full year. Commercial services revenue also grew over 30%. Internal shop visits increased over 10% and external spare parts were up over 40%.\nFor the year, we now expect commercial engines revenue to grow mid-to-high 20s and commercial services to grow above 20%.\nDefense improved this quarter, delivering significant growth. Orders more than doubled. Engine output increased with units up over 70% year-over-year. Through the first half we delivered double digit revenue growth and we're on track for at least high single digit growth this year.\nLooking ahead, we're constantly innovating here as well. Our XA100 is the only engine tested and ready to ensure the US maintains air superiority this decade. This engine is the most cost-effective option to meet the needs of the US warfighter for decades to come. We're pleased the House has recognized the importance of this program by including funding in the National Defense Authorization Act and in the House Appropriations Committee defense bill. We'll be closely watching the Senate as it considers legislation this week.\nBased on our first-half strength, we're raising revenue growth to high teens to 20% and operating profit to $5.6 billion to $5.9 billion, up roughly $1 billion year-over-year at the midpoint. And we expect free cash flow to be even stronger year-over-year in line with our increased profit expectations.\nMoving to GE Vernova, we continue to see long-term growth tailwinds driven by the need for more sustainable, affordable, resilient energy along with energy security. We're encouraged by the team's progress as they use Lean to strengthen operations, driving toward a significant inflection in 2024. This quarter, renewables demonstrated continued improvement. Market demand drove record orders led by grid with two more large HVDC projects. Even excluding these projects, grid orders were up over 40% as expected. We also recognized a large US offshore order which was included in our backlog forecast at our March investor conference.\nOnshore wind was strong again, led by North American equipment growing more than threefold. We serve many of North America's largest developers and the IRA incentives are helping grow orders significantly. This year.\nRevenue grew 27% organically driven by higher equipment deliveries across both wind and grid, and offshore. Revenue tripled year-over-year as we increased nacelle production with June, the highest month to date.\nImportantly, profit improved year-over-year and sequentially for the second consecutive quarter, driven by price and productivity improvements primarily at onshore and grid.\nGoing deeper into each business at onshore, the progress continued. First, we're seeing the impact of enhancing our underwriting rigor and focusing on select markets with fewer product offerings. Second, we're driving price to manage inflation. As we've seen the past four quarters, equipment margins on new orders are coming in higher than current margins, especially here in the US, this will help drive improved profitability going forward. Next, we're improving reliability through our Fleet Enhancement program, and as of July, we're almost 30% complete, and we expect to be more than halfway done by year end.\nOur cost rationalization continues with onshore headcount down roughly 30% year-over-year. At offshore, we're improving on the Haliade-X learning curve and reducing cycle times to deliver for our customers as we work through our initial projects.\nAnd finally, in grid, the top line grew double digits in all businesses with significant margin expansion from volume, price, and productivity. Grid was profitable this quarter and remains on track to turn profitable for the full year.\nLooking ahead, we're raising our full year renewables revenue growth forecast to high single digits, and we're expecting some sequential profit improvement in the second half driven by onshore wind and grid.\nTurning to power. Power continues to deliver solid results in reliable earnings and cash flow, providing critical support for future growth at GE Vernova, and at the same time our multi-year decarbonization efforts continue. Just this month the Province of Ontario announced we'll work together on the planning and licensing process for three more potential new small modular reactors there using our BWRX-300 design.\nLooking at the market, GE gas turbine utilization grew at a low single-digit rate this quarter.\nOrders grew high single digits with strength from gas power transactional services.\nRevenue declined slightly, largely due to aeroderivative shipment timing. Services, however, continued to grow, and we had higher HA deliveries. This provides stable baseload power to the grid now and generates future services growth.\nPower delivered continued profit growth and margin expansion. Price, productivity, and higher contractual outage volume on heavy duty units more than offset inflation.\nOverall. In the first half, power revenue grew mid-single-digits organically, and margins expanded led by gas power services. For the year, we continue to expect low-single-digit revenue growth, and given our Q2 performance, we now expect power's profit to be even better versus 2022. Taken together for GE Vernova, we're raising our revenue forecast to mid-single-digit growth. We're also improving our profit guidance driven by both renewables and power and now expect a negative $400 million to a negative $100 million this year, an improvement of almost $800 million year-over-year.\nAt the midpoint, we continue to expect flat to slightly improved free cash flow. Overall, we're pleased with our progress and momentum, but of course more remains to be done.\nSo to wrap up on slide seven, our businesses delivered a strong half anchored by missions that matter to our customers and to the world. GE Aerospace: Inventing the Future of Flight. GE Vernova: Electrifying and Decarbonizing the World. We're excited about where we are and where we're headed, and I'm confident we're well positioned for success as two innovative, service-focused market leaders. Steve, with that, let's go to Q&A.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks, Larry. Before we open the line, I'd ask.\nEveryone in the queue to consider your.\nFellow analysts, and ask one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Liz, please open the line.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone. If you wish to withdraw your question or your question has already been answered, please press star one one again.\nOur first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace, Defense, and Airlines Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGood morning everyone.\nThank you.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nMorning, Sheila. How are you?\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace, Defense, and Airlines Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nI wanted to ask about aerospace profitability. When we look at year-to-date margins for the first half, Aero margins are 18.9% and the full-year implied guidance is 18.5%. So what are the dynamics of contraction in the second half, given the commentary.\nIn the release prior was the commentary in your release is good. Market strength efficiencies are coming through.\nYou've shipped 46% of the LEAPs in.\nH1 slightly ahead of your prior expectation.\nOf sequential improvement for the year. So what happens that margins contract in the second half?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nSheila, thank you.\nYou're spot on. And I think as we reference, there is largely a mix dynamic in play as equipment revenues begin to accelerate here vis-à-vis services. But I think that's an excellent question for Rahul to jump in on here. It's one of the reasons we wanted to have him here with us this morning. Rahul.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah, thanks, Larry. Morning, Sheila. So first let me just go back to how good the Q2 was, which you referenced. We had 28% organic growth, commercial engines up more than 50%, service continuing a really strong run with 30%+ growth, defense recovering. As Larry said in his remarks, to be up double-digit on revenue growth for the first half and profit was up more than 30% year-over-year with margin expansion. And the quarter was better than what we had expected going back all the way to April.\nBut more importantly, as we looked at the quarter, it gave us the confidence to raise the full year. And now profit is up a billion dollars for the year at the midpoint of the guide with year-over-year margin expansion. So that's a positive change as well.\nRelative to April, we're raising the full year profit by about $250 million at the midpoint of the guide with about $400 million of revenue increase. That's about a 60% incremental drop through. That is happening even though most of the revenue increase in our guide is coming from commercial OE as we are raising the commercial OE outlook from approximately 20 to mid-to-high 20s. The business is doing better on execution, and the improvement in the spare parts growth is helping as well.\nNow to your question on the sequential view between first half and second half. The key driver of the sequential growth is coming from commercial OE which is up probably 60% between first half, second half, and that's a reversal of what we saw last year.\nLast year most of the first half to second half growth was coming from commercial services. And within commercial OE there is a spare install dynamic happening as well with installs being as a percentage of total shipments increasing as we get into the second half of the year. So that's why you're seeing a sequential step down in margin. But again, it's going to be a really good year. We're going to expand margins and grow profit about a billion dollars for the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nOh yes, good morning.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nHey Andrew.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nI'll stay in the power lane given.\nThat there are more illustrious analysts now covering the stock.\nOffshore.\nInterestingly, you noted favorable year-over-year orders in offshore, and I thought the.\nCommentary was that you were not looking at offshore orders.\nAnd also, if you could comment on the industry dynamic because it seems that folks are pulling out of offshore as the overall pricing dynamic is not favorable, so people are pulling away from contracts. So more color on offshore would be great, and great quarter.\nThank you.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nThank you, Andrew. You're illustrious in our eyes. Rest assured. I would say with respect to the offshore order, again, that was something that we knew we had coming. There were just some details that we needed to lock down, and we were pleased to do that. But really no surprise from what we shared with you out in Cincinnati in March in that regard. I think for us, we're still building out this offshore business. We referenced what we're doing in terms of production in Saint-Nazaire to begin to flow this backlog, this nascent backlog that we have.\nWe certainly have read and have had direct discussions with a number of customers on both sides of the Atlantic as they prepare for for the next decade. I think we're optimistic about offshore wind.\nI know there was some press over the course of the weekend that talked to some of the potential delays. But at the end of the day, as we think about the energy transition, we think about various ways in which certainly the coasts are going to be powered with renewable sources. Offshore has a role to play there, and I think what we want to do is build up a business that has a respectable profitable slice of that market. Really pleased with the progress we're making in onshore. I think everything that we said a year ago is playing out in terms of our selectivity, the improvement in the quality of the backlog from a pricing and from a cost perspective.\nI think the team here, we've talked often about how they're going to run the power playbook, have done a really nice job making sure that we are working through some of the quality issues that triggered the charge that we took in the Q3 of last year. And again, our cost base is 30% better than it was just 12 months ago. So you put that together, you can really see the turn in onshore and grid.\nWe don't talk a lot about grid, but really pleased with similar execution against a backdrop where I think maybe more so in Europe, but increasingly here in the US people appreciate how critical grid modernization will be to the energy transition. So we've got three, as they say in aerospace, angles of attack in renewables. Gas continuing to play a vital role. So we like the way that we're positioned.\nOffshore wind being one play among many at GE Vernova.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, Seb.\n\nCarolina Dybeck Happe\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, Seb.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nI wanted to ask with regard.\nTo the margin rate for aerospace in the second half, if you could talk a little bit about what role you expect pricing to play there and the.\nExtent to which it can offset the.\nMixed headwinds and then maybe just a technical question. I think you talked about really strong.\nGrowth in spare parts.\nJust when we try to think.\nAbout this and model it going forward, I think if I, you know, if.\nI look in the Q, it's like.\nA low single-digit growth in the spares rate per day.\nBut I think spares were up something.\nLike 40% in the quarter.\nJust kind of how to square those things and how we can kind of, you know, measure that and think about it going forward?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nSo let me start with the first question on pricing debt. So again, I think the price continues to be a positive driver in terms of earnings growth across both defense and commercial. And we are price-cost positive both in the quarter and expect to be price-cost positive for the year. So the trends continue to be good, and that is similar to what we saw last year. So really no change in terms of how we are driving incremental pricing to cover the inflation that we are feeling in the business.\nNow, in terms of our spare parts sales. Yeah, the spare parts sales, you're right, I mean, it was really good, really good growth in the quarter, more than 40%, and I would say three large drivers of the spare parts growth. First, the price increases that we just spoke about.\nBut it's just not the increases. It's also the discipline with which we're driving the business so that we're making sure that we are extracting the most out of the price increases that we are putting in place. The second was the customer mix was favorable as well, so that helped drive spare part sales. The third, I would say, is if you go back to 2022, China was really weak last year, especially in Q2 and Q3 because of the shutdowns in China. So the year-over-year growth trends were helped by a weak compare in Q2 in China.\nNow, that dynamic is going to shift a little bit as we get into the second half of the year because if you recall, China came back really strongly in Q4 to get ready for the reopening in Q1.\nSo that's going to impact our spare part growth in the second half of the year on a year-over-year basis. So overall, I think we're really pleased with how spare parts are trending, good growth in the quarter, and expect continued growth in the second half of the year on a year-over-year basis, although at a slower rate.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Maybe just wanted to focus on the renewables business because I guess you had a very strong revenue uplift. But the sort of incrementals perhaps if we're looking sequentially or year-on-year.\nWe're not particularly strong. So maybe help us kind of parse that out in terms of, you know, maybe it's offshore losses getting a lot wider and that's offsetting better incrementals maybe at onshore and grid. Maybe just talk through some of those dynamics. And then as we're thinking about the second half for renewables and the sort of entry rate into 2024, how do we think about the losses narrowing? Is it sort of linear or there's a step function sometime next year because of offshore mix or something?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nJulian, let me frame that for you. I think you've got the contours exactly right. Again, I think that in 2023, what we've said all along is that what we really need to see is that sequential improvement in onshore wind. That was really, if you will, the battleground for us this year as we get ready to have Vernova go sometime early next year. I think all in all, we saw that sequential improvement, again, a function of a better backlog being shipped from a pricing, terms, and conditions perspective.\nSome of that's a function of our selectivity, some of that's a function of just improved market conditions. We know we are delivering a higher quality product to customers today. That's reflected in our cost performance, let alone the restructuring that has been underway there. That really continues.\nI'd also suggest that beyond what you see in those numbers, what I see in our operating reviews really gives me confidence that the team's running this business the way we want them to run it. That bodes well both for the back half improvements that are part of the guide here, but also getting us ready for next year. Again, a similar rollout in grid.\nWe've been running the power playbook there for the last couple of years and having them turn profitable, not that that's the goal, we want to be strong contributor here, I think, is another proof point of progress. You're right. Offshore wind does begin to negate some of that progress as that mix effect takes a hold with the uptake in offshore revenues improving and thus the revenue recognition and the losses there as we work through that initial backlog. But we knew that was part of the startup of offshore wind. So we see sequential progress. It's muted a bit perhaps in your eyes, because of the offshore effect. I mean, offshore was roughly half of the loss in Q2.\nBut given the progress in onshore wind, given the progress in grid, given what we know we're going to be able to do an offshore wind next year, we feel very good about the progress and the momentum that we're making at Vernova or in renewables at large.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nJust to add.\nTo what Larry just said, so if you look at Vernova, we are raising both the revenue and the profit guidance for the year. About $150 million of the profit raises from midpoint. And it's coming both with power and renewables contributing to the raise. About 1/3 of that is from the second quarter. Performance in power driven by the strength of the services business, and about 2/3 from renewables in the second half of 2023, with improvement in both onshore and grid onshore mainly because of the backlog margins improving, and in grid from volume and productivity. So good progress in both businesses year-over-year and on a sequential basis.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.\n\nRobert Spingarn\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace, Defense, and Space Equity Research, Melius Research\n\nMorning everyone.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, Rob.\n\nRobert Spingarn\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace, Defense, and Space Equity Research, Melius Research\n\nLarry, maybe on the product development side, perhaps a little high level, but Airbus has said that an A220-500 is a matter of when and not if. And they've also openly talked about the desire to add a second engine to the family. And so given that that aircraft would directly compete against the MAX 8, do you feel the need to get the LEAP-1B onto the A220 family?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nRob, I thought your multi-series coverage on that specific topic and how the two airframers are going to play out their narrow-body product strategy here really captured well the critical questions that we're all wrestling with. As you probably can respect, we're in deep with both of our airframer customers relative to our own product roadmap and technology roadmap for that matter, i.e. RISE, and how we can work together as they evolve their own product strategies. So specifically to the A220-500, I think we'll keep our comments.\nPrivately. We'll have that conversation with Guillaume and his team. But obviously as we evolve our product portfolio, we want to be on all the critical platforms that matter in the decades ahead.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning everyone.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nHey Deane.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, Deane.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, and first of all, thank you.\nTo Carolina, and wish you all the best.\n\nCarolina Dybeck Happe\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nThank you, Deane.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey Larry, I know you talked about the renewable orders that were booked in terms of profitability, but can you generalize a bit and talk about the range of customer modifications within these orders that?\nWere booked that had been a problem before? Too much variability versus steering customers to a more standardized offering.\nDid that read out in these orders?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nDeane, we should have mentioned that earlier. Thanks for asking about that. Part of what we've tried to do, in addition to our selectivity effort in terms of the types of opportunities that we pursue, is also make sure that frankly, we are driving more standardized offerings. I would say that we are seeing probably more in the order book than in the P&L today. The positive effect of that, I'd also say coupled with that is just, frankly, a more conservative forward estimation of cost, and that will play out over time. We'll see how conservative those estimates are.\nBut I know that the team for the last several quarters has really not bet too far into the future vis-a-vis the cost position that we anticipate having when we deliver on this growing backlog.\nSo you put all that together, in addition to the quality improvements that we put across the.\nSharply reduced cost structure that we have in the business, I think that's why we've got particularly an onshore wind. The optimism we do about the back half and profitability in 2024.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you.\nGood morning, everyone.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nHey, Jeff.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nGood morning, Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nHey. Hey.\nGood morning.\nHey. Just to follow up on renewables, maybe supposed to get your thoughts on the trajectory of free cash flow. Kind of stuck with the same language, right? Flat to improving. But I'm wondering if, inside that, given the better trajectory of profitability apparently and what looks like some decent orders that should be coming with deposits attached, if in fact the free cash flow outlook for renewables has improved for the year. And if you have anything to share about how you view 2024 playing out, thank you.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nSo let me start, Jeff, with 2023 first. So on renewables for full year in the current construct, what you'll find is kind of flattish to last year. $150-ish million positive from earnings with huge growth in earnings, minus the charge that we took last year, and good progress on onshore wind here, especially with the progress payments, grids doing well. But it's coming; it's getting offset by the offshore from absence of progress payments and the way the contract assets are playing out. So overall, renewables, think of that as kind of flat year-over-year for full year. And then if you go to power, the fact is power free cash could be slightly down year-over-year, again positive earnings from cash.\nBut it's getting pressured with these contract assets because as the revenue growth happens, we burn through the contract assets that are sitting on our books because the revenue exceeds the billings. So that's what's happening on the power side. So it's good for the business. The revenue growth is happening, the outages are helping. It's driving good revenue growth, but has a temporary negative impact on free cash. Now obviously as we get into 2024, we'll provide more guidance as we get towards the end of the year into next year. But we do expect strong sequential improvement year-over-year in Vernova business overall.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nAnd Carolina.\nCongratulations and good luck. I just wondered if maybe we could just dive into maybe Q3 and look at some of the moving pieces for both earnings and free cash flow. On top of that, just this $1 billion charge on the Polish bank.\nIs that just writing down the remaining?\nNet asset value in that business? No cash. Does that clean up litigation there?\nThanks.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah. So on Poland, Nigel, I didn't fully follow your Q3 question, so let's come back to that. But let me start with Poland. So we've been working to simplify the legacy liabilities, and it's a meaningful step forward in that direction. Prior to spinning, we are approving a settlement program, and that significantly reduces our exposure to future losses. And as Carolina said in her prepared remarks, there's no incremental GE cash from taking this reserve, as the bank has adequate cash balances.\nSo we feel good to get this as much as we can behind us. Obviously the situation is evolving, but at this point it's a really good step forward as we clean up and simplify all the legacy liabilities.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nAnd the Q3 question was just guide, just how are we thinking about Q3 guide overall?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nYeah. So on Q3, expect high single digit revenue growth in the quarter and then EPS range of about $0.45 to 0.55 with sequential profit growth in both aerospace and in renewables. And we'll see a pretty strong growth in power in the third quarter on profit. And we expect the margins to go up three to four points on power.\nIf you look at the EPS that we are providing, the range that we're providing of $0.45 to 0.55, that's about 2x what we did last year, even if we exclude the charge. So it's a significant improvement from that. For aerospace, going back all the way to prior questions, profit will be up sequentially, but the margin rates could be down slightly given the majority of the first half to second half increase is coming from commercial OE. Then renewables will continue to see sequential improvement given onshore wind and grid performance. Then as I said power, given the outage activity in Q3, we do expect.\nGood improvement there.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nAnd free cash?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nAnd the free cash kind of flat to up slightly in the quarter, with earnings growth and working capital reduction offsetting the AD&A headwinds.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question.\nComes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nGood morning everyone. Carolina, thanks for your help.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nHey Andy, good morning.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nCould you give us a little more color into the improvement you're seeing in your defense business? You talked about orders more than doubling. Revenue was up 31%. Has defense growth and profitability really turned the corner for you guys? And how do we think about its contribution to growth and margin over the next couple quarters and into 2024? I know you said Rahul, that you expect at least high single digit growth for defense. But does GE Defense now have an extended runway for growth?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nAndy, maybe I'll start. As we indicated in our prepared remarks, and I think we have through the last several quarters, demand is not our fundamental challenge in the defense arena. Throughput is. The supply chain challenges that we've talked about and everyone talks about certainly apply to defense. I think we've had some particular issues that have challenged us especially so with the Q1 numbers. I think we're really encouraged by what we have seen recently, not only with the T700, but with a host of platforms where our material flow in our own facilities.\nis better. We are improving yields in a number of key operations that allows that flow to take place. We talked a little bit about PFEP, a Plan For Every Part, how that helps us implement pull, in turn, improve deliveries. Our signals to not only our internal supply base, but also our external supply base are better and more clear. We're not just trying to work against past due, but really targeting what we need when we need it.\nThat has in turn, I think, had some early impact here. To the extent that we're able to do that more productively, we've certainly seen, I think, improvements not only in traditional material price cost, but also beginning to see some labor productivity improvements. All of that accrues to our good.\nBut as long as we're able to continue to drive this output level, we'll see that high single digit top line number and in turn the goodness that will follow from a margin and from a cash perspective. Rahul, anything you'd add there?\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nNo, Larry, I think you covered it. I think it's, you know, it's good to see the recovery happening in the second half. In the second quarter kind of puts us back on track for the full year and you know, we're seeing good demand and you know, good improvement in year-over-year delivery. So you know, expect a good half in the back half of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\nCarolina, thank you for all the help throughout the years.\n\nCarolina Dybeck Happe\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nThank you, thank you.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nSo really my question was congrats on all the progress you're making cleaning up.\nThe balance sheet with the prep redemption.\nThe Polish mortgage announcement today. I'm just curious from this point forward, you know, how are you thinking about capital allocation pre-spin and then any color that you can give us on, you know, just the progress of the spin. I know you said early 2024, but just any other hurdles that you see from here to there.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nJoe, I would say that there really isn't any change in our perspective this morning with respect to the spend and the capital allocation decisions that we'll take between now and then.\nWe've talked about Vernova launching sometime early next year. That is still very much the case today. We've talked about that really being a function of their performance, not necessarily our readiness, because the teams that are focused on the separation work had, I think, real success with HealthCare, are rerunning that playbook here, and are exactly where we would want to be in the middle of July. So as we look forward again, I think we're really encouraged by what we have seen in the first half results and in the second half outlook. Still work to do, right. There's a negative operating loss there that none of us feel great about.\nBut I think what we've said is the way we'll define winning is sequential improvement, business by business, and what we've seen in onshore and grid, I think we can all be quite, quite proud of with respect to capital allocation. Job one remains a successful standup of all three of these companies. And while you've seen us continue to make progress on some of the specific initiatives like the monetization of the AerCap stake, likewise with HealthCare.\nYou mentioned the prefs, thank you. Well, just you put all that together. We're very much going to be in position from a balance sheet perspective to not only launch, but then allow each of the respective boards at Aerospace and Vernova to shape the contours of a capital allocation policy fit for each business.\nThat may be a little boring perhaps here in the near term, but this team is hyper focused on what our overarching priority is over the next several quarters, and that is the successful spin of GE Vernova and successful stand up of GE Aerospace.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nLiz, we have time for one last quick question.\n\nOperator\n\nThis question will come from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nI appreciate the time. So I want to ask on renewables. Revenue was up 12% in the first half of the year, and with the full-year guidance calling for high single-digit revenue growth, it's, I guess, implying like a fall down to low single in the back half of the year. Can you just maybe talk about what's driving that? Because it doesn't seem to jive with orders up, you know, well over 100% for the first half. Thank you.\n\nRahul Ghai\n\nCFO, GE Aerospace\n\nSo the orders don't help much this year, Chris. I mean that's mainly, you know, those revenues, those orders will kind of you know, play out, you know, over 2024 and even 2025. So and what you see between the, you know, the first half growth and the second half growth is just basically project timing. It's just a question of which projects are getting executed, how those projects play out. So but you know, again, it's good progress. Feel better about the, about the year, you know, raising guidance on renewables, on revenue growth. So it's good progress. And the orders that we and the orders are obviously very, very strong and that helps. 2024 and 2025.\n\nSteve Winoker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, GE Aerospace\n\nThanks, Rahul. Larry, any final comments?\n\nLarry Culp\n\nChairman and CEO, GE Aerospace\n\nSteve, thank you. No, I would say simply to close a strong first half in 2023. And frankly, I've never been more confident in our path ahead as we prepare to launch both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova. Thanks everybody for your time today, your investment, and support of our company.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Liz and I will be your conference coordinator today.\nIf you experience issues with the webcast slides refreshing or there appears to be delays in the slide advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\n\nSteven E. Winoker\n\nAnalyst, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC\n\nThanks, Liz. Welcome to GE's first quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm joined by Chairman and CEO, Larry Culp; and CFO, Carolina Happe. Some of the statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes. As a reminder, similar to our fourth quarter call, our remarks will be brief today, reflecting the company we are now and we'll move more quickly to Q&A. Over to Larry.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nSteve, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter as a new GE, a simpler and more focused GE. We are now GE Aerospace and GE Vernova, 2 industry leaders in their own rights. We're creating significant value today, underscored by strong first quarter results, 17% organic revenue growth with all segments up, more than doubling our adjusted profit with margin expansion in all segments, resulting in $0.27 of adjusted EPS and positive free cash flow.\nThis performance reflects robust market demand for our innovative technologies and services, and we're operating leaner and more focused businesses. Services proved again they're clearly one of our best assets, representing more than 60% of revenue, given not only the resiliency and higher margins we enjoy, but the fact they keep us in daily contact with our customers.\nSince our investor conference in March, GE Aerospace has continued to see tremendous commercial momentum, delivering double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines. Our execution at GE Vernova is tracking well with continued signs of progress in renewable energy as Power continues to deliver. Now with GE Healthcare on its own, we're focused on launching these 2 businesses as independent investment-grade companies. Further, we also continued to simplify the balance sheet, partially monetizing our AerCap stake, closing out our Baker Hughes stake and calling half of the preferreds.\nWe also named 2 new exceptional Board members: retired U.S. Air Force General, Darren McDew and Jessica Uhl, both of whom have deep domain expertise in Aerospace and Energy, respectively. We completed consultations with our European Works Council, which allows us to build the teams with both internal and external leaders for these stand-alone businesses.\nWe're also advancing the internal rewiring to separate the businesses. This includes working through our legal entities, tax, organizational and capital structures as well as standing up Boards for both businesses. The rest assured job 1 remains our operating performance, which we'll dive into in more detail momentarily.\nSo a big thank you to our outstanding teams, particularly our separation management office that is leading these efforts as well as the vast majority of our global employee base that's focused daily on serving customers. These businesses are ready to deliver and realize our full potential as independent industry leaders.\nWith that, Carolina will take you through our results.\n\nCarolina Happe\n\nThanks, Larry. Turning to Slide 3, which I'll speak to on an organic basis. In the first quarter, top line momentum was strong with robust market demand and execution driving growth. Orders increased 26%, all segments up. Equipment was up significantly led by renewables, almost doubling its order intake. Notably, grid booked 2 large HVDC orders with Tenet and U.S. Onshore Wind is seeing the initial positive impact of the Inflation Reduction Act, including higher margin orders. Services was up 12%, largely driven by commercial aerospace activity. Revenue also increased double digits with strength in both equipment and services. Aerospace was a significant driver with substantial LEAP engine deliveries and shop visit growth, and we're encouraged by equipment growth in other areas such as Gas Power and Grid.\nAdjusted margin expanded 330 basis points, driven by services volume, price outpacing inflation and productivity. Together, doubling operating profit and debt reduction drove substantial accretion to adjusted EPS, up $0.36 year-over-year.\nFree cash flow was $102 million, positive. Importantly, it was up $1.3 billion year-over-year with half of the improvement from earnings and half from working capital. From a flow perspective, this was driven by higher earnings and some AD&A timing, partially offset by working capital as we build inventory to support second half growth.\nIn addition to the strong earnings results, this was GE's first positive free cash flow in the first quarter since 2015. This achievement reflects our team's intense focus in sealing disciplined processes to enhance linearity and eliminate waste while driving operational efficiency and improved earnings and cash flow. A moment on corporate.\nAdjusted costs were down over 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by ongoing cost-out efforts and interest income as well as improvement in digital. For the year, we expect costs of around $600 million, half the amount in 2021 and in line with reduced corporate needs and progress setting up stand-alone cost structures.\nAt insurance, as previously discussed, we now have adopted the industry-wide accounting standard for LDTI and we implemented first principles models. As of the end of 2022, the impact from this transition was $2.7 billion reduction in GAAP equity. These changes, including first principles, did not impact cash funding. We also funded the expected $1.8 billion during the quarter, in line with the permitted practice.\nOverall, we're pleased with the first quarter, delivering significant growth, margin, EPS and cash improvement. Based on this performance and market demand, we are raising the low end of our full year adjusted EPS range by $0.10 and our free cash flow range by $200 million. So we now expect adjusted EPS of $1.70 to $2 and free cash flow of $3.6 billion to $4.2 billion. And on that positive note, back to you, Larry, to discuss the businesses.\n\nLarry Culp\n\nCarolina, thank you. Starting with GE Aerospace. As many of you heard from us just over a month ago at our customer technical education center in Cincinnati, a premier franchise with leading value propositions for propulsion and systems in both Commercial and Defense.\nWith our highly differentiated technology and service portfolio, we're redefining flight for today, tomorrow and the future. Today, we're focused on partnering with air framers, airlines and lessors to drive stability and predictability as they ramp. For tomorrow, we're focused on roaming and optimizing our next generation of engines.\nOur recent proof point, our record-breaking deal with Air India with 800 LEAP 40 GEnx and 20 GE9X engines plus services. And for the future, we're developing next-generation technologies like RISE, hybrid electric and sustainable aviation fuels to better serve our customers and deliver growth. I'm extremely proud of how our team continues to make progress on these priorities, running the business with lean principles in a more decentralized manner with intensity, discipline and focus day in and day out. Looking at the market, the recovery has strengthened as the world is eager to travel, GE and CFM departures continue to improve, currently at 97% of '19 levels, and we still expect to be back to '19 levels later this year.\nTo that end, we delivered strong results driven by this commercial momentum. Orders were up 14%. Revenue was up 25%, driven primarily by services and commercial engine deliveries. Profit improved up over 40%. And margins expanded due to services volume, pricing and productivity, which together more than offset negative mix, inflation and investments. Commercial Engines and Services performance was particularly robust with 35% revenue growth. Commercial Engines revenue grew over 30% with LEAP deliveries up over 50%. To support our customers, LEAP spare engine deliveries will be more first half loaded, but we expect this to normalize in the second half, remaining roughly in line with 2022 for the full year.\nServices revenue also grew over 30%. Internal shop visits increased over 30% and external spare parts was up over 20%. Favorable pricing and customer mix also contributed to the margins. We recently welcomed 2 new members of our LEAP MRO network, StandardAero and ST Engineering. Our external network for LEAP is now up to 5 partners, creating a highly competitive environment that drives a lower cost of ownership for our airline customers.\nToday, third-party MROs licensed by CFM service about 70% of the CFM56 shop visits. So this is a model that customers know well and trust today. In the supply chain, we saw areas of improvement with material inputs and LEAP shipments improving sequentially, thanks largely to our lean efforts. However, output continued to be impacted by material availability and supplier challenges, particularly in Defense, where revenue declined 2%.\nLean is critical to improve process capabilities and increase material availability from our suppliers. In both Commercial and Defense, we use rigorous daily management with problem-solving across product lines, supply chain and engineering teams. This helped drive Commercial Engine deliveries to be up 40% year-over-year and recovery of roughly 70 engines in Defense, the first week of April. Predictability, stability and improved delivery remain key for us going forward.\nWe're also constantly innovating for the future. Our XA100 is the only engine tested and ready to ensure the U.S. maintains air superiority this decade, especially critical as geopolitical threats grow. XA100 provides 30% more range, 20% greater acceleration and twice the thermal management capacity. This engine is the most effective -- the most cost-effective option to meet the needs of the U.S. war fighter for decades to come. Looking ahead, despite the encouraging start, as we shared in March, over the next few quarters, we'll face headwinds from tougher comps and the mix impact from equipment growth, inflation and investments.\nHowever, we continue to expect to deliver significant profit dollar growth and higher free cash flow in 2023, primarily from strong volume across engines and services, combined with better pricing and productivity. We'll share more details on our progress and our future as a stand-alone industry leader at the Paris Air Show in June. I look forward to seeing many of you there. Turning to Vernova. This business is already demonstrating how well it's positioned to support our customers through the energy transition. We're seeing favorable secular growth tailwinds underscored by IRA momentum and the need for sustainable, affordable, resilient and secure energy.\nThis quarter at renewables, we saw continued signs of progress. We've talked about the IRA as a game changer, providing greater near-term and long-term demand certainty. We're already seeing this play out with significantly better visibility into our commercial pipeline over the next several years compared to this time just a year ago. Orders nearly doubled, led by Grid with strong growth across the businesses, including 2 large HVDC orders needed to connect new renewable sources to the Grid. Onshore equipment orders also increased with North America growing more than threefold. Revenues rut mid-single digits organically, driven primarily by grid and offshore wind.\nLooking at services, excluding repower, core services grew again on both orders and revenue. We saw both sequential and year-over-year profit improvement driven by price and cost reduction benefits primarily at Onshore and Grid. To break it down by business, in Grid, we're clearly making progress. All 3 businesses saw strong top line growth with continued productivity gains in the first quarter, and we remain on track to achieve modest profitability for the full year.\nAt Onshore, we're executing the strategy we shared with you in March. Focusing on select markets with a simplified range of product offerings, this in turn is yielding better margins in our backlog for longer-term profitable growth. And this quarter, we saw both sequential and year-over-year margin improvement, mostly in U.S. equipment. And we continue to drive pricing with positive price/cost. Our proactive fleet enhancement program is now roughly 20% complete.\nAt the same time, we're still rationalizing our Onshore cost structure. As mentioned last quarter, headcount is down roughly 20% relative to last summer with more to do. And this has already begun to generate some savings.\nIn Offshore, we're managing our existing Haliade-X backlog. This quarter, revenue more than doubled as we produced more nacelles. As discussed in March, we still expect Offshore to remain a near-term challenge as we execute our initial projects and improve our learning curve, both in terms of product cost and operational capabilities. Scott and the team are laser-focused on managing project costs and disbursements while improving our underwriting processes. Looking ahead for renewables overall, we're expecting a second quarter loss roughly in line with the first quarter.\nWe continue to expect significant second half improvement year-over-year in Onshore Wind, which will be partially offset by Offshore Wind. As we said in March, we see an inflection to profitability from renewables in '24 from higher U.S. volume, price and continued cost out. Moving to Power. We delivered another quarter of solid growth, led by Gas Power, including both equipment and services. This business is a long-term cash generator and will help fund future growth at GE Vernova.\nStarting with the market, GE Gas Turbine utilization grew low single digits despite a milder winter in many markets, providing stable baseload power to customers transitioning from coal to gas or needing new power for electrification. We also continue to invest for the long term, including decarbonization pathways that will provide customers with cleaner, more reliable power.\nFocusing on the quarter, Power delivered solid top line growth with services up 8% organically, driven by Gas Power heavy-duty gas turbine transactional services and aero derivatives. Equipment revenue grew double digits as we shipped 5 more HDGT units compared to last year. This included 2 incremental HA units adding to our large gas installed base, which will serve us for years to come.\nMargins expanded despite a higher mix of HDGT equipment sales. We continue to manage inflationary pressures with price and continued productivity gains. Looking beyond the quarter, similar to last year, we see roughly 70% to 75% of Power's total year profit in the second half based on higher expected gas outage volume. Overall Power remains on track to deliver on its '23 commitments, including strong cash conversion.\nIn summary, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making across GE Vernova. With the secular tailwinds, the impact of lean and our investments in the portfolio, I see tremendous value creation opportunity for years to come.\nSo to wrap up on Slide 7. The GE team is off to an encouraging start in '23 and our progress continues. Our missions at both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova matter to the world, and we're crystal clear on how we plan to deliver on them.\nGE Aerospace has a bold vision to define the future of flight. With nearly 3 billion people flying with our engines under wing last year, this exceptional franchise is growing amidst the pronounced industry ramp.\nAt GE Vernova, as the world looks to accelerate efforts to decarbonize and electrify, we're uniquely positioned with our solutions, which provide 30% of the world's electricity today. Our renewables business is showing continued signs of progress with clearly more to do, while Power continues to deliver solid growth. Simply put, we're improving how we operate, how we innovate and how we deliver for our customers. I couldn't be more excited about the future and where we're going.",

(Operator Instructions) My name is Liz, and I will be your conference coordinator today. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\n\nSteven Eric Winoker\n\nVP of IR, General Electric Company\n\nThanks, Liz. Welcome to GE's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Call. I'm joined by Chairman and CEO, Larry Culp; and CFO, Carolina Dybeck-Happe.\nKeep in mind that some of the statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes.\nAs a reminder, GE completed the separation of our HealthCare business this month. GE HealthCare will report separately on January 30. So while included in our 2022 results, we're focusing today's commentary primarily on GE Aerospace and GE Vernova, our portfolio of energy businesses. Our remarks will also be simpler and shorter today, reflecting the company we are now, and we'll move more quickly to Q&A.\nI'll now hand the call over to Larry.\n\nH. Lawrence Culp\n\nChairman & CEO, General Electric Company\n\nSteve, thank you, and good morning, everyone. 2022 marked the beginning of a new era for GE, following 4 years of strategic and operational transformation. We successfully separated GE HealthCare in a spin-off, distributing approximately 80% to GE shareholders on January 3. We strengthened our foundation, retiring an additional $11 billion of debt, bringing our total debt reduction over $100 billion since 2018. We continue to improve our operations, further embedding Lean and decentralization to better serve our customers. And today, excluding GE HealthCare Services -- which are both higher-margin and more resilient, represented an even larger part of our portfolio, about 60% of revenues and 85% of our backlog.\nWe finished the year strong, delivering revenue growth, margin expansion and better cash generation. GE Aerospace led the way as we executed on an unprecedented ramp. Within GE Vernova, Power delivered with continued stability at Gas, and we took significant actions to position Renewable Energy for future profitability.\nExternal catalysts like U.S. climate legislation and the European focus on accelerating electrification are increasing investment in new decarbonization technologies. This progress has positioned us to create industry-leading, investment-grade, independent public companies.\nThanks to our team's high-quality work, our plans to launch GE Vernova and GE Aerospace are progressing well. We're filling key leadership positions for both, and we're preparing for 2 stand-alone businesses. We'll share more details with you, including our ongoing progress and time line for the planned GE Vernova spin, at our Investor Conference in March.\nI could not be more proud of how the GE team managed through a challenging external environment to deliver for our customers and partners in 2022. My thanks to everyone.\nAnd before I turn the call over to Carolina, a moment of reflection. Just 2 weeks ago, I, along with many of our leadership team, attended a memorial service for our exemplary GE Board member and former U.S. Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter. Ash was a remarkable leader, incredibly humble and clear-headed. We miss him and his sage counsel.\nNow Carolina will take you through our results.\n\nCarolina Dybeck Happe\n\nSenior VP & CFO, General Electric Company\n\nThanks, Larry. Turning to Slide 3. I'll speak to the key drivers of our performance, I'll do it on an organic basis and including GE HealthCare.\nIn the fourth quarter, top line momentum continued as orders grew significantly across all segments. Revenue was up 11%, with services up 13%.\nBy segment. Revenue at Aerospace, Power and HealthCare was up double digits, driven by market demand, price realization and improving delivery. This was partially offset by Renewables largely due to lower volume resulting from U.S. PTC lapse and our heightened commercial selectivity. Adjusted margin expanded 290 basis points. Power was particularly robust, offsetting Renewables. Overall, our price and cost-out actions outpaced inflation.\nRevenue and profit growth resulted in over 50% EPS growth. Free cash flow was $4.3 billion, primarily driven by strong earnings and improving working capital. All accounts were a source of cash except receivables, which, as expected, was a use from revenue growth.\nMoving to the full year. Orders were up 7%, with 22% growth in Aerospace and 13% growth in Power. Total services orders were up 12%, supporting profitable growth in 2023. Revenue was up 6%, largely driven, again, by aerospace, up 23%. More broadly, higher-margin services were up double digits, while total equipment revenue decreased 4%.\nCollectively, supply chain headwinds and macro pressures impacted our performance by about 4 points. Importantly, margins, EPS and free cash flow all significantly improved year-over-year and finished in line or above the most recent outlook we shared in October.\nAdjusted margin expanded 160 basis points, led by Aerospace and Power. Robust services growth, pricing, plus almost $1.5 billion of cost-out actions drove improvement. This was partially offset by inflationary pressures especially at our shorter-cycle businesses and pressure from Renewables.\nOperating profit growth and debt reduction drove EPS up more than 50% for the full year. Free cash flow was $4.8 billion, up over $2 billion or over 80% improvement, driven by earnings and reduced debt. In 2022, working capital was a source of cash as accounts payable, progress collections and contract assets all contributed to the solid performance.\nNow a moment on corporate. In 2021, we ended the year with $1.2 billion of costs. We continued to reduce costs in 2022, including a few hundred million dollars of market-driven favorability. We now have a smaller, leaner cost structure. And in 2023, we expect costs of about $600 million or roughly half of the 2021 baseline. Free cash flow, we expect to improve significantly given our progress with debt reduction and lower costs.\nWe continue to execute our restructuring plans and reduce our cost structure post the HealthCare spin, setting up fit-for-purpose, stand-alone structures for GE Aerospace and GE Vernova. Stepping back, we're encouraged by our improved volume and pricing and our significant cost-out actions exiting the quarter. This will help us drive continued growth in 2023.\nNow back to you, Larry, to discuss our businesses.\n\nH. Lawrence Culp\n\nChairman & CEO, General Electric Company\n\nCarolina, thank you. Starting with Aerospace. I'm 6 months in leading this business, and my conviction is even higher today that we have a premier franchise with highly differentiated product and technology positions and leading positions in attractive commercial and military sectors.\nEntering 2022, our priority was delivering on the significant growth across both engines and services, where stability and predictability are critically important for our customers. This starts with the right team. We have a balance of unparalleled experience and fresh perspective with nearly half our leaders new to their roles this year.\nWe're also driving 2 major operational changes. First is accelerating our progress with Lean to improve operating rigor and delivery. Take supply chain, where we've seen real improvements with more to come.\nOur team in Terre Haute produces LEAP turbine center frames and started '22 with about 50 pieces delinquent. Working through multiple Kaizens, implementing flows, standard work and daily management, the team's Lean actions increased output over 20% and improved productivity by about 10%. And today, they are on schedule. With our 2023 demand, we'll need to continue to use Lean in this way to deliver for our customers.\nThe second is decentralization. For example, in our Commercial Engines business, we're increasingly running our product lines as their own P&Ls, in line with how our customers work with us. More cross-functional collaboration in real time closer to the customer helps make us better.\nTurning to the quarter. Both orders and revenue were up over 20%. Equipment orders were robust, now with almost 10,000 LEAP engines in backlog. Commercial services and equipment revenue grew about 30%, and Military revenue was up about 20%, and services internal shop visits were up 25% and external part sales were up more than 20%. In equipment, commercial units were up nearly 30% with LEAP units up almost to 50%.\nLooking sequentially, both internal shop visits and commercial units were about flat, but military units were up 10%. While material availability continues to be a challenge, our output across engines and services, we're using our Lean tools to help accelerate sequential improvement, a key for us this year.\nFourth quarter margins were above 18%, slightly better than we expected, although down year-over-year. Higher volume and price were more than offset by negative mix, driven by increased commercial equipment shipments, continued investment to support the business growth and other cost pressures. While still net price/cost positive, we expect inflation will continue to be challenging in 2023.\nFor the year, revenue was up 23%, driven by commercial sales with internal shop visits up over 20%. Profitability and cash were solid. Margins were 18.3%, up 440 basis points year-over-year. Services growth and positive price/cost more than offset the impact of increased investments and negative engine mix from higher LEAP deliveries. Free cash flow of $4.9 billion was driven by earnings and working capital. As we shared last quarter, total in-year AD&A flow came in close to 0 versus last year, $0.5 billion of pressure.\nLooking ahead today, GE and CFM departures are close to 90% of '19 levels, and we expect to be back to '19 levels later this year. In '23, internal shop visits are expected to grow about 20% and external spare part sales are expected to increase. With Commercial Engines growing at about 20% and services at high teens to about 20%, plus Military growing at a high single-digit rate, we expect total Aerospace revenue to be in the mid-to-high teens. And we expect LEAP engine deliveries to grow about 50% in '23. We also expect to deliver profit of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion and higher free cash flow. Aligned to current airframe or aircraft delivery schedules, AD&A is expected to be about $0.5 billion outflow in 2023.\nWe're laser-focused on supporting our air framers, airlines and lessors as they ramp post pandemic. Today, that means providing stability and predictability for our customers, keeping our current fleet flying and growing our new fleet, all the while continuing to invest in technologies that will define the future of flight.\nNotably, we're encouraged by the momentum at Military with our next-generation technology, including the XA100 engine for the F-35. The XA100 offers cutting-edge capabilities needed to ensure continued U.S. air superiority. The Adaptive Engine Transition Program received a strong show of support recently from nearly 50 bipartisan members of Congress who wrote in support of continuing the program, which includes our engine, with $286 million of funding included in the 2023 Omnibus Appropriations Bill.\nOverall, GE Aerospace is an exceptional franchise with a bright future as a stand-alone industry leader.\nTurning to the GE Vernova portfolio. Power delivered a solid performance this year, and we're making real progress running a similar strategy at Renewables. While the demand drop due to the PTC lapse significantly impacted our Renewables results in 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act is a real game-changer for us and the industry going forward.\nIn fact, we began to see a rebound in demand this quarter with Renewables orders up 7%. Onshore orders in North America more than doubled, a very encouraging sign. But unlocking the full potential of the IRA will hinge on how quickly the administration moves through implementation.\nMeanwhile, lower volumes and inflationary pressures continued to weigh on our performance. Fourth quarter revenue was down 13% due to Onshore, and margins contracted as inflation and lower volumes offset pricing and productivity gains. Full year free cash flow declined over $0.5 billion due to lower earnings.\nSo while we await clarity on the IRA rules, Scott and the team are controlling the controllable, taking action. And we saw progress in that regard this quarter.\nGrid, a business that lost close to $400 million in 2021, was profitable for the first quarter since 2018, reflecting our restructuring and selectivity efforts. Orders also grew significantly.\nAt Onshore, we're executing a restructuring with our headcount decreasing almost 20% sequentially, which will deliver savings in 2023. Our strategic sourcing actions at Onshore and our focus on reducing product variants will improve product costs despite continued inflationary pressures.\nAcross the businesses, orders and sales pricing continue to improve with our selectivity strategy yielding a more profitable backlog and pipeline. Service orders and revenues, excluding repower, grew. There's certainly more work to do and the next 6 months will remain challenging, but we're acting with urgency. In 2023, we expect mid-single-digit growth, significantly better profit, and flat to improving free cash flow.\nTaking it by the business. Onshore. We expect more than 50% orders growth in North America this year. And based on the orders we have in hand, we're confident of delivering over 2,000 units globally with North American volume more than doubling in the second half versus the first half of the year. We also expect a significant step-up in profit driven by lower warranty and related reserves, better price and restructuring benefits.\nWith this significant orders growth comes roughly $3 billion to $4 billion of cash down payments this year. This includes $0.5 billion of cash linked to large tech selects we've won which we expect to convert to orders later this year. These are strong customer commitments, but given the project size and complexity, timing could shift somewhat across quarters.\nIn Offshore, we expect to more than double revenue from about $0.5 billion in 2022. However, our margins on the first tranche of Haliade-X projects will be challenging between typical new product margins and inflation, resulting in rising losses. Associated with the delivery growth and limited down payments, we also expect cash will be significantly pressured in 2023 in Offshore, mostly a timing dynamic.\nAnd at Grid, given our robust orders growth, we expect continued growth. The actions we've taken on price are expected to offset inflation pressures, and we continue to make progress, including our small -- our smaller cost structure and productivity. Taken together, this will enable Grid to deliver a modestly profitable year in 2023.\nOverall, I'm confident we're seeing operating improvements throughout the year in Renewables. And key external catalysts, like the IRA, will help improve our longer-term economic profile here.\nMoving to Power. We've significantly improved Power, which is demonstrated by our continued profit and cash growth. We're well positioned for continued services growth with our expanded HA fleet. To date, we've now shipped 110 HAs with roughly 80 units COD, providing a reliable source of cash growth in the future as our highest utilization assets in the fleet.\nLooking at the quarter, Power demand remained robust, orders grew in all businesses and revenue was up double digits, largely driven by continued aeroderivative momentum at Gas Power. Services were also solid with orders and revenue up again driven by Gas transactional services. Margins expanded over 700 basis points driven by significant Gas volume, favorable price/cost and productivity gains. Similar to Aerospace, we expect inflation will remain challenging through 2023.\nMoving to the full year, orders were up double digits. But importantly, we're not taking our eye off selectivity with disciplined underwriting. In line with our outlook, revenue was up low single digits, led by services. Margins expanded 300 basis points, enabling Power to achieve high single-digit margin for the year. And our free cash flow improved significantly across both Gas and Steam. At Gas, service billings were strong as fleet utilization grew low single digits.\nLooking to 2023 for Power. We expect low single-digit revenue growth driven by Gas Power services. Equipment revenue will grow as we deliver more HAs despite the new build wind down at steam. And we anticipate profit improving slightly year-over-year. At Gas, both equipment and services volume as well as productivity gains and price should help offset rising inflation pressure. We expect lower free cash flow year-over-year. Continued earnings growth and strong services collections are offset by disbursements, but we expect free cash flow conversion to remain solid.\nStepping back. Our existing technologies in the GE Vernova portfolio will play an important role in the energy transition. It's the strategic imperative to electrify and decarbonize the world, is the challenge that these businesses with their vast installed bases were made to meet.\nLet's turn now to the overall GE outlook for 2023. We're expecting organic revenue growth in the high single-digit range; $1.60 to $2 for adjusted EPS, which includes about $4.2 billion to $4.8 billion of adjusted profit; and a range of $3.4 billion to $4.2 billion for free cash flow.\nUnderpinning this outlook is a higher services concentration in our portfolio as well as our confidence in the strength of GE Aerospace as the worldwide commercial aviation industry, airlines and airframers alike, continues its post-pandemic recovery. We also anticipate Military revenue growth, thus yielding significant profit growth for GE Aerospace in '23.\nFor GE Vernova, we expect low to mid-single-digit growth and profit of negative $600 million to negative $200 million, including improvement at both businesses. On cash, we expect flat to slight improvement. This is driven largely by better profitability and planned down payments in Onshore, where timing could shift across quarters with some offset from Offshore increasing deliveries.\nAcross GE, we expect continued operational improvements to deliver higher earnings and improved working capital management. In turn, this will help us drive higher free cash flow for GE in '23.\nWe're looking forward to sharing more during our March 9 Investor Conference at GE Aerospace in Cincinnati, by then hopefully, home of the Super Bowl champion Bengals, where you'll hear more detail from our leadership teams about both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova. Please come see us.\nTo close on Slide 8, I hope you see what I see: Strong results, a simpler story and an exciting future.\nAt GE Aerospace, continuous improvement is our mantra, and our results reflect our team, our technology and our portfolio's unique positioning as the industry's largest and youngest fleet. At GE Vernova, Power is delivering solid earnings and cash, while we're setting up Renewables to drive longer-term profitable growth.\nWe're moving forward with our plans to launch 2 independent investment-grade industry leaders that are well positioned to create long-term growth as we shape the future of flight and lead the energy transition. And I'm confident that we'll unlock greater value for our customers and our shareholders in the year ahead.\nNow we're ready for questions. Steve?\n\nSteven Eric Winoker\n\nVP of IR, General Electric Company\n\nThanks, Larry. (Operator Instructions) We ask that you please save any GE HealthCare questions until their earnings call next week. Liz, can you please open the line?",

(Operator Instructions) My name is Denise, and I will be your conference coordinator today. (Operator Instructions) If you experience issues with the slides refreshing or there appears to be delays in the slide's advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\n\nSteven Eric Winoker\n\nVP of IR, General Electric Company\n\nThanks, Denise, and welcome to GE's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm joined, as usual, by Chairman and CEO, Larry Culp; and CFO, Carolina Dybeck Happe. GE HealthCare's CEO, Pete Arduini, is also here with us to share insights on pre-spin progress and performance.\nKeep in mind that some of the statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Larry.\n\nH. Lawrence Culp\n\nChairman & CEO, General Electric Company\n\nSteve, thank you, and good morning, everyone. We're building broad-based momentum, and GE delivered solid third quarter results with Aerospace leading the way.\nWithin GE Vernova, Power remains on track to grow this year, and we took significant actions this quarter to reset Renewable Energy for future profitability. And external catalysts, like the recent U.S. climate legislation and the European energy crisis, are increasing investment in new decarbonization technologies, helping position this business for longer-term profitable growth.\nOur planned spins are on track with GE HealthCare ready to launch in January and GE Vernova in early 2024. GE HealthCare is in the home stretch now. I'm particularly proud of what they've accomplished: Navigating COVID, bringing in a new CEO and CFO and now preparing to operate as an independent global leader in precision health. Pete Arduini is with us today to give you a full update.\nNow a moment on GE Aerospace. I'm really excited to be leading this exceptional franchise, especially during this unprecedented industry ramp. We have a tremendously talented team, a highly differentiated product and technology portfolio and leading positions in attractive commercial and military sectors. And we have leaders that nicely balance unparalleled experience and fresh perspective as nearly half are new to their roles in the last year. Our high-caliber team includes Russell Stokes leading our Commercial Engine business; Amy Gowder, who runs our Military business; and Rahul Ghai, who recently joined as CFO.\nIn that same vein, I'd like to recognize Shane Wright, who's retiring after 34 years of service. His many contributions across GE and GE Aerospace have been invaluable and helped build a world-class business and team. Shane, thank you.\nThe opportunity and the imperative to embrace lean more deeply, both within our 4 walls and with our partners, suppliers and customers, has really stood out to me over the last several months. We've been taking a harder look at our operating rhythms, moving toward a more frequent weekly and monthly cadence for each of our P&Ls. This has helped us manage the business in real time and deliver better, faster and more efficiently in what is clearly a dynamic environment.\nThe process capability improvements are real. Taking last quarter's example, the additional 20% of existing engineers that we reprioritized to support delivery. Through daily management, they're helping solve problems closer to the point of impact faster, and that's improving engine deliveries.\nEngine output was up double digits sequentially, with LEAP units up over 50% sequentially, a credit to the entire team, especially those in our supply chain organization. However, the post pandemic recovery requires continued sequential improvements for the foreseeable future, which our lean efforts will help us deliver.\nWe have a similar story in services, where internal shop visits grew 10% sequentially and more than 30% year-over-year. Lean helps us reduce cycle time, improve turnaround time and generate capacity for more. In addition to strengthening our operating rhythms to meet this extraordinary industry demand, we updated our strategic plan last month with an eye toward how we continue to shape the future of flight for years to come.\nThe quality of our technology and product roads, coupled with the energy and collaboration in the room, have me even more excited about what this business will become when it's a stand-alone aerospace leader. First things first, of course, with respect to the post-COVID ramp. But this is a business with an exceptional future.\nTurning to total company results on Slide 3. Orders declined 7%, driven by a tough comp at Renewables against prior year megadeals in Onshore Wind. Excluding Renewables, orders were up 8% and positive across all segments. Revenue was up 7% with particular strength in services, up 20%.\nLooking at the segments. Aerospace and HealthCare were both up double digits as the market recovery continued and our pricing and delivery actions took hold. This was offset by Power down mid-single digits and Renewables down 10%, largely due to lower U.S. volumes resulting from the PTC lapse and our heightened new business selectivity.\nCollectively, supply chain and macro pressures adversely affected revenue by about 4 percentage points in the quarter, easing slightly again. Adjusted operating margin declined 190 basis points. Strength at Aerospace from volume and price was more than offset by Renewables, which included about $500 million of higher warranty and related reserves tied to fleet performance, which we'll address shortly. Excluding this impact, margin expanded by 80 basis points. HealthCare improved sequentially and Power decline year-over-year due largely to planned service outage seasonality.\nAdjusted EPS was down. Excluding the $0.40 Renewables reserve, EPS was $0.75. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion, largely driven by strong adjusted earnings. We've continued to build inventory as we prepare for the fourth quarter ramp and continue to work through ongoing supply chain challenges. All in all, I'm pleased with how the GE team has continued to navigate a tough operating environment.\nAnd for the year, we're maintaining our prior outlook for revenue, trending toward the low end of our high single-digit growth range. We now expect 125 to 150 basis points of operating margin expansion and $2.40 to $2.80 for EPS. This is primarily driven by the higher warranty and related reserves at Renewables this quarter. And aligned with the color we shared in the second quarter, we're expecting free cash flow this year of about $4.5 billion.\nTurning to GE Vernova. Power is a stable cash generator, as gas utilization grows, our ongoing focus on services at Steam take root, the continued turnaround progress at Power Conversion and innovation at Nuclear.\nNow more on Renewables, where we've all been disappointed with our year-to-date performance. Our proven leadership, with Scott Strazik and his team at the helm, is leveraging the lessons from their Power playbook to transform Renewables' fundamentals. Let me break down how we're going to improve performance there. Recall, we look at this in 3 parts: Onshore Wind, Offshore Wind and Grid. I'll take those in reverse order.\nGrid is a $3 billion business which will be the first to profitability. Market demand in automation and hardware remains strong. This year, we expect double-digit orders growth, and thanks to our cost efforts, significant margin expansion; along with profitability here in the fourth quarter, setting up 2023 as a profitable year for grid.\nAt Offshore, we're transitioning from a new product investment into a business with roughly $1 billion of revenue, and growing. The roughly 80 turbines we installed and commissioned for EDF recently were on schedule. And we're now shifting to the 7-gigawatt Haliade-X backlog, knowing our initial 200 deliveries will be challenging financially in an inflationary environment. But as we move to the next tranche of projects and reduce cost, we expect to approach profitability in Offshore in the mid-20s.\nFinally, Onshore is a $9 billion revenue business, more than 60% of the segment today and most of the operating loss. This is the battleground. Overall, for Renewables, we expect to achieve profitability in 2024.\nWe've quickly innovated in the fast-growing onshore wind industry, introducing larger turbines to provide leading performance and competitive project economics for customers. Since 2017, we've added over 40 gigawatt to the grid, increasing megawatt hours per turbine significantly. However, like much of the industry, such rapid innovation strains manufacturing and the broader supply chain. It takes time to stabilize production and quality on these new products, which in turn pressures fleet availability. We need to industrialize faster to counteract these dynamics, and we are.\nFirst, we're drastically simplifying and standardizing too many variants into what we call workhorse products, so we and our suppliers can implement more repeatable manufacturing processes. This enhances product quality and reduces cost. In our existing fleet, we're deploying corrective measures, enhancements and monitor and repair programs to deliver high 90s availability consistently. We expect to implement the corrective measures associated with these warranty and related reserves over the next couple of years. With fleet availability as our true north, we'll continue to be a leader and deliver for our customers.\nSecond, as we've talked about in the past, we're being more selective about where we play, going after fewer markets where we have the right product and service capabilities and can execute profitably, including focusing more on equipment-only projects. We're also seeing improvement in both orders and sales pricing.\nThird, we're reducing fixed costs. We're decreasing global headcount in Onshore wind by about 20% and more broadly delayering at Renewable Energy. Across GE Vernova, we're expecting about $500 million of annualized savings from a $600 million restructuring program we plan to implement over the next few years.\nReflecting on the broader market. When we spoke just 90 days ago, the prospect of significant U.S. climate legislation this year was unlikely. Recent months have been game-changing. The Inflation Reduction Act provides much-needed certainty and stability for us and our customers, especially in onshore wind. The bill's $370 billion in tax credits over the next decade aligned tightly with GE's decarbonization technologies. Additionally, the Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act provides at least $75 billion for investment in grid, nuclear and breakthrough technologies.\nIn Europe, we're seeing more urgency and pragmatism to reduce emissions and make energy more resilient. Take the new European taxonomy which reinforces the important role of gas and nuclear alongside renewables. As Europe looks to swiftly address energy security concerns, customers want to engage GE's full technology road map, including wind, gas fuel blends and grid.\nWhile these external catalysts won't factor into our results overnight, they improve the demand and economic profile for our businesses remarkably. To that end, we see a robust future in contrast to the current orders troughed. Altogether, we're at a significant inflection point for onshore and Renewables overall. While we expect Renewables to achieve profitability in 2024, a about a year later than planned previously, we remain very excited about GE Vernova's future.\nWith that, let me hand it over to Carolina.\n\nCarolina Dybeck Happe\n\nSenior VP & CFO, General Electric Company\n\nThanks, Larry. Turning to Slide 5. I'll share the insights from the quarter on an organic basis. While orders were down 7%, revenue was up high single digits with double-digit growth in Aerospace and HealthCare. Equipment declined 6% with continued U.S. Onshore volume pressure and a largely planned decrease at Power. On a sequential basis, revenue increased more than $0.5 billion as we're making progress on our second half ramp.\nServices were the bright spot with orders and revenue up double digits and growth across all segments. Aerospace led the way with orders up 28% and revenue up 33% as market demand remained strong. Recall services represent half of our revenue and an even larger percentage of our backlog.\nOverall, adjusted margin contracted 190 basis points. This was largely driven by the Renewables reserves which impacted margin by 270 basis points. Meaning, if we exclude this, margin would have expanded 80 basis points.\nOur actions are taking hold, and we are seeing early signs of supply chain easing. Volume, together with price, contributed almost 300 basis points of margin expansion, offsetting headwinds from inflation and logistics costs. Aerospace was a major contributor, up 280 basis points with strength in services.\nAdjusted EPS was down $0.18. Excluding the renewables reserves, it would have been up $0.22. Continuing EPS was negative, primarily driven by an insurance transaction, which I'll cover momentarily, and increased separation costs, as expected.\nRegarding our updates to the margin and EPS outlook. We are now including additional pressure from the elevated warranty and related reserves at Renewables. About half of this charge is incremental to our prior view. We also expect to offset HealthCare pressure largely due to inflation and investments with strength in the other businesses.\nMoving to cash. We generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion. Strong adjusted earnings contributed to this. Working capital, again, had a very limited impact on free cash flow despite high single-digit growth this quarter.\nLooking at the dynamics. First, receivables, the use of cash. Our terms were focused on collecting the accounts receivable from second quarter, improving year-over-year DSO by 2 days. But deliveries continue to occur later in the quarter, resulting in high quarter-end receivable balance. Inventory was also a use of cash. This is typical as we build for significant fourth quarter volume, leading to inventory and accounts payable growth. Progress was a source mainly due to the timing of down payments. Contract assets was also a source. Continued strength in Aerospace and Gas Power utilization drove billings.\nAD&A was positive $300 million. Given the year-to-date impact and our fourth quarter estimate aligned with the current airframer aircraft delivery schedules, we now expect full year AD&A flow to be about 0. Year-to-date, free cash flow is approximately $500 million.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect higher collections given the large receivables balance and reduced inventory due to the strong quarterly deliveries. So in line with typical seasonality and our operational efforts, fourth quarter cash flow will be significantly higher, and we expect free cash flow of about $4.5 billion for the year. This is aligned with the color we shared last quarter.\nNow a moment on corporate. Adjusted costs were down over 50% year-over-year. This was primarily driven by lower EHS and other costs and progress in functions and operations. For the year, we expect corporate costs of less than $700 million, which includes a few hundred million of favorability primarily from interest rate and FX dynamics.\nAs we prepare for the planned spin of GE HealthCare, we're looking at our corporate costs to ensure what remains is sized appropriately. Therefore, we plan to take restructuring actions to reflect today's reduced need for corporate-led activity and footprint. The program is expected to deliver roughly $450 million in annualized cost-out over the next few years with about $700 million of expense, the majority in the fourth quarter.\nAt Insurance, we further derisked our portfolio by terminating several reinsurance contracts. This reduces counterparty risk and improves administration, settling our receivable from the reinsurer in exchange for $2.5 billion of assets that we can deploy in our current investment strategy. Given the assets need to be transferred at fair market value and the current rate environment, this was an after-tax charge of roughly $300 million. We expect to recoup this over time as the assets mature. While excluded from our adjusted results, Insurance net income was roughly $250 million loss. And without the charge, was approximately positive $80 million.\nThis quarter, we also completed our annual LRT. As expected, this resulted in a positive margin with no impact to earnings. And this, for the third consecutive year.\nIn discontinued operations, we recorded charges of about $100 million in our runoff Polish BPH mortgage portfolio, primarily driven by unfavorable results for banks in ongoing litigation with borrowers. This brings total litigation reserves related to this matter to approximately $1.1 billion.\nNow turning to our businesses. Aerospace. Aerospace delivered a very strong quarter. Orders growth of 6% was driven by Services, while Equipment orders were down against a tough comp, especially in Military. Revenue was up 25%, led by substantial growth in Commercial Services, up 47%. This was driven by internal shop visit growth, strong spare part sales to our external MROs and favorable price. Commercial Engine revenue also grew significantly on higher shipments, both year-over-year and sequentially.\nLEAP shipments improved, up over 100 units sequentially, and we're starting to see better flow through our factories. Military revenue was down year-over-year, driven by lower shipments and engine mix. However, tangible improvements on T700s helped drive a sequential increase in engine units.\nSegment margin expanded 280 basis points, driven by Commercial Services growth and favorable price/cost. This more than offset negative mix from higher Commercial Engine shipments and increased growth investments. Based on strong year-to-date performance and continued improvement in services, we expect full year Aerospace margins to be high teens with greater than 20% top line growth. Overall, Aerospace's strong market growth and business fundamentals reinforce the significant long-term opportunity here.\nTurning to Renewables. Orders were down 40%. Recall, we had record orders last year due to Offshore where the project-driven profile remains uneven, making this a difficult comparison. Importantly, services, excluding Repower, grew double digits. And all Grid product lines grew.\nRevenue declined 10%. Over 2/3 was driven by lower U.S. volume at Onshore from the PTC lapse and our heightened new business selectivity. This more than offset Services growth of 40% and better pricing across many businesses. Segment margin declined significantly year-over-year, primarily driven by the warranty and related reserves at Onshore. The remainder of the decline was driven by lower U.S. volume at Onshore and net inflation pressure in all businesses. Excluding Onshore though, all businesses improved reported profitability year-over-year.\nWhile we previously included about half of this elevated reserve in our full year expectations, the incremental impact this quarter is pressure versus our prior view. We now expect an annual loss of about $2 billion. The IRA is a significant catalyst, medium to long term. However, near term, customers continue to defer investments into the future, impacting orders and associated cash.\nWhile 2022 has been disappointing, the actions we're taking, combined with the external catalysts we've discussed, puts us on a much stronger footing as we head into 2023.\nMoving to Power. As expected, we're managing through a lower CSA outage year, typical third quarter seasonality and second half timing dynamics for some equipment deliveries and service outages pushed to the fourth quarter.\nLooking at the market. Global gas generation and utilization grew mid-single digits year-to-date, with strength in Europe and in the U.S. While we continue to monitor gas prices and availability, gas remains a fuel of choice on dispatch curves globally to meet growing electricity demand.\nIn the third quarter, orders were up 20%. This was driven by higher HA and Aeroderivative units as gas and services growth in all businesses. Importantly, our team continues to prioritize disciplined underwriting and project selectivity as we build our installed base pipeline. And as we've said, equipment orders remain uneven quarter-to-quarter.\nRevenue declined 5%, primarily driven by Gas equipment and Steam, where we continue to exit our newbuild coal business. We shipped 2 fewer HAs and 2 fewer Aero units year-over-year. Meanwhile, services grew 6%, driven by Gas, where price and transactional services growth offset the lower expected CSA outage volume.\nSegment margin declined 100 basis points. This was mainly due to lower CSA outages and unfavorable equipment mix at Gas together more than offsetting the price escalation. At Steam, margins continued to improve, driven by selectivity and the associated cost-out.\nLooking at the fourth quarter. We continue to expect significant sequential and year-over-year growth in equipment and services. This sets Power up to deliver its outlook of low single-digit revenue growth and margin expansion. And Power remains on track for earnings growth and cash generation this year and next.\nNow I'm happy to welcome Pete, who will cover GE HealthCare.\n\nPeter J. Arduini\n\nSVP, General Electric Company\n\nThanks, Carolina. It's a pleasure to join you and Larry on the last earnings call before GE HealthCare's planned spin, which is on track for the first week of January.\nOur team has made excellent progress preparing GE HealthCare for its future as an independent public company. We achieved several milestones in recent months, including establishing our Board of Directors with deep healthcare expertise, diverse leadership and financial experience. I look forward to working with them as we hit the ground running together in GE Healthcare's next chapter of growth and value creation.\nAnother key step in the process was our public Form 10 filing. This important disclosure details our historical and pro forma financials for GE HealthCare at both the segment and total company level. We also disclosed our planned capital structure. We expect our go-forward financial policy will incorporate a strong investment-grade rating for the company. And while we expect to prioritize deleveraging near term, we believe our solid financial position provides us significant flexibility to continue to invest in the business.\nWe'll share more on our strategy at our December 8 Investor Day. My senior leadership team and I look forward to meeting with many of you and discussing our vision as we work to drive better outcomes for patients and productivities for customers in the years ahead.\nMoving to our performance. Overall, GE Healthcare delivered a strong quarter with sequential improvement. Top line growth across the business reflects the tireless work of our teams and partners to address supply chain constraints and improve product fulfillment. Market demand and backlog conversion remained positive despite inflationary and supply challenges that continue to impact the industry.\nWe're speaking with our customers regularly and watching their behavior closely. They have been impacted by higher costs, particularly around labor. This makes the imaging and ultrasound products we provide more important than ever based on their ability to deliver increased productivity for providers.\nLooking at customer trends. Global public spending in healthcare is solid, particularly in Europe and Asia. In the U.S., customers are taking a more cautious approach as they monitor the economic environment.\nOverall, continued patient demand is leading providers to invest in products and services that increase productivity and reduce operating cost, an important dynamic as healthcare systems modernized post-pandemic and prepare for increased demand longer term. That said, we're keeping a keen eye on provider performance and procedures, which continue to improve sequentially.\nLooking at the quarter. Orders increased 4% year-over-year with sequential growth. Service is strong, up low double digits. Equipment was negative due to our reclassification of certain upgrades from equipment to services, plus a tough comp year-over-year. Organic revenue was up 10% year-over-year with sequential growth. Equipment and Services were both up low double digits year-over-year and Imaging and Ultrasound were bright spots. Currency negatively impacted reported results by 5 points.\nNear term, we're focused on commercial execution improvements and NPI launches. Notably, GE HealthCare recently topped the FDA's list of authorized artificial intelligence and machine learning-enabled medical devices. Our commitment to innovation continues, with quarterly R&D spend up double digits year-over-year, helping us accelerate our long-term growth plans.\nSegment margins declined to 15.4% year-over-year due to ongoing supply and inflation impacts. Sequential margins have improved since the first quarter, driven by higher volume, price and a continued focus on reducing costs. We've now delivered 2 consecutive quarters of positive price and orders price which also remains positive.\nWe've been offsetting supply constraints by embedding Lean throughout our business. One way we monitor supply dynamics is through red flags, identifying lines of -- at risk of a shortage if not replenished within 10 days. And these have declined nearly 40% since last quarter. We've also broadened our supply base and requalified and redesigned over 7,000 parts, driving positive results. While challenging, we expect supply chain pressures to improve for the remainder of '22 and into '23.\nWith the spin approaching, we thought it would be helpful to provide some color on GE HealthCare's cash performance. Keeping in mind our customer needs, we work with suppliers to stock up on critical inventory year-to-date and continue to manage inventory in an inflationary environment. In total, our quarterly free cash flow grew slightly year-over-year and sequentially. Our actions leave us confident that we can meet fourth quarter customer demand.\nFor the full year, we still expect mid-single-digit revenue growth. At the same time, higher inflation, currency and investments are impacting operating profit, which we now expect to be $2.6 billion or more. And we expect free cash flow in a range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion, based on the higher inventory build to meet demand in the fourth quarter and into 2023.\nIn closing, our team is highly energized as we approach this new chapter. We're confident, and the planned spin will unlock significant shareholder value, enabling us to prioritize R&D investment, grow faster and optimize our operating model.\nAnd so with that, Larry, I'll hand it back over to you.\n\nH. Lawrence Culp\n\nChairman & CEO, General Electric Company\n\nPete, thank you. I share your excitement. I think we're going to have some fun.\nI'd like to close on Slide 12. GE continued to build momentum in the third quarter. Aerospace delivered a very strong quarter. Renewables is taking action to reset for profitable growth. Power remains on track for stable earnings and cash. And HealthCare, as Pete just outlined, improved performance.\nLean and decentralization are the key enablers of this momentum, driving safety, quality, delivery and cost improvements which serve as the foundation of all we do at GE. And these improvements are sustainable. Take my 2021 kaizen week team at Lynn. 1 year later, the team has enhanced our closed-loop machining process on the T700 midframe. Now while there's always more to do, this process is delivering close to 100% first-time yields compared to about 60% previously.\nReal lean sticks, and we're scaling it across lines, sites and businesses. And with that Lean foundation, GE continues to lead with innovation. At Aerospace, we completed testing on our second XA100 adaptive cycle engine, partnering with the U.S. Air Force. It's an innovative engine that pairs power with efficiency.\nHealthCare made further progress in the home care space, expanding its AliveCor relationship and announcing a new collaboration with AMC Health to enable remote patient monitoring.\nAnd Power secured an order from Kindle Energy to provide HA class power generation equipment. This will help support Louisiana's ongoing energy transition, initially fueled by natural gas, with the ability to use up to 50% hydrogen by volume.\nIt's clear our businesses are creating a smarter and more efficient future of flight, driving decarbonization through the energy transition and enabling precision healthcare. And we're set to unleash their full potential through our plans to launch 3 independent investment-grade industry leaders, starting with GE HealthCare in just 2 short months.\nSteve, with that, let's go to questions.\n\nSteven Eric Winoker\n\nVP of IR, General Electric Company\n\nThanks, Larry.

(Operator Instructions) My name is Cheryl, and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\n\nSteven Eric Winoker\n\nVP of IR, General Electric Company\n\nThanks, Cheryl. Welcome to GE's Second Quarter '22 Earnings Call. I'm joined by Chairman and CEO, Larry Culp; and CFO, Carolina Dybeck Happe.\nKeep in mind that some of the statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Larry.\n\nH. Lawrence Culp\n\nChairman & CEO, General Electric Company\n\nThanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone.\nGE delivered a strong second quarter with growth in orders, revenue and profit as well as positive free cash flow. Aerospace was the key driver and services remain a bright spot of performance. While this remains the toughest operating environment I've seen, I am proud of how the GE team is taking action to deliver.\nI'll start this morning with an update on our plans to launch our strong franchises as 3 independent investment-grade industry leaders. It's now been 259 days since we shared this intent. We're on track and making good progress. Just last week, we unveiled the new branding of our 3 companies: GE Aerospace, GE Healthcare and GE Vernova, which will comprise our portfolio of energy businesses, including renewable energy, power and digital. The names leverage GE's multibillion-dollar global brand and deep customer trust, giving us competitive advantage in our end markets.\nWe also achieved several key milestones on the Healthcare spin, which will go first in early '23. We plan to file our confidential Form 10 shortly. Our team submitted its request for a private letter ruling to the IRS, an important step to achieve tax-free spin-off. We completed consultation with our European Works Council, allowing us to move forward with a number of critical employee actions globally, including adding key talent in support of the new company. We announced that GE Healthcare will trade on the NASDAQ, and I'm excited about the Board we're assembling for GE Healthcare and look forward to sharing more with you soon once finalized.\nWe're focused on building out our leadership team broadly to support the success of each of the standalone businesses. I'm thrilled to now be leading a very talented team at Aerospace including John Slattery, who has been named Chief Commercial Officer; Russell Stokes, now leading Commercial Engines and Services, Amy Gowder, leading Military Systems; and Rahul Ghai, who will join us next month as the business' CFO. And just last week, we announced Eric Gray as the new CEO of GE Gas Power, part of GE Vernova.\nI'm thankful for how the dedicated GE team has strengthened our financial and operating performance while advancing the spin-off plans. And I'm confident in our path to create 3 companies that will be well positioned for long-term growth.\nSo now let's turn to our results on Slide 3. I'm encouraged by the order revenue and profit growth and positive free cash we delivered this quarter despite continuing macro pressures. Orders were up 4%, supported by growth in both services and equipment. Aerospace led the way, up 26%.\nRevenue was up 5%, growing in 3 of our 4 segments. Aerospace was up double digits as the market recovery continued. Healthcare and Power were both up mid-single digits, and this was partially offset by Renewables, down double digits, reflecting lower U.S. volumes resulting from the PTC expiration as well as the business' international selectivity strategy. Our higher-margin services remained a bright spot, up double digits, led again by Aerospace.\nCollectively, supply chain and macro pressures adversely affected revenue by about 5 percentage points this quarter but eased slightly versus the previous quarter.\nAdjusted operating margin expanded 380 basis points, driven largely by higher services growth and our focus on pricing, with Aerospace and Power, sources of strength. Healthcare is stabilizing but still faces supply chain challenges and Renewables remains difficult.\nAdjusted EPS was up significantly, driven largely by Aerospace. Free cash flow was roughly $200 million and improved slightly year-over-year due to better adjusted earnings. This was offset by higher working capital tied to inventory build as we prepare for the second half ramp as well as work through the supply chain issues.\nOverall, this was a strong quarter for GE with orders, revenue, profit and cash all growing.\nNotwithstanding much is still uncertain about the external environment companies like GE are facing at the moment. We continue to trend toward the low end of our 2022 outlook on all metrics except cash. Working capital will be pressured as we protect customers from the impact of supply chain challenges as well as the timing of renewable energy-related orders, which together are likely to push out approximately $1 billion of free cash flow into the future. So fundamentally, a timing dynamic at work.\nWe're just starting our annual strategy and budgeting cycle for 2023. We still expect to deliver significant year-over-year improvement in both profit and cash, but below our prior view. With the world evolving so quickly, we have to see how the next 6 months unfold and expect to provide you our 2023 outlook in the usual time frame at fourth quarter earnings.\nTurning to Slide 4, starting with Aerospace and Healthcare. While demand remains robust, delivery has been a challenge for us, for the industry broadly and for our suppliers. What differentiates us is our Lean foundation, which we've built over the last several years.\nIn Aerospace, the industry is experiencing an unprecedented ramp as the pandemic eases coupled with labor and material shortages. The team and I spent time with our airframer and airline customers at the Farnborough Air Show just last week, talking about the need for predictability and stability across the entire ecosystem. We need to do better to deliver for our customers, and quality and delivery are our top priorities.\nLet me take a couple of minutes on the actions that we're taking. Starting with OE. On the left chart, you can see material issues trending, either from our suppliers or of our own making that are impacting production flow and ultimately, delivery. We recently allocated an additional 20% of our existing engineering team to help solve these issues faster. We're seeing impact moving parts along, but we need to do more and quickly, and we will. We're partnering with our suppliers holding kaizens at points of impact in their shops to help them reduce setup time, eliminate constraints, optimize transportation and improve overall flow to us. This is leading to increased supplier throughput, as much as 30% or more in some cases. Overall, we're seeing signs of improvement with engine output up sequentially.\nIn services, we use work stops to measure how often we need to interrupt a shop visit due to a lack of resources, primarily from delayed repairs, castings, forgings or labor constraints. The curve was beginning to bend in May and June, reflecting our efforts to ramp labor and improve overhaul cycle time.\nLast month, we held kaizen events at multiple GE sites around the world. John, Russell, Amy and I were all in Wales at our GE Aerospace MRO facility, where we overhaul both the CFM56 and GE90 engines. As we work to improve turnaround time for a steep CFM56 ramp, the kaizen focused on increasing overhaul capabilities from 3 to 4 engines per week.\nWhat I saw across our 7 kaizen teams in Wales was Lean in action, a clear focus on waste elimination and continuous improvement. For example, operators on my team shared with me how they spent 45 minutes searching for parts for what is often a 60-minute operation. By removing this waste, we improved turnaround time at Wales by 3 to 5 days, about a 5% reduction. These examples are everywhere at GE. Each one further increases the efficiency of our operations and improves our pace of delivery to customers.\nIn Healthcare, we continue to broaden and strengthen our supplier base and address inflation through price and cost actions. One way we monitor supply dynamics is through red flags, which identify the lines at risk of a shortage if not replenished within 10 days. The chart indicates our efforts are starting to yield improvements. But again, we need to do more.\nFor example, responding to the COVID-19-related factory shutdown in Shanghai, our PDx team took fast action and we were able to operate at full capacity within 10 weeks. In the interim, our Cork, Ireland PDx team used a kaizen to increase capacity in the first step of producing contrast media solutions, which help doctors better image patients. They reduced cycle time by over 20% lifting capacity by about 5 million doses annually, critical in a shortage.\nExamples like these support our confidence for higher output in the second half and in 2023. The actions we're taking not only help clear today's backlogs but build what our customers want, more predictable, shorter cycle times going forward.\nLooking at GE Vernova. In Renewables, it's been a disappointing first half, and we're working intensely focused on stabilizing the business. We're working the fundamentals with Scott and his team leveraging the power playbook that has delivered improved profitability and increased cash over the last 3 years.\nFirst, given the U.S. political environment, we're taking a more conservative view of the market for the time being. You've heard us talk about sizing gas power for a 20 to 30 gigawatt market. In Renewables, we're taking a similar strategy, assuming GE onshore wind output of about 2,000 turbines per year. One key difference in onshore, we aren't sizing ourselves to the market. We're sizing ourselves based on our refocused efforts on select geographies where we believe we can grow and grow profitably.\nLean and decentralization are core to the strategy. In Power, our first step was to decentralize, removing headquarters and other layers and driving full accountability closer to the customer. Using Lean, the team has implemented our live outage program that many of you saw firsthand in Greenville last March.\nAt Renewables, we're embedding similar principles, starting with reorganizing grid into 3 P&Ls and integrating horizontal functions such as commercial and services vertically into the businesses.\nNext, scope selectivity, stronger commercial underwriting and a focus on pricing has enabled Power to reduce risk and offset rising costs. We're turning to price escalation in our long-term service agreements where appropriate, and we're updating our project cost estimates more frequently to reflect our current reality.\nIn Renewables, while it won't be enough to offset the significant inflation pressure, we are making progress. Our pricing has substantially improved in onshore while continuing our focus on deal selectivity. Additionally, we're growing our higher-margin businesses, such as grid automation, which delivered double-digit orders growth.\nIn Power, we continue to invest in gas and steam services productivity while focusing on product cost competitiveness. At Renewables, we've introduced several new products, which we are working down the cost curve. These are larger, more innovative technologies that need to be industrialized for large-scale production. We're also proactively deploying improvements to our fleet that will enable long-term reliable performance from these high-tech products.\nFixed costs, frankly, a misnomer in my view because nothing is really fixed, is another critical element here. Over 3 years, we cut these costs in gas by approximately $1 billion. Based on international selectivity and a smaller North American market, we're taking a harder look at our Renewables cost structure, which we expect will yield significant savings.\nWe know from our Power experience that these actions at Renewables won't yield results immediately. But with this playbook, we expect the business to return to profitable growth over time. Combined with Power's progress and enhanced profitability and cash, we're excited about the future for GE Vernova.\nMoving to Slide 6. While driving operational improvements across our businesses, we're also focused on better serving our customers and innovating for the future. A few recent highlights. At Aerospace, our joint venture with Safran. CFM International was selected by Delta to deliver 200 CFM LEAP-1B engines to power its new fleet of Boeing 737-10 aircraft, with options for up to 60 additional engines. Qatar Airways also signed an agreement for installed and spare LEAP-1B engines to power the airline's new fleet of 25 737-10 aircraft.\nAt Healthcare, our recently announced partnership with Medtronic is enabling personalized care with the integration of 2 of Medtronic's continuous monitoring solutions with our precision monitoring platform. These capabilities allow clinicians to have access to real-time, reliable patient insights.\nAnd at Power, we celebrated the first HA gas turbine order in Vietnam. The new 9HA.02 combined cycle power plant is expected to improve the reliability and stability of the energy grid to support renewables penetration there.\nWe're also developing new products with innovation supported by our continued investment in R&D. For example, Digital announced the first solution resulting from its Opus One Solutions acquisition, distributed energy resource management system designed to help utilities keep the grid safe, secure and resilient while enabling energy affordability.\nSo in summary, I have great confidence in the actions we're taking and our path forward to drive sustained profitable growth.\nWith that, Carolina will provide further insights on the second quarter.\n\nSteven Eric Winoker\n\nVP of IR, General Electric Company\n\nThanks, Larry.\nDiving into the results. Turning to Slide 7, I'll share the highlights from the quarter on an organic basis. Orders were up 4% and revenue up 5%, with growth led by Aerospace. On a sequential basis, adjusted revenue improved $1.6 billion or 10%, a significant step-up reflecting progress towards our second half ramp. Services revenue was a particular strength in the quarter as we delivered double-digit service revenue growth compared to last year, with Aerospace leading the way, up 47%.\nEquipment declined 6%, driven by Renewables. Healthcare and Power equipment revenues were bright spots, with Healthcare up 5% despite supply constraints and Power up 18%, reflecting strong aero derivative shipments. Year-to-date, organic growth was 3%. Both quarter and year-to-date, this includes 5 points of pressure from supply chain disruptions, COVID impact in China and the Russia-Ukraine war with the latter contributing roughly 1 point of impact year-to-date.\nOn adjusted margin, both Aerospace and Power saw expansion overall as a result of the actions we're taking, focused on pricing drove more than 100 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. Services mix, particularly in Aerospace, contributed favorably. We also saw improved contract margin reviews for CMRs with strength from contractual escalations and engine utilization. Cost reductions were more than 150 basis points of year-over-year benefit, largely restructuring savings and some timing-related corporate benefit. Partly offsetting these improvements was approximately 200 basis points of margin headwinds from inflation and logistics costs, net of sourcing actions.\nIn Aerospace and Power, the net impact of price cost and inflation was positive. Healthcare and onshore wind both took steps to address cost and price, but it wasn't enough to offset the inflation.\nLastly, adjusted EPS was up about $0.56 or about 2.5x driven by profit growth plus lower interest expense from our debt reduction actions. About $0.15 of earnings was timing related that we either do not expect to repeat or had originally expected in the third quarter. Continuing EPS was negative, primarily driven by the unfavorable mark-to-market impact from our Baker Hughes and AerCap positions.\nIn total, we delivered a strong quarter marked by revenue up mid-single digits significant profit growth and margin expansion. These results and our focus on execution gives me confidence that we will achieve the low end of full year growth, profit and EPS outlook even in a tough environment. Year-to-date, we have delivered more than 1/3 of our EPS guide, in line with typical seasonality.\nMoving to cash. We generated $200 million of free cash flow driven by strong adjusted earnings, which was positive, excluding the mark-to-market impact previously mentioned. Despite a limited impact on free cash flow in the quarter, supply chain challenges are contributing to inventory pressure and later deliveries and billings.\nFirst, on working capital dynamics. Receivables for the use of cash driven by billings from sequential revenue growth and also pressured by later deliveries in the quarter. This was partially offset by collection strength, where we saw a 7-day DSO improvement year-over-year. Inventory up across all businesses was a large use of cash. A portion of this is typical, building for the second half volume growth leads to inventory and accounts payable growth with material resets outpacing disbursement.\nThis quarter, however, supply chain challenges also contributed to elevated inventory levels across inputs and outputs. Inputs were pressured by the impact on inflation and additional purchases needed to support second half deliveries for customers. For output, fulfillment challenges led to higher inventory.\nProgress was a source of cash, mainly due to Aerospace collections on equipment orders to support production. Contract assets was a use of cash. We saw continued strength in aerospace utilization, resulting in higher billings, offset by service revenue in Aerospace and positive CMRs.\nIn the second half, we expect free cash flow to be significantly greater than the first half due to higher collections on revenue growth and disbursements in line with the first half inventory build. However, supply chain constraints are delaying deliveries and pushing collections to the following periods. So as a result, much of the third quarter free cash flow is likely to shift to the fourth quarter, while late fourth quarter deliveries would leave a higher receivable balance at the end of the year to be collected in 2023. Combined with lower progress payments from renewable energy orders, we expect this to result in a deferral of about $1 billion of free cash flow out of 2022.\nTurning to the business. Aerospace delivered a very strong quarter as the commercial market continued to recover. Orders grew across the board, up 26% with both commercial engines and services up substantially, reflecting continued robust customer demand. Revenue was up, driven by significant growth in commercial services with shop visits 14% higher year-over-year and continued strength in spare parts sales. Supply constraints, including material availability, negatively impacted revenue by 9 points, primarily in commercial engines. Military growth was driven by services while engine deliveries slowed due to temporary setbacks, specifically in T700 shipments, we expect tangible improvements in the second half.\nCommercial Engine revenue was down slightly as supply chain disruptions continued to impact deliveries. Total engine shipments were down 7%, largely due to lower GEnx production, where LEAP shipments were up 7%.\nSegment margin expanded by almost 15 points primarily driven by commercial services growth, lower OE shipments as well as actions improving pricing structures to address inflation and CMR performance. CMR alone drove over 8 points of improvement given the negative CMR last year.\nFor the total year, largely due to China's first half slowdown, we now expect shop visits to be in the high teens range. We also expect lower commercial engines revenue, trending below 20% growth year-over-year due to continued supply chain challenges. However, we continue to expect more than 25% commercial services growth from ongoing strength in spare parts sales, and that more than offsets the lower shop visit volume and OE volume. Therefore, we still expect to achieve greater than 20% growth and $3.8 billion to $4.3 billion of operating profit for the year.\nMoving to Healthcare. Market demand remains solid, while supply and inflation challenges continue to impact the market. Underlying customer orders indicate continued commitment to investment and we're encouraged by signs that supply chain pressures will ease in the second half of this year. We continue to monitor hospital investment plans and procedure activity. Second quarter orders grew 1%, but that was against a tough comparison to the second quarter of last year when orders increased 11% as well as the impact from COVID in China. Orders increased mid-single digits in services, partially offset by a slight decline in equipment orders. Comparisons continue to be challenging through the second half.\nRevenue in the second quarter was up 4%, with mid-single-digit growth in equipment and low single-digit growth in services. Growth was driven by Imaging, Ultrasound and HCS services sales, and it was offset by the continuing supply chain constraints, including those related to COVID impact in China. Recall that fulfillment challenges started in the second quarter of 2021. And when excluding supply chain impact in both periods, revenue growth would have been 5% this quarter, highlighting how we proactively manage sourcing and logistics.\nCOVID in China impacted growth in both equipment and PDx revenue. With China broadly reopening in early June and our Shanghai PDX facility fully operational, our equipment and PDx revenue in China is expected to rebound in the third quarter.\nSegment margin was impacted by material and logistics inflation with some sequential improvement. Net of sourcing actions, margins contracted about 300 basis points year-over-year but were up about 200 basis points sequentially. We are making progress with price and sales positive for the first time in recent history.\nLooking ahead, Healthcare is focused on driving cost reductions and implementing Lean through supply chain actions to deliver for customers and address cost and price structures as we work to offset inflation and logistics pressures. We are also prudently investing in future innovation, aiming at high-return differentiated technologies. Our commitment to R&D investments is demonstrated by the double-digit year-over-year increase this quarter. For example, we launched Voluson Expert 22, our most advanced ultrasound yet. This latest addition to our Women's Health portfolio has AI-powered tools and our proprietary Lyric Architecture to unlock new imaging and processing power, achieving higher resolution detailed images and scanning flexibility revealing fine anatomy in 2D, 3D and 4D with ease.\nIn addition, our inventory levels are elevated as we prepare for an anticipated ramp in orders fulfillment in the second half of 2022.\nAs Larry mentioned, we're making good progress on the Healthcare spin. We have an opportunity to impact both patients and customers as Healthcare transitions into an independent public company.\nLooking at the full year, order demand remains solid, and we're expecting mid-single-digit revenue growth while closely monitoring customer order activity. Due largely to inflation pressure, we now expect 2022 operating profit to be about $3 billion, slightly below our prior outlook.\nTurning to Renewables. Orders were down due to continued pressure from onshore North America market dynamics and the selectivity in international, impacting both equipment and services repower upgrades. Partially offsetting this were Grid and Hydro, which won a large order for the upgrade of the Itaipu hydropower plant. Grid had orders growth across all businesses, including significant growth in grid automation.\nRevenue declined with roughly 2/3 of the decline from lower onshore wind North America deliveries. The remainder of the decline was primarily driven by Onshore Wind International as planned. Grid and onshore services, excluding repower, both were up low single digits, reflecting our focus on driving growth in these businesses.\nSegment margin declined significantly although up 160 basis points sequentially. Roughly half the year-on-year decline was a result of volume reductions in our most profitable market, U.S. onshore. The remainder of the decline was split roughly equally between net inflation pressures across our businesses and higher-than-expected new product costs in Onshore International as we take measures to improve durability across our fleet. This was partially offset by Grid where margins improved from higher volume and benefits from prior restructuring actions, and we also recovered costs associated with legacy hydro projects of about $70 million.\nIn summary, we knew coming into this year that renewables would be challenging. Offshore wind is a long-term investment in an industry still not at full maturation. Grid, a critical part of the energy transition, is where we're making good progress today. Our priority is onshore wind where many pressures are converging. The ongoing paralysis in Washington with the PTC expiration is hitting our most profitable market, impacting demand. This is coupled with additional inflationary pressures and fleet durability actions.\nFor 2022, due to these dynamics, we no longer expect a step-up profit in the second half. Clearly, we have more work to do here. We're taking swift actions to turn around this business, running our power playbook. Given the strength of our portfolio and the fundamental importance of renewable energy in the energy transition, we remain confident that we will drive profitability over time.\nMoving to Power. Starting with the market. Global gas generation and GE utilization remained resilient, growing low single digits. Despite higher gas prices and availability challenges, gas remains a fuel of choice on the dispatch curves around the globe to meet the growing electricity demand. We continue to expect the market for gas generation to grow low single digits over the next decade.\nOrders were down in the quarter, largely reflecting the uneven equipment order profile we've seen quarter-to-quarter. Services declined due to lower gas CSA outages in line with our multiyear technology cycle. Importantly, Power orders grew low single digits in the first half of the year, driven by equipment strength in the first quarter. The team remains focused on disciplined underwriting and backlog quality.\nRevenue was up mid-single digits, primarily driven by margin-accretive aeroderivative strength, shipping 14 more units versus last year. Overall, services revenue was flat. We delivered strong transactional services growth in gas and power conversion, which was offset with the expected lower gas CSA outage volume. Segment margin reached high single digits in the quarter and expanded 30 basis points.\nAt Gas Power, margins remain resilient from improving price structure to address inflation and aero equipment and transactional services volume growth. This helped offset the mix headwind. At Steam, margins improved significantly due to continued focus on productivity as well as project and legal charges from last year that didn't repeat.\nWe're focused on expanding our services opportunity and expect higher CSA outages next year. In the second half, we expect more growth as each class and aero delivery ramp alongside the continued strength of transactional services and the improvement at Steam.\nPower is set up well to grow profit in 2022, and we are reaffirming our outlook for low single-digit revenue growth and margin expansion.\nFinally, a moment on corporate. Adjusted corporate costs decreased over 50% versus last year and 65% year-to-date. We saw lower functions and operations costs from some timing benefit in addition to lower elimination. Given the favorability in the first half, we now expect corporate costs of below $1 billion for the year.\nWhile excluded from our adjusted results, insurance net income was approximately $140 million. This was down year-over-year as COVID favorability subsides and trends continue to normalize.\nAs we have previously disclosed early this year, aligned with the industry, we plan to adopt the GAAP LDTI accounting standard. The transition adjustment is being applied retroactively to the beginning of 2021. As a result, we expect a negative equity impact of about $7 billion to $8 billion after tax using January '21 rates. This is driven primarily by the lower discount rates.\nUsing June 30, 2022 rates, the transition adjustment would be $4 billion to $5 billion, taking effect in the first quarter of 2023. Also embedded in this estimate is the $1.5 billion to $2 billion after-tax equity impact primarily from adopting the LTC first principles approach, which complements the LDTI and incorporates a more granular modeling assumptions. The first principles model are considered an industry best practice and allow for additional transparency driven by refined modeling that improves claims projections.\nImportantly, we do not expect any additional cash funding needs as a result of these changes currently.\nWe will finalize our CFT results in the first quarter of 2023. We also currently expect our LRT margin to remain positive and will report results in the third quarter of this year. We've provided more info on this in the 10-Q that we filed today.\nIn discontinued operations, our runoff Polish BPH mortgage portfolio ended the quarter with a gross balance of about $2.1 billion. And this quarter, we recorded charges of about $200 million, primarily driven by unfavorable results for banks in ongoing litigation with borrowers. This brings the total litigation reserves related to this matter to approximately $1 billion.\nStepping back, despite the volatile environment, we are pleased by the progress we made this quarter. We delivered order, revenue and profit growth and positive cash. This gives me confidence in achieving the outlook for 2022 that we've shared today.\nNow Larry, back to you.\n\nH. Lawrence Culp\n\nChairman & CEO, General Electric Company\n\nThanks, Carolina. And by the way, happy birthday.\nWrapping up on Slide 13. As we sit here today, I hope you see what we see. GE is a stronger, more customer-centric company. With Lean and decentralization at the center of everything we do, we've made significant progress across delivery, price and cost, driving lasting improvements. The actions I outlined earlier are helping us manage pressures today and most importantly, positioning our businesses for sustainable long-term growth.\nLooking ahead, our story is simple. We have leading innovative franchises poised to accelerate in critical growth sectors the world needs. We're advancing the future of flight, precision health and the energy transition. And our solid financial and operational foundation keeps us on track with our plan to launch 3 companies, each with greater agility, more focus and future growth opportunities. I'm excited about what's ahead and confident GE is positioned to create value.\nSteve, with that, let's turn to questions.\n\nSteven Eric Winoker\n\nVP of IR, General Electric Company\n\n(Operator Instructions) Cheryl, can you please open the line?",

(Operator Instructions) My name is Brandon, and I'll be your conference coordinator today. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\n\nSteven Eric Winoker\n\nVP of IR, General Electric Company\n\nThanks, Brandon. Welcome to GE's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm joined by Chairman and CEO, Larry Culp; and CFO, Carolina Dybeck Happe.\nKeep in mind that some of the statements we're making are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Larry.\n\nH. Lawrence Culp\n\nChairman & CEO, General Electric Company\n\nSteve, thanks, and good morning, everyone.\nI'd like to start by addressing the devastating war in Ukraine. The GE team stands proudly with the people of Ukraine. As we shared last month, we have suspended our operations in Russia with the exception of some essential activities, primarily in Healthcare. We've also made a multimillion-dollar contribution through philanthropic commitments and medical equipment to assist those who have been directly impacted by the events. I'm inspired by the more than 50 GE employees in the surrounding regions who have opened the doors of their homes to Ukrainian refugees and have volunteered their time to help with other refugee efforts.\nNow let me turn to our results, starting on Slide 2. I'm proud of how our team drove improved services, orders, and cash as we managed through increasing challenges in the first quarter. Orders were up 13% organically, with strength in both services and equipment and we saw double-digit growth in Aviation and Power. Revenue was up slightly, driven by growth in higher-margin services in all segments. We saw continued momentum at Aviation with revenue up double digits. This however was largely offset by supply chain constraints in all segments, especially Healthcare and Aviation, U.S. policy uncertainty driving lower Onshore Wind North American deliveries at Renewables this quarter and continued selectivity at Power.\nIn particular, selectivity, being more disciplined about what we sign up for, taking a closer look at the margins we underwrite and not competing everywhere, continues to be a critical element of our strategy at Power and Renewables. We're focusing on business that's aligned with our long-term growth and profit objectives.\nAs you've been hearing from many other companies, we're operating in a challenging macro environment. Collectively, supply chain issues, the Russia-Ukraine war and China COVID impacts adversely affected revenue in the quarter by about 6 percentage points. I'll provide more detail shortly on these factors, and more importantly, the actions we're taking to mitigate them.\nAdjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points, driven by higher services mix and continued cost out. Both Aviation and Power margin improved substantially, while Healthcare and Renewables were meaningfully pressured due to both inflation and supply chain [constraints] (corrected by company after the call). Strong services growth and margin expansion led to an adjusted EPS of $0.24, up 85% year-on-year. Free cash flow was roughly negative $900 million, as expected, given our seasonality. This was driven by receivables and inventory build for the second half and supply chain constraints. Importantly though, this was a $1.7 billion improvement, excluding discontinued factoring. Overall, services are recovering across our portfolio, our total orders are strong, and our cash generation continues to improve.\nTurning to Slide 3. At our Investor Day in March, we discussed some of the key risk factors that drove the range in our outlook. Since then, we're experiencing increased pressure from inflation, Renewable Energy and the Russia-Ukraine war. We're also watching 2 evolving areas, namely additional supply chain pressure and recent COVID impacts in China.\nWe're holding the outlook range we shared in January and working through these pressures I just outlined. But given the fluidity around the duration and magnitude of these factors, we're trending toward the low end of that range.\nCarolina will run through the dynamics by business shortly, but let me spend a moment on Renewables. As Scott Strazik shared last month, our financial results here have been unacceptable, but they are fixable. First, continued U.S. policy uncertainty, along with higher prices, has reduced near-term demand in our profitable North America Onshore Wind business. Second, inflationary pressures are impacting GE with higher material and logistics costs. Third, proven and new leadership with Scott and Philippe Piron is transforming the business fundamentals, largely using their Gas Power and Power Conversion playbooks in their new roles.\nThis all starts, of course, with what's in our control. We need to run the business better, and that's something we know how to do. We're using lean to improve safety and quality and product cost. We're taking an even harder look at our cost structure to size the business for the new realities. We're now managing the business in a more decentralized manner, closer to our customers as well as improving our own execution. We're being more selective on deals internationally, with our price and market focus on defined geographies where we've identified product fit, services opportunities, and an ability to execute. This is already yielding improved order pricing, which was up high single digits in the quarter in our Onshore International business.\nThese actions won't materialize in our results right away, but we do expect Renewable Energy to return to being a profitable growth business over time. And rest assured, this is a business that's critical to the energy transition, thus one positioned for long-term growth.\nMore broadly, in all of our businesses, we're driving growth, price and cost out. We're growing our more profitable services businesses, reconfiguring our supply chains, and leading with innovation while increasing R&D spend. We're also raising list prices and price floors. And in services, we're utilizing escalation clauses in our agreements. And we're focused on sourcing and productivity to reduce cost. Power, for example, continues to deliver profit and cash, supported by price escalation in our CSAs, an improving Steam business, a disciplined underwriting strategy and operational improvements despite the fulfillment challenges.\nAnd we're embedding lean deeply across GE, changing the way we work for the better. You've heard me talked about the core principles of lean before, which is all about serving the customer, eliminating waste, and prioritizing ruthlessly.\nEarlier, I mentioned 6 points of pent-up revenue. We need to work through to execute on the demand we're seeing, especially in Aviation and Healthcare. Let me give you a few quick examples of what we're doing to manage through the well-documented supply chain challenges out there. We hosted our Investor Day at Gemba, showing up close how lean is transforming the company. Many of you saw at our Aviation facility in Greenville how our team performs complex machining operations and detailed inspections on high-pressure turbine blades. Here, we're focused on reducing the site's blade delivery lead time. The team has used lean to improve the plant layout and create standard lines, improving part flow. These actions have reduced lead time by more than 10 days, and we're targeting an additional 10-day decrease. Through this work, overall inventory has been reduced as well.\nOur Military business is also making progress. For the T700 program, we've improved first-time yield in key lines by about 40% and shipments increased more than 35% sequentially. This supported high single-digit revenue growth at Military in the quarter, with more improvement to come as we apply these learnings to other engine programs.\nIn Healthcare, our Ultrasound team shifted part of their work cadence from make to stock to make to order. This has simplified planning and execution, optimized infrastructure cost, and reduced lead time by 30%. Importantly, the team has also increased inventory turns by 50% since 2019, removing the Muda, or the waste, in the system. And while lean is always important, it's during these dynamic times that lean really contributes and differentiates us in the eyes of our customers.\nIn turn, as we make these kinds of continuous operational improvements, we better serve our customers and set ourselves up to reinvest for growth, driving innovation across GE, where we have significant impact with our customers.\nJust looking at what we market, sell and service today. At Renewables, we completed the Traverse Wind Energy Center with Invenergy recently. This is the largest wind farm constructed in North America in a single phase, and it's powered by more than 350 of GE's 2-megawatt platform turbines.\nAt Aviation, we're developing technologies for the future. We've recently reached 2 key engine milestones. Our adaptive cycle XA100, with the second engine to test fired up in March, and our first T901 engine tested successfully in March as well, achieving max power, with performance matching our pretest predictions.\nWe're also introducing new products, like Healthcare's Edison Digital Health Platform. Powered by AI, this platform will aggregate data from multiple sources and vendors to help reduce staff burdens and improve the delivery of care.\nAnd at the same time, we'll continue to complement these organic investments with inorganic activity to improve our growth potential, whether with an acquisition like BK Medical or a sale, as seen this quarter with part of Steam Power's nuclear business.\nIn summary, we're taking action in this difficult environment to serve our customers while investing in tomorrow's innovation. We're using lean principles to improve our results and our culture. We're confident this work is improving our operational and financial performance while fortifying our competitive positions around the world, ultimately, unlocking further potential across our company.\nAnd with that, Carolina will provide further insights on the quarter.\n\nCarolina Dybeck Happe\n\nSenior VP & CFO, General Electric Company\n\nThanks, Larry. Let's dive right into our results.\nTurning to Slide 4. I'll provide color on the quarter on an organic basis. Overall, orders were strong when revenue up 1% remained pressured, especially in Renewables due to U.S. onshore. The constraints that Larry detailed, including supply chain disruptions, Russia-Ukraine, and China, weighed on our ability to ship, which further hurt revenue. Taken together, these constraints reduced the total growth by about 6 points. Plus, our selectivity actions impacted revenue by another point. It's important to highlight that this was largely an equipment dynamic. And services remained strong, up 15%, with growth in all businesses. Notably, Aviation and Commercial Services rose 37% as the market recovery accelerated.\nWe continued to enhance profitability, expanding our adjusted margin 110 basis points, reflecting the mix shift to higher-margin services and continued cost productivity.\nOn the positive side, both Aviation and Power expanded with more than 300 basis points, driven largely by favorable services mix. Within Power, Steam showed significant expansion, reflecting our strategy to exit less profitable segments like new build coal as well as benefits from prior cost actions. There was approximately 200 basis points of additional margin headwinds from inflation and logistics costs net of sourcing actions at the total company level. This was greater than expected, especially in our shorter-cycle businesses like Healthcare. While we achieved positive pricing on deliveries this quarter, particularly in Aviation and Power, it was not enough to offset inflation.\nDespite the tough macro environment, we are continuing to prioritize investing in the future, with R&D up double digits. We remain focused on leading with innovation through high-return, strategically differentiated technologies, such as Aviation next-gen programs and Healthcare Imaging platforms like the CT photon counting.\nFinally, we increased adjusted EPS 85%, driven by margin expansion. In the standard work from continuing to adjusted EPS, I'd call out 3 additional adjustments this quarter. First, separation costs related to the planned business operation; second, the asset impairment due to our previously announced plan to sell the nuclear activities within our Steam business to EDF; and third, Russia and Ukraine charges, primarily related to sanction activities at Aviation and certain Power businesses. In all, we delivered significant order growth and continued margin expansion this quarter.\nMoving to cash. Free cash flow was negative $880 million, a use of cash which we expect seasonally. This was an improvement of $2.5 billion year-over-year on a reported basis or up $1.7 billion, excluding discontinued factoring programs. The improvement was largely driven by lower interest expenses and derivatives on reduced debt, as expected, as well as improvement at Aviation and Power, in line with earnings growth and utilization. This was offset by significant headwinds, including supply chain disruptions.\nThis quarter, working capital was the biggest component of negative free cash flow. And looking at the dynamics, receivables was a use of cash. This was driven by growing CSA billings through the quarter at Aviation and supply chain constraints, driving higher deliveries late in the quarter. Inventory was also a use across the businesses of $1 billion. We expected inventory to grow in the first quarter as inventory was built to support second half volume, but this was further impacted by material shortages, delaying shipments of finished goods.\nWe still see opportunities to improve both inventory turns and receivable DSOs. In this challenging environment, it is much harder to implement though, but we are still seeing pockets of improvement. Take the Onshore Wind North America. Our team in Pensacola, Florida held a case and event focused on hub costing. Using standard work, they reduced lead time to prep the hub costing for the assembly line by 80%, so from 9 hours to under 2. And as a result, the team also increased productivity by about 50% and reduced inventory by more than 80%.\nContract assets and progress collections were a source of cash. Strength was driven by utilization, outpacing service visits in Aviation and Power as well as progress payments in Aviation and Renewable Energy.\nIn all, our efforts to improve working capital management are slowly taking hold despite the difficult supply chain environment. We see real opportunity for the company to build on this momentum, keeping us on track to reach more than $7 billion of free cash flow for 2023.\nOur success in strengthening our balance sheet and improving cash flow provides us with more optionality to drive value, both through growth investments and capital return initiatives. To that end, our Board recently authorized up to $3 billion in share repurchases as a potential capital allocation alternative.\nMoving to the businesses. Aviation results reflect continued recovery in commercial markets as demand remains strong. However, supply chain disruptions presented headwinds to our top line performance this quarter. This will be a key watch item as we progress through the year, but we still expect improvement across the business as deliveries and shop visits ramp. For the quarter, orders grew significantly, with both Commercial Engines and Services up substantially again. Military orders were down, largely due to a tough comp in the previous year when we recorded big CF6 and T408 engine wins. Demand remains robust. Revenue was up due to meaningful growth in Commercial Services, again, the shop visits up 18% year-over-year. Growth in shop visits this quarter would have been even higher without the material availability and fulfillment issues we experienced.\nMilitary was up as lean improvements begin to materialize. As we apply the T700 learnings across other programs, we expect tangible progress through the second half of 2022. Commercial engine revenue was down double digits, driven by supply chain disruptions and lower production rates on GEnx. You can see the impact of wide-body mix here as engine shipments were down just 4% year-over-year, with LEAP narrow-body up 27%. The supply chain constraints were mainly related to labor and material availability due to COVID disruptions in our facilities and at our suppliers, which we're actively managing.\nSegment margin expanded 310 basis points to 16.2%, primarily driven by Commercial Services growth as well as positive pricing and productivity. This was partially offset by higher LEAP engine shipments, inflation, and additional growth investments.\nLooking ahead at the remainder of the year. We expect demand to remain strong as the market continues to recover in most parts of the world despite uncertainty in China due to the recent COVID impacts. We're managing through this and the supply chain disruptions. We still expect shop visits to ramp through the year up to 25%, driven by the ongoing recovery and customer confidence. And this supports the total year growth of 20% or more.\nMoving to Healthcare. Market demand continues to be strong, though the first quarter was impacted by supply chain and inflationary challenges. Orders were up high single digits year-over-year. This was driven by high single-digit growth in Healthcare Systems and mid-single digits in PDx. Elective procedure volumes recovered from January. COVID cases subsided in February and March, with volumes improving sequentially, though hospital staffing shortages continue.\nRevenue was up 2%, with Services growing low single digit and Equipment flat. Growth was impacted by the continued supply chain constraints, primarily in electronics; COVID impact in certain China regions, further limiting what we can buy and ship and affecting revenue toward quarter end; lower volume in Russia and Ukraine, a region that accounts for about 2% of Healthcare's annual sales. And finally, COVID has delayed site readiness and some equipment installations, mainly due to customers' labor and construction material shortages. Absent these constraints, we estimate that the revenue growth would have been about 7 to 8 points higher or a year-over-year growth of approximately 9%.\nSegment margin was significantly impacted by increased material and logistics inflation, which net of our sourcing actions resulted in a headwind of about 4 points. We've been leveraging every tool at our disposal within our control. This includes: price actions, which are showing early success; qualifying alternative parts; redesigning product configuration; and reducing discretionary spend. The Healthcare team remains focused on innovation and commercial growth investments, with R&D investments up double digits this quarter. A couple of key solution highlights from the quarter include: the FDA approval of the End tidal Control software platform to automate anesthesia delivery and a subscription model for our handheld ultrasound tools.\nLooking ahead, our current view at Healthcare is that supply and inflationary challenges will persist at some level through 2022. Sequential improvement depends on supply chain constraints easing, especially in China, and our ability to leverage lean to improve output and strengthen our pricing discipline. We are working to offset headwinds with price increases. But given product fulfillment timing, this will likely have a more meaningful positive impact in the second half. We also continued to manage SG&A and discretionary costs to improve margins. Our supply chain constraints is Healthcare is well positioned to achieve high teens to 20% margins over time.\nTurning to Renewables. Our results were challenging. So let me give you more context. We're seeing pressure in the U.S. Onshore Wind, largely due to the PTC dynamics, and higher prices suppressing demand as customers delay decisions. Grid is positioned to support modernization needs as demonstrated by our contract this quarter to supply a digital substation for the Empire Offshore Wind 1 project. And we've started to see increased interest within Europe as countries recognize the need to meet their energy goals.\nOn the quarter, orders were down double digits. Onshore equipment orders decreased, consistent with the inflation-driven customer delays and the U.S. market decline. Our selectivity strategy is impacting both Wind and Grid. Grid was also down as we lapped the large HVDC order versus last year. However, with automation orders remain strong, up double digits. And overall, services grew mid-single digits.\nRevenue declined, with all businesses down as we saw lower equipment revenue with 280 fewer wind turbine deliveries year-over-year. Grid was also down due to increased selectivity. This was partially offset by significant services growth, primarily driven by Onshore repower. Segment margin declined substantially, driven by volume reduction in our most profitable market, U.S. Onshore, combined with cost inflation in materials, such as steel and transportation costs across the business. Onshore Wind margin declined and was negative, pressured by volume, mix and the new product transitions. We continued to transition to newer product offerings internationally and executed on lower-margin projects in North America. On the positive side, we saw benefits from lower cost and savings associated with prior restructuring projects across our businesses.\nAt Grid, margins improved slightly with the restructuring benefits, offsetting lower volume and our rundown of low-margin legacy backlog. Today, due to lower volumes in Onshore Wind North America and the additional inflation we've seen, we expect Renewables to be below the outlook range. The business full year result will depend largely on North America volume, the inflationary environment and execution of cost and price actions.\nOverall, these results are disappointing and we know we have a lot to do here, but we have a proven playbook and a leadership driving price to market and selectivity and taking a hard look at the right cost structure. Long term, we're confident the team will drive profitable growth given the market demand for renewable energy generation as the world adds 1,000 gigawatts of wind capacity in the next decade and our strong portfolio.\nMoving to Power, where our team is driving operational improvements. Better results reflect progress with Gas Power, Steam, and Power Conversion as lean takes hold, positioning the business for long-term success. Global gas generation and GE utilization remained resilient, up mid-single-digits as the market manages through the uncertainty and disruptions in Ukraine. Despite recent price volatility, gas continues to be reliable and economic source of power generation. And over the next decade, we expect the gas market to remain stable, with gas generation growing low single digits. Orders were strong, and we improved the quality of the backlog for the future. Significant growth in equipment was driven by large H-class order, with continued aero momentum. Our new business underwriting remained disciplined as we grow our backlog profitably. Services orders were also up, driven by gas, with growth in both our contractual and transactional business.\nRevenue was down mid-single digits, primarily driven by equipment as we shipped 3 fewer H-class units year-over-year. This was consistent with our backlog ship dates, which will result in back-end loaded equipment revenue this year. Aero continued to grow, shipping 7 more units versus last year. And services was up 1%, driven by Gas and Power Conversion. And recall, we deconsolidated the Baker aero joint venture last year, so that is now excluded from our organic metrics.\nSegment margin expanded 360 basis points. Gas Power margin was positive and improved. We are seeing progress in Steam with meaningful margin improvement due to the increased focus on services, reduced cost structure, and project and legal charges from last year that did not repeat. Similarly, the focus on services and selectivity at Power Conversion generated positive margin, making 4 quarters of profitability.\nAnd for 2022, we expect to deliver margin expansion, driven by Aero deliveries, transactional services and continued improvement in Steam. And while we expect a dip in our CSA revenue, driven by a lower planning outage profile in 2022 really based on multiyear technology cycles, we expect to increase next year. And we expect continued strong service fleet utilization and cash generation.\nPower remains on track to meet its full year outlook, though the team faces a relatively higher exposure to Russia than the other businesses, with Russia comprising of about 4% of revenue at high incremental margin. Importantly, our commitment to selectivity and operational execution is enabling us to win the right orders, grow services and increase free cash flow generation.\nFinally, I'll spend a moment on Corporate. As a reminder, we rolled the remainder of Capital, including EFS, under Corporate. Adjusted corporate costs, which we expect to be uneven through the year, decreased by more than 40% year-over-year. This was primarily driven by better EFS performance and improvements in functions and operations.\nWhile excluded from our adjusted results, Insurance net income was approximately $180 million, up year-over-year. This was driven by favorable claim experience in our LTC portfolio and continued investment return favorability. This quarter, we also completed our annual cash flow test. As expected, we funded $2 billion in line with permitted practice. Additionally, our team is preparing to implement the industry-wide FASB accounting standard beginning in January 2023. As disclosed previously, this will result in a GAAP charge but does not impact projected cash funding. At Q2 earnings, we'll provide more detailed update.\nIn parallel, we are adopting the LTC first principles approach, which complements the FASB standard and includes incorporating more granular modeling assumptions. This is expected to impact our GAAP LRT margin, but we expect the margin to remain positive. And in addition, we do not expect changes to statutory reserves to regulatory capital or projected funding.\nIn discontinued operations, we have our runoff Polish BPH mortgage portfolio, with a current gross balance of $2.2 billion. This quarter, we recorded charges of about $200 million, mainly driven by more adverse results for banks in the ongoing litigation with borrowers. This brings the total litigation reserves related to this matter to approximately $900 million.\nStepping back, we are managing through an increasingly difficult macro environment. We are focused on what's within our control by leveraging lean and digital tools to improve our operations. As those improvements take hold, we'll drive sustainable, profitable growth and free cash flow, enabling us to deliver value for shareholders and strengthening GE for the long term.\nNow Larry, back to you.\n\nH. Lawrence Culp\n\nChairman & CEO, General Electric Company\n\nCarolina, thanks.\nBefore I close, I'll briefly touch on the real progress we're making on our plan to create 3 independent investment-grade industry leaders.\nAs always, it starts with our team. As we shared at our Investor Day, we've added 3 new Board members: Steve Angel; Bella Goren; and Tom Mihaljevic, who bring deep domain expertise in our key industries. And we're delighted to add to our existing leadership bench, Scott Reese, who joined as CEO of our Digital business, which will be part of GE's Global Energy portfolio going forward. And in Healthcare, we welcome Chief People Officer, Betty Larson, and General Counsel, Frank Jimenez.\nWe remain very enthusiastic about the opportunities these spins will unlock for our already strong franchises as they will help drive greater focus, accountability and alignment with our customers and the markets they serve. We're committed to making sure each proposed company is set up with an investment-grade rating, strong capital and governance structures, and best-in-class talent that will position them for long-term success.\nAs you heard from our Healthcare leaders last month, planning work for the spin-off is well underway, and we're on track to launch Healthcare early next year. We've received positive feedback from our customers and many investors. And we have dedicated cross-functional teams working through stand-alone operating and capital structures, governance branding and a range of other work streams to ensure operational readiness. We have more than 1,000 people today engaged in the separation planning work, moving forward with purpose in important areas. We're progressing the carve-out audits, and we have finalized the IT infrastructure and legal entity separation plans. A lot of work has been completed, more to come, but we're on our way.\nPete and his leadership team are focused not only on successfully executing the intended spin, but also deeply embedding lean and developing long-term plans to accelerate top and bottom line growth as an independent company.\nAt the same time, GE remains focused on serving our customers. The majority of our teams are fully dedicated to running the business and driving lean improvements to further strengthen our foundation ahead of the spins.\nAs we move forward, we're confident about our path to create 3 outstanding companies well positioned for the future, with global leadership positions, lean cultures and innovation prowess to solve for the critical needs of our customers.\nI'm grateful for the focus and dedication of the GE team. I continue to be inspired by their extraordinary commitment. I'm excited about our ability to realize the full potential of these businesses as we move forward.\nTo close on Slide 11. It's been a busy start to the year to say the least. This quarter presented its challenges with rising inflation, Renewable Energy and Russia-Ukraine chief amongst those challenges. And we continue to monitor additional supply chain constraints and the COVID impacts in China. But we're managing through, focusing on what we can control, and there is a lot that we can control. The recovery in services is a bright spot, with all businesses growing service revenue this quarter as well as strong underlying demand in Aviation and Healthcare.\nI'm confident that our team is leveraging lean and decentralization, focused on safety, quality and delivery, and taking action to drive growth, price and cost out. And we continue preparing our plans to stand up 3 strong independent companies, focused on growing critical sectors: in Aviation, where we're on the cusp of a post-COVID recovery and new engine ramp with our airframe customers, accelerating our mission to create a smarter and more efficient future of flight; in Healthcare, where we're innovating in precision health to drive efficiency and improve patient outcomes; and in Energy, where we see tremendous opportunity to provide affordable, reliable and sustainable power.\nOverall, I hope you see what I see, that our businesses are positioned for success as we continue to scale lean and drive innovation, delivering better results for our shareholders today and tomorrow.\nSteve, with that, let's go to questions.\n\nSteven Eric Winoker\n\nVP of IR, General Electric Company\n\nThanks, Larry.

Please proceed.\n\nSteven Eric Winoker\n\nVP of IR, General Electric Company\n\nThanks, Brandon. Welcome to GE's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I'm joined by Chairman and CEO, Larry Culp; and CFO, Carolina Dybeck Happe. Keep in mind that some of the statements we're making are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements may change as the world's changes.\nNote that we plan to hold an investor event on March 10 in Greenhill, South Carolina at our Power and Aviation plants to provide more in our 2022 outlook with an upclose look at our lean progress and innovation. We're covering a lot of ground today with the quarter, the year, our reporting changes and outlook. So we will run a little long. Appreciate your patience and we'll still make time at the end for Q&A.\nOne quick note. I've been getting a number of questions this morning on changes -- on the changes we're making and the relevance to consensus. Consensus is not comparable to our current numbers given the changes we're about to walk through, most notably insurance, which was about $0.40 in '21. So with that, I'll hand the call over to Larry.\n\nH. Lawrence Culp\n\nChairman & CEO, General Electric Company\n\nSteve, thank you, and good morning, everyone. 2021 was an important year for GE. We successfully navigated a dynamic environment, delivering solid margin expansion, EPS growth and free cash flow. We focused our portfolio, significantly reduced debt and strengthened our operating performance through lean and decentralization. We've remained on track to achieve our long-term financial goals, and we're confident about where we stand today and where we're headed.\nWe entered 2022 with strength from this continued strategic operational and financial progress, thanks to the dedication and resilience of the entire GE team. We're seeing real opportunities for sustainable profitable growth from near-term improvements in our businesses, especially as aviation recovers and our end markets strengthen. With our transformation accelerating and significant momentum in our businesses, we're playing more offense through both organic and inorganic growth opportunities, such as our recent health care acquisitions.\nIt's this momentum that allowed us to announce in November, one of the most important events in GE's history, creating 3 independent investment-grade industry leaders focused on critical global needs. We're supporting the recovery of the aviation industry today and creating a future of smarter, more sustainable and efficient flight. We're developing precision health care that personalizes diagnoses and treatments, and we're leading the energy transition to drive decarbonization.\nThese are big challenges and our customers deserve and demand our best work. At GE, we're committed to creating value for all of our stakeholders and delivering on our purpose of building a world that works.\nTurning to Slide 3. We materially strengthened our business in 2021, and our balance sheet is in solid shape. We took a large step in the fourth quarter with the close of the GECAS AerCap transaction, focusing GE on our industrial core and creating an industry leader and strategic partner to airline customers. Using the proceeds, we reduced debt by $25 billion, and we're now able to transition to a simpler reporting structure. I'll address our 2021 performance versus our outlook on a prior basis for ease of comparison. Then we'll bridge these results to our simplified reporting, which we'll use going forward.\nLet me briefly address the fourth quarter and Carolina will provide further insights. We made good progress in the quarter, [2] highlights of which were orders in Aviation and Healthcare, up 22% and 7%, respectively. But our top line results were pressured by 2 dynamics that we believe are temporary. First, persistent supply chain challenges. This was most acute in health care, although the impact was felt in all businesses, and we're confident in our countermeasures that are underway, including both price and cost actions across GE; second, we continue to drive commercial selectivity across the board with a particular focus in Power and Renewables. We're being more disciplined in the projects we choose to underwrite in the broader markets where we participate. This means lower volume with lower risk today but better margins and less risk over time.\nIncreased selectivity and supply chain headwinds each impacted revenue performance by about 3 to 4 points. Our focus on profitability and cash generation was evident this quarter. Industrial margins expanded 290 basis points organically, led by Aviation and Power Services. And we delivered $3.8 billion of industrial free cash flow.\nNow looking at the full year, orders were up 12% organically with services growth in all businesses and up 12% overall, supporting faster growth in 2022. Industrial revenue was down 2% organically. Increased selectivity and supply chain headwinds impacted performance by 3 to 4 points and 1 to 2 points, respectively. Total equipment revenue decreased 8% organically, while higher-margin services grew 4% organically, led by Power and Healthcare. We ended the year with strong profitability and cash performance as margins, EPS and free cash flow all exceeded our full year outlook. Industrial margin expanded 390 basis points organically. Strong services growth, coupled with cost actions and restructuring benefits, drove improvements in 3 businesses, led by Aviation. This was offset by supply chain headwinds across the company, renewable energy performance and rising inflationary pressures.\nSolid margin expansion helped drive adjusted EPS up significantly to $2.12. And we delivered industrial free cash flow of $5.1 billion, driven by better earnings and disciplined working capital management. If you add back discontinued factoring, our business has generated $5.8 billion of free cash flow last year. Now I recognize there are several definitions this quarter as we transition to reporting that reflects a simpler GE. But let there be no doubt, $5.8 billion best represents our operating performance for the year. And this is the number from which we'll grow in 2022 and going forward.\nNow given the impact of renewables on our overall performance, I'd like to spend a moment talking through the business dynamics. Remember, we run this business by its parts. Offshore Wind, pre-revenue and growing; Grid Solutions, on its way to profitability. And while not a part of renewables results today, there's grid software, a profitable part of digital within corporate. Our largest business, though, is Onshore Wind, which is where I'll focus.\nFirst, demand will be there in Onshore Wind is a critical component of the energy transition. We have leading products and a strong services franchise, but we do face near-term challenges, some structural, but many within our control. In the U.S., we're the market leader and profitable. While internationally, we've experienced continued challenges that we're addressing related to new technology ramps. And we're managing through the U.S. production tax credit or PTC, inflation and supply chain issues. So what are we doing?\nScott Strazik is now leading our energy businesses, and he'll run the same operational playbook he did at Gas Power. We're being more selective. It's okay not to compete everywhere, and we're looking closer at the margins we underwrite on deals with some early evidence of increased margins on our 2021 orders. Our teams are also implementing price increases to help offset inflation and are laser focused on supply chain improvements and lower costs.\nWe're making progress operationally. Turbine availability is increasing across the fleet. Our field teams are enhancing the customer experience with better design and testing and quicker responses to field issues. Core services was up double digits in 2021, and we expect growth to continue. Using Lean, the team lowered overall inventory by more than $300 million at year-end. We do have work to do, and we're on it. With Scott and Pat Byrne now full-time leading onshore at the helm, we believe this will be a growth business that delivers high single-digit margins over time.\nOverall, our performance at GE was strong in 2021, underpinned by rising demand in Aviation and Healthcare. Our bottom line focus is paying off and enabling us to reinvest in growth. This sets us up well to deliver high revenue growth, margin expansion and better free cash flow in the year ahead.\nMoving to Slide 4. GE today is operating from a position of strength. Lean principles are helping our teams increase their focus on customers, eliminating waste and driving continuous improvement. This is leading to sustainable, impactful improvements in safety, quality, delivery and cost. One recent example is what our gas power team did dramatically improve the [7.5] turbine outage experience for our North American customers. By standardizing crews optimizing material flow and digitizing frontline field procedures, the team reduced outage cycle time by 30%, ultimately decreasing customer downtime. Our teams are scaling their learnings to more regions.\nIn this quarter, at PDX in Ireland, our team rearranged standard workflow and prep sequences in their main contrast media filling line, reducing turnaround time by 40%. This helps avoid unnecessary capital expenditures while significantly expanding our production capacity to reach more customers and ultimately more patients. These are just 2 of the many examples demonstrating the progress our businesses continue to make. Decentralization goes hand-in-hand with Lean. We continue to drive decentralization at every turn, P&L by P&L. In each of our 3 go-forward companies, we'll carry that philosophy to drive better results.\nFirst and foremost, we're driving organic growth through innovation. In health care, for example, we've been investing in one of the fastest-growing ultrasound subsegments, the handheld market. Portable ultrasound is expected to become standard of care over time as it enables quick insights from routine exams with greater mobile flexibility. We launched our Vscan Air pocket-sized wireless ultrasound last year, and it's already reaching patients in more than 70 countries, contributing to strong handheld ultrasound revenue growth in 2021.\nEnagas power this quarter, Guangdong Energy ordered 2 9HG.01 gas turbines, which will be the first to burn hydrogen blended with natural gas in Mainland China. We're also selectively complementing our organic growth with inorganic investments becoming more active in the market as we've strengthened our financial position. Recently, GE Digital acquired Opus One, a company with advanced interoperable software and renewable energy planning capabilities that are highly complementary with digital network management and optimization portfolio. Together, we'll help customers integrate distributed energy resources at scale.\nThis builds on other bolt-ons we've done lately such as BK Medical to expand our competitive capabilities. In addition to broadening momentum in our businesses, many of our end markets are improving. In Aviation, we're encouraged by our performance, which reflects our actions and a continued market recovery. While the current GE CFM departures are down 25% versus '19 levels, given recent volatility due to the omicron variant, it wasn't a material impact in 2021. Shop visits once again were higher than we initially anticipated, and green time utilization continue to lessen. Along with our customers, GE remains confident in the recovery while actively monitoring the impact of travel restrictions.\nWe're positioned to lead as the commercial aftermarket recovers and military growth, supporting the industry today and sustainability for the long term. In health care, order demand remained strong despite supply chain disruptions which we expect to be with us through at least the first half of next year or 2022. We're encouraged that government and private health systems are investing in products and services to support future capacity and improve quality of care. We're also continuing to invest to meet rising demand from hospital providers while managing costs through operational improvements.\nThe energy market remains dynamic. At Renewables, the PTC expired at year's end, and the uncertainty is impacting onshore wind demand. Based on Wood Mac's latest equipment and repower forecast, the U.S. market is expected to decline from 15 gigawatts of installations in '21 to approximately 10 gigawatts in 2022. We're monitoring policy proposals and see strong diverse interest in continuing tax credit for wind. In Offshore Wind, demand continues to significantly increase around the world. We have over 7 gigawatts of Haliade-X commitments, spanning across Europe, North America and now Asia, including our recent 1.7 gigawatt commitment with our partner, Mitsubishi in Japan.\nAt gas, while global gas generation was down slightly for the year, GE gas turbine megawatt average grew high single digits, supporting stronger services and cash generation. We anticipate the 21 equipment market will be above 30 gigawatts. Overall, gas continues to be a reliable and economic source of power generation, and we see gas generation demand growing low single digits over the next decade.\nOur Renewables and Power businesses, including digital and grid, are playing a critical role in solving the trilemma of affordable, reliable and sustainable energy to meet increasing energy demand and support customers in achieving their net zero emissions. GE operates in mission-critical markets, each with global reach, profitably growing backlogs and sizable installed bases. Aftermarket services, which make up roughly 80% of our more than $400 million backlog and more than half our revenue keep us close to our customers on a daily basis.\nSo I hope that you can see that we're running GE better with a focus on driving innovation, sustainability and growth in '22 and longer term. With that, I'll turn it over to Carolina for further insights on our results.\n\nCarolina Dybeck Happe\n\nSenior VP & CFO, General Electric Company\n\nThanks, Larry. We're continuing to make GE a focused, simpler and stronger high-tech industrial company. Closing the GECAS transaction was a significant milestone that helped us reduce gross debt by $87 billion since the end of 2018 and created an opportunity for us to make reporting changes to substantially simplify our financials and enhanced transparency. This quarter, we moved from a 3-column reporting format, which showed GE Industrial separately from our financial services operations to a simpler 1 column format. This means we rolled the remainder of capital, including EFS and runoff insurance into corporate. As we shared before, to provide a clearer view of our core performance, our results will exclude runoff insurance from adjusted revenue, profit and free cash flow.\nLet me outline what this means. Looking at the EPS and cash flow bridges provided at the right-hand side, starting with adjusted EPS of [$2.12] in the prior 3-column format. Now ex runoff insurance, adjusted EPS is $1.71 in the 1-column format.\nLooking at free cash flow, there are a couple more puts and takes. Starting with the prior 3-column format or what we call industrial, adding back the cash impact of discontinued factoring gets us to $5.8 billion. Transitioning to the 1-column format and the impact of legacy capital, which is largely interest expense and derivatives ex runoff insurance, and we arrived at $2.6 billion of free cash flow ex discontinued factoring.\nImportantly, we expect the $3.2 billion legacy impact from cash flow to be close to $0.5 billion in 2022. This is driven by the significant debt reduction, causing lower interest expense and lower derivatives impact. For ease of comparison, we've provided detailed walks, including quarterly financials on our IR website. Stepping back, after this transition quarter, our new simplified financials reflect the strategic actions we've taken to further focus on our industrial core.\nTurning to Slide 6. I'll speak to all figures on the 1-column reporting format and an organic basis, unless otherwise noted. Starting with orders. This quarter, we saw strength in Aviation and Healthcare. We're growing more profitable areas like services, which was up 7%. Meanwhile, equipment was down, driven by large order timing at renewables, including the PTC and power. As we've mentioned, we're being more selective in the commercial deals we're pursuing. For the year, equipment and services orders were both up 12% organically, with services growing in all businesses. We're confident this builds revenue momentum heading into '22.\nWhile adjusted revenue was down this quarter, services was a bright spot, up double digits with growth in all businesses. We're managing through various market and operational dynamics, including supply chain challenges in all businesses, especially health care as well as the continued impact of increased selectivity. Examples here include lower turnkey scope at power, pursue yields at the right margins and the exit of new build coal. For the year, these dynamics play through with equipment down and services up.\nThis quarter, adjusted margins expanded 210 basis points, largely driven by Aviation Services. For the year, we achieved 400 basis points of margin expansion, driven by services growth, cost productivity, non-repeat of COVID contract charges and more than $1 billion of restructuring savings. At the macro level, inflation pressure continues.\nFinally, adjusted EPS was up significantly this quarter and for the year, primarily driven by margin expansion. In all, we're pleased with our orders, margins and earnings performance this year where we continue to drive profitable top line growth in the year ahead. Strengthening our cash generation through improved working capital management and linearity has been a major focus of our transformation. This will ultimately drive more consistent, sustainable and higher cash flow. Thanks to the focus and discipline of our team, we generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow this quarter, mainly driven by earnings and working capital. This was down $2.1 billion year-over-year ex discontinued factoring. In addition to improved linearity throughout the year, the decline was primarily driven by the timing of Onshore Wind North America orders due to PTC and health care supply chain constraints.\nAs you know, we stopped factoring this year. The fourth quarter impact was roughly $2 billion, bringing the full year adjustment to approximately $5.1 billion. Working capital was the biggest driver of our free cash flow this quarter and focused on 2 key dynamics. Receivables were a source of cash, mainly driven by continued operational rigor. For example, this quarter, daily management has improved DSO in 3 of our 4 businesses, with total company down DSO of 12 days for the full year. On inventory, we reduced 0.5 billion, mainly from renewables. This was due to seasonally higher deliveries and more rigorous material management driven by Lean as we adjust for the 2022 market demand. We have more to do, but we're confident this will be a source of cash in '22.\nFor the year, free cash flow was $1.9 billion or $2.6 billion ex discontinued factoring. As previously discussed, the consolidation to 1-column resulted in a negative impact of $3.2 billion, mostly from interest and derivatives. When you add back the impact of discontinued factoring, we generated $5.8 billion of industrial free cash flow in '21. As Larry said earlier, we believe this best represents our operating performance for the year, and this is the number which we will grow from in '22 and go forward.\nAllowance and discount payments or AD&A were net zero this quarter, which is $200 million better than we anticipated due to delayed aircraft deliveries. This resulted in total year '21 AD&A flow of a positive $500 million, flat year-over-year.\nLet's take a look at free cash flow by business for the year, ex factoring all periods. Aviation delivered an impressive $4.6 billion, up $2.6 billion. This was driven by services strength aligning with the market recovery, improved working capital, including strong customer collections and timing of customer allowance payments. Healthcare delivered $2.7 billion, which was roughly flat ex pharma. Higher earnings were offset by working capital pressure linked to supply chain constraints. Renewables was negative $1.2 billion versus breakeven last year. We saw a decline in the U.S. equipment orders due to PTC. The lower down payments drove a $1.5 billion of progress burn, while inventory and receivables substantially improved.\nTotal power generated $1.2 billion, up $600 million, mainly driven by improved earnings and working capital at Gas Power, including substantial progress payments for aeroderivative orders and backlog growth. This was partially offset by the impact of new build coal, which was about $500 million negative. Overall, our returns are driving working capital improvements, which coupled with higher earnings, will continue to drive measurable free cash flow growth in '22.\nTurning to Slide 8. We've made substantial progress strengthening our long-term financial position. On leverage, our rating agency line net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.4x in '21, improving from our estimate of approximately 6x, driven by higher debt reduction. Using a market-aligned measure, which includes bonds, preferreds and cash, as you can see on the slide, we ended '21 at 3.3x and expect to be around 2x at the end of '22. We expect our leverage to continue to decrease with a clear focus on improving operations and thereby EBITDA. Additionally, we have significant sources available, growing free cash flow, cash on hand of $16 billion and our stakes in AerCap and Baker Hughes, totaling $13 billion.\nWe've continued to derisk and actively manage our pension. We decreased our after-tax deficit by $8 billion, ending the year at $12 billion, driven by strong asset returns and a favorable interest rate environment. Going forward, the strength of our balance sheet positions us well to create 3 independent investment grade and industry-leading companies and enables us to invest for growth.\nMoving to our business results, which I'll also speak to on an organic basis. First, on Aviation. Our strong results reflect our underlying business fundamentals and a recovery in commercial market. For the quarter, orders grew double digits. Both commercial engines and services were up substantially again year-over-year. Military orders were down, largely due to a tough comp when we had large wins on F404 and F14 last year. but demand remains strong. Revenue was up. Commercial Services grew significantly. Shop visits was up over 40% again year-over-year and mid-single digits sequentially. Overall scope improved sequentially. MRO purchases were seasonally higher in the fourth quarter. And as usual, we expect activity to decline significantly in the first quarter.\nCommercial Engines was down double digits. The driver here is twofold. First, mix continues to shift to more NPI units, specifically with lower production rates on GMX. Second, we're navigating continued supply chain and labor availability challenges. Military was also down as output challenges continue, but we are seeing significantly higher first-time yields in the areas where we have fully implemented lean and sustainable process improvement. It's taking more time to realize the process benefits across all production lines. We'll see more tangible and visible progress, particularly through the second half of '22.\nSegment margin expanded significantly year-over-year and sequentially. This was primarily driven by commercial services growth and favorable commercial engines mix. For the year, while Aviation revenue was slightly below our expectations, margin expanded to 13.5% reported. This leverage was supported by solid services as shop visits increased 10% year-over-year, and we reduced operational costs.\nLooking at '22, given our strong fourth quarter margin, a moment on Aviation in the first quarter, we expect margins closer to mid-teens, driven by seasonal decreases in MRO buying behavior and the new engine ramp. Broadly speaking, we continue to evaluate and manage the impact of Omicron and we're confident in the long-term fundamentals of this business.\nMoving to health care. Looking at our performance, market momentum continues to drive strong demand despite the industry-wide supply chain constraints. For the quarter, orders were up high single digits, both year-over-year and compared to '19 levels. This was driven by high single-digit growth in Healthcare Systems and low single-digit growth in PDX. Revenue was down with a mid-single-digit decline in health care systems. This more than offset the low single-digit growth at PDX. Service revenue increased low single digits. Industry-wide semiconductor, resin, parts and labor shortages continued across all modalities. Absent these shortages, if we were able to fill all orders, we estimate that organic revenue growth would have been about 7 to 8 points higher in the fourth quarter or year-over-year growth of 4% and about 3 to 4 points higher for the full year or growth of mid-single digits.\nSupply chain challenges are expected to continue at least through the first half of '22, which we're actively managing. We are confident that these factors are temporary and the business should return to long-term sustainable growth. We've seen elective procedures holding through the year-end. But Omicron is having a more recent impact on procedure volumes, it is still too early to quantify, but we're encouraged to see hospitals better managing routine procedures along with COVID cases. Segment margin declined year-over-year, largely driven by supply chain issues and inflation. Also recall that the fourth quarter was a difficult comp to 2020 as revenue began to rebound significantly from COVID lows. This was partially offset by productivity and higher PDX volume. In addition, we're seeing evidence of lean-driven operational improvement, including health care finance, where our team is Lean to reduce the quarter close process to 5 days down from 10 days just 2 years ago.\nFor the year, healthcare delivered strong performance. We proactively managed sourcing and logistics as well as qualifying new parts, for example, to partially mitigate supply chain impact. Orders were up double digits with strength in HCS and PDX. Revenue was up low single digits and margins expanded with 70 basis points. Overall, this strength has enabled us to increase our recent organic and inorganic investments. We continue to reinvest launching a significant number of exciting new products in MR, CT, X-ray, handheld ultrasound, interventional and digital. The innovation we deliver extends beyond clinical capabilities. We also always consider how can we help customers make the most of their investments whether that through efficient digital upgrades at AI, such as our Recon or leveraging a platform like Revolution Apex City to scale existing solutions without significant hardware changes.\nAnd on the inorganic side, we completed the acquisition of BK Medical in December, adding fast-growing surgical visualization assets to our [$3 billion] ultrasound business. Looking forward, healthcare is well positioned for continued profitable growth, targeting 25 to 75 bps of margin expansion as we prepare to stand up the business as an independent company.\nTurning to Renewables. As Larry said, we're focused on improving our performance in '22 and '23. Looking at the quarter, orders were down double digits, driven largely by uncertainty, delivering investments in the U.S. onshore equipment. Offshore was also down slightly despite several large orders, including Dogan this quarter. Revenue declined mid-single digits, driven by lower equipment deliveries at onshore and continued project selectivity at grid. Offshore was also lower, driven by project timing. Services partially offset these declines as repower revenue nearly doubled, even X-ray power, ArsheService grew double digits for the year.\nSegment margin declined over 500 basis points, largely due to onshore and grid. Onshore margins declined were negative, driven by our international business. We continue to experience challenge related to our new technology ramp as well as project execution and lower margins on older deals in the backlog, which will run off over the next couple of years. In the U.S., margins improved. This was due to continued productivity and higher repower sales, partially offset by lower volume. At Grid, cost actions were more than offset by continued volume declines, largely driven by selectivity and project costs.\nBut both supply chain and inflation impacts were limited this quarter, rising inflation will be a bigger impact in 2022 as we have previously flagged. So for the year, we delivered double-digit order growth driven by offshore, while revenue and margin both declined. Long term, we are firmly positioned to lead the energy transition, building on advanced technologies like the Haliade-X, which we'll begin delivering in '22.\nMoving to Power. The team delivered strong performance this year, driven by operational improvements, especially at Gas Power. For the quarter, orders were down driven by Gas Power offsetting steam growth, gas decline, facing a tough comp and some customer changes. This quarter, we booked 4 HA units, some of which will run on hydrogen blended natural gas. We see continued momentum on our HA with more than 20 tech selections for the year, which will likely manifest in orders in '22 and '23.\nSteam orders were up across equipment and services, driven by the nuclear part of the business. Revenue was down. Equipment was down due to fewer unit shipments, reduced turnkey scope of gas and Steam continued exit of new build coal. We're navigating supply chain constraints, which significantly impacted deliveries this quarter. Services was up. Gas was up double digits with both CSA and transactional volume growth.\nOne reminder. Due to the aeroderivative joint venture with Baker being deconsolidated effective November 1, gas services revenue no longer includes the sales from the joint venture to Baker Hughes or about 1 billion -- $0.5 billion of lower reported annual revenue. Still Services was down on continued selectivity. Margins expanded year-over-year and were up sequentially, largely driven by Gas Power services. All businesses delivered positive margin this quarter.\nFor the year, orders were up low single digits. Gas orders were about flat with services offsetting equipment. We remain selective with disciplined underwriting. Margin in our gas equipment backlog increased by 2 points. And due to selectivity, 80% of our heavy-duty unit orders were equipment only in scope. Power revenue was down 4%. Services saw double-digit growth led by gas, while equipment was down with turnkey revenue about $1 billion lower year-over-year. Since coal equipment backlog also ended below $1 billion. and power conversion grew double digits. Margins improved more than 300 basis points. Gas has stabilized, achieving high single-digit margins and power conversion achieved low single-digit margins reflecting operational improvement through the year.\nLooking at '22, we see opportunities to expand margins and improve free cash flow as Lean becomes further embedded and Steam continues to exit new build coal. At gas, equipment revenue will increase driven by air derivative growth and heavy-duty normalizing. The HA commissioned units will almost double by year-end versus 2020, supporting future services and cash growth. We expect total power to achieve high single-digit margins in 2023.\nNow closing with corporate. As we've discussed, we're driving leaner processes and decentralization to reduce functional and operational costs. Compared to our outlook on the prior reporting basis, adjusted corporate costs was less than $1 billion in '21, down 30%. Adjusted capital net income was negative $350 million, better than our most recent guide of negative $500 million. As we've mentioned earlier, on our 1-column basis, capital is now part of corporate. So for the year, adjusted corporate cost was $1.2 billion with functions and operations continuing to improve.\nI'm encouraged at digital with double-digit order growth in the fourth quarter and exciting innovations such as autonomous tuning software. This applies AI to continuously optimize any gas turbine to operate with the ideal combustion and reduce emissions and fuel consumption. At insurance, which is included -- excluded from our organic results as this is a runoff business, net income was approximately $450 million. This was up significantly, driven primarily by strong investment results and favorable claim experience in our LTC portfolio, partially offset by higher paid claims in our Life portfolio.\nConsistent with prior years, we will finalize our annual statutory cash flow test in the first quarter. We currently anticipate that this will be in line with our permitted practice requirements. In discontinued operations, we have our runoff Polish BPH mortgage portfolio with a current gross balance of $2.4 billion. This quarter, we recorded charges of about $200 million, mainly driven by more adverse results in the ongoing litigation with borrowers. This brings the total estimate of losses in connection with this litigation to approximately $800 million.\nIn all, this quarter marked a strong close to 2021. As you can see, Lean and decentralization are not just operational levers. They are becoming embedded in our culture and in the business. These operational improvements drove margin expansion, EPS growth and free cash flow generation for the year, and we are continuing to improve. Our strong performance is enabling us to play more offense and drive sustainable, long-term profitable growth.\nNow Larry, back to you.\n\nH. Lawrence Culp\n\nChairman & CEO, General Electric Company\n\nCarolina, thanks. Turning the page to 22. We're planning to provide more detail during our March investor event that Steve referenced. But today, let me share our company overview.\nLooking at Slide 10, we're expecting organic revenue growth in the high single-digit range; organic margin expansion of 150 basis points or more; adjusted EPS of $2.80 to $3.50 a share; and a range of $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion for free cash flow. There are a number of key assumptions underpinning our plan for the year.\nLet me start with Aviation. The continued commercial market recovery will again be one of the most critical factors to delivering our '22 outlook. Starting with the market, we're currently planning for improved GE CFM departures, which we expect to average down about 10% off '19 levels and total year shop visits to be up about 20% year-over-year. We expect revenue will increase more than 20% driven by strong worldwide shop visit growth and the ramp of LEAP engine deliveries. Margins will expand despite commercial mix pressure as LEAP engine deliveries increase while we increase our investment in new technology.\nLooking across our other segments at health care. We see low to mid-single-digit revenue growth driven by our commercial efforts and new product launches, tempered by continued supply chain challenges through at least the first half. We're targeting solid margin expansion this year inclusive of more than $1 billion of R&D spend. In Renewables, we've discussed in detail how we're driving operational improvement today in a smaller onshore wind market. This better execution, along with offshore wind growth will help us deliver low single-digit revenue growth and improved profitability.\nIn Power, continued services strength will drive low single-digit revenue growth while we continue to increase selectivity and exit new build coal. We're on a path towards high single-digit margins in '23. We'll discuss cash more on the next slide, but across each business, we're driving operational improvements that in turn will deliver higher cash flow for the company. Better earnings and working capital management, especially inventory will enable us to grow free cash flow in 2022. For the first quarter, though, we expect free cash flow to be negative.\nIn aggregate, our substantial backlog and large services installed base give us confidence in our ability to deliver on these commitments. We're focused on delivering profitable growth and stronger cash generation, enabling us to reinvest in growth and play more offense.\nMoving to Slide 11. Our strong $5.8 billion of free cash performance in '21 sets us up well to deliver $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion of free cash in '22. Looking at the year-over-year dynamics. Following last year's significant debt reduction actions, legacy capital outflows will be dramatically lower, down to $0.5 billion. We expect earnings will continue to grow driven by revenue growth and margin expansion. Excluding the capital impact, this drives the bulk of the year-over-year improvement. We expect working capital to be a source with continued lean efforts offsetting volume growth. We see opportunity to improve inventory turns as we resolve supply chain constraints.\nAt Renewables, we expect a higher impact from onshore progress collections resulting from down payments on new orders and fewer deliveries in '22. And as both gas and aircraft engine utilization increases, we expect CSA billings to increase as well. We anticipate AD&A outflow of $0.5 billion or a year-over-year negative impact of $1 billion, as our customers plan for higher deliveries in '22. We expect a limited drag from other cash flows, including growth investments supported by higher CapEx.\nSome color by business compared to '21 free cash flow, excluding the impact of discontinued factoring. We expect Aviation will be slightly down, driven by the AD&A headwinds I mentioned a moment ago, while health care, renewables and power all improved year-over-year. This positive trajectory gives us conviction in achieving high single-digit margins or greater than $7 billion of free cash flow in '23 with today's portfolio of businesses.\nClosing on Slide 12. Since our announcement in November, we've received very encouraging feedback. Our customers are excited. In hundreds of conversations, they've indicated that the new structure will help us better serve their needs. There's also a lot of excitement within the company. Our teams are highly motivated. They're sharpening their focus and picking up the pace. This makes me even more confident in what we'll deliver this year. And our investors are also very supportive and see the value creation opportunity ahead. We have 3 terrific businesses that are leaders in their respective industries. And independently, they will be able to attract an even broader investor base with distinct sector-specific investment propositions.\nDuring the transition, it's critical that our employees remain focused on serving our customers and driving daily business performance. While nearly all of the company remains fully dedicated to running the business, we've established a dedicated separation management office led by Jen Van Bell and the senior leadership team. They are focused on detailed work stream planning and execution to deliver on each business' critical value drivers, ranging from optimizing their operating model to their capital structures, armed with best-in-class talent and board governance starting with health care.\nWe're also naming leadership for these independent companies. Pete Arduini started as the Healthcare CEO earlier this month. He's already deeply engaged with our team and customers and has started meeting with investors and analysts, including at recent conferences, where the focus has been on technology and growth. And we're attracting new talent who are excited to be part of this, including Scott Reese, who will lead our digital business, which will be part of the go-forward energy businesses.\nSo we've hit the ground running to launch 3 outstanding businesses at scale in places the world needs and wants GE at its best. Each business will be focused and accountable with the agility to respond faster to customer needs, and there will be more opportunities for employees, management teams, Boards and investors who increasingly want to be part of dedicated industries and missions. And these businesses, each with a well-capitalized balance sheet, will enjoy greater capital allocation and strategic flexibility to invest in growth.\nIt's still early in the process, and we look forward to updating you as we move forward. More broadly, this is the next phase of building a world that works. GE is exceptionally well positioned to create long-term growth and value in our 3 critical global needs, shaping the future of flight, delivering precision health care and leading the energy transition. I'm proud of the work our teams are doing to enable a more sustainable, healthier, cleaner and connected future for all. And we look forward to seeing as many of you as can make it to Greenville, South Carolina in March for our outlook event.\n\nSteven Eric Winoker\n\nVP of IR, General Electric Company\n\n(Operator Instructions) Brandon, can you please open the line?",

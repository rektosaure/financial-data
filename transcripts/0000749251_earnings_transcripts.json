This call may be recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to David Cohen, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Cohen\n\nGroup Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to Gartner's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. I'm David Cohen, SVP of Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] After comments by Gene Hall, Gartner's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Craig Safian, Gartner's Chief Financial Officer, there will be a question-and-answer session.

Reconciliations for all non-GAAP numbers we use are available in the Investor Relations section of the gartner.com website. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, certain statements made on this call may constitute statements forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2024 annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as in other filings with the SEC. I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.\nNow I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\n\nEugene A. Hall\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Gartner, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner's Q3 financial results were ahead of expectations. The macroeconomic environment remains dynamic with -- changes in the federal government and evolving tariff policies. We made operational adaptations that are starting to yield results. We continue to deliver great value to our clients. Enterprise client retention remained strong and contract renewal rates improved from the second quarter. Finally, we repurchased more than $1 billion of stock in the quarter, reducing share count by 6% year-over-year. AI will be one of the most innovative and pervasive technologies in history. We're seeing unprecedented demand for help with AI, and we're meeting that demand. We're helping tens of thousands of clients in thousands of enterprises across every function, every sized enterprise, every geography and every industry determine how best to use AI. We've developed indispensable AI insights that are captured in more than 6,000 documents, and our insights are growing every day.\nTo put this into perspective, if you read 10 documents per day, it would take about 2 years just to get through our current library. While enterprise leaders are excited about the prospects of AI, they continue to chase returns on those investments. We've cataloged more than 1,000 AI use cases, spanning roles in industries that outline which have the highest ROIs and why. These are [ inspensible ] insights. In addition, our entire client base has access to our AI drone tool, AskGartner. AskGartner enables quick access and generates in-depth summaries of our business and technology insights. We continue to accelerate and enhance AskGartner's capabilities at a rapid pace. Our insights are derived from Gartner's vast pool of proprietary data that is unique, highly differentiated and not available in the public domain. This includes data from Gartner IT key metrics, which is the industry's largest key metrics database. Our vast online peer network of more than 139,000 unique users, our more than 500,000 one-on-one client discussions annually and our more than 3 million ratings and reviews of technology and software services, all of this and more uniquely positions Gartner as the best source for helping clients determine the right AI tools, applications and benefits.\nWe're also leveraging AI to improve productivity and effectiveness internally. Gartner's data science team is using our sophisticated proprietary AI model to quickly and systematically determine the topics of greatest interest to our clients. We've provided our experts with advanced proprietary AI tools for content production. The amount of content published per analyst is up 31% year-over-year. Over time, we expect this will have a meaningful impact on retention, and we've reduced our average publishing time by 75% compared to last year. This allows us to respond to changes in the market faster than ever. Our service delivery teams are leveraging our AI tools to be better prepared for client discussions, and our sales teams are using AI to hone their selling skills.\nAs we continue to navigate the dynamic external environment, our adaptations are beginning to yield results. Client engagement is a leading indicator of future retention. Client engagement was up in the quarter. Client retention is higher than last year. Productivity of our business development executives who sell to new enterprises is strong. And across GTS and GBS, our new business pipeline is up double digits.\nGartner Conferences is also an important indicator of client value. Licensed users who attend our conferences retain at higher rates. Prospects to attend our conferences convert to clients at higher rates. Attendee ratings of our conferences are reaching all-time highs. I recently returned from our 35th Annual IT Symposium Expo in Orlando, Florida. We hosted more than 7,000 technology leaders over the 4-day in-person conference. You can't find this many senior technology executives gathered together anywhere else. Attendance at the conference was up 8% year-over-year, excluding the U.S. Federal Government in Canada. Attendees get the conference a very strong Net Promoter Score of 75, about 1/3 of the nearly 600 sessions on-site covered the topic of AI. Our opening keynote framed the AI journey across 2 dimensions: AI readiness and human readiness. Gartner analysts discussed how CIOs can navigate vendor choices, reimagine the workforce and redefine organizational identities to be agents of change. It was our highest-rated keynote ever. Looking ahead, advanced exhibitor bookings for our 2026 conferences are strong.\nIn summary, while the macroeconomic environment remains dynamic, Gartner's Q3 financial results were ahead of expectations. We made operational adaptations that are starting to yield results. We continue to deliver great value to our clients. Enterprise client retention remains strong and contract renewal rates improved for the second quarter, and we repurchased more than $1 billion of stock in the quarter. AI will be one of the most innovative and pervasive technologies in history. Gartner is the best source for clients to determine the right tools and applications for their environments. And of course, we continue to help in other mission-critical priorities such as cybersecurity. We're also leveraging AI to improve productivity and effectiveness internally, compelling client value, strong demand, operational adaptations and modest normalization of the external environment give us a clear path back to long-term sustained double-digit growth over the medium term.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.\n\nCraig W. Safian\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Gartner, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gene, and good morning. Third quarter contract value or CV grew 3% year-over-year. Excluding the U.S. federal government, CV grew 6%. Financial results in the third quarter were better than expected, and we are increasing our guidance for the full year. Our client value proposition is unique and compelling. Our Insights products are subscription based. They help senior operating executives make better decisions on their journeys to address their strategic priorities. Because we sell to leaders across all major enterprise functions in every geography, industry and company size, we have a long runway for growth in a large addressable market. We see a unique opportunity to create long-term value for our shareholders by repurchasing our stock at an attractive price point. In the third quarter, we bought $1.1 billion of stock. We will generate more free cash flow and have fewer shares outstanding over the course of the next several years. This, coupled with accelerating growth in 2026 and beyond will create significant value for shareholders.\nThird quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, up 3% year-over-year as reported and 1% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69%, up 90 basis points from last year. EBITDA was $347 million, up 2% as reported. FX was a 3-point benefit in the quarter. Adjusted EPS was $2.76, up 10% from Q3 of last year, and free cash flow was $269 million as our year-to-date performance remains strong. During the quarter, we made a change in our segment reporting structure. Most of the Insights non-subscription revenue is now reported as other revenue in the P&L. Insights, which is almost 100% recurring subscription revenue, remains our largest, most profitable operating segment. In the earnings supplement, we provided several quarters of historical data for the new Insight segment. Insights revenue in the quarter grew 5% year-over-year as reported and 4% FX neutral. Third quarter Insights contribution margin was 77%, up 30 basis points versus last year.\nContract Value was $5 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 3% versus the prior year. Excluding the U.S. federal government, CV growth was about 270 basis points faster at around 6%. Global NCVI in the quarter, excluding U.S. federal government, was positive $62 million, a sequential increase of $49 million from Q2. This $49 million improvement is larger than the sequential improvement from Q2 to Q3 last year. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, all the industries except public sector grew at mid-single-digit rates, energy, transportation and banking led the growth. CV grew at high single-digit or mid-single-digit rates across all commercial enterprise [ sizes ]. We drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in more than half of our top 10 countries. We had more than $240 million of new business in the quarter, which is down about 4% year-over-year, excluding U.S. Fed. Outside of U.S. Fed contracts, in-quarter renewal rates improved from Q2. This largely reflects benefits from the adaptations we've been making. Nearly all of our U.S. federal contracts will come up for renewal during 2025, with more than 85% having transacted in the first 3 quarters of the year. Dollar retention year-to-date was around 46%. At September 30, we had approximately $165 million of U.S. Federal CV.\nGlobal Technology Sales contract value was $3.8 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 2% versus the prior year. Excluding the U.S. federal government for both periods, GTS CV grew about 300 basis points faster or 5% in the quarter. Tech vendor CV increased mid-single digits, with small tech vendor growth continuing to improve. For tech subsectors unaffected by tariffs, such as software and services, the CV growth was low double digit or high single digits. While retention for GTS was 98% for the quarter, excluding the U.S. federal business, wallet retention was more than 100%. In quarter contract renewal rates improved from Q2 to Q3. GTS new business was down 12% compared to last year and down about 4%, excluding the U.S. federal government. GTS quota-bearing headcount was up 1% year-over-year as we continue to optimize our territories. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement.\nGlobal Business Sales contract value was $1.2 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 7% year-over-year. Excluding the U.S. federal government, GBS CV grew about 160 basis points faster at around 9%. Half of the major GBS practices grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates. Growth was led by the sales, legal and finance practices. GBS and [ CVI ] was positive $17 million in the third quarter. Excluding the U.S. federal government, GBS and CVI was positive $25 million. While retention for GBS was 102% for the quarter, in quarter contract renewal rates, excluding the U.S. federal government, improved from Q2 to Q3. GBS new business was down 10% compared to last year. Excluding the U.S. federal government, new business was down about 4%. GBS quota-bearing headcount was up 5% year-over-year. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement.\nConferences revenue for the third quarter was $75 million. On a same conference basis, revenue growth was around 6% FX neutral. Contribution margin was 37%. We held 10 destination conferences in the third quarter as planned. Q3 consulting revenue was $124 million compared with $128 million in the year ago period. FX was a benefit of about 200 basis points in the quarter. Consulting contribution margin was 29% in Q3. Labor-based revenue was $94 million. Backlog at September 30 was $195 million. We had 1 large project which slipped out of Q3, affecting revenue and backlog.\nIn Contract Optimization, we delivered $30 million of revenue in the quarter, up 12% versus Q3 of last year and 11% FX neutral. Our contract optimization revenue is highly variable. Consolidated cost of services was about flat year-over-year in the third quarter as reported and down 1% FX neutral. SG&A increased 7% year-over-year in the third quarter was reported and about 6% on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter compared with 2024 as a result of headcount growth and 2025 merit increases. EBITDA for the third quarter was $347 million, up 2% from last year as reported. FX contributed almost 3 percentage points. We outperformed in the third quarter through modest revenue upside, effective expense management and a prudent approach to guidance. Depreciation in the quarter of $31 million was up 6% compared to 2024. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $15 million. This is favorable by $2 million versus the third quarter of 2024 due to lower interest expense and higher interest income on our cash balances. The Q3 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 23% for the quarter. This compares to last year's rate of 26%. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 14% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q3 was $2.76, up 10% compared to Q3 last year. We had 75 million shares outstanding in the third quarter. This is an improvement of about 3 million shares or approximately 4% year-over-year. We exited the third quarter with 73 million shares on an unweighted basis.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $299 million. This compares with $291 million in Q3 2024, adjusting for last year's $300 million of conference cancellation insurance proceeds. CapEx was $29 million, up about $4 million year-over-year. This was primarily due to real estate related costs and in line with our expectations. Third quarter free cash flow was $269 million. This compares with $265 million in Q3 2024, adjusting for last year's insurance proceeds. Free cash flow on a rolling 4-quarter basis was 137% of GAAP net income and 76% of EBITDA. As we previously noted, there were several items that affect rolling fourth quarter net income and free cash flow, including cash taxes on the insurance proceeds in Q4 of 2024, 2 real estate lease termination payments and tax planning benefits. We also had a noncash goodwill impairment charge in Q3 2025. This relates to the digital markets business, which now sits in the other segment. Adjusting for these items, free cash flow on a rolling 4-quarter basis was 20% of revenue, 83% of EBITDA and 154% of GAAP net income.\nAt the end of the third quarter, we had about $1.4 billion of cash. Our September 30 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was well under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy. Our balance sheet is very strong with $2.1 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and almost 90% fixed interest rates. We repurchased $1.1 billion of stock during the third quarter. Year-to-date through the end of September, we have purchased around $1.5 billion of our stock. Our repurchase authorization is about $1.3 billion. We expect the Board will refresh the authorization as needed. As we continue to repurchase stock, we create value for shareholders through EPS accretion and increasing returns on invested capital. We are increasing our full year guidance to reflect recent performance and trends. Based on October FX rates, we expect revenue growth to benefit by about 80 basis points and EBITDA growth to benefit by about 165 basis points for the full year. As a reminder, about 1/3 of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar.\nFor Insights revenue in 2025, our guidance reflects Q3 Contract Value, which provides very high visibility for the fourth quarter. For Conferences, we are basing our guidance on the 53 in-person destination conferences we have planned for 2025. We have good visibility into current year revenue with the majority of what we've guided already under contract. For Consulting, we have more visibility into the next quarter or 2 based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. Contract Optimization has had several very strong years and the business remains highly variable. Our updated 2025 guidance is as follows: we expect Insights revenue of at least $5.06 billion, which is an increase from last quarter and is FX-neutral growth of about 4%. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $630 million, which is an increase from last quarter and is FX neutral growth of about 6%. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $575 million, which is growth of about 2% FX neutral. This is unchanged from last quarter. We continue to expect at least $210 million of other revenue. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $6.475 billion, which is an increase from last quarter and is FX-neutral growth of 3%. We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.575 billion, up $60 million from our prior guidance. This reflects full year margins of 24.3%, up from last quarter. We expect 2025 adjusted EPS of least $12.65, an increase from last quarter. For 2025, we expect free cash flow of at least $1.145 billion. This reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of 165%. Our guidance is based on 76 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which incorporates the repurchases made through the end of the third quarter. We exited Q3 with about 73 million fully diluted shares. For Q4, we expect adjusted EBITDA of at least $400 million.\nOur financial results in Q3 were ahead of expectations, and we've increased the guidance for 2025. Contract Value, excluding the U.S. federal business grew 6% in the quarter. Third quarter contract renewal rates, excluding the U.S. federal government, improved from Q2, and we saw a year-over-year increase in our sequential NCVI improvement. We are positioned to accelerate CV growth in 2026, on a path to long-term sustained double-digit growth in 2027 and beyond. We'll also deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

Welcome to Gartner's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. I'm David Cohen, SVP of Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions]\nAfter comments by Gene Hall, Gartner's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Craig Safian, Gartner's Chief Financial Officer, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nThis call will include a discussion of second quarter 2025 financial results and Gartner's outlook for 2025 is disclosed in today's earnings release and earnings supplement, both posted to our website, investor.gartner.com.\nOn the call, unless stated otherwise, all references to EBITDA are for adjusted EBITDA with the adjustments as described in our earnings release and supplement. Our contract values and associated growth rates we discuss are based on 2025 foreign exchange rates. All growth rates in Gene's comments are FX neutral, unless stated otherwise. All references to share counts are for fully diluted weighted average share counts unless stated otherwise. Reconciliations for all non-GAAP numbers we use are available in the Investor Relations section of the gartner.com website.\nAs set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2024 annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as in other filings with the SEC. I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.\nNow I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\n\nEugene A. Hall\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Gartner, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us today. There are 2 things I'd like you to take away from today's discussion. First, AI is an important opportunity for Gartner across several dimensions. And second, we're making adaptations that give us a clear path back to double-digit growth. AI is one of the most pervasive changes happening around the world. It was the single largest demand area across all the topics we cover for virtually every role. Clients see large potential in AI, and they need help in determining the best way to capture that potential. Across functions, geographies and industries, clients are looking to Gartner to provide that help, and we're the best solution to support clients' AI journeys.\nWhile AI was the largest single topic, there were others that were mission critical to clients, including cybersecurity, cost optimization, data governance and management, IT strategy and digital transformation, risk management, finance transformation, HR talent planning and more.\nWe also experienced some headwinds during Q2. Measures of CEO confidence fell to recessionary levels, among the fastest drops ever recorded. And in a Gartner survey, 78% of CEOs indicated they're implementing cost-cutting measures to safeguard performance. We have a high degree of confidence in what caused these headwinds because we track the reason for every loss for both renewals and potential new business.\nThe largest headwind in Q2 was with the U.S. federal government. Initiatives from the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, made it more challenging for clients to purchase or renew many of our products. In addition, there were impacts from tariff policies.\nWith the prospect of higher tariffs, many companies implemented strong cost-saving measures. Even companies not directly impacted by tariffs began implementing these measures. Purchase decisions that were previously made by functional leaders are now being escalated to the CFO or even the CEO. These changes occurred at a record pace, impacting our performance during Q2.\nOne of Gartner's core strengths is agility in responding to change. So we're making adaptations to accelerate our performance going forward. With the U.S. federal government, we're ensuring we stay aligned to the changing priorities, especially improving efficiency. Of course, we'll also continue to support critical issues such as cybersecurity, and we're working with our clients to adjust to new procurement processes. We're also adapting to industries impacted by changing tariffs. A portion of our clients are always interested in cost optimization. We have great expertise in helping clients on this topic. Clients highly value our guidance because it results in quantifiable cost savings.\nNow with tariff changes, the number of clients interested in cost optimization has increased dramatically. So we've expanded our capabilities, including certifying our client-facing associates on delivering these services. We're also helping clients determine how to optimally reconfigure supply chains for tariff changes. Even industries not directly impacted by tariffs will get strong value from enhanced cost optimization capabilities.\nWe're making several other changes to reaccelerate growth. In research, we redesigned our insight processes to ensure we create content relevant to the broadest possible audience and that delivers the biggest impact. We're also incorporating additional proprietary data to enhance the value clients receive from our insights. We've begun rolling out Ask Gartner, an AI-powered tool for our clients to access trusted insights from Gartner. Ask Gartner has been in development for almost 2 years to ensure clients get the high-quality results they expect from Gartner. It's based on best-in-class large language models. Ask Gartner quickly breaks down a client's question into topic and intent and provide structured answers through natural language processing. Answers contain direct references to our distinctive insights.\nUnlike other AI tools, which provide answers based on public information from the Internet, Ask Gartner's responses are fully grounded in our world-class proprietary independent and objective insights. Ask Gartner also provides users with relevant images and recommends follow-up questions, making our insights more discoverable and fully immersing clients in the Gartner platform.\nAsk Gartner is unique because it marries the power of Gartner insights with AI, and our teams are focused on making sure it gets better and better. We've been testing it with internal teams and a pilot group of clients. One client referred to Ask Gartner as, \"a game changer for Gartner.\" Some mentioned time savings of up to 75% on the platform.\nWe're also leveraging AI internally. We've introduced more than 50 applications that use AI to improve associate productivity and effectiveness.\nFinally, we appointed a strong tenured Gartner leader to head up our research organization. We're also making adaptations in sales and services to accelerate growth. We recently launched a new program to better equip client-facing associates with comprehensive knowledge on hot topics, including AI and cost optimization, and we're certifying our associates on these critical topics to ensure a high level of capability. Not all of our clients are aware of the full suite of high-value capabilities they're entitled to. So we're training our teams to ensure clients benefit from the full range of services.\nWe're also expanding and refining our sales development program, which we've discussed before. This is an apprentice type program that pairs early career talent with experienced sales professionals. Program graduates then take on their own sales territories and have higher productivity than those hired directly into role. We expect these and other adaptations will get us back to double-digit growth.\nGartner's strategy and the foundation of our business is to guide executives on their journeys to achieve their mission-critical priorities. Addressing these priorities usually requires long complex journeys. Through our high-value proprietary business and technology insights, we got our clients at every stage of their journeys.\nGartner Insights are derived from a vast pool of highly proprietary data. Every year, we hold more than 500,000 2-way conversations with more than 80,000 executives across every major function and in every industry. We learn what they care about most, what's working and what isn't. All of this amounts to several hundred terabytes of highly proprietary data.\nWe also conducted more than 27,000 briefings annually with technology provider executives. This gives us unique insights into the technology industry that no one else has. We supplement this data with additional terabytes of information from proprietary surveys, tools, models, benchmarks and more. Our data is real time and continuously updated, reflecting the latest information and challenges our clients are experiencing.\nOur more than 2,500 world-class experts use this vast proprietary data in highly developed processes to create unique and valuable insights. These insights aren't available anywhere else. We know we need to get better every year. So we continually develop new proprietary data sources and constantly innovate our processes. The segment that develops these insights has historically been called Research. To better describe the value we deliver, we're changing the name of the segment. Going forward, our Research business will now be called Business and Technology Insights, or Insights for short.\nSummarizing, there are 2 things I'd like you to take away from today's discussion. First, AI is an important opportunity for Gartner across several dimensions. It's the highest demand topic that we're helping our clients with today. We [indiscernible] Gartner to provide faster, easier access to your insights, and we're improving internal efficiency with AI tools. And second, we're making adaptations that will give us a clear path back to double-digit growth.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.\n\nCraig W. Safian\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Gartner, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gene, and good morning. Second quarter contract value or CV grew 5% year-over-year. Revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow were better than expected. We remain highly focused on delivering extraordinary value to our clients. The challenging Q1 selling environment, which was affected by DOGE and tariff-affected industry spending changes continued through the second quarter. We are updating our guidance to reflect the Q2 results and the outlook for the balance of the year. With our disciplined expense management, we will continue to deliver strong profitability and free cash flow.\nSince the end of the first quarter, we increased the pace of share repurchases. We bought $274 million in Q2 and an additional $282 million since the end of the second quarter. This brings the year-to-date repurchase total to approximately $720 million. We will generate more free cash flow and have fewer shares outstanding over the course of the next several years. This, coupled with return to double-digit growth, will create significant value for shareholders.\nAfter reviewing the results for the second quarter and updating the guidance, I will take you through some of the numbers related to our path back to double-digit CV growth that Gene highlighted. Second quarter revenue was $1.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year as reported and 5% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68%, up 70 basis points from last year. EBITDA was $443 million, up 7% as reported and 5% FX neutral versus the second quarter of 2024. Adjusted EPS was $3.53, up 10% from Q2 of last year. And free cash flow was $347 million, another strong performance.\nAs Gene just highlighted, we renamed the Research segment to Business and Technology Insights or Insights to reflect the nature of the value we provide to clients. Insights revenue in the quarter grew 4% year-over-year as reported and 3% FX neutral. Subscription revenue grew 5% FX-neutral. Nonsubscription Insights revenue continues to be affected by shifts in traffic volumes. Second quarter Insights contribution margin was 74%, up 20 basis points versus last year.\nContract value was $5 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 5% versus the prior year. Contract value and CV growth are FX-neutral. Excluding the U.S. federal government, CV growth was about 150 basis points faster at around 6%. The Global NCVI in the quarter, excluding the U.S. federal government, was positive $13 million.\nCV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, all the industries except public sector grew at high single or mid-single digit rates. Energy, banking, transportation and health care led the growth. CV grew at mid-single or high single-digit rates across all commercial enterprise sizes.\nWe drove double-digit growth in half of our top 10 countries. CV declined on a year-over-year basis in Canada and Australia, which combined represents around 6% of global contract value. Nearly all of our U.S. federal contracts will come up for renewal during 2025 with over 60% having transacted in the first half of the year. Dollar retention year-to-date was around 47%. At June 30, we had approximately $200 million of U.S. Federal CV.\nGlobal Technology Sales contract value was $3.8 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 4% versus the prior year. Excluding the U.S. federal government for both periods, GTS CV grew about 180 basis points faster or 5% in the quarter. The U.S. Federal business NCVI was negative $26 million. While retention for GTS was 99% for the quarter, excluding the U.S. federal business, while retention was over 100%. GTS new business was down 8% compared to last year. GTS quota-bearing head count was up 3% year-over-year. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement.\nGlobal Business Sales contract value was $1.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 9% year-over-year. Excluding the U.S. federal government, GBS CV grew about 60 basis points faster at around 10%. All of our major GBS practices grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates. Growth was led by the sales, finance and legal practices. GBS NCVI was positive $14 million in the second quarter. Excluding the U.S. federal government, GBS and CVI was positive $18 million. Wallet retention for GBS was 104% for the quarter. GBS new business was down 3% compared to last year. GBS quarter-bearing head count was up 10% year-over-year. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement.\nConferences revenue for the second quarter was $211 million, increasing 14% as reported and 12% FX neutral compared to Q2 of 2024. Adjusting for the 3 conferences, which moved from Q1 or Q3 last year to Q2 this year, revenue growth was around 6% FX neutral. Contribution margin was 57%, consistent with typical Q2 seasonality. We held 19 destination conferences in the second quarter as planned. Q2 consulting revenue was $156 million compared with $143 million in the year ago period, up about 9% as reported and 6% FX neutral. Consulting contribution margin was 40% in the second quarter.\nLabor-based revenue was $110 million. This part of the segment was up 3% versus Q2 of last year's reported and about flat FX neutral. Backlog at June 30 was $191 million, down about 2% year-over-year FX neutral.\nIn contract optimization, we delivered $46 million of revenue in the quarter, up 26% versus Q2 of last year and 24% FX neutral. The quarter was ahead of our expectations. Our contract optimization revenue is highly variable.\nConsolidated cost of services increased 4% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and 2% FX neutral. The biggest driver of the increase was higher compensation costs. SG&A increased 9% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and about 8% on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of head count growth.\nEBITDA for the second quarter was $443 million, up 7% from last year's reported and up 5% FX neutral. We outperformed in the second quarter through modest revenue upside, effective expense management and a prudent approach to guidance. Depreciation in the quarter of $31 million was up 11% compared to 2024. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $11 million. This is favorable by $8 million versus second quarter of 2024 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through the third quarter of 2025.\nThe Q2 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income was 24% for the quarter. This compares to last year's rate of 23%. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 25% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q2 was $3.53, up 10% compared to Q2 last year. We had 77 million shares outstanding in the second quarter. This is an improvement of about 1 million shares or approximately 1% year-over-year. We exited the second quarter with just under 77 million shares on an unweighted basis.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $384 million, up 4% compared with last year. CapEx was $36 million, up about $7 million year-over-year. This was primarily due to real estate related costs and in line with our expectations.\nSecond quarter free cash flow was $347 million, up 2% compared with Q2 in 2024. Free cash flow on a rolling 4-quarter basis was 119% of GAAP net income and 95% of EBITDA. As we noted previously, there were several items that affect rolling fourth quarter net income and free cash flow, including after-tax insurance proceeds in 2024, 2 real estate lease termination payments and tax planning benefits last year. Adjusting for these items, free cash flow on a rolling 4-quarter basis was 20% of revenue, 83% of EBITDA and 157% of GAAP net income.\nAt the end of the second quarter, we had about $2.2 billion of cash. Our June 30 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was well under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of disciplined share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $2.9 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates.\nWe repurchased $274 million of stock during the second quarter. Since the end of June, we have bought back an additional $282 million worth of shares, bringing us to about $720 million year-to-date. Last week, the board increased the repurchase authorization to about $1 billion. We expect they will refresh the authorization as needed. As we continue to repurchase stock, we create value for our shareholders through EPS accretion and increasing returns on invested capital.\nWe are updating our full year guidance to reflect recent performance and trends. We are remaining agile in managing our cost structure while also ensuring we have enough selling capacity now and in the future. This includes QBH and other sales-related roles, which are key inputs into our algorithm for future sustained double-digit growth.\nBased on July FX rates, we expect revenue growth to benefit by about 95 basis points and EBITDA growth to benefit by about 190 basis points for the full year. As a reminder, about 1/3 of our revenue and operating expenses are dominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nFor the Insight subscription revenue in 2025, our guidance reflects an expectation that Q2 trends for new business and retention continue through the second half. At this point in the year, we have very high visibility into the Insight subscription revenue for calendar 2025. We've also incorporated the information we have about U.S. federal spending decisions to date. In addition, we've taken a prudent view of the outlook.\nWhile the selling environment remains challenging, and we've seen longer sales cycles, we entered Q3 with double-digit year-over-year growth in both GTS and GBS new business pipelines.\nFor the nonsubscription part of the Insight segment, we've built a continuation of recent traffic and pricing trends into the guidance.\nFor conferences, we are basing our guidance on the 53 in-person destination conferences we have planned for 2025. We have good visibility at the current year revenue with the majority of what we've guided already under contract.\nFor consulting, we have more visibility into the next quarter or 2 based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. Contract optimization has had several very strong years and the business remains highly variable.\nOur updated 2025 guidance is as follows. We expect Insights revenue of at least $5.255 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 2%. This reflects subscription Insights revenue growth of about 4%. We expect around $210 million of non-subscription revenue. We expect conferences revenue of at least $625 million, which is FX-neutral growth of about 5%. This is unchanged from last quarter. We expect consulting revenue of at least $575 million, which is growth of about 1% FX neutral. This is also unchanged from last quarter. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $6.455 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 2%.\nWe now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.515 billion, down $20 million from our prior guidance. This reflects margins of 23.5%, consistent with last quarter's outlook despite the lower revenue guidance. We expect 2025 adjusted EPS of at least $11.75, an increase from last quarter.\nFor 2025, we expect free cash flow of at least $1.145 billion. This is unchanged from our prior guidance and reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of 141%. Our guidance is based on 77 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which incorporates the repurchases made through the end of the second quarter. For Q3, we expect adjusted EBITDA of at least $300 million.\nOur financial results through June were modestly ahead of expectations, underscoring the resilience of our business model. We've updated the revenue guidance to reflect continued challenges in the selling environment. Our EBITDA margin outlook remains higher than it was at the start of the year. We have successfully navigated challenging environments before and know the right things to do. We are adapting by making operational changes and renewing focus on leveraging our proven sales best practices. This will drive the return to historical levels of productivity. Some of the headwinds are related to temporary external factors, including the U.S. federal government and tariff affected industries. As productivity gets back to historical levels, we will accelerate QBH to capture the very large addressable market opportunity we have.\nBefore we go to questions, I will take you through some of the numbers related to our path back to double-digit CV growth. If recent retention and new business trends continue in the second half, we would exit this year with CV growth in the low to mid-single digits. This reflects DOGE, tariff-affected industry dynamics and tech vendors only part of the way back to normal spending. There are 4 primary categories, which will drive the return to double-digit growth.\nFirst, most of our U.S. federal contracts will have come up for renewal this year. Removing the DOGE headwinds with no assumption for net growth next year will add back around 200 basis points of CV growth in 2026.\nSecond, as companies and tariff-affected industries get more clarity around trade policies, we expect them to get back to normal course planning and spending. This should add at least 100 basis points to growth.\nThird, tech vendor remains on a path back to double digits. We are encouraged, in particular, with the improvement in the small tech vendor part of the business.\nWithin large tech vendors, the overall trend remains positive. The second quarter was affected by the timing of a few larger deals getting delayed and tariffs affecting some parts of the hardware subsegment. Continued reacceleration of tech vendor CV would add back another 100 basis points to growth.\nFinally, we are focused on improving our operations to drive faster growth, even in challenging selling environments. This includes more focus on cost optimization insights, the continued rollout of Ask Gartner, the initiatives Gene discussed and more. We expect to add as much as 100 to 200 basis points to growth from these initiatives and better overall execution. All these factors would get us to at least high single-digit growth in 2026, well on our way back to double-digit growth in 2027 and beyond.\nAnother take on the opportunity is to recognize that as the sales teams return towards historical levels of productivity, we will return to double-digit CV growth. With around 5,000 sellers, we can generate enough NCVI to grow high single to low double digits next year. This is the case with outgrowing QBH and even at productivity levels lower than the historical $110,000 to $120,000 per seller. We are implementing programs to support the sales teams to drive client and prospect engagement and to grow our sales and sales support teams outside of direct frontline quota-bearing headcount.\nBased on recent trends, as I mentioned, CV growth this year will be in the low to mid-single digits. With the adaptations we are making and with the stabilization of our most acutely impacted end markets, we expect growth to accelerate next year and again in 2027. Based on this outlook, our overall medium-term growth algorithm, including double-digit revenue growth and modest margin expansion remains unchanged. We'll also continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time, and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions.

I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.\nNow, I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\n\nEugene A. Hall\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Gartner, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner remains resilient in a complex environment. In Q1, contract value grew 7%. First quarter revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow were ahead of our expectations. We increased head count across our sales organizations by 4%. As we navigate another year of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, we will continue to be agile and we'll target our investments to support long-term sustained double-digit growth.\nResearch continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Research contract value grew 7%. Excluding the U.S. federal business, contract value grew 8%. Within research, we serve executives and their teams through distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS contract value grew 6%. Excluding the U.S. federal business, contract value grew 7%. Contract value with tech vendor clients improved for the fourth consecutive quarter. Global Business Sales, or GBS, source leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, legal, sales and more.\nGBS contract value increased 11%. Gartner Conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. On a same conference basis, revenue grew 12%. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 5% against a strong compare from Q1 2024.\nRevenue from contract optimization grew a robust 38% and consulting backlog grew 16%. Overall, our Q1 financial results were ahead of expectations. Gartner has a unique client value proposition. We deliver actionable objective insight, guidance and tools that help our clients succeed with their mission-critical priorities. We practiced disciplined cost management while remaining agile and prudently investing for future growth. We generate free cash flow well in excess of net income. And we returned capital to our shareholders through our repurchase program.\nOver the past 5 years, we've seen persistent elevated levels of volatility in the macroeconomic environment. The COVID-19 pandemic, the bursting of a tech spending bubble, the highest inflation in 40 years, a sharp rise in interest rates, the first ground war in Europe in 80 years. Now government policy and tariff changes are affecting enterprises across the U.S. and around the world in different and complex ways.\nThere's a high level of macroeconomic uncertainty. Executives know they need help. Gartner is the best, most cost-effective source for the insight, guidance and tools they need to succeed. We help our clients make smarter decisions that address mission-critical priorities, such as cost optimization, managing through public policy changes, leveraging AI innovation, cybersecurity and more. And we do this while helping them manage risk, save time, save money and build confidence.\nGartner helps senior executives make smarter decisions to achieve their mission-critical priorities. Today, one urgent priority for the majority of our clients is harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence. Of course, Gartner is one of the world's leading experts in AI. We helped thousands of end-user enterprises determine the best uses and business cases for AI. With our in-depth understanding of end-user business cases, we also advised thousands of technology vendors on how to compete in the AI marketplace.\nAnd finally, we use AI internally to support our business. We've developed proprietary insight, guidance and tools to help senior executives make smarter decisions on their mission-critical priorities. Our 2,500 experts developed these proprietary insights, guidance and tools by analyzing our more than 500,000 one-on-one conversations that we hold with clients every year. In addition, we conduct proprietary primary research which is only available through Gartner to supplement these conversations. All of this creates a valuable data set that is massive, proprietary and constantly updated.\nFinally, we incorporate publicly available data were helpful, often using AI. The combination of our 2,500 experts, hundreds of thousands of conversations with end users and technology vendors and proprietary data methodologies and process, makes our insights, guidance and tools, highly valuable, highly unique and highly differentiated from any other source. A core element of our strategy is continuous improvement in innovation, which we will apply to further increase our value and differentiation over time.\nOur powerful client value proposition gives us a vast untapped market opportunity. And we know the right things to do to capture that opportunity. Gartner has proven best practices that address how we serve our clients, recruit, hire, train and deploy our salespeople, create our insights, guidance and tools, host attendees at our conferences and support our largest technology clients through consulting. We also have best practices that address how we approach expense management to optimize flexibility while increasing selling capacity.\nFor the remainder of 2025, we plan to grow sales head count in the mid-single digits, excluding directly impacted areas. This reflects our commitment to invest for future growth while delivering strong margins and free cash flow. Our plan is to exit the current environment better, faster and stronger than before with continued sales head count growth and a return to historically strong productivity we're well positioned to accelerate growth as the external environment evolves. We expect to reaccelerate CV growth to our target of 12% to 16% when the macroeconomic environment returns to normal and we expect EBITDA margins to expand through the natural operating leverage in the business.\nGartner has a highly diversified client base. The U.S. federal government represents approximately 4% of our total contract value. Our U.S. federal business has been impacted by the recent policy changes. Nearly all of our U.S. federal contracts are up for renewal in 2025. Roughly 40% of these were transaction in Q1, the largest quarter of the year and we renewed roughly half that business. We remain laser focused on creating and delivering value for our U.S. federal clients. As the U.S. federal government modifies and refines their priorities, we believe that we will be a core part of helping them achieve critical priorities such as cybersecurity, cost optimization, digital transformation and more.\nStock buybacks are an important way we return value to shareholders. We remain eager to repurchase shares aggressively. Our approach is designed to optimize returns by being price sensitive, opportunistic and disciplined. In closing, Gartner delivered financial results ahead of expectations. Tech vendor CV growth continued to accelerate. We have a powerful client value proposition and a vast addressable market opportunity. We will continue to create value for our shareholders by providing actionable objective insight, guidance and tools to our clients. prudently investing for future growth, remaining agile and disciplined in our approach to expenses and returning capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase program.\nWe expect to deliver modest margin expansion over time, alongside double-digit top line growth, and we'll continue to generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. All of this and more positions us to drive long-term double-digit growth and sustain our track record of success far into the future. With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.\n\nCraig W. Safian\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Gartner, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gene, and good morning. First quarter contract value or CV grew 7% year-over-year. Revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow were better than expected as we continue to execute well in an increasingly complex environment. We were resilient in the quarter affected by macro factors. Since we reported Q4 2024 results in early February, there were notable changes in the U.S. federal government end market. The broader selling environment also shifted during the quarter as many company decision makers started to adjust to the evolving global macro economy.\nWe are updating our guidance to reflect Q1 performance, the new macro landscape, the benefit from the move in FX rates and our own expense agility. We repurchased $163 million of stock in the quarter, maintaining flexibility as the market digests the changes in the macro landscape. We remain eager to repurchase shares, which we will do opportunistically.\nFirst quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, up 4% year-over-year as reported and 6% FX-neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69%, up 20 basis points from last year. EBITDA was $385 million, up 1% as reported and 3% FX neutral versus the first quarter of 2024. Adjusted EPS was $2.98, up 2% from Q1 of last year. And free cash flow was $288 million, a very strong performance for our first quarter. Research revenue in the quarter grew 4% year-over-year as reported and 6% FX-neutral. Subscription revenue grew 8% FX-neutral.\nNonsubscription research revenue was in line with our expectations. First quarter research contribution margin was 74%, consistent with last year. Contract value was $5.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 7% versus the prior year. Contract value and CV growth are FX-neutral. Excluding the U.S. federal government, CV grew 8%. Contract value growth with tech vendors continued to improve. Global CV was $63 million lower than Q4 2024 with around 80% of the change attributable to the U.S. federal government end market. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, all of the industry sectors, except 2 grew at high single-digit rates led by the energy, health care and manufacturing sectors.\nCV grew at high single-digit rates across all enterprise sizes except small, which grew low single digits. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries. Canada, which represents about 3% of total CV, had a more challenging selling environment in the quarter. Nearly all of our U.S. federal contracts will come up for renewal during 2025, with about 40% having transacted in Q1, the largest quarter of this calendar year.\nIn the first quarter, the dollar retention was almost 50%. At March 31, we had $225 million of U.S. Federal CV. Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.9 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 6% versus the prior year. Excluding the U.S. federal government for both periods, GTS CV grew 7% in the quarter as the tech vendor market continued to improve. $44 million of the $58 million change in GTS CV from Q4 was due to the U.S. federal government. While retention for GTS was 101% for the quarter. GTS new business was down 4% compared to last year. CTS quota-bearing head count was up 3% year-over-year. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Global Business Sales contract value was $1.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 11% year-over-year.\nAll of our major GBS practices grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates. Growth was led by the sales, finance and legal practices. GBS CV was $5 million below the fourth quarter. Excluding the U.S. federal government, GBS CV was largely unchanged from Q4. Wallet retention for GBS was 105% for the quarter. GBS new business was down 3% compared to last year. GBS quota-bearing head count was up 9% year-over-year. As with GTS, our regular full set of TBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the first quarter was $73 million, increasing 4% as reported and 5% FX neutral compared to Q1 of 2024.\nAdjusting for the 2 conferences we moved to Q2 this year, revenue increased around 12% FX neutral. Contribution margin was 38%, consistent with typical Q1 seasonality. We held 10 destination conferences in the first quarter as planned. Q1 consulting revenue was $140 million compared with $135 million in the year-ago period, of about 4% as reported and 5% FX neutral. Consulting contribution margin was 38% in the first quarter. Labor-based revenue was $104 million. This part of the segment was down 4% versus Q1 of last year's reported and 2% FX neutral against the tough compare.\nBacklog at March 31 was $214 million, increasing 16% year-over-year FX-neutral. This was driven by strength in multiyear contracts. In Contract Optimization, we delivered $36 million of revenue in the quarter, up 36% versus Q1 of last year and 38% FX neutral. The quarter was ahead of our expectations. Our contract optimization revenue is highly variable. Consolidated cost of services increased 3% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and 4% FX neutral. The biggest driver of the increase was higher compensation costs. SG&A increased 6% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and about 7% on an FX-neutral basis.\nSG&A increased in the quarter as a result of head count growth. EBITDA for the first quarter was $385 million, up 1% from last year's reported and up 3% FX neutral. We outperformed in the first quarter through modest revenue upside, effective expense management and a prudent approach to guidance. Depreciation in the quarter of $29 million was up 10% compared to 2024. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $12 million. This is favorable by $5 million versus the first quarter of 2024 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through the third quarter of 2025.\nThe Q1 adjusted tax rate, which we used for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 21% for the quarter. This compares to last year's rate of 19%. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 26% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q1 was $2.98, up 2% compared to Q1 last year. We had 78 million shares outstanding in the first quarter. This is an improvement of over 1 million shares or about 1% year-over-year. We exited the first quarter with just under 78 million shares on an unweighted basis.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $314 million, up 66% compared with last year. CapEx was $26 million, up about $3 million year-over-year. This was primarily due to real estate related costs and in line with our expectations. First quarter free cash flow was $288 million, up 73% compared with Q1 in 2024. Free cash flow on a rolling 4-quarter basis was 120% of GAAP net income and 97% of EBITDA. As we noted last quarter, there were several items in 2024 that affect rolling fourth quarter net income and free cash flow, including after-tax insurance proceeds or real estate lease termination payment and tax planning benefits.\nAdjusting for these items, free cash flow on a rolling 4-quarter basis was 20% of revenue, 82% of EBITDA and 155% of GAAP net income. At the end of the first quarter, we had about $2.1 billion of cash. Our March 31 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was well under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of disciplined share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A.\nOur balance sheet is very strong with $2.8 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased $163 million of stock during the first quarter. At the end of Q1, our share repurchase authorization was approximately $870 million. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital. We are updating our full year guidance to reflect recent performance and trends.\nSince we reported Q4 results in early February, the world has become significantly more dynamic. We are applying all the lessons we've learned from prior challenging environments. We are shifting our focus to the things our clients need the most in an extraordinarily uncertain operating environment. We're also remaining agile in managing our cost structure while also investing for future growth.\nIn particular, we are preserving and growing our selling capacity outside of directly impacted areas, which is a key input into our algorithm for future sustained double-digit growth. The U.S. dollar weakened significantly during Q1. We now expect FX to benefit revenue growth by about 50 basis points and EBITDA growth by about 130 basis points in 2025. We've provided both the FX-driven and operational changes to guidance in our earnings supplement.\nAs a reminder, about 1/3 of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For research subscription revenue in 2025, our guidance reflects an expectation that Q1 trends for new business and retention continue for the balance of the year. We've also incorporated the information we have about U.S. federal spending decisions to date. In addition, we've taken a prudent view of the outlook as the current environment remains very dynamic.\nFor the nonsubscription part of the research segment, we've built a continuation of recent traffic and pricing trends into the guidance. For conferences, we are basing our guidance on the 53 in-person destination conferences we have planned for 2025. We have good visibility into current year revenue with the majority of what we've guided already under contract.\nFor consulting, we have more visibility into the next quarter or two based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. Given the shifts in the macro environment, we have been thoughtful about the outlook for the labor-based part of the business. Contract optimization has had several very strong years and the business remains highly variable. We've incorporated a prudent outlook for this part of the segment. Our base level assumptions for consolidated expenses have changed to reflect the revenue outlook.\nWe have demonstrated our ability to manage costs prudently in any market environment, and we will remain agile. We will do this while also investing for future growth. Our plan is to exit the current environment better, faster and stronger than before. We can both deliver on our EBITDA margin commitments for this year while investing for future growth.\nOur plan for both GTS and GBS is for mid-single-digit sales head count growth outside of directly impacted areas. This reflects our commitment to invest for future growth while delivering strong margins and free cash flow. We're maintaining recruiting capacity and are prepared to go faster on the hiring based on the macro driven demand.\nAnd as the selling environment gets back to normal, we expect significant benefits from QBH productivity. Our updated 2025 guidance is as follows: we expect research revenue of at least $5.34 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 4%. This reflects subscription research revenue growth of about 5%. We expect conferences revenue of at least $625 million, which is FX-neutral growth of about 6%. We expect consulting revenue of at least $575 million, which is growth of about 2% FX neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $6.535 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 4%.\nWe now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.535 billion, up $25 million from our prior guidance. We expect 2025 adjusted EPS of at least $11.70, up about $0.25 from last quarter. For 2025, we expect free cash flow of at least $1.145 billion. This reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of 137%. Our guidance is based on 78 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of the first quarter.\nFor Q2, we expect adjusted EBITDA of at least $400 million. Our financial results through March were ahead of expectations, underscoring the resilience of our business model. While we updated the revenue guidance to reflect the macro landscape, we will also benefit from the latest FX rates. Our EBITDA margin outlook is now higher than it was in February. We have successfully navigated challenging macro environments before and know the right things to do. We are running our operational best practices, including delivering exceptional value for our clients, running our sales and services best practices playbooks, investing in sales capacity, which is a key ingredient for future sustained double-digit top line growth, managing our expenses aggressively and thoughtfully to protect profitability and cash flow and using our strong balance sheet and cash flow to buy our stock and for tuck-in M&A.\nLooking out over the medium term in a normal macro environment, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. There is operating leverage in the business, which allows us to expand margins. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing about in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we will deliver modest EBITDA margin expansion.\nWe can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

Welcome to Gartner's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I'm David Cohen, SVP of Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions]. After comments by Gene Hall, Gartner's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Craig Safian, Gartner's Chief Financial Officer, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nThis call will include a discussion of fourth quarter 2024 financial results and Gartner's outlook for 2025, as disclosed in today's earnings release and earnings supplement both posted to our website, investor.gartner.com.\nOn the call, unless stated otherwise, all references to EBITDA are for adjusted EBITDA with the adjustments as described in our earnings release and supplement. Our contract values and associated growth rates we discuss are based on 2024 foreign exchange rates. All growth rates in Gene's comments are FX-neutral unless stated otherwise. All references to share counts are for fully diluted weighted average share count unless stated otherwise.\nReconciliations for all non-GAAP numbers we use are available in the Investor Relations section of the gartner.com website. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including those contained in the company's 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as in other filings with the SEC. I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.\nNow I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\n\nEugene A. Hall\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Gartner, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner continues to remain resilient in a complex environment. In Q4, contract value grew 8%. Fourth quarter revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow were ahead of expectations. We delivered 6% headcount growth across our sales organizations and will continue to accelerate growth in 2025.\nIn 2024, geopolitical polarization and conflict was the worst in decades. Supply chains continued to experience major disruptions. Cybersecurity attacks escalated becoming even more sophisticated. Enterprises remain challenged by how to leverage artificial intelligence while mitigating risk and more.\nExecutives across the enterprise are facing greater uncertainty than ever before, and the rate of change continues to accelerate. Leaders know they need help and they know Gartner is the best source for the insight, guidance and tools they need to succeed.\nWe help our clients make smarter decisions that address their mission-critical priorities while managing risk, saving time, saving money and building confidence. Gartner guides leaders across every size enterprise in all major geographies and in every major industry. This includes government. There is no organization that knows more about how to help governments than Gartner.\nWe support public sector leaders in 74 countries, including the 30 largest economies, except Russia. And of course, we know more than anybody in the world about how to leverage technology in the private sector. In the U.S., there's a focus on leveraging technology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of governance.\nWe'll apply our insights and best practices to help the U.S. achieve these objectives. One topic that continues to challenge leaders across the enterprise is how to harness AI innovation in their environment. In the world of artificial intelligence, the pace of innovation is almost impossible to keep up with.\nDuring our 2024 IT symposium conference series, Gartner analysts discussed ways leaders could successfully pivot from learning AI to scaling AI and pursuing what's next. We are helping tens of thousands of executives determine how best to leverage AI in their enterprises.\nResearch continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Within our Research segment, we serve executives and their teams through distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS new business grew 13%, with double-digit growth in both enterprise leaders and tech vendors. GTS contract value accelerated to 7% and contract value with tech vendor clients improved for the third consecutive quarter.\nGlobal Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, legal, sales and more. GBS contract value accelerated to 12% with strong new business growth of 15%. Gartner Conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience.\nConferences revenue grew 17% in the fourth quarter, and our plan and advanced bookings for 2025 are strong. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business.\nLabor-based consulting revenue grew 4%. Contract Optimization revenue was $50 million, which exceeded expectations. Three foundational elements of our long-term success are: first, an unrelenting focus on globally consistent execution of Gartner best practices; second, a company-wide commitment to continuous improvement and innovation; and third, our vibrant culture, which inspires associates to operate and win as a global team.\nIn closing, Gartner delivered financial results ahead of expectations. CV growth continued to accelerate. We have a powerful client value proposition and a vast addressable market opportunity. We will continue to create value for our shareholders by providing actionable objective insight, guidance and tools to our clients; prudently investing for future growth; and returning capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase program.\nWe expect to deliver modest margin expansion over time, and we'll continue to generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. All of this and more positions us to drive long-term double-digit revenue growth and sustain our track record of success far into the future.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.\n\nCraig W. Safian\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Gartner, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gene, and good morning. Fourth quarter contract value growth accelerated to almost 8%. Revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash were better than expected as we continue to execute well in a complex environment. Our financial performance for the full year 2024 included global contract value growth of 8%, consolidated revenue growth of 6%, EBITDA of $1.6 billion, diluted adjusted EPS of $14.09 and free cash flow of $1.4 billion.\nWe repurchased more than $735 million of stock through December and remain eager to repurchase shares opportunistically. We are introducing 2025 guidance, which we view as achievable with opportunity for upside.\nFourth quarter revenue was $1.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year as reported and FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 66%. EBITDA was $417 million, up 8% as reported and 9% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $5.45, up 79% versus Q4 2023. This includes a benefit in the quarter from our tax planning initiatives. And free cash flow was $311 million, a very strong finish to the year.\nWe ended the quarter with 21,044 associates, up 4% year-over-year. We have a great team across Gartner driven by a very compelling associate value proposition. Moving into 2025, we are in an excellent position from a talent and tenure perspective with a strong hiring plan for the coming year.\nResearch revenue in the fourth quarter grew 5% year-over-year, as reported, and 6% FX neutral. Subscription revenue grew 8% on an FX-neutral basis. Non-subscription revenue was in line with our expectations and guidance.\nFourth quarter research contribution margin was 74%, consistent with the prior year period. For the full year 2024, research revenue increased by 5% as reported and FX neutral. The gross contribution margin for the year was 74%. Contract Value, or CV, was $5.3 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 8% versus the prior year.\nQuarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $220 million. As we've discussed in the past, there is notable seasonality in this metric. For the fourth quarter, CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew 9%. CV from tech vendors accelerated for the third consecutive quarter.\nCV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, the majority of the industry sectors grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates led by the health care, manufacturing and public sectors. We had high single-digit growth across almost all of our enterprise size categories.\nThe small category, which has the largest tech vendor mix, grew mid-single digits. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries. Global Technology sales contract value was $4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 7% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $165 million from the third quarter.\nWallet retention for GTS was 102% for the quarter, reflecting net growth even before the addition of new clients. GTS new business increased 13% versus last year with double-digit growth with both enterprise leaders and tech vendors. GTS quota-bearing headcount increased 4% year-over-year, consistent with our plan. We added 138 net new sellers in the quarter, the largest sequential increase since Q4 of 2022. We are planning mid-single-digit QBH growth for GTS in 2025. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the earnings supplement.\nGlobal Business Sales contract value was $1.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 12% year-over-year. The majority of our GBS practices grew at double-digit rates. Growth was led by finance, sales and legal. GBS CV increased $55 million from the third quarter. While retention for GBS was 106% for the quarter, reflecting strong net growth with our existing clients, GBS new business was up 15% compared to last year. GBS quota-bearing headcount was up 9% versus the fourth quarter of 2023. We are planning double-digit QBH growth for GBS in 2025.\nAs with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. As we do each year at this time, we've provided quarterly historical contract value data updated to 2025 FX rates in the appendix of the earnings supplement. The dollar strengthened significantly during 2024 against our major currencies. This resulted in a larger-than-normal revaluation. As you build your 2025 models, please remember to use the updated data as the baseline for your forecasting.\nConferences revenue for the fourth quarter was $251 million, up 17% year-over-year. Contribution margin in the quarter was 48%, consistent with typical seasonality. We held 13 destination conferences in the quarter, all in person. For the full year 2024, we delivered revenue of $583 million, which was an increase of 15% on a reported and FX-neutral basis.\nFull year gross contribution margin was 48%. We made investments during the year for conference launches and the expansion of existing conferences. Fourth quarter consulting revenue of $153 million increased 19% compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. Consulting contribution margin was 35% in the fourth quarter.\nLabor-based revenue was $104 million, up 4% versus Q4 of last year as reported and on an FX-neutral basis. Backlog at December 31 was $192 million, increasing 17% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis on strength in multiyear contracts.\nWe delivered $50 million of contract optimization revenue in Q4. The quarter was very strong, with more and larger deals compared with last year. About $8 million were pulled forward from the first quarter of 2025. Our contract optimization revenue is highly variable.\nFull year consulting revenue was up 9% on a reported and FX-neutral basis. Gross contribution margin was 36% compared to 35% in 2023. Consolidated cost of services increased 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and 8% on an FX-neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher headcount to support our future growth.\nSG&A increased 10% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth, mostly in sales. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $417 million, an increase of 8% as reported and 9% on an FX-neutral basis.\nFourth quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance primarily reflected stronger-than-expected revenue performance. EBITDA for the full year was almost $1.6 billion, a 5% increase over 2023 on a reported basis and up 6% FX neutral.\nDepreciation in the quarter of $29 million was up 10% compared to 2023 and similar to Q3. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $11 million. This was an improvement of $8 million versus the fourth quarter of 2023 due to higher interest income on our cash balances.\nThe Q4 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was a benefit of 25% for the quarter as a result of favorable tax planning which took place during the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 32% in Q4. The full year tax rate for the calculation of adjusted net income was 10%, again, as a result of the favorable tax planning in the fourth quarter.\nAdjusted EPS in Q4 was $5.45, up 79% versus Q4 2023. If the adjusted tax rate had been 23%, adjusted EPS in the quarter would have been $3.37. We had 78 million shares outstanding in the fourth quarter. This is a reduction of about 1 million shares or about 1% year-over-year. We exited the fourth quarter with just under 78 million shares on an unweighted basis.\nFor the full year, adjusted EPS was $14.09, up 24% for 2023. If the adjusted tax rate had been 23%, adjusted EPS for the year would have been $11.99.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $335 million, up 50% compared to last year with a working capital timing benefit in the quarter. CapEx for Q4 was $24 million, about $4 million less than the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $311 million, up 59% compared to last year.\nFree cash flow for the full year was almost $1.4 billion, a 31% increase versus 2023. There were several items affecting net income and free cash flow during 2024, including after-tax insurance proceeds, a real estate lease termination payment and tax planning benefits. Adjusting for these items, free cash flow for 2024 was 18% of revenue, 74% of EBITDA and 140% of GAAP net income.\nOur free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had about $1.9 billion of cash. Our December 31 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A.\nOur balance sheet is very strong with $2.6 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased $102 million of stock during the fourth quarter and more than $735 million for the full year. At the end of December, we had more than $900 million of authorization for repurchases remaining, and we expect the Board will continue to refresh the repurchase authorization going forward.\nAs we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital.\nBefore providing the 2025 guidance details, I want to discuss our base level assumptions and planning philosophy for 2025. As you know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly. We expect FX will be around a 2 percentage point headwind to revenue and EBITDA growth for the full year. For research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects.\nThe outlook for 2025 research revenue growth is a function of 3 primary factors: first, 2024 ending contract value; second, the timing and slope of the continued CV acceleration; and third, the performance of nonsubscription revenue. Starting with research subscription revenue, which was 77% of 2024 consolidated revenue.\nOur guidance reflects CV continuing to accelerate during 2025. First quarter and first half NCVI are important inputs to calendar 2025 revenue growth. We have taken a prudent view of NCVI phasing because Q1 is a seasonally important quarter for renewals.\nWith the U.S. Federal Government, we ended 2024 with around $270 million of CV, which is 5% of the total. Our contracts are spread widely across agencies and departments. Around 85% of U.S. Federal CV is in GTS. Almost all the U.S. federal contracts are for 1 year with renewal spread across the year.\nWe offer a very compelling value proposition for our public sector clients. As Gene discussed, we help government function leaders address their mission-critical priorities. Potential government changes may affect our business in the short term. We will continue to provide great sales, service and research levels to our clients. This will position us to drive strong growth over time.\nThe nonsubscription part of the Research segment was about 5% of consolidated revenue in 2024. We built into the guidance a continuation of second half traffic trends. If the underlying fundamentals of this portion of the segment improve, we'll be able to increase the full year outlook.\nFor conferences, which was about 9% of 2024 revenue, we are basing our guidance on the 53 in-person destination conferences we have planned for 2025. We expect similar seasonality to what we saw in 2024 with Q4 the largest quarter, followed by Q2. We expect gross margins in the second quarter to be the highest of the year for the Conferences segment.\nWe have very good visibility into 2025 revenue with the majority of what we've guided already under contract. This is consistent with last year.\nFor Consulting, which was also about 9% of 2024 revenue, we have more visibility into the first half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. Contract optimization has had several very strong years. It's seasonally slower in the first quarter. We pulled forward about $8 million in Q4, and the business remains highly variable.\nWe've incorporated a prudent outlook for this part of the segment. Our base level assumptions for consolidated expenses reflect the run rate from the second half 2024 hiring and the growth hiring we have planned for 2025. Beyond the hiring factors, we recommend thinking about expenses sequentially with notable seasonality driven by the conferences calendar and annual merit increases.\nOur plan for mid- to high single-digit sales headcount growth for 2025 reflects our commitment to invest for future growth while delivering strong margins and free cash flow. For GTS, we expect mid-single-digit QBH growth again in 2025. We have the capacity we need for the tech vendor part of the business for now, and we're going to be thoughtful about our public sector hiring in the short term.\nFor GBS, we plan to grow QBH double digits this year. We have the recruiting capacity to go faster depending on how the year plays out. The most important way we invest for long-term sustained double-digit growth is by increasing our sales headcount. This is an essential part of our 2025 operating plan.\nOur guidance for 2025 is as follows: We expect Research revenue of at least $5.365 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 6%. The guidance reflects FX-neutral research subscription revenue growth near 8%, consistent with 2024 CV growth.\nWe expect Conferences revenue of at least $625 million, which is FX-neutral growth of about 10%. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $565 million, which is FX-neutral growth of about 2%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $6.555 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 6%. We expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.51 billion. On a reported basis, we expect an EBITDA margin of at least 23%.\nCompared with 2024 margins, this factors in FX, 2024 headcount additions, 2025 growth hiring and a prudent approach to the plan. We expect 2025 adjusted EPS of at least $11.45 per share. For 2025, we expect free cash flow of at least $1.14 billion. This reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of about 140%.\nOur guidance is based on 78 million shares, which only assumes repurchases to offset dilution. Finally, for the first quarter of 2025, we expect to deliver EBITDA of at least $345 million.\nWe performed well in 2024 despite continuing global macro uncertainty and a dynamic tech vendor market. We finished the year with high single-digit CV growth. Revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow performance exceeded our expectations and the guidance we set a year ago.\nWe repurchased about $735 million in stock during 2024 and more than $4 billion over the past 4 years. We remain eager to return excess capital to our shareholders. We will continue to be price sensitive, opportunistic and disciplined. Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged.\nWith 12% to 16% Research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing about in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we will expand EBITDA margins modestly over time.\nWe can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

In Q2, contract value grew high single digits. Financial results for the second quarter were ahead of expectations, and we delivered strong profitability and free cash flow.\nThe external environment remains volatile uncertain, complex and ambiguous.

Safian\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Gartner, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gene, and good morning. Second quarter contract value grew 7% year-over-year, accelerating about 50 basis points from Q1. We believe the first quarter marked the bottom for CV growth this cycle, barring a meaningful shift in the macro or geopolitical environment.\nGrowth may vary from quarter-to-quarter, but we expect the overall trend will be higher from the 6.9% we delivered in the first quarter. Over the medium term, we expect both GTS and GBS to grow 12% to 16%.\nSecond quarter revenue, EBITDA and EPS all came in ahead of our expectations. We are updating our guidance based on the Q2 results, FX and a change in nonsubscription research revenue. We have repurchased $565 million of stock through June and remain eager to buy back stock opportunistically.\nSecond quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, up 6% year-over-year as reported and 7% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68%, about in line with last year. EBITDA was $416 million, up 8% as reported and 10% FX neutral versus second quarter 2023.\nAdjusted EPS was $3.22, up 13% from Q2 of last year, and free cash flow was $341 million. Research revenue in the second quarter grew 5% year-over-year as reported and 6% on an FX-neutral basis. Subscription revenue grew 7% FX neutral. The year-over-year change in non-subscription revenue was similar to Q1 2024.\nSecond quarter research contribution margin was 74%, consistent with last year. Contract value was $4.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 7% versus the prior year and up about $67 million from the first quarter. CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew 10%.\nContract value and CV growth are FX neutral. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, the majority of industry sectors grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates led by the energy, manufacturing and public sectors. CV grew double-digit or high single-digit rates across all enterprise sizes, except small, which has the largest tech vendor mix.\nWe also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries. Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.8 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 6% versus the prior year. CTS enterprise leader CV increased high single digits. Tech vendor CV returned to growth in the quarter. GTS CV increased $40 million from the first quarter.\nWhile retention for GTS was 101% for the quarter, up from Q1, enterprise leader wallet retention was consistent with historical levels. GTS new business was up 8% compared to last year. GTS quota-bearing head count was down 2% year-over-year as we manage tech vendor-focused sales territories in response to near-term industry dynamics.\nAcross GTS, we continue to aggressively optimize our territories to align with where we have the best growth opportunities, and we are investing for future growth. We continue to expect mid-single-digit QBH growth by the end of the year. We have the headcount we need to meet commitments for this year. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement.\nGlobal Business Sales contract value was $1.1 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 12% year-over-year. All of our GBS practices grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates other than marketing, which grew mid-single digits. Growth was led by the finance, legal and supply chain practices.\nGBS CV increased $27 million from the first quarter. Wallet retention for GBS was 106% for the quarter, which compares to 109% in the prior year. GBS new business was up 16% compared to last year. GBS quota-bearing head count was up 6% year-over-year, and we continue to target high single-digit growth for 2024.\nAs with GTS, a regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the second quarter was $186 million, increasing 10% as reported and 11% FX neutral compared to Q2 of 2023. Adjusting for the movement of conferences across the year, revenue increased about 15% in the quarter.\nContribution margin was 58%. Q2 is our seasonally strongest margin quarter of the year. We held 16 destination conferences. Second quarter consulting revenue increased by 13% year-over-year to $143 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenue was up 15%. Consulting contribution margin was 38% in the second quarter.\nLabor-based revenue was $107 million, up 3% versus Q2 of last year's reported and 5% on an FX-neutral basis. Backlog at June 30 was $199 million, increasing 16% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with continued booking strength.\nIn Contract Optimization, we delivered $36 million of revenue in the quarter, up 62% versus the prior year. Our contract optimization business is highly variable. Consolidated cost of services increased 5% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and 6% on an FX-neutral basis.\nThe biggest driver of the increase was higher compensation costs. SG&A increased 5% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth, which contributed to higher compensation costs. EBITDA for the second quarter was $416 million, up 8% from last year's reported and up 10% FX neutral.\nWe have performed in the second quarter through effective expense management and a prudent approach to guidance. Depreciation in the quarter of $28 million was up 16% compared to 2023. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $19 million. This is favorable by $4 million versus second quarter of 2023 due to higher interest income on our cash balances.\nThe modest floating rate that we have is fully hedged through the third quarter of 2025. The Q2 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 24% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 25% for the quarter.\nAdjusted EPS in Q2 was $3.22, up 13% compared with last year. We had 78 million shares outstanding in the second quarter. This is a reduction of more than 1.5 million shares or about 2% year-over-year. We exited the second quarter with about 78 million shares on an unweighted basis.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $370 million compared with $436 million in Q2 of 2023. The change reflects working capital timing, which we expect to reverse in the second half. CapEx for the quarter was $29 million, in line with our expectations. Free cash flow for the quarter was $341 million. Free cash flow on a rolling 4-quarter basis was 17% of revenue and 66% of EBITDA. Free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income was 121%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating.\nAt the end of the second quarter, we had about $1.2 billion of cash. Our June 30 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $1.9 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates.\nWe repurchased $340 million of our stock during the second quarter. We have more than $1 billion of repurchase capacity after the Board recently increased our share buyback authorization by $600 million. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital.\nWe are updating our full year guidance to reflect recent performance and trends. The outlook for subscription research is higher based on the latest FX rates. We increased the outlook for conferences and consulting. And our EBITDA guidance primarily reflects Q2 upside, partially offset by our updated nonsubscription research outlook.\nFor subscription research, which was about 76% of revenue in 2023, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. The executive and their teams face uncertainty and challenges, and they recognize how Gartner can help regardless of the economic environment.\nFor subscription research revenue, based on Q2 results and our outlook for the balance of the year, our FX-neutral guidance is unchanged. We have very high visibility into the subscription research revenue at this point in the year. For nonsubscription research, which was about 6% of 2023 revenue, we help small businesses find the right software. We've updated our outlook for this portion of the segment given the most recent trends. We now expect non-subscription revenue of about $305 million for 2024.\nAs a reminder, about 1/3 of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Based on recent FX rates, we expect currency to be roughly neutral in the back half of the year with a modest benefit in Q4.\nOur updated 2024 guidance is as follows: we expect research revenue of at least $5.105 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 5%. This reflects subscription research revenue growth of about 7%. We expect conferences revenue of at least $565 million, which is FX-neutral growth of about 12%. We expect consulting revenue of at least $530 million, which is growth of about 4% FX neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $6.2 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 5%.\nWe now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.460 billion, up $5 million from our prior guidance. We expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $11.05. For 2024, we expect free cash flow of at least $1.08 billion, consistent with our prior guidance. This reflects the conversion from GAAP net income of 138%.\nAfter the second quarter ended, we reached the settlement related to pandemic or event cancellation insurance. We expect pretax proceeds of $300 million during the third quarter. This is not yet included in the cash flow or GAAP EPS guidance. Our guidance is based on 78 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of June.\nAnd finally, for the third quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA of at least $295 million. Our financial results through the first half have been ahead of our plan despite continuing global macro uncertainty. CV grew high single digits in the quarter, and we believe Q1 was the bottom for CV growth in this cycle. We repurchased $565 million in stock year-to-date through June and remain eager to return excess capital to our shareholders. We will continue to be price sensitive, opportunistic and disciplined.\nLooking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we've delivered double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing about in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we will deliver modest EBITDA margin expansion over time. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time, and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions.

Welcome to Gartner's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call, and David Cohen, SVP of Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] After comments by Gene Hall, Gartner's Chief Executive Officer; and Craig Safian, Gartner's Chief Financial Officer, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. .\nThis call will include a discussion of first quarter 2024 financial results and Gartner's outlook for 2024 as disclosed in today's earnings release and earnings supplement both posted to our website, investor.gartner.com.\nOn the call, unless stated otherwise, all references to EBITDA or for adjusted EBITDA, with the adjustments as described in our earnings release and supplement, while -- values and associated growth rates we discuss are based on 2024 foreign exchange rates, while growth rates in Gene's comments are FX neutral, unless stated otherwise. All references to share counts are for fully diluted weighted average share counts unless stated otherwise.\nReconciliations for all non-GAAP numbers we use are available in the Investor Relations section of the gartner.com website. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including those contained in the company's 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as in other filings with the SEC. I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.\nNow I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\n\nEugene A. Hall\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Gartner, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner remains resilient in a complex environment. In Q1, contract value grew high single digits. Natural results for the quarter were ahead of expectations. We delivered strong profitability and free cash flow and we increased our guidance for 2024 on an FX neutral basis.\nThe world continues to experience broad geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Higher interest rates and uncertain outlook continue to affect banks. Federal and local governments are struggling to shifting priorities. Inflation remains challenging for companies in many sectors such as health care. Supply chains continue to be strained. We continue to see big shifts in where people work, which is affecting the real estate sector. Cybersecurity continues to be a global and universal treat. And enterprise leaders are just beginning to understand how to leverage artificial intelligence in their organizations.\nEnterprise leaders and their teams know they need help. And they know Gartner is the best source for that help. We provide the insights, tools and advice to drive smart decisions and achieve stronger performance on their mission-critical priorities. Our insights often make the difference between success and failure for the leaders we work with and the enterprises they serve. Gartner guides the leaders who shape the world.\nResearch continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Our Research business serves enterprises across all major functions in every industry and every geography. Our market opportunity is vast. We deliver unparalleled value to our clients whether they're thriving, struggling or anywhere in between.\nIn Q1, our clients experienced more challenging macroeconomic conditions, which led to a tougher selling environment. Because of the incredible value we deliver, contract value in our enterprise functional leader business grew 10%. Our tech vendor clients continue to be affected by sizable layoffs as well as reductions and shifts in venture capital investments. In addition, we had higher than normal levels of tech vendor contracts up for renewal in Q1 as expected.\nWe guided clients through a wide range of challenging topics, including cybersecurity, supply chain optimization, data analytics, leader and manager development, managing emerging risks, cost optimization and more. Artificial intelligence was a topic with a high level of interest across every business function we serve. Gartner serves executives and their teams through distinct sales channels.\nGlobal Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS also serves leaders at technology vendors, including CEOs, Chief Marketing Officers and senior product leaders. GTS contract value grew 5%. GTS contract value with enterprise function leaders grew at high single digits.\nGlobal Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, legal, sales and more. GBS contract value grew 12%.\nGartner Conferences deliver valuable insights to a highly engaged audience. We had a great start to the year, including the launch of two new Conferences. The outlook for Conferences remain strong.\nGartner Consulting is the extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives, deeper project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 7%. Labor-based revenue was up 13%. We drove a strong performance in contract optimization against a tough compare.\nPeople are at the heart of our business. I just returned from our sales recognition events where I spent time with some of our top performers. Our sales teams are enthusiastic about our prospects for growth in 2024. They love Gartner's strategy, culture and ability to innovate. Gartner is a place where our associates build lifelong careers and sales and beyond.\nLooking ahead, we updated our guidance for the stronger dollar and increased revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow on a FX-neutral basis.\nIn closing, Gartner delivered financial results ahead of expectations and 10% contract value growth with enterprise function leaders. Gartner is well positioned for contract value growth to accelerate as we move through the year. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term sustained double-digit revenue growth.\nWe will continue to create value for our shareholders by providing actionable objective insight to our clients, prudently investing for future growth and returning capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. We expect margins will expand modestly over time, and we'll continue to generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. All of this and more positions us to continue our sustained record of success are into the future.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.\n\nCraig W. Safian\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Gartner, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gene, and good morning. First quarter financial results were better than planned with particular strength in profitability and free cash flow. We remain well positioned for the global CV growth rate to accelerate from the first or second quarter of this year. We are increasing our revenue, profit and free cash flow guidance on an operating basis and updating for the stronger U.S. dollar. We have a -- capacity for share repurchases and remain eager to buy back stock opportunistically.\nFirst quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, up 5% year-over-year as reported and FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69%, about in line with last year. EBITDA was $382 million, ahead of our guidance and up modestly from first quarter 2023. Adjusted EPS was $2.93, up 2% from Q1 of last year. And free cash flow was $166 million. .\nResearch revenue in the first quarter grew 4% year-over-year as reported and on an FX-neutral basis. Subscription revenue grew 6% FX-neutral. Non-subscription revenue was similar to Q4 2023 following changes we made during the fourth quarter, which we discussed in February. First quarter Research contribution margin was 74%, consistent with last year.\nContract value, or CV, was $4.9 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 7% versus the prior year and down about $10 million from the fourth quarter of 2023. The NCVI results reflect the higher-than-normal level of tech vendor contracts up for renewal, which we discussed in February. In addition, Q1 is our seasonally smallest quarter for new business.\nCV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew 10%. CV growth is FX neutral. CV growth outside of our tech vendor client base was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, the majority of industry sectors grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates led by the energy, manufacturing and public sectors. CV grew double-digit or high single-digit rates across all enterprise sizes except small, which was about flat and has the largest tech vendor mix. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries.\nGlobal Technology Sales contract value was $3.8 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 5% versus the prior year. GTS enterprise leader CV increased high single digits. Tech vendor CV was down slightly year-over-year. GTS CV was $22 million lower than the fourth quarter. Wallet retention for GTS was 101% for the quarter, which compares to 104% in the prior year. Enterprise leader wallet retention was consistent with historical levels. As expected, tech vendors were the key driver of the change year-over-year.\nGTS new business was 1% lower than last year even as enterprise leader new business increased year-over-year. GTS quota-bearing headcount was down 2% year-over-year. We continue to expect mid-single-digit QBH growth by the end of the year. The near-term hiring focus is in the enterprise leader portion of the business. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement.\nGlobal Business Sales contract value was $1.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 12% year-over-year. All of our GBS practices grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates other than sales, which grew mid-single digits. Growth was led by finance, legal and supply chain. GBS CV increased $12 million from the fourth quarter, while retention for GBS was 107% for the quarter, which compares to 110% in the prior year. GBS new business was up 7% compared to last year. GBS quota-bearing headcount was also up 7% year-over-year. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement.\nConferences revenue for the first quarter was $70 million, modestly ahead of our expectations during a seasonally small period. We had two successful launches in the quarter: Our CFO and Finance Executive Conference in Australia and our Data and Analytics Summit in Brazil. Contribution margin in the quarter was 33%, consistent with typical seasonality and reflecting investments for future growth. We held 12 destination conferences in the quarter.\nFirst quarter Consulting revenues increased by 6% year-over-year to $135 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 7%. Consulting contribution margin was 40% in the first quarter. Labor-based revenues were $109 million, up 12% versus Q1 of last year's reported and 13% on an FX-neutral basis. Backlog at March 31 was $188 million, increasing 17% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with continued booking strength.\nOur contract optimization business is highly variable. We delivered $26 million of revenue in the quarter against a tough prior year compare. Consolidated cost of services increased 6% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and 5% on an FX-neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher compensation costs.\nSG&A increased 5% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth and higher compensation costs. EBITDA for the first quarter was $382 million, up modestly from last year. First quarter strength compared to our guidance reflected modest revenue upside, effective expense management and a prudent approach to our initial guidance. Depreciation in the quarter of $26 million was up about 10% compared to 2023.\nNet interest expense, exclusive financing costs in the quarter was $18 million. This is favorable by $9 million versus the first quarter of 2023 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through the third quarter of 2025. The Q1 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income was 20% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 25% for the quarter.\nAdjusted EPS in Q1 was $2.93, up 2% compared with last year. We had 79 million shares outstanding in the first quarter. This is a reduction of close to 1 million shares or about 2% year-over-year. We exited the first quarter with about 79 million shares on an unweighted basis. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $189 million, up 15% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $23 million, up modestly year-over-year.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was $166 million. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue on a rolling 4-quarter basis was 18% of revenue and 72% of EBITDA. Free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income was 135%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating. At the end of the first quarter, we had about $1.2 billion of cash. Our March 31 debt balance was about $2.5 billion.\nDuring the quarter, we closed on a new 5-year, $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. Outstanding borrowings from the existing credit agreement were rolled over into the new unsecured revolver. The outdrawn remains fully hedged. Our capital structure is now 100% unsecured. Credit in April, we now have three investment grade ratings from Fitch, S&P and Moody's.\nOur reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A.\nOur balance sheet is very strong with $1.9 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased $225 million of our stock during the first quarter. We expect the Board will continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward. At the end of March, we had about $830 million authorized for repurchases. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital.\nWe are raising our full year guidance on an FX-neutral basis to reflect Q1 performance. The dollar has gotten stronger since we reported in February, which is also incorporated into the guidance.\nFor Research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. Executives and their teams face uncertainty and challenges, and they recognize how Gartner can help regardless of the economic environment. For Research revenue, based on Q1 results and our outlook for the balance of the year, our guidance on an FX-neutral basis is unchanged. The guidance also reflects the CV growth rate reaccelerating this year. New business strength and improvements in retention would lead to upside to our guidance.\nAnd Research subscription revenue growth will likely lag CV growth reacceleration by about a quarter or 2 on an FX-neutral basis. The nonsubscription revenue outlook continues to reflect the shift to higher-quality traffic sources we discussed last quarter. We saw pricing stabilizing over the past few months. An improvement in pricing would represent upside to the guidance.\nThe first quarter for Conferences is seasonally small. We continue to expect strong performance for the full year. We expect similar seasonality to what we saw in 2023 with Q4 the largest quarter, followed by Q2.\nFor Consulting, we continue to see demand on our labor-based services in areas like digital transformation and cost optimization. Contract optimization has had several very strong years and is highly variable. We've incorporated a prudent outlook for this part of the segment.\nFor consolidated expenses, we are investing for future growth even as we have taken a balanced view of the timing of revenue flowing into the P&L. We recommend thinking about expenses sequentially with notable seasonality driven by the conferences calendar and merit increases. As a reminder, about 1/3 of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. With the strengthening dollar, we now expect FX-neutral growth to be higher than reported growth by about 0.5 point for revenue and around a full point for EBITDA for the full year.\nOur updated 2024 guidance is as follows: We expect Research revenue of at least $5.115 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 5%. First quarter results were about in line with our expectations, we updated for the stronger dollar. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $560 million, which is FX-neutral growth of about 11%. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $525 million, which is growth of about 3% FX neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $6.2 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 5%.\nWe now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.455 billion, up $35 million from our prior guidance before the effect of a stronger dollar. We expect typical operating expense seasonality to continue through the rest of the year. We now expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $10.90. For 2024, we now expect free cash flow of at least $1.08 billion, up $15 million from our prior guidance. The higher free cash flow reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of 139%. Our guidance is based on 79 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of March. And finally, for the second quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA of at least $390 million.\nOur financial performance started the year ahead of our plan despite continuing global macro uncertainty and a dynamic tech vendor market. CV grew high single digits in the quarter, and we expect CV growth to reaccelerate from the first or second quarter of this year. Revenue and EBITDA performance exceeded our expectations. We increased our operating guidance and incorporated the stronger U.S. dollar into the outlook.\nFree cash flow was strong in the quarter, and we increased the guidance for the full year. We repurchased about $225 million in stock year-to-date through March and remain eager to return excess capital to our shareholders. We will continue to be price sensitive, opportunistic and disciplined.\nLooking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% Research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing about in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we will expand EBITDA margins modestly over time. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

Welcome to Gartner's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I'm David Collin, SVP of Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] After comments by Gene Hall, Gartner's Chief Executive Officer; and Craig Safian, Gartner's Chief Financial Officer, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nThis call will include a discussion of fourth quarter 2023 financial results and Gartner's outlook for 224 as disclosed in today's earnings release and earnings supplement, both posted to our website, investor.gartner.com. On the call, unless stated otherwise, all references to EBITDA are for adjusted EBITDA, with the adjustments as described in our earnings release and supplement. Our contract values and associated growth rates we discussed are based on 2023 foreign exchange rates and exclude contributions related to the first quarter divestiture and the 2022 Russia exit. All growth rates in Gene's comments are FX-neutral, unless stated otherwise. All references to share counts are for fully diluted weighted average share counts, unless stated otherwise.\nReconciliations for all non-GAAP numbers we use are available in the Investor Relations section of the gartner.com website. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as in other filings with the SEC. I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\n\nEugene A. Hall\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Gartner, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner drove another strong performance in the fourth quarter. We delivered high single-digit growth in contract value. Revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow came in above expectations.\nGartner delivers incredible client value in any macroeconomic environment. In 2023, the world experienced multiple disruptions. They impacted enterprises in dramatically different ways. For example, high interest rates affected capital-intensive industries and financial institutions such as regional banks. High inflation rates had an outsized effect on industries such as health care. Geopolitical polarization and conflict drove increases in military and defense spending, while affecting supply chains.\nMore shifts in how and where people work affected real estate live events and entertainment and other industries. Cybersecurity attacks became even more frequent, were getting stronger and more disruptive. And we saw a significant leap in the capabilities of artificial intelligence, or AI, which fueled even more complexity.\nWe serve leaders in every enterprise, and across every industry and every geography. They know they need help, and they know Gartner is the best source for the help they need. Gartner delivers actionable objective insight that drive smarter decisions and stronger performance on an organization's mission-critical priorities. We got the leaders who shape the world. Our insights also make the difference between success and failure, the leaders we work with and the enterprises they serve.\nAs we move into 2024, our ability to execute operational best practices consistently is the strongest it's ever been. We have the lowest proportion of open positions ever. Our recruiting capability and capacity are world-class. We have a strong associate value proposition, and our teams have higher tenure than in 2023, which will allow us to drive strong performance well into the future.\nResearch continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Our market opportunity is vast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. Our business remains resilient in a complex external environment. Through relentless execution of proven practices, we're able to deliver unparalleled value to our clients. In the fourth quarter, we help clients with a wide range of topics, including cybersecurity, data analytics, artificial intelligence, remote work, cost optimization and more.\nResearch revenue grew 5% in Q4. Subscription revenue represented more than 75% of our consolidated global revenue in 2023. We delivered subscription revenue growth of 8% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter. Total contract value growth was 8%. Across GTS and GBS, contract value from enterprise function leaders grew at double-digit rates. New business with enterprise function leaders also grew at double-digit rates.\nGartner serves executives and their teams through distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS also serves leaders at technology vendors, including CEOs, Chief Marketing Officers and senior product leaders. GTS contract value grew 6%, led by growth with IT and enterprise function leaders. GTS sales to leaders and technology vendors continue to be affected by technology sector dynamics. Exiting the year, we began to see some improvements. New business with tech vendors were at high single digits. We expect new business to lead retention and contract value growth.\nGlobal Business Sales, or GBS, source leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, legal, sales and more. GBS contract value grew 13%. GBS new business was up double digits. Gartner Conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. 2023 was the first full year of in-person conferences since 2019. We had a great year, and we drove a strong finish in the fourth quarter.\nIn Q4, we held some of our largest destination conferences, including IT Symposium in Orlando and Barcelona, and ReimagineHR in Orlando. These conferences were spectacular. Across all our destination conferences, attendance was up year-over-year, with many at or near capacity. Looking ahead to 2024, advanced bookings continue to be very strong and feedback continues to be excellent.\nGartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 8% for the full year. We saw growth in labor-based consulting and record results in contract optimization for the full year. We are introducing 2024 guidance, which we view as achievable across a wide range of economic and geopolitical scenarios with opportunity for upside.\nIn closing, Gartner achieved another strong quarter of growth. We deliver incredible client value, whether our clients are struggling, thriving or anywhere in between. We're exceptionally agile and continuously adapt to the changing world, and we know the right things to do to be successful in any environment. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to continue our sustained record success far into the future.\nOur client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term sustained double-digit revenue growth. We expect margins will expand modestly over time, and we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. As we invest for future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This reduces shares outstanding and increases returns over time.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.\n\nCraig W. Safian\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Gartner, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gene, and good morning. Fourth quarter revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow were better than expected as we continue to execute very well in a complex environment. Our financial performance for the full year 2023 included global contract value and consolidated revenue growth of 8%, EBITDA of $1.5 billion, diluted adjusted EPS of $11.33 and free cash flow of $1.1 billion. We are introducing 2024 guidance, which we view as achievable across a wide range of economic and geopolitical scenarios, with opportunity for upside.\nFourth quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, up 5% year-over-year as reported and 4% FX-neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 67%. EBITDA was $386 million, ahead of our guidance, primarily as a result of disciplined cost management. Adjusted EPS was $3.04 and free cash flow was $196 million. We finished the quarter with 20,237 associates, up 5% excluding the 2023 divestiture and about the same as Q3. We have a great team across Gartner, driven by a very compelling associate value proposition. Moving into 2024, we are in an excellent position from a talent and tenure perspective.\nResearch revenue in the fourth quarter grew 6% year-over-year as reported and 5% FX-neutral. Subscription revenue grew 8% on an organic FX-neutral basis. Non-subscription revenue performance in the quarter reflects a shift to higher quality traffic. While this action has a short-term effect on revenue, we expect it will drive higher prices and increase revenue over time. Fourth quarter research contribution margin was 74%, consistent with the prior year period as we have caught up on hiring and return to the new expected levels of travel.\nFor the full year 2023, research revenues increased by 6%, both as-reported and FX-neutral. The gross contribution margin for the year was 74%. Contract value or CV was $4.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 8% versus the prior year. CV growth is FX-neutral and excludes the first quarter 2023 divestiture.\nWe expect new business to be a leading indicator for retention and, in turn, contract value growth. We had the highest 1 month of new business dollars ever in December 2023. For the fourth quarter, CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew at double-digit rates. New business with enterprise function leaders increased double digits as well. CV from tech vendors about flat versus the prior year and up sequentially. Tech vendor CV continued the quarterly improvement we saw in Q3. Tech vendor new business was up high single digits in Q4, marking the first year-over-year increase in 2023.\nQuarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $180 million. As we've discussed in the past, there is notable seasonality in this metric. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, the majority of the industry sectors grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates led by the energy, manufacturing and public sectors. We had high single-digit growth across almost all of our enterprise size categories. The small category, which has the largest tech vendor mix, grew modestly. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries.\nGlobal Technology Sales contract value was $3.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 6% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $134 million from the third quarter. Wallet retention for GTS was 101% for the quarter, reflecting net growth even before the addition of new clients. In the fourth quarter, IT enterprise function leaders' wallet retention was consistent with historical GTS levels. GTS new business increased 12% versus last year. New business with IT enterprise function leaders increased mid-teens compared to 2022. New business with tech vendors increased high single digits in the quarter.\nGTS quota-bearing head count was about flat year-over-year. With the dynamic territory planning we introduced a few years ago, the catch-up hiring we did last year and our teams moving up 10-year curve, we're well positioned for growth moving into 2024. Operationally, we are continuously allocating resources to the best near-term opportunities even as we ensure we are well positioned to capture the large addressable market opportunity over time. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the earnings supplement.\nGlobal Business Sales contract value was $1.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 13% year-over-year. The majority of our GBS practices grew at double-digit rates. Growth was led by supply chain, legal and HR. GBS CV increased $46 million from the third quarter. Wallet retention for GBS was 107% for the quarter, reflecting strong net growth with our existing clients. GBS new business was up 13% compared to last year. GBS quota-bearing head count was up 8% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. This excludes headcount associated with the Q1 divestiture. As with GTS, a regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the earnings supplement.\nAs we do each year at this time, we've provided 2 years of quarterly historical contract value data updated to 2024 FX rates in the appendix of the earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the fourth quarter was $214 million, up 14% year-over-year. Contribution margin in the quarter was 50%, consistent with typical seasonality. We held 11 destination conferences in the quarter, all in-person.\nFor the full year 2023, we delivered an all-time high revenue of $505 million, which was an increase of 30% on a reported basis and 29% FX-neutral. Gross contribution margin was 50%. Fourth quarter consulting revenues were $128 million compared with $138 million in 2022 when we saw a record performance in the contract optimization business. Consulting contribution margin was 27% in the fourth quarter, affected by revenue mix and growth hiring.\nLabor-based revenues were $99 million, up 3% versus Q4 of last year as-reported and on an FX-neutral basis. Backlog at December 31 was $162 million, increasing 21% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with continued booking strength. We delivered $29 million of contract optimization revenue in the quarter. This part of our business is highly variable. For the second half of 2023, revenues were $62 million, up from the second half of 2022 when we delivered our largest-ever quarter in Q4.\nFull year consulting revenue was up 7% on a reported basis and 8% FX-neutral. Gross contribution margin was 35% compared to 39% in 2022. Consolidated cost of services increased 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and 10% on an FX-neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher headcount to support our future growth. SG&A increased 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and 8% FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth.\nEBITDA for the fourth quarter was $386 million compared to $421 million last year. Fourth quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance primarily reflected disciplined expense management. EBITDA for the full year was almost $1.5 billion, a 1% increase over 2022 on a reported basis and up 2% FX-neutral. Depreciation in the quarter of $26 million was up modestly compared to 2022. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $19 million. This was down $9 million versus the fourth quarter of 2022 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity.\nThe Q4 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 24% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust that income was 15% for the quarter. The full year tax rate for the calculation of adjusted net income was 22%. Adjusted EPS in Q4 was $3.04 compared with $3.70 last year. We had 79 million shares outstanding in the fourth quarter. This is a reduction of about 1 million shares or about 1% year-over-year. We exited the fourth quarter with about 79 million shares on an unweighted basis. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $11.33, up modestly from 2022.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $224 million, up 10% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $28 million, down $4 million, as a result of catch-up spend on technology investments in 2022 which normalize this year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $196 million, up 19% compared to last year. Free cash flow for the full year was almost $1.1 billion, a 6% increase versus $2.2 million. Free cash flow on a rolling 4-quarter basis was 18% of revenue and 71% of EBITDA. Adjusting for the Q1 divestiture, the full year free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income would have been 138%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating.\nWe have a new slide in the earnings supplement which shows the conversion from both EBITDA and GAAP net income to free cash flow on a rolling 4-quarter basis. The past 2 years have had some unusual items affecting the conversion, including insurance proceeds related to pandemic conference cancellations and the 2023 divestiture. We expect about a 4- to 6-point difference between EBITDA margin and free cash flow margins in a typical year. The normal free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income is 140% to 160%.\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, we had about $1.3 billion of cash. Our December 31 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $2.3 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates.\nWe repurchased $158 million of stock during the fourth quarter and more than $600 million for the full year. At the end of December, we had about $1 billion of authorization for repurchases remaining, and we expect the Board will continue to refresh the repurchase authorization going forward. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and, combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital.\nBefore providing the 2024 guidance details, I want to discuss our base level assumptions and planning philosophy for 2024. For Research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. The executives and their teams face uncertainty and challenges, and they recognize how Gartner can help regardless of the economic environment. The outlook for 2024 Research revenue [ growth ] is a function of 3 primary factors: first, 2023 ending contract value; second, the timing of growth bottoming and the slope of the reacceleration; and third, the performance of nonsubscription revenue.\nStarting with the research subscription revenue, which was 76% of 2023 consolidated revenue. Our guidance reflects CV bottoming and reaccelerating during 2024. First quarter and first half NCVI are important inputs to calendar 2024 revenue growth. We have taken a prudent view of NCVI phasing because Q1 is a seasonally important quarter for tech vendor renewals. With the majority of our contracts being multiyear, some haven't come up for renewal during the tech sector's recalibration. And research subscription revenue will likely bottom about 1 quarter after the contract value growth bottoms.\nIf new business continues to perform well and retention is better than we've incorporated into the plan, there would be upside to our guidance. The nonsubscription revenue was about 6% of consolidated revenue in 2023. In this part of the business, we help small business buyers find the best software for their needs and help sellers find customers. This adds a lot of tangible value for both groups. The outlook built into the 2024 guidance reflects a shift to higher-quality traffic sources. As I mentioned, this affects revenue in the shorter term, but we expect it to drive higher prices and increased revenue over time.\nFor Conferences, which is about 9% of 2023 revenue, we are basing our guidance on the 51 in-person destination conferences we have planned for 2024. We expect similar seasonality to what we saw in 2023, with Q4 the largest quarter followed by Q2. We have very good visibility into 2024 revenue, with the majority of what we've guided already under contract. This is consistent with last year and ahead of historical levels.\nFor consulting, which was also about 9% of 2023 revenue, we have more visibility into the first half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. Contract optimization has had several very strong years. It's also seasonally slower in the first quarter and remains highly variable. We've incorporated a prudent outlook for this part of the segment. We remain focused on aligning expense growth with CV growth. This is the best way for us to balance short-term margins while investing for long-term sustained double-digit growth.\nOur base level assumptions for consolidated expenses reflect a more typical cadence than we've seen in a while. We are investing for future growth even as we have taken a prudent view of the timing of revenue flowing into the P&L. We recommend thinking about expenses sequentially, with notable seasonality driven by the campus calendar and merit increases.\nOur plan for mid- to high single-digit sales headcount growth for 2024 reflects our commitment to invest for future growth while delivering on our margin targets. We have the recruiting capacity to go faster depending on how the year plays out, and we have other levers like increased tenure to support CV growth in 2024. At current rates, FX will be approximately neutral to growth for the full year.\nOur guidance for 2024 is as follows. We expect research revenue of at least $5.15 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 5%. The Research revenue guidance reflects a prudent plan for NCVI performance and the recalibration of nonsubscription part of the business. The guidance reflects subscription revenue growth in the high single digits. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $560 million, which is FX-neutral growth of about 10%. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $530 million, which is growth of about 3% FX-neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $6.24 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 5%.\nWe expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.435 billion, which results in an EBITDA margin of at least 23%. We expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $10.55 per share. For 2024, we expect free cash flow of at least $1.065 billion. This reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of above 140%. Our guidance is based on 79 million shares, which only assumes repurchases to offset dilution. Finally, for the first quarter of 2024, we expect to deliver EBITDA of at least $335 million.\nWe performed well this year despite continuing global macro uncertainty and a dynamic tech vendor market. Global CV grew high single digits in the quarter, with enterprise function leaders CV growing double digits. Revenue, EBITDA and EPS performance exceeded our expectations, and we introduced achievable guidance with opportunity for upside. We repurchased more than $600 million in stock during 2023 and more than $3 billion in the past 3 years. We remain eager to return excess capital to our shareholders. We will continue to be price sensitive, opportunistic and disciplined.\nLooking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing about in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we will expand EBITDA margins modestly over time. We can grow cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which lower the share count over time and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions.

Hall\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Gartner, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner drove another strong performance in Q3. We delivered high single-digit growth in contract value. Revenue, EBITDA and adjusted EPS came in above expectations. Free cash flow in the quarter was excellent. The external environment remains volatile and uncertain. The tech sector is still adjusting to post-pandemic demand. The banking industry continues to grapple with rising interest rates. Supply chain challenges are still in many industries. There's heightened in geopolitical volatility more. Leaders know they need help, and they know Gartner is the best source for that help. .\nGartner delivers actionable, objective insight to drive smarter decisions and stronger performance on our clients' mission-critical priorities. Whether they're thriving, struggling or anywhere in between, our insights, tools and advice offering the different success and failure for leaders and the enterprises they serve. We continue to be agile and adapted to the changing environment. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. We got leaders across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our market opportunity is vast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. We estimate our opportunity at around $200 billion.\nIn the third quarter, we continue to help clients with a wide range of topics such as cybersecurity, data analytics, artificial intelligence, remote work, cost optimization and more. In the third quarter, research revenue grew 5%. Subscription revenue grew 8% on an organic basis. Total contract value growth was 8%. Contract value for enterprise function leaders continue to grow at double-digit rates. We serve executives and their teams through distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, source leaders and their teams within IT. GTS also serves leaders at technology vendors, including CEOs and Chief Mortgaging officers and senior product leaders. GTS contract value grew 7%. GTS sales to enterprise function leaders performed well in the quarter. GTS sales to leaders and technology vendors were affected by technology sector dynamics and tough year-over-year comparisons.\nWe expect sales to technology vendors will return to normal growth rates over the next 12 to 18 months. Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value grew 14%. Through a relentless execution of proven practices, we're able to deliver unparalleled value to our clients. Our business remains resilient despite a persistent, complicated, external environment and top compares for the technology vendor market.\nGartner Conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. This will be the first full year of in-person conferences since 2019. We're having a great year. In-person attendance and advanced bookings are at record levels. The fourth quarter is off to a great start, and our outlook for the gain is strong. IT Symposium Expo is our flagship conference in series. I recently attended this conference in Orlando. Attendance was strong. Our sales teams were highly engaged with clients and prospects, and feedback from the conference continues to be excellent.\nFurther Consulting is intron of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through a deeper extended project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 23% of the quarter, with active results and contract optimization. Given the strong performance across business, we've increased our 2023 guidance for revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Craig will take you to the details. We're well positioned to grow close to the year and get off to a fast start in 2024.\nClosing, Gartner achieved another strong growth.

We expect margins will expand modestly over time. and we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. Even as we invest for future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This reduces shares outstanding and increases returns over time.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.\n\nCraig W. Safian\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Gartner, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gene, and good morning. Third quarter results were strong with high single-digit growth in contract value. Revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow were better than expected with outstanding performance in consulting and disciplined cost management. With strong results in the quarter and good visibility into Q4, we are increasing our 2023 guidance. Third quarter revenue was $1.4 billion, up 6% year-over-year as reported and 5% FX neutral. .\nIn addition, total contribution margin was 68% compared to 69% in the prior year as the 2022 hiring catch-up continued to flow through the P&L as expected. EBITDA was $333 million, ahead of our guidance and about in line with last year. Adjusted EPS was $2.56, up 6% from Q3 of last year. and free cash flow was $302 million. We finished the quarter with 20,253 associates, up 6% from the prior year and 1% from the end of the second quarter. We remain well positioned from a talent perspective as our associates continue to move up the 10-year curve.\nResearch revenue in the third quarter grew 6% year-over-year as reported and 5% on an FX-neutral basis. Subscription revenue grew 8% on an organic FX-neutral basis. Non-subscription revenue performance was similar to Q2. Third quarter research contribution was 73% compared to 74% in the prior year period as we have caught up on hiring and return to the new expected levels of travel.\nContract value or CV was $4.7 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 8% versus the prior year. The third quarter last year was a very strong research quarter with outstanding performance across most key metrics. CV growth is FX neutral and excludes the first quarter 2023 divestiture, CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew at double-digit rates. New business with enterprise function leaders increased double digits as well. CV from tech vendors grew low single digits compared to mid-teens growth in the third quarter of 2022.\nQuarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $101 million. As we've discussed in the past, there is notable seasonality in this metric. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, the majority of the industry sectors grew at double-digit rates, led by the transportation, services and public sectors. We had high single-digit growth across all of our enterprise size categories other than the small category, which has the largest tech vendor mix and grew low single digits. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries.\nGlobal Technology Sales contract value was $3.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 7% versus the prior year. GTS CV $65 million from the second quarter. While retention for GTS was 102% for the quarter, which compares to 107% in the prior year when we saw a near record high for this metric. IT enterprise function leaders wallet retention remained above historical GTS levels during the third quarter. GTS business was up 7% versus last year. New business with IT enterprise function leaders increased mid-teens compared to the prior year. GTS quota-bearing head count was up 5% year-over-year. With the dynamic territory planning we introduced a few years ago, that's a hiring we did last year and our teams moving up the tenure curve, we're well positioned for growth moving into 2024.\nOur regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Global Business Sales contract value was $1 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 14% year-over-year. All of our GBS practices grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates other than sales, which grew mid-single digits. Growth was again led by supply chain and HR. GBS CV increased $36 million from the second quarter, while retention for GBS was 108% for the quarter, which compares to 114% in the prior year when we saw one of the highest ever results for this metric. GBS new business was up 10% compared to last year. GBS quota-bearing head count was up 10% year-over-year. This excludes head count associated with the Q1 divestiture. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement.\nConferences revenue for the third quarter was $57 million, ahead of our expectations during a seasonally small period. We delivered strong growth for the conferences we held in Q3 compared to the same conferences in 2022. The calendar shifted significantly from 2022 to 2023 with the return to in-person. Contribution margin in the quarter was 36%, consistent with typical seasonality and reflecting investments for future growth. We held 9 destination conferences in the quarter, all in-person.\nThird quarter consulting revenues increased by 24% year-over-year to $133 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 23%, and Consulting contribution margin was 37% in the third quarter. Labor-based revenues were $100 million, up 10% versus Q3 of last year as reported and on an FX-neutral basis. Backlog at June 30 was $180 million, increasing 15% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with continued booking strength. Our Contract Optimization business is highly variable. We delivered $33 million of revenue in the quarter with some of the revenue pulled forward from the fourth quarter relative to our prior outlook.\nConsolidated cost of services is 8% year-over-year in the third quarter as reported and 7% on an FX-neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher head count to support our future growth. SG&A increased 8% year-over-year in the third quarter as reported and 7% on an FX neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of head count growth. EBITDA for the third quarter was $333 million, about in line with last year. Third quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance primarily reflected revenue exceeding our expectations in consulting and prudent expense management.\nDepreciation in the quarter of $25 million was up modestly compared to 2022. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $21 million. This was down $8 million versus the third quarter of 2022 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity. The Q3 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income was 22% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 35% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q3 was $2.56, up 6% compared with last year. We had 80 million shares outstanding in the third quarter. This is a reduction of close to 1 million shares or about 1% year-over-year. We exited the third quarter with about 79 million shares on an unweighted basis.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $331 million, up 5% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $28 million, down 11% year-over-year as a result of catch-up spend on technology investments in 2022, which normalize this year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $302 million. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue on a rolling 4-quarter basis was 18% of revenue and 67% of EBITDA, adjusted for the after-tax impact of the Q1 divestiture, free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income was 122%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating.\nAt the end of the third quarter, we had about $1.2 billion of cash. Our September 30 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provides ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy, our share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A.\nOur balance sheet is very strong with $2.2 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased $209 million of stock during the third quarter and about $100 million in October. The Board increased authorization by $500 million earlier this week, and we expect they will continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward.\nAt the end of October, following the increased authorization, we had about $1 billion available for repurchases. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital. We are raising our full year guidance to reflect the better-than-expected Q3 performance and good visibility into the fourth quarter.\nFor research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. Subscription research growth will reflect recent trends in contract value. We continue to expect stronger growth in the subscription business than the nonsubscription part of the segment, consistent with the third quarter.\nFor conferences, we still expect Q4 to be the largest quarter of the year. For consulting revenues, the labor business continues to perform well. We have very tough contract optimization compares in Q4 and pulled some revenue into Q3 relative to our prior expectations. We will continue both to manage expenses prudently to support future growth and deliver strong margins.\nOur updated 2023 guidance is as follows: we expect research revenue of at least $4.875 billion which is FX neutral growth of about 6% or 7% excluding the Q1 divestiture. The update to the research revenue guidance reflects better-than-planned NCVI performance in Q3 with continued stability in the nonsubscription part of the business, there is modest incremental upside relative to the expectations we built into the guidance last quarter. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $500 million, which is FX-neutral growth of about 27%. We have increased our outlook for conferences by $10 million to reflect a good start to the fourth quarter. We expect consulting revenue of at least $550 million, which is growth of about 8% FX-neutral, reflecting the very strong performance in Q3 and timing in the Contract Optimization business. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.89 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 8%. We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.44 billion, up $80 million from our prior guidance. With the strong performance in Q3, we have increased confidence in the margin forecast for the fourth quarter. We expect typical operating expense seasonality from Q3 to Q4. We now expect 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $10.90 per share.\nFor 2023, we now expect free cash flow of at least $1.025 billion, up $50 million from our prior guidance. Higher free cash flow reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of 136%, excluding the after-tax divestiture proceeds. Our guidance is based on 80 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of October. We are performing well this year despite continuing global macro uncertainty and a dynamic tech vendor market.\nCV grew high single digits in the quarter. Revenue and EBITDA performance exceeded our expectations, and we increased our guidance. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter, and we increased the guidance for the full year. We repurchased about $550 million of stock year-to-date through October and remain eager to return excess capital to our shareholders. We will continue to be disciplined, opportunistic and price sensitive.\nLooking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing about in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we will expand EBITDA margins modestly over time. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients pay us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

On call, unless stated otherwise, all references to EBITDA are for adjusted EBITDA, with the adjustments as described in our earnings release and supplement.

Forward-looking statements comparing materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, as well as other filings with the SEC. Encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.\nNow I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\n\nEugene A. Hall\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Gartner, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner drove another strong performance in Q2. We delivered double-digit revenue growth and high single-digit growth in contract value. EBITDA, EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS came in above expectations as a result of modest revenue upside and disciplined cost management. Free cash flow in the quarter was excellent.\nThe environment remains highly uncertain. The tech sector continues to adjust to post-pandemic demand. The banking industry is grappling with rising interest rates. Many industries continue to be impacted by supply chain challenges and more. Enterprise leaders and their teams need actionable, objective insight. Gartner is the best source for the insight, tools and advice that make the difference between success and failure for these leaders and the enterprises they serve. We're helping our clients make better decisions, whether they're thriving, struggling or anywhere in between. We do this through consistent execution of operational best practices.\nResearch continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. We guide leaders across all major enterprise functions. Our market opportunity is fast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. We estimate our opportunity at around $200 billion. 95% of our addressable market is with enterprise function leaders, like chief information officers, CFOs, heads of supply chain and more. The balance of the market opportunity is with technology vendors.\nIn the second quarter, we helped clients with a wide range of topics, including cybersecurity, data analytics, artificial intelligence, remote work, cost optimization and more. Research revenue grew 7% in Q2. Subscription revenue grew 9% on an organic basis. Total contract value growth was 9%. Contract value for enterprise function leaders continue to grow at double-digit rates.\nWe serve executives and our teams through distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS also serves leaders at technology vendors, including CEOs, chief marketing officers and senior product leaders. GTS contract value grew 7%. GTS sales to enterprise function leaders performed well in the quarter. GTS sales to leaders and technology vendors were affected by technology sector dynamics and tough year-over-year comparisons. We expect sales to technology vendors will return to our target growth rates over the medium term.\nGlobal Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value grew 15%. Through relentless execution of proven practices, we're able to deliver unparalleled value to our clients. Our business remains resilient despite a persistent complicated external environment and tough compares for the technology vendor market.\nGartner Conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. This will be the first full year of in-person conferences since 2019, and we're off to a great start. Attendance is strong, exhibitor bookings are at record levels and feedback continues to be excellent. We had a great first half and the outlook for the year is strong. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper extended project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 6% in the second quarter.\nWe updated our 2023 guidance, increase in EBITDA and free cash flow. We've revised our nonsubscription research revenue to reflect technology vendor dynamics, and our outlook for conferences is higher. Craig will take you through the details.\nIn closing, Gartner achieved another strong quarter of growth. We deliver unparalleled value to enterprise leaders and their teams across every major function, whether they're thriving, struggling or anywhere in between. We're exceptionally agile and continuously adapt to the changing world. We know the right things to do to be successful in any environment.\nLooking ahead, we are well positioned to continue our sustained record of success far into the future. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term, sustained double-digit revenue growth. We expect margins will expand modestly over time. We generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. Even as we invest for future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This reduces shares outstanding and increases returns over time.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.\n\nCraig W. Safian\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Gartner, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gene, and good morning. Second quarter results were strong with high single-digit growth in contract value and double-digit FX-neutral revenue growth. EBITDA, EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS were better than expected as a result of modest revenue upside and disciplined cost management. Free cash flow in the quarter was excellent. With good visibility into the balance of the year, we are increasing our 2023 EBITDA and free cash flow guidance.\nSecond quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, up 9% year-over-year as reported and 10% FX-neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68% compared to 69% in the prior year as we caught up on hiring during 2022. EBITDA was $384 million, ahead of our guidance and about in line with last year. Adjusted EPS was $2.85 consistent with Q2 of last year. And free cash flow was $410 million.\nWe finished the quarter with 20,104 associates, up 12% from the prior year and 1% from the end of the first quarter. We remain well positioned from a talent perspective with low levels of open territories and our new associates coming up the 10-year curve. We will continue to carefully calibrate headcount and operating expenses based on near-term revenue growth and opportunities to invest for the future.\nResearch revenue in the second quarter grew 6% year-over-year as reported and 7% on an FX-neutral basis. Subscription revenue grew 9% on an organic FX-neutral basis. Second quarter Research contribution margin was 73% compared to 74% in the prior year period as we have caught up on hiring and returned to the new expected levels of travel. Contract value, or CV, was $4.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 9% versus the prior year.\nThe second quarter last year was one of our strongest Research quarters ever, with outstanding performance on nearly every metric we provide. GP growth is FX-neutral and excludes the first quarter 2023 divestiture. CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew at double-digit rates. CV from tech vendors grew low single digits, compared to mid-teens growth in the second quarter of 2022. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $41 million. As we've discussed in the past, there is notable seasonality in this metric.\nCV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, the majority of industry sectors grew at double-digit rates, again, led by the transportation, retail and public sectors. We had high single-digit growth across all of our enterprise-sized categories other than the small category, which grew mid-single digits. This category has the largest tech vendor mix. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries.\nGlobal Technology Sales contract value was $3.5 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 7% versus the prior year. GTS had quarterly NCVI of $14 million. While retention for GTS was 102% for the quarter, which compares to 107% in the prior year when we saw a record high for this metric. IT enterprise function leaders wallet retention remained above historical GTS levels during the second quarter. GTS new business was down 4% versus last year. New business with IT Enterprise function leaders increased high single digits compared to the prior year against the tough compare.\nGTS quota-bearing headcount was up 13% year-over-year, reflecting the catch-up hiring we did in 2022. We will continue to manage hiring based on both short-term performance and the medium-term opportunity. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement.\nGlobal Business Sales contract value was $1 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 15% year-over-year, which remains towards the higher end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. All of our GBS practices grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates, again, led by supply chain and HR. GBS CV increased $27 million from the first quarter. While retention for GBS was 109% for the quarter, which compares to 115% in the prior year when we saw one of the highest ever results for this metric. GBS new business was up 2% compared to last year against a strong compare.\nGBS quota-bearing headcount was up 15% year-over-year. This excludes headcount associated with the Q1 divestiture. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement.\nConferences revenue for the second quarter was $169 million, ahead of our expectations as we saw strong performance with both exhibitors and attendees. Contribution margin in the quarter was 58%, consistent with typical seasonality. We held 17 destination conferences in the quarter, all in person. Second quarter Consulting revenues increased by 5% year-over-year to $126 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 6%. Consulting contribution margin was 37% in the second quarter.\nLabor-based revenues were $104 million, up 9% versus Q2 of last year and up 11% on an FX-neutral basis. Backlog at June 30 was $172 million, increasing 17% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with continued booking strength. Our Contract Optimization business is highly variable. We delivered $22 million of revenue in the quarter and the pipeline for both contract optimization and labor-based revenues remained strong.\nConsolidated cost of services increased 15% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and on an FX-neutral basis. The gist driver of the increase was higher headcount to support our continued strong growth. We also saw an increase in cost year-over-year with a return to in-person conferences. SG&A increased 12% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and 14% on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth.\nEBITDA for the second quarter was $384 million compared to $389 million in the year ago period. Second quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance reflected revenue exceeding our expectations in Conferences and prudent expense management. Depreciation in the quarter of $24 million was up modestly compared to 2022. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $23 million. This was down $5 million versus the second quarter of 2022 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity.\nThe Q2 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 25% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 27% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q2 was $2.85, in line with last year. We had 80 million shares outstanding in the second quarter. This is a reduction of close to 1 million shares or about 1% year-over-year. We exited the second quarter with about 80 million shares on an unweighted basis.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $436 million, up 5% compared to last year. FX for the quarter was $26 million, up 21% year-over-year as a result of an increase in technology investments. Free cash flow for the quarter was $410 million. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue on a rolling 4-quarter basis was 17% of revenue and 66% of EBITDA. Adjusted for the after-tax impact of the Q1 divestiture, free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income was 119%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating.\nAt the end of the second quarter, we had about $1.2 billion of cash. Our June 30 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provides ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $2.2 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates.\nWe repurchased $132 million of stock during the second quarter. We had about $830 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization at June 30. We expect the Board to continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share, and combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time.\nWe are increasing our full year conferences, EBITDA and free cash flow guidance to reflect the strong Q2 performance. We are updating our Research revenue guidance to reflect tech vendor market dynamics on the nonsubscription part of the business. For Research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. We've got tough compares across most of the segment for another quarter. We expect stronger growth from subscription business than the nonsubscription part of the segment, as we indicated last quarter. The nonsubscription part of the business has direct exposure to tech vendor spending.\nThe outlook continues to be based on all of our 47 destination conferences for 2023 running in person. There is seasonality to the business based on the conferences calendar, which is different than the historical pattern. We still expect Q4 to be the largest quarter of the year. We expect Q3 will be the smallest revenue quarter of the year, as I noted in May. For Consulting revenues, contract optimization remains highly valuable. We had a very strong year in 2022, especially in contract optimization in the fourth quarter. We will continue both to manage expenses prudently to support future growth and deliver strong margins.\nOur updated 2023 guidance is as follows. We expect research revenue of at least $4.855 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 6% or 7% excluding the Q1 divestiture. The update to Research revenue guidance reflects the effect of tech vendor market dynamics on the nonsubscription part of the business. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $490 million, which is growth of about 26%. We have increased our outlook for Conferences by $20 million. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $505 million, which is growth of about 5% effect neutral, consistent with the outlook we gave in May.\nThe result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.85 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 7%. The guidance reflects an update to nonsubscription research revenue, partially offset by an increase to Conferences. We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.36 billion, up $30 million from our prior guidance and an increase in our margin outlook as well. We will deliver on our margin guidance in most economic scenarios. If revenue is stronger than our outlook, EBITDA would be better than our guidance.\nWe now expect 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $10. For 2023, we now expect free cash flow of at least $975 million, up $55 million from our prior guidance. This higher free cash flow reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of about 140%, excluding the after-tax divestiture proceeds. Our guidance is based on 80 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of June. Finally, for the third quarter of 2023, we expect EBITDA of at least $275 million.\nWe had a strong first half despite continuing global macro uncertainty and a dynamic tech vendor market. CV and revenue grew high single digits in the quarter. Conferences and EBITDA performance exceeded our expectations, and we increased our guidance as well. Margins are strong, consistent with our prior commentary. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter, and we increased the guidance for the full year. We repurchased over $230 million in stock during the first half and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. And we have ample liquidity that we are ready to deploy on behalf of shareholders over the coming quarters.\nLooking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% Research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV growth over time and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic, value-enhancing tuck-in M&A.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

Hall\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Gartner, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner drove strong performance in the first quarter with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and EPS.\nThe rate of change and uncertainty in the world continues to accelerate. The tech sector is adjusting to post-pandemic demand. The banking industry is grappling with rising interest rates. Many industries have been impacted by rising inflation and more. Enterprise leaders and their teams [ give ] actionable objective guidance. Gartner is the best source for the insights, tools and advice that makes the difference between success and failure for these leaders and enterprises they serve.\nWe continue to be agile with the changing times.

Research continues to be our largest and the most profitable segment. We guide leaders across all major enterprise functions. Our market opportunity is vast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. And we're delivering more value than ever.\nIn the first quarter, we helped clients in a range of traffic, including cybersecurity, data analytics, artificial intelligence, remote work, cost optimization and more. Research revenue grew 9%. Total contract value growth was 10%. Contract value growth was affected by slower than average growth with our technology vendor clients. This also affected the nonsubscription portion of our research business. End user contract value for both GTS and GBS continue to grow at strong double-digit rates.\nWe serve executives and their teams through two distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS also serves leaders and technology vendors, including CEOs and product managers. GTS contract value grew 9%.\nGlobal Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more.

Our business remains resilient despite a volatile and complicated external environment. Gartner Conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to engaged and qualified audience.

Consulting revenue grew 14% in the first quarter.\nOur business is fueled by our highly talented associates. We have carefully aligned our hiring with recent demand and our long-term opportunity. We are well positioned to drive long-term, sustained double-digit growth.\nWe finished Q1 ahead of our expectations despite volatility in the global environment. We're increasing our outlook for 2023, while still allowing for a higher-than-normal level of uncertainty in the world. Craig will take you through our guidance in more detail.\nIn closing, Gartner achieved another strong quarter of growth. We deliver unparalleled value to enterprise leaders and their teams across every major function whether they're thriving, struggling or anywhere in between. We're exceptionally agile and continuously adapt to the changing world, and we know the right things to do to be successful in any environment.\nLooking ahead, we are well positioned to continue our sustained record of success far into the future. We expect margins to increase modestly over time. And we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. Even as we invest for future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders, which reduces shares outstanding and increases returns over time.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.\n\nCraig W. Safian\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Gartner, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gene, and good morning. First quarter results were strong with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and adjusted EPS. FX-neutral growth was even stronger than our reported results. We also again delivered better-than-planned EBITDA margins. The upside reflected stronger Conferences and Consulting revenue and disciplined cost management. With results ahead of our expectations, we are increasing our 2023 guidance.\nFirst quarter revenue was $1.4 billion, up 12% year-over-year as reported and 14% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69%, down 103 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $379 million, up 15% year-over-year and up 19% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.88, up 24%. And free cash flow in the quarter was $144 million. We finished the quarter with 19,830 associates, up 15% from the prior year and 2% from the end of the fourth quarter. We are well positioned from a talent perspective with low levels of open territories and our new associates coming up the 10-year curve. And we will continue to carefully calibrate headcount and operating expenses based on near-term revenue growth and opportunities to invest for the future.\nResearch revenue in the first quarter grew 7% year-over-year as reported and 9% on an FX-neutral basis. Subscription revenue grew 11%, FX neutral. First quarter research contribution margin was 74%, down about 1 point as we have caught up on hiring and return to the new expected levels of travel.\nContract value or CV was $4.5 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 10% versus the prior year. The first quarter last year was one of our strongest research quarters ever with outstanding performance on nearly every metric we provide. CV growth is FX neutral and excludes both Russia and the recent divestiture. CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew at double-digit rates. CV from tech vendors grew mid-single digits compared to high teens growth in the first quarter of 2022. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $26 million.\nAs we've discussed in the past, there is notable seasonality in this metric. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, all industry sectors grew at double-digit rates other than technology and media, which both grew at mid-single-digit rates. The fastest growth was in the transportation, retail and public sectors. We had high single-digit growth across all of our enterprise size categories. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in all of our top 10 countries.\nGlobal Technology Sales contract value was $3.5 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 9% versus the prior year. GTS had quarterly NCVI of $10 million. While retention for GTS was 104% for the quarter, which compares to 107% in the prior year when we saw a record high for this metric. While tech vendor wallet retention remained under pressure, on a net basis, our clients spend more with us compared to the prior year. GTS new business was down 1% versus last year. New business of IT function leaders increased compared to the prior year against the tough compare. New business with tech vendors declined versus very strong performance last year.\nGTS quota-bearing headcount was up 22% year-over-year and 11% on a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis. We will continue to manage hiring based on both short-term performance and the medium-term opportunity. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement.\nGlobal Business Sales contract value was $983 million at the end of the first quarter, up 16% year-over-year, which is at the high end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. All of our GBS practices other than sales and marketing grew at double-digit rates. Supply chain and HR both continued to grow faster than 20%. GBS CV increased $16 million from the fourth quarter. While retention for GBS was 110% for the quarter, which compares to 115% in the prior year when we saw the highest end result for this metric.\nIn addition to continued strong client retention, our clients spent significantly more with us than they did a year ago. GBS new business was down 4% compared to last year against a very strong compare. The 2-year compound annual growth rate for new business was 6%. GBS quota-bearing headcount was up 18% year-over-year. This excludes headcount associated with the Q1 divestiture. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement.\nConferences revenue for the first quarter was $65 million, ahead of our expectations as we saw strong performance with both exhibitors and attendees. The first quarter is always a seasonally small quarter, but we are off to a strong start for the year. Contribution margin in the quarter was 41%, consistent with typical seasonality. We held 10 -- conferences in the quarter, all in person.\nFirst quarter Consulting revenues increased by 10% year-over-year to $127 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 14%. Consulting contribution margin was 40% in the first quarter, consistent with the incremental hiring and return to travel.\nLabor-based revenues were $97 million, up 1% versus Q1 of last year and up 5% on an FX neutral basis. Backlog at March 31 was $161 million, increasing 14% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with continued booking stream.\nOur Contract Optimization business had another very strong quarter, up 53% as reported and 56% on an FX-neutral basis versus the prior year. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable.\nConsolidated cost of services increased 15% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and 17% on an FX-neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher headcount to support our continued strong growth. We also saw an increase in cost year-over-year with a return to in-person conferences.\nSG&A increased 6% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and 9% on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth. The increase was partially offset by lower charges associated with real estate rationalization.\nEBITDA for the first quarter was $379 million, up 15% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 19% FX neutral. First quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance reflected revenue exceeding our expectations in Conferences and Consulting and prudent expense planning. Depreciation in the quarter of $24 million was up modestly compared to 2022.\nNet interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $26 million, down $4 million versus the first quarter of 2022, resulting from higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity. The Q1 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 18% in the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust that income was 35% for the quarter.\nAdjusted EPS in Q1 was $2.88, up 24% year-over-year. We had 80 million shares outstanding in the first quarter. This is a reduction of close to 3 million shares or about 3% year-over-year. We exited the first quarter with about 80 million shares on an unweighted basis.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $165 million, down 2% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $21 million, up 22% year-over-year as a result of an increase in technology modernization investments and equipment for new associates. Free cash flow for the quarter was $144 million. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue on a rolling 4-quarter basis was 18% of revenue and 65% of EBITDA. Adjusted for the after-tax impact of the divestiture and interest rate swap gains, free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income was 120%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating.\nAt the end of the first quarter, we had $894 million of cash. Our March 31 debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provides ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $1.9 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates.\nWe repurchased more than $100 million of stock during the first quarter. We had about $950 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization at March 31. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time.\nWe are increasing our full year guidance to reflect the strong Q1 performance, while still allowing for a higher-than-normal level of uncertainty in the world. As we move through the year, we have more visibility into the revenue outlook and the corresponding expenses needed to support the business and drive growth.\nFor research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. Our plans for 2023 allows for a higher-than-normal range of outcomes as we discussed last quarter. We've got tough compares across the business and particularly with tech vendors and in GBS for another quarter or 2.\nWe've taken a prudent approach based on historical trends, which we've reflected in the guidance. We expect stronger growth from the subscription business than the nonsubscription part of the segment. The nonsubscription part of the business faces tough compares and has more direct exposure to tech vendor spending. The outlook continues to be based on 100% of our 47 destination conferences for 2023 running in person. There is seasonality to the business based on the conferences calendar, which is different than the historical matter. We expect Q4 to be the largest quarter and Q3 to be the smallest of the year.\nFor Consulting revenues, we have more visibility into the second quarter than the second half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. Contract optimization remains highly variable. We had a very strong year in 2022, especially in contract optimization in the fourth quarter.\nWith Q1 behind us, we are comfortable we can run the business successfully for this year while investing for future growth with lower consolidated expenses than we built into the original guidance. We will continue both to manage expense prudently to support future growth and deliver strong margins.\nOur updated guidance for 2023 is as follows. We expect research revenue of at least $4.925 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 7% or 8% excluding the Q1 divestiture. Research revenue guidance is up modestly from February. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $470 million, which is growth of about 21%. We have increased our outlook for Conferences by $25 million. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $505 million, which is a growth of about 5% FX neutral and a modest increase from February. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.90 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 8%. Overall, we've increased our revenue outlook by $35 million.\nAs I mentioned in the last quarter, we've taken a prudent approach to planning for 2023. This applies to revenue, operating expenses and free cash flow. We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.33 billion, up $70 million from our prior guidance and an increase in our margin outlook as well. We expect to be able to deliver on our margin guidance in most economic scenarios. Revenue is stronger than our outlook, we expect upside to EBITDA. We now expect 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $9.50.\nFor 2023, we still expect free cash flow of at least $920 million. This reflects the conversion from GAAP net income of almost 140% excluding the after-tax divestiture proceeds. Our guidance is based on 80 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of March. Finally, for the second quarter of 2023, we expect EBITDA of at least $350 million.\nWe had a strong start to the year despite continuing global macro uncertainty with notable performance in Conferences and overall profitability. Contract value grew double digits. EPS grew more than 20%. We repurchased over $100 million of stock during the first quarter and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. Combining our expected free cash flow generation with the after-tax proceeds of our recent divestiture, we have more than $1 billion available to deploy on behalf of our shareholders in 2023.\nLooking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged with 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV over time and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which lower the share count over time and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

Welcome to Gartner's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm David Cohen, SVP of Investor Relations. (Operator Instructions) After comments by Gene Hall, Gartner's Chief Executive Officer; and Craig Safian, Gartner's Chief Financial Officer, there'll be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nThis call will include a discussion of fourth quarter 2022 financial results and Gartner's outlook for 2023 as disclosed in today's earnings release and earnings supplement, both posted to our website, investor.gartner.com.\nOn the call, unless stated otherwise, all references to EBITDA are for adjusted EBITDA, with the adjustments as described in our earnings release and supplement. All growth rates in Gene's comments are FX neutral, unless stated otherwise, and his contract value comments exclude Russia from 2021. All references to share counts are for fully diluted weighted average share counts unless stated otherwise. Reconciliations for all non-GAAP numbers we use are available in the Investor Relations section of the gartner.com website. Finally, all contract values and associated growth rates we discuss are based on 2022 foreign exchange rates unless stated otherwise.\nAs set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2021 annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as in other filings with the SEC. I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.\nNow I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\n\nEugene A. Hall\n\nCEO & Director, Gartner, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner drove a strong performance in the fourth quarter with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and EPS. We generated nearly $1 billion in free cash flow, and we returned even more than that to shareholders through our ongoing share repurchase program.\nEnterprise leaders are dealing with high volatility and uncertainty. Inflation accelerated to the highest level in 40 years. The dollar was the strongest it's been in 20 years, and it remains extremely volatile. There are ongoing supply chain issues. Energy prices have been volatile. The labor market has been volatile. Enterprises are assessing the impact of remote versus hybrid versus in-person work. There are widespread concerns of a recession. All of these factors and more impact enterprises around the world.\nLeaders need help navigating this turbulent time, and they know Gartner is the best source for that help. Our services often make the difference between success and failure for executives and their enterprises. We help clients succeed with their mission-critical clarities, whether they're in growth mode or cutting costs.\nWith all this volatility, our most recent research shows that Chief Financial Officers are more carefully scrutinizing the expenses but at the same time are increasing investment in mission-critical priorities. Even in enterprises, they are under extreme financial pressure.\nOur research business continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. We help leaders across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our market opportunity is fast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. And we're delivering more value than ever. Research revenue grew 13% in the fourth quarter. Total contract value growth was 12%. Contract value growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions.\nWe serve executives and their teams through two distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS is our largest sales force. GTS contract value grew 11%. The large majority of GTS serves IT leaders and their teams, and we saw double-digit growth with this client segment despite tough compares. GTS also serves leaders at technology vendors, including CEOs and product managers. In this segment, growth moderated but still grew at high single digits despite even tougher compares.\nGlobal Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value grew 19% in 2022. In the 5 years since we launched our GXL products within GBS, we have seen exceptional compound annual growth rates.\nGartner Conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. In the first half of 2022, we delivered most of our conferences virtually. In the second half, we pivoted back to in-person for nearly all our conferences. Feedback has been excellent. Most in-person conferences were sold out in 2022, and we've sold significantly more than half of our exhibitor space for 2023.\nGartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consultant helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 24% in the fourth quarter.\nWe exited the year with a strong backlog and pipeline. Our business is fueled by our highly talented associates. During 2022, we grew our team by about 2,900 associates. With this growth, we ended 2022 with the lowest percentage of open positions ever. When we're fully staffed, we provide our clients better service, which results in better retention. We also sell more in territories that are fully staffed. We have carefully aligned our hiring with recent demand and the long-term opportunity we have for growth.\nOur 2023 outlook reflects our most recent experiences from Q4. We've also been prudent in considering the potential impact of volatility from the global environment. We expect to deliver at least 21.5% margins across a wide range of economic scenarios and our guidance has opportunity for upside if the business performs in line with historical trends. Craig will take you through our guidance in more detail.\nOne of the unique things about Gartner is that we provide value to enterprises that are thriving, struggling or anywhere in between. By being exceptionally agile and adapting to the changing world, we have sustained record of success. We're well prepared as we enter 2023. We've carefully aligned staffing levels with demand and we have the lowest percentage of open positions ever.\nOur content addresses today's mission-critical priorities, and we know the right things to do to be successful in any environment.\nIn closing, we again saw strong growth across the business. Looking ahead, we are well-positioned to drive growth far into the future. Even as we invest for future growth, we expect margins to increase modestly over time, and we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. We'll return capital to our shareholders through buybacks, which reduces shares outstanding and increases returns over time.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.\n\nCraig W. Safian\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Gartner, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gene, and good morning. Fourth quarter results were strong with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and adjusted EPS. FX-neutral growth was even stronger than our reported results. We also delivered better-than-planned EBITDA margins.\nDuring 2022, we generated almost $1 billion of free cash flow, and we returned more than that to shareholders through stock repurchases. Our financial performance for the full year 2022 included total contract value growth of 12%, total revenue growth of 16%, EBITDA growth of 14%, diluted adjusted EPS of $11.27 and free cash flow of $993 million.\nWe are introducing 2023 guidance, which reflects higher-than-normal variability in the set of reasonably likely outcomes. The guidance accounts for the tough compares at the start of the year and the opportunity for upside if near-term demand is stronger than we built into the outlook.\nWith the catch-up hiring we did last year, we are very well-positioned to add value to enterprise function leaders and their teams across all industries and around the world.\nFourth quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year as reported and 20% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68%, down 100 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $421 million, up 37% year-over-year and up 44% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $3.70, up 24% and free cash flow in the quarter was $166 million.\nWe finished the year with 19,505 associates, up 18% from the end of 2021. About 40% of the headcount growth was catch-up from prior years. Our hiring has been carefully calibrated to revenue growth and future demand, and we are well positioned from a talent perspective heading into 2023.\nResearch revenue in the fourth quarter grew 9% year-over-year as reported and 13% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by our strong contract value growth. Fourth quarter Research contribution margin was 74%, consistent with 2021. The contribution margin had a benefit during the quarter from somewhat lower headcount levels and travel expenses still modestly below our post-pandemic expectations. For the full year 2022, Research revenues increased by 12% on a reported basis and 16% FX neutral. The gross contribution margin for the year was 74%, in line with 2021.\nContract value, or CV, represents the annualized revenue under contract at a point in time. And looking at our global contract value across both GTS and GBS, more than 75% of our CV is from enterprise function leaders and their teams with the bulk of the balance coming from leaders at tech vendors. Our enterprise function leaders business includes IT leaders who are end users of technology and who we serve through our GTS sales force, and leaders of other business functions who we serve through our GBS sales force. In both cases, we serve leaders around the world and across all industries. We're helping these enterprise function leaders address their most important mission-critical priorities.\nCV was $4.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 11.9% versus the prior year and up 12.3% adjusted for the impact of exiting Russia. CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew at strong double-digit rates. CV from tech vendors grew high single digits compared to a high teens growth rate in the fourth quarter of '21. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $189 million (inaudible) of almost $400 million.\nCV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, all industry sectors grew at double-digit rates other than technology and media, which grew at high single-digit rates. The fastest growth was in the transportation, retail and manufacturing sectors. We had double-digit growth across all of our enterprise-size categories. We also drove double-digit growth in 9 of our top 10 countries with high single-digit growth in the 10th.\nGlobal Technology Sales CV was $3.6 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 10% versus the prior year and up 10.5% adjusted for the exit of Russia. GTS had quarterly NCVI of $138 million, while retention for GTS was 105% for the quarter. GTS new business was down 8.5% versus last year. New business with IT function leaders was up modestly year-over-year against the tough compare. New business with tech vendors facing tougher compare against Q4 of 2021, which was its strongest quarter ever. GTS quota-bearing headcount was up 18% compared to December of last year. About 40% of the growth was catch-up hiring from 2021. Our continued investments in our sales teams will drive long-term sustained double-digit growth. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement.\nGlobal Business Sales CV was over $1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 19% year-over-year, which is above the high end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. All of our GBS practices, other than marketing, grew at double-digit growth rates led by supply chain and HR, which both continued to grow faster than 20%. GBS CV increased $52 million from the third quarter while retention for GBS was 112%. GBS new business was up 3% versus last year against a very strong compare. The 2-year compound annual growth rate for new business was 9%. GBS quota-bearing headcount increased 22% year-over-year with a little more than 50% of the growth being catch up from 2021. Headcount we hired in 2022 will help to position us for sustained double-digit growth in the future. As with GTS, a regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement.\nConferences revenue for the fourth quarter was $188 million. Contribution margin in the quarter was 53%. We held nine in-person conferences in quarter. It has been very exciting for our business to return to in-person conferences. For the full year 2022, revenue increased 82% on a reported basis and 90% FX neutral. Gross contribution margin was 54%.\nFourth quarter Consulting revenues increased by 17% year-over-year to $138 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 24%. Consulting contribution margin was 37% in the fourth quarter.\nLabor-based revenues were $96 million, up 11% versus Q4 of last year and up 19% on an FX-neutral basis. Backlog at December 31 was $140 million, increasing 24% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with another strong bookings quarter. The inclusion of multiyear contracts in our backlog calculation, a change we described earlier last year, contributed about 13 percentage points to the year-over-year growth rate.\nOur contract optimization business had a very strong quarter, increasing 36% as reported and 39% on an FX-neutral basis versus the prior year. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly variable.\nFull year Consulting revenue was up 15% on a reported basis and 22% on an FX-neutral basis. Gross contribution margin of 39% was up 140 basis points from 2021. Consolidated cost of services increased 19% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and 24% on an FX-neutral basis. The biggest drivers of the increase were higher headcount to support our continued strong growth and the return to in-person destination conferences.\nSG&A decreased 3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and increased 1% on an FX-neutral basis. We had lower noncash nonrecurring charges in 2022 compared to 2021. On a comparable basis, SG&A was up due to additional headcount for sales and G&A functions. For the full year, cost of services increased 17% on a reported basis and 21% on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased 15% on a reported basis and 19% on an FX-neutral basis in 2022.\nEBITDA for the fourth quarter was $421 million, up 37% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 44% FX neutral. Fourth quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance reflected revenue exceeding our forecast, most notably in consulting and expenses at the low end of our expectations. EBITDA for the full year was $1.47 billion, a 14% increase over 2021 on a reported basis and up 19% FX neutral.\nDepreciation was $24 million in the fourth quarter, down modestly versus 2021. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $29 million, about flat with the prior year. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity.\nThe Q4 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 16.7% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 23.2% for the quarter. The full year tax rate was 21.6% on the same basis.\nAdjusted EPS in Q4 was $3.70, up 19% year-over-year. The average share count for the fourth quarter was 80 million shares. This is a reduction of about 3.7 million shares or about 4% year-over-year. We exited the fourth quarter with about 80 million shares outstanding on an unweighted basis. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $11.27. EPS growth for the year was 22%.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $203 million. Excluding insurance proceeds in Q4 of 2021, operating cash flow is down about 7%. Q4 cash flow was impacted by Hurricane Ian, which hit our Center of Excellence in Fort Myers extremely hard in late September. While we were able to sell and service our clients from Fort Myers, we did have some delays in getting invoices out as quickly as we normally would. Elections for some of these delayed invoices slipped into January, but we are now caught up.\nCapEx for the quarter was $38 million, up about $16 million year-over-year, led by increases in capitalized technology labor costs and catch-up laptop spend. Free cash flow for the quarter was $166 million. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest CapEx needs and upfront client payments. As many of you know, we generate free cash flow well in excess of net income. Our conversion from EBITDA is also very strong with the differences being cash interest, cash taxes and modest CapEx, partially offset by strong working capital cash inflows.\nFree cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 18% on a rolling 4-quarter basis. On the same basis, free cash flow was 68% of EBITDA and 123% of GAAP net income. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had almost $700 million of cash. Our December 31 debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, unused revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A.\nOur balance sheet is very strong with $1.7 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased more than $1 billion of stock throughout 2022. We expect the Board will refresh our share repurchase authorization as needed, which they did earlier this month. We now have about $1 billion authorized for share repurchases.\nAcross the past 2 years, we have returned $2.7 billion to shareholders by repurchasing more than 11 million shares. Over that time frame, we have reduced our shares outstanding by 11%. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time.\nBefore providing the 2023 guidance details, I want to discuss our base-level assumptions and planning philosophy for 2023. For research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. Executives and their teams face uncertainty and challenges, and they recognize how Gartner can help regardless of the economic environment. Our plan allows for a higher-than-normal level of uncertainty in the world, as Gene discussed. We've got tough compares across the business and particularly with tech vendors for another quarter or two. We've taken a prudent approach based on historical trends as well as more normal patterns, which we've reflected in the guidance.\nIf near-term demand is stronger than we've built into the outlook, and NCVI phasing, retention rates and nonsubscription growth performed closer to the way they have historically, there would be upside to our guidance. In addition, our teams are focused on driving greater growth than what's embedded in the guidance.\nFinally, as you think about GBS, overall CV and revenue growth for 2023, please keep in mind that we closed on the divestiture of a small noncore asset last week. We sold TalentNeuron, which we acquired as part of the CEB transaction for $164 million. In the earnings supplement appendix, we've provided historical contract value updated for 2023 FX rates as well as the removal of TalentNeuron from prior years.\nFor conferences, we are basing our guidance on being 100% in-person for the 47 destination conferences we have planned for 2023. We expect to return to more typical seasonality for the business with fourth quarter the largest, followed by the second quarter.\nFor Consulting revenues, we have more visibility into the first half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. Contract optimization is seasonally slower in the first quarter and remains highly variable. We had a very strong year in 2022, especially in contract optimization in the fourth quarter.\nOur base-level assumptions for consolidated expenses reflect significant headcount increases from 2022 annualizing into 2023. Our plan for headcount for 2023 is more in line with our normal model as we caught up on hiring last year. If demand is stronger than what's in the initial plan, we will have the opportunity to add even more great talent to our teams. We also expect T&E costs to more fully normalize this year.\nFinally, we continue to invest in our systems and process automation, both client-facing and internal applications as part of our innovation and continuous improvement programs. We will continue both to manage expenses prudently to support future growth and deliver strong margins. At current rates, FX will be a modest tailwind to growth for the full year with the benefit in the second half.\nOur guidance for 2023 is as follows: We expect Research revenue of at least $4.92 billion, which is growth of about 7%. Excluding the effect of the divestiture, adds 1 percentage point to the year-over-year growth rate. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $445 million, which is growth of about 14%. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $500 million, which is growth of about 4%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.865 billion, which is growth of about 7%. Excluding the divested business from 2022, would add about 80 basis points to the growth rate.\nAs I've mentioned, we've taken a prudent approach to planning for 2023. This applies to revenue, operating expenses and free cash flow. We expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.26 billion. We expect to be able to deliver at least 21.5% margins in most economic scenarios. If revenue is stronger than our guidance, we expect upside to EBITDA and margins. Included in the guidance is equity comp of $132 million, up from 2022. We expect 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $8.80 per share. For 2023, we expect free cash flow of at least $920 million. Our EPS guidance is based on 80 million shares, which only assumes repurchases to offset dilution. Finally, for the first quarter of 2023, we expect to deliver at least $310 million of EBITDA. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site.\nOur strong performance in 2022 continued in the fourth quarter. Contract value grew 12%, adjusted EPS increased 19%, fueled in part by the significant reduction of shares in 2021 and 2022. Over the past few years, our hiring has been carefully calibrated to demand, and we are well-positioned from a talent perspective heading into 2023. Our continued investments in our teams will drive long-term sustained double-digit growth. We repurchased more than $1 billion in stock last year and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders over time. As I mentioned, we expect to generate at least $920 million in free cash flow in 2023. In addition, we have ample liquidity and the net proceeds from last week's divestiture for capital deployment initiatives.\nLooking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% Research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

Welcome to Gartner's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm David Cohen, SVP of Investor Relations. (Operator Instructions) After comments by Gene Hall, Gartner's Chief Executive Officer; and Craig Safian, Gartner's Chief Financial Officer, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nThis call will include a discussion of third quarter 2022 financial results and Gartner's updated outlook for 2022 as disclosed in today's earnings release and earnings supplement, both posted to our website, investor.gartner.com.\nOn the call, unless stated otherwise, all references to EBITDA are for adjusted EBITDA with the adjustments as described in our earnings release and supplement. All growth rates in Gene's comments are FX-neutral, unless stated otherwise. All references to share counts are for fully diluted weighted average share counts, unless stated otherwise.\nReconciliations for all non-GAAP numbers we use are available in the Investor Relations section of the gartner.com website.\nFinally, all contract values and associated growth rates we discuss are based on 2022 foreign exchange rates unless stated otherwise.\nAs set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as in other filings with the SEC. I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.\nNow I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\n\nEugene A. Hall\n\nCEO & Director, Gartner, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thanks for joining us. We continue to deliver incredible value to more than 15,000 enterprises around the world. This led to another strong performance in the third quarter. We achieved double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and EPS. We had strong growth in all practices, all industry sectors, across every size client and in every region. In addition, through Q3, we repurchased over $1 billion of stock.\nOur clients continue to face a rapidly changing world, things like digital transformation, future of work, high inflation, shifting customer needs, supply chain disruptions and more. Our clients know they need help on these issues, and they know Gartner is the best source of help.\nThrough our actionable, objective insights, we help executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions achieve their mission-critical priorities. We know how to help whether our clients are thriving, struggling or somewhere in between. With all of this, demand for our services remain strong.\nResearch continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Total Research revenue grew 15%. Contract value growth was 14%.\nWe serve executives and their teams through distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. We help chief information officers achieve mission-critical priorities such as leading digital transformations, managing talent in a challenging labor market and fueling innovation. GTS contract value grew 13%.\nGlobal Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. We help leaders across these functions achieve their mission-critical priorities. For example, we help HR leaders engage employees in a hybrid world, evolve organizational design with the transition to digital business, manage compensation in an inflationary environment, manage employee expectations on divisive social issues and reimagine the future of work. GBS contract value grew 21%.\nAcross GTS and GBS, we're driving relentless execution of proven practices, which in turn is driving our sustained results. Gartner Conferences deliver valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience.\nWe continued our return to in-person conferences. In October, we hosted 2 of our flagship conferences, IT Symposium and ReimagineHR, both in Orlando, Florida. Compared to 2019, attendance of IT Symposium was up 12% and ReimagineHR attendance doubled. The feedback from our in-person conferences has been resoundingly positive.\nGartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper extended project-based work. Consulting revenue grew 21% in the third quarter.\nOver the past few quarters, the rapid growth of our business outpaced hiring. This quarter, our associate base grew 18% year-over-year. This provides the capacity we need to serve our rapidly growing base of licensed users and positions us for sustained future growth.\nIn closing, Gartner delivered another strong performance. We've caught up on hiring and are positioned to deliver sustained future growth. Our underlying margins are in the low 20s, comfortably above pre-pandemic levels. We expect them to modestly increase over time. We'll continue to generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income. And we'll continue to return significant levels of capital to our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.\n\nCraig W. Safian\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Gartner, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gene, and good morning. Third quarter results were strong with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue and adjusted EPS. FX-neutral growth was even stronger than our reported results. We also delivered better-than-planned EBITDA margins.\nReflecting the strong third quarter, enthusiastic demand for our in-person conferences and continued success in balancing cost discipline with investing for future growth, we are again increasing our 2022 guidance.\nThird quarter revenue was $1.3 billion, up 15% year-over-year as reported and 20% FX-neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69%, down 20 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $332 million, up 9% year-over-year and up 15% FX-neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.41, up 19%. And free cash flow in the quarter was $283 million.\nResearch revenue in the third quarter grew 11% year-over-year as reported and 15% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by our strong contract value growth. Third quarter Research contribution margin was 74%, modestly below last year. The continued higher-than-normal contribution margin reflects improved operational effectiveness, increased scale, travel expenses still modestly below our post-pandemic expectations and research-related head count with a bit more catch-up still to go.\nContract value or CV was $4.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 14.5% versus the prior year. CV growth is always FX-neutral. Excluding the impact of exiting Russia, growth for Q3 would have been 14.9%.\nQuarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $128 million. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter even though there is notable seasonality in this metric.\nThe sequential increase in CV of $128 million was driven by the combination of continued strong retention rates and near record new business of almost $250 million, similar to the second quarter of this year and the third quarter of 2021. The 14.9% contract value growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions.\nOur technology practice grew 13%, and all of our business practices led by HR and supply chain grew at double-digit growth rates. All industry sectors, including technology, grew at double-digit rates with the fastest growth in transportation, retail and manufacturing. We had double-digit growth across all of our enterprise-sized categories with our medium category growing the fastest. In the small category, the technology sector continued to grow at double-digit rates.\nWe also drove double-digit growth across all of our top 10 countries other than China, where we saw continued single-digit growth. Across our North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, all industry sectors had double-digit growth rates.\nGlobal Technology Sales contract value was $3.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 13% versus the prior year. GTS had quarterly NCVI of $88 million, driven by strong retention and near record levels of new business for a third quarter while retention for GTS was again strong at 107% for the quarter, up about 310 basis points year-over-year.\nGTS new business was down 5% versus last year, up against another tough compare. The 2-year compound annual growth rate was about 9%. GTS quota-bearing head count was up 16% compared to September of last year. Our continued investments in our sales teams will drive long-term sustained double-digit growth.\nOur regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement.\nGlobal Business Sales contract value was $977 million at the end of the third quarter, up 21% year-over-year, which is above the high end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. GBS CV increased $40 million from the second quarter while retention for GBS was 114% for the quarter, up about 120 basis points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 1% compared to last year against a strong compare. The 2-year compound annual growth rate for new business was 18%. GBS quota-bearing head count increased 19% year-over-year. Head count we hire in 2022 will help to position us for sustained double-digit growth in the future.\nAs with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement.\nConferences revenue for the third quarter was $77 million, ahead of our expectations as attendees and exhibitors were excited to get back to the in-person experience. Contribution margin in the quarter was 52%. We held 10 in-person conferences and 3 virtual conferences in the quarter. We held Evanta meetings in both virtual and in-person formats.\nWe plan to run 9 in-person destination conferences in the fourth quarter and have updated our guidance to reflect the strong demand we are seeing.\nThird quarter Consulting revenues increased by 13% year-over-year to $107 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 21%. Consulting contribution margin was 35% in the third quarter, up 210 basis points versus the prior year with better-than-expected revenue and higher utilization rates.\nLabor-based revenues were $90 million, up 16% versus Q3 of last year and up 26% on an FX-neutral basis. Backlog at September 30 was $162 million, increasing 33% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with another strong bookings quarter. The inclusion of multiyear contracts in our backlog calculation, a change we described earlier in the year, contributed about 11 percentage points to the year-over-year growth rate.\nOur contract optimization business declined 3% as reported and 1% on an FX-neutral basis versus the prior year. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable.\nConsolidated cost of services increased 16% year-over-year in the third quarter as reported and 21% on an FX-neutral basis. The biggest drivers of the increase were higher head count to support our continued strong growth and the return to in-person destination conferences.\nSG&A increased 20% year-over-year in the third quarter as reported and 24% on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of added head count for sales and G&A functions and higher commissions following a strong CV growth in 2021. We expect SG&A expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue over the near term as our catch-up hiring continues.\nEBITDA for the third quarter was $332 million, up 9% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 15% FX-neutral. Third quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance reflected revenue exceeding our forecast and expenses at the low end of our expectations.\nDepreciation in the third quarter of $23 million was down modestly versus 2021.\nNet interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $29 million, down a little over $1 million versus the third quarter of 2021, mainly due to lower interest rate swap costs. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity.\nThe Q3 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 24.7% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 20.2% for the quarter.\nAdjusted EPS in Q3 was $2.41, growth of 19% year-over-year. The average share count for the third quarter was 80 million shares. This is a reduction of about 4.7 million shares or about 5.6% year-over-year. We exited the third quarter with about 80 million shares outstanding on an unweighted basis.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $315 million, down 9% compared to last year.\nCapEx for the quarter was $32 million, up about $18 million year-over-year, led by increases in capitalized technology, labor costs and catch-up laptop spends.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was $283 million. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest CapEx needs and upfront client payments.\nAs many of you know, we generate free cash flow well in excess of net income. Our conversion from EBITDA is very strong with the differences being cash interest, cash taxes and modest CapEx partially offset by strong working capital cash inflows. Adjusting for the insurance proceeds we received last year, free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 19% on a rolling 4-quarter basis. On the same basis, free cash flow was 76% of EBITDA and 137% of GAAP net income.\nAt the end of the third quarter, we had $529 million of cash.\nOn September 30, debt balance was $2.5 billion.\nOur reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, unused revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A.\nOur balance sheet is very strong with $1.5 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates.\nWe repurchased more than $1 billion worth of stock through the end of the third quarter. We had about $600 million remaining on our authorization at the end of September, which we expect the Board will continue to refresh as needed going forward.\nSince the end of the end of 2020 through the end of this September, we've reduced our shares outstanding by 10 million shares. This is a reduction of 11%. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share, and combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time.\nWe are increasing our full year guidance to reflect strong Q3 performance and an improved outlook for the fourth quarter despite incremental FX headwinds. We now expect an FX impact to our full year revenue growth rate of about 420 basis points for the full year. This is up from 370 basis points based on rates when we guided in August.\nAs we discussed the last 3 quarters, 2021 Research performance benefited from several factors, including QBH tenure mix, NCVI phasing within the quarters and year, record retention rates and strong nonsubscription growth. The growth compares will continue to be challenging for a few more quarters. We continue to take a measured approach based on historical trends and patterns, which we reflected in the updated guidance.\nFor Conferences, we assume we will be able to run all 9 in-person conferences as planned.\nConsistent with our commentary in the past couple of quarters, our assumptions for consolidated expenses continue to reflect significant head count increases during the fourth quarter to support current and future growth. We continue to model higher labor costs and T&E well above 2021 levels as we've previously indicated. We also have higher commission expense during 2022 due to the exceptional performance we delivered in 2021. Finally, we continue to invest in our tech, both client-facing and internal applications as part of our innovation and continuous improvement programs.\nOur updated guidance for 2022 is as follows: we expect Research revenue of at least $4.58 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 16%. The FX-neutral growth is up about 60 basis points from our prior guidance due to strong NCVI performance in the third quarter.\nWe expect Conferences revenue of at least $375 million, which is growth of about 84% FX-neutral.\nWe expect Consulting revenue of at least $450 million, which is growth of about 14% FX-neutral.\nThe result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.40 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of almost 19%. The FX-neutral growth is up about 180 basis points from our prior guidance due to strong performance in the third quarter and an improved outlook for Q4. Without the strengthening U.S. dollar since August, our revenue outlook would have been about $85 million higher than previous guidance.\nWe now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.36 billion, up $125 million from our prior guidance and an increase in our margin outlook as well. Without the strengthening U.S. dollar since August, our EBITDA guidance would have been about $136 million higher than previous guidance.\nWe now expect 2022 adjusted EPS of at least $10.06 per share. For 2022, we now expect free cash flow of at least $1.025 billion.\nOur EPS guidance is based on 81 million shares, which reflects year-to-date repurchases.\nAs a result, we expect to deliver at least $310 million of EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nAll the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site.\nOur strong performance in 2022 continued in the third quarter with momentum across the business. Contract value grew 14%. Adjusted EPS increased 19%, fueled in part by the significant reduction of shares over the past year. We are adding associates across the business to keep up with our growth and to position us well heading into 2023. Our continued investments in our teams will drive long-term sustained double-digit growth. We repurchased more than $1 billion in stock this year through September and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders over time.\nLooking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% Research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions.

Welcome to Gartner's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) After comments by Gene Hall, Gartner's Chief Executive Officer; and Craig Safian, Gartner's Chief Financial Officer, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nThis call will include a discussion of second quarter 2022 financial results and Gartner's updated outlook for 2022 as disclosed in today's earnings release and earnings supplement, both posted to our website, investor.gartner.com. On the call, unless stated otherwise, all references to EBITDA are for adjusted EBITDA, with the adjustments as described in our earnings release and supplement. All growth rates in Gene's comments are FX neutral, unless stated otherwise. All references to share counts are for fully diluted weighted average share count, unless stated otherwise. Reconciliations from non-GAAP numbers we use are available in the Investor Relations section of the gartner.com website.\nFinally, our contract values and associated growth rates we discuss are based on '22 foreign exchange rates, unless stated otherwise. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as in other filings with the SEC. I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\n\nEugene A. Hall\n\nCEO & Director, Gartner, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thanks for joining us. Gartner had a strong performance in the second quarter. We delivered double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and EPS, and we continue to return excess capital to our shareholders through our buyback programs.\nResearch continues to be our largest and most profitable segments. Gartner Research provides actual objective insight to executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our expert guidance and tools enable faster, smarter decisions and stronger performance on our clients' mission-critical priorities. We continue to have a vast market opportunity across all sectors, sizes and geographies, and we're delivering more value than ever.\nThe rate of change in the world is the fastest I've ever seen. Against this backdrop, Gartner continues to get even more agile. We're generating new insights to address timely and pressing issues, such as leveraging emerging technologies, optimizing costs, attracting and retaining talent in the hybrid world, managing cybersecurity risk and more. We deliver incredible value, whether our clients are thriving, struggling or somewhere in between. As a result, demand for our services remain strong.\nQ2 Research revenue grew 17% in the second quarter. Total contract value growth was 15%. Retention remained very strong, and new business was near all-time highs. We're also growing our sales teams. Global Technology Sales headcount was up 9%, and Global Business Sales headcount was up 17% year-over-year. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, source leaders in their teams within IT. GTS contract value grew 14%. Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value grew 23%.\nAcross every function: IT, supply chain, marketing, sales, HR, finance and more, leaders and their teams benefit from our incredible value proposition. As a result, the enterprises we support see measurable progress on their mission-critical priorities.\nLeveraging the extraordinary value of our research insights. Our Conferences business brings the power of Gartner to life for an engaged and highly qualified audience. During Q2, we delivered our first in-person destination conferences since the start of the pandemic. This conference has covered IT, finance and supply chain in Europe, Australia and the U.S. Attendee feedback has been resoundingly positive. They deeply value the opportunities to connect, engage and learn in person.\nBookings continue at a strong pace for both exhibitors and attendees. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic technology initiatives through deeper, extended project-based work. Consulting had a strong quarter, with revenue up 20%. Bookings were also strong, driving backlog up 45%.\nIn closing, we saw strong growth across the business. We continue to generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. We returned excess capital to shareholders, which reduced our shares outstanding. Looking ahead, we are well positioned for strong double-digit top line growth.\nOur underlying margins are in the low 20s, well above pre-pandemic levels, and we expect them to modestly increase over time. And we continue to generate free cash flow well in excess of earnings, which we will deploy to further drive shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. Craig?\n\nCraig W. Safian\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Gartner, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gene, and good morning. Second quarter results were strong, with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue and adjusted EPS. With results above our expectations, we are again increasing our 2022 guidance. The improved outlook reflects the better-than-expected second quarter top line results, strong demand for second half conferences and a successful balance between cost discipline and investing for future growth. .\nSecond quarter revenue was $1.4 billion, up 18% year-over-year as reported and 22% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69%, down 70 basis points versus the prior year as costs return towards normal. EBITDA was $389 million, up 10% year-over-year and up 14% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.85, up 27%, and free cash flow in the quarter was $395 million.\nAdjusting for insurance proceeds received last year, free cash flow was down 2% year-over-year for the quarter and up 5% on a rolling 4-quarter basis. Research revenue in the second quarter grew 14% year-over-year as reported and 17% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by our strong contract value growth. Second quarter Research contribution margin was 74%, about in line with 2021.\nHigher-than-normal contribution margins reflect improved operational effectiveness, increased scale, continued temporary avoidance of travel expenses and continuing to catch up on headcount to support the Research business. Contract value, or CV, was $4.3 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 15% versus the prior year. As we discussed previously, CV reflects our decision to exit the Russian market, which contributed about $13 million in the second quarter 2021 number. This reduced the headline growth by about 40 basis points. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $97 million. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter, even though there is notable seasonality in this metric. The sequential increase in CV of $97 million was driven by the combination of continued strong retention rates and near record new business of close to $250 million.\nWe saw broad-based CV growth across all of our practices. Our technology practice grew 14%, and all of our business practices grew at double-digit growth rates, with many of them growing more than 20% year-over-year. From an industry perspective, retail, media and manufacturing led our CV growth. Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.4 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 14% versus the prior year. GTS had quarterly NCVI of $60 million, driven by strong retention and near record levels of new business for our second quarter. While retention for GTS was 107% for the quarter, up about 530 basis points year-over-year and near record levels. GTS new business was down 1% versus last year, up against a very tough compare.\nThe 2-year compound annual growth rate was about 16%. GTS quota-bearing headcount was up 9% year-over-year. We are on track to get to double-digit growth by the end of 2022 as we have successfully brought turnover down and our investments in recruiting are delivering results. We will continue to invest in our sales team to drive long-term sustained double-digit growth while also delivering strong margins. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement.\nGlobal Business Sales contract value was $936 million at the end of the second quarter, up 23% year-over-year, which is above the high end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. GBS CV increased $37 million from the first quarter. Wallet retention for GBS was 115% for the quarter, up about 5 percentage points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 3% compared to last year, reflecting robust growth across the full portfolio and against a very strong compare. The 2-year compound annual growth rate for new business was 35%. GBS quota-bearing headcount increased 17% year-over-year. Headcount we hire in 2022 will help to position us for sustained double-digit growth in the future. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement.\nConferences revenue for the second quarter was $114 million, ahead of our expectations as attendees and exhibitors enthusiastically return to in-person. Contribution margin in the quarter was 65%. We held 6 in-person conferences and 8 virtual conferences in the quarter. We held Evanta meetings in both virtual and in-person formats. We plan to run 19 in-person conferences for the balance of the year.\nSecond quarter Consulting revenues increased by 14% year-over-year to $121 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 20%. Consulting contribution margin was 42% in the second quarter, up 120 basis points versus the prior year with better-than-expected revenue, higher utilization rates and a mix benefit from strong growth in contract optimization. Labor-based revenues were $95 million, up 11% versus Q2 of last year and up 18% on an FX-neutral basis.\nBacklog at June 30 was $152 million, increasing 45% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with another strong bookings quarter. The inclusion of multiyear contracts, a change we described last quarter, contributed about 12 percentage points to the year-over-year growth rate.\nOur contract optimization business was up 28% as reported and 31% on an FX-neutral basis versus the prior year. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable. Consolidated cost of services increased 21% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and 25% on an FX-neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher headcount to support our continued strong growth and the return to in-person destination conferences.\nSG&A increased 24% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and 27% on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of increased hiring and sales and G&A functions, higher commission expense following strong CV growth in 2021 and the $12 million onetime real estate charge. We expect SG&A expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue over the near term as our catch-up hiring continues.\nEBITDA for the second quarter was $389 million, up 10% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 14% FX neutral. Second quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance reflected revenue exceeding our forecast and expenses at the low end of our expectations. Depreciation in the quarter of $23 million was down modestly versus 2021.\nNet interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $29 million, up $2 million versus the second quarter of 2021 due to an increase in total debt balances. The Q2 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 25.7% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 25% for the quarter.\nAdjusted EPS in Q2 was $2.85, growth of 27% year-over-year. The average share count for the second quarter was 81 million shares. This is a reduction of about 5.6 million shares or about 6.5% year-over-year. We exited the second quarter with about 80 million shares outstanding on an unweighted basis.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $416 million. Adjusting for the insurance proceeds we received in the second quarter of 2021, operating cash flow was down 2% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $21 million, up 76% year-over-year as a result of an increase in capitalized software, laptops and other infrastructure.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was $395 million. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model, with modest CapEx needs and upfront client payments. As many of you know, we generate free cash flow well in excess of net income. Our conversion from EBITDA is very strong with the differences being cash interest, cash taxes and modest CapEx, partially offset by strong working capital cash inflows.\nAdjusting for the insurance proceeds we received last year, free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 21% on a rolling 4-quarter basis. On the same basis, free cash flow was 81% of EBITDA and 146% of GAAP net income. At the end of the second quarter, we had $360 million of cash. Our June 30 debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, unused revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A.\nWe repurchased around $930 million of stock through the first half of this year. We had about $700 million remaining on our authorization at the end of June. We expect the Board to continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward.\nSince the end of 2020 through the end of this June, we have reduced our shares outstanding by 9 million shares. This is a reduction of 11%. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share, and combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time.\nOur medium-term outlook is for double-digit revenue growth. While margins have been very strong in the past 2 years, we are continuing to catch up hiring and to resume travel spending. We estimate our underlying margins to be in the low 20s, well above pre-pandemic levels, and we expect them to increase modestly over time. We will give 2023 specific guidance in February, consistent with our usual practice.\nStrong top line growth, modest margin expansion, low capital intensity and working capital as a source of cash will allow us to deliver strong free cash flow now and in the future. We are increasing our full year guidance to reflect strong Q2 performance and an improved outlook for the second half despite incremental FX headwinds. We now expect an FX impact to our revenue growth rates of about 370 basis points for the full year. This is up from 260 basis points based on rates when we guided in May.\nAs we discussed in the last 2 quarters, 2021 Research performance benefited from several factors, including QBH tenure mix and CVI phasing within the quarters and the year, record retention rates and strong non-subscription growth. We continue to assume that those benefits do not persist at the same levels through 2022. The growth compares will continue to be challenging as we move through the year. We continue to take a measured approach based on historical trends and patterns, which we've reflected in the updated guidance.\nFor Conferences, we assume we will be able to run all the in-person conferences as planned. Consistent with our commentary the past couple of quarters, our assumptions for consolidated expenses continue to reflect significant headcount increases during the year to support current and future growth. We have modeled higher labor costs and T&E well above 2021 levels, as we've previously indicated. We also have higher commission expense during 2022 due to the very good selling performance we delivered in 2021.\nFinally, we continue to invest in our tech, both client-facing and internal applications, as part of our innovation and continuous improvement programs. Our updated guidance for 2022 is as follows. We expect Research revenue of at least $4.575 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 15%. The FX-neutral growth is up about 120 basis points from our prior guidance due to strong NCVI performance in the second quarter.\nWe expect Conferences revenue of at least $335 million, which is growth of about 63% FX neutral. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $440 million, which is growth of about 11% FX neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.35 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of almost 17%. The FX-neutral growth is up about 290 basis points from our prior guidance due to strong performance in the second quarter.\nWithout the strengthening U.S. dollar since May, our revenue guidance would have been about $138 million than previous guidance. We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.235 billion, up $100 million from our prior guidance and an increase in our margin outlook as well. Without the strengthening U.S. dollar since May, our EBITDA guidance would have been about $120 million higher than previous guidance.\nWe now expect 2022 adjusted EPS of at least $8.85. For 2022, we now expect free cash flow of at least $985 million. Our guidance is based on 81 million shares outstanding, which reflects year-to-date repurchases. All of the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site.\nFinally, for the third quarter of 2022, we expect to deliver at least $255 million of EBITDA. Our strong performance in 2022 continued in the second quarter with momentum across the business. Contract value growth was very strong at 15%. Adjusted EPS grew 27%, fueled by the significant reduction in shares over the past year. We repurchased around $930 million in stock this year through June and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders.\nLooking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic, value-enhancing tuck-in M&A.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions.

Welcome to Gartner's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Cohen, Gartner's SVP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Cohen\n\nGroup VP of IR, Gartner, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for Gartner's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call, and hope you are well. With me on the call today are Gene Hall, Chief Executive Officer; and Craig Safian, Chief Financial Officer. This call will include a discussion of first quarter 2022 financial results and Gartner's updated outlook for 2022, as disclosed in today's earnings release and earnings supplement, both posted to our website, investor.gartner.com, following comments by Gene and Craig, who will open up the call for your questions. (Operator Instructions)\nOn the call, unless stated otherwise, all references to EBITDA are for adjusted EBITDA, with the adjustments as described in our earnings release and supplement. All growth rates in Gene's comments are FX neutral, unless stated otherwise. Reconciliations for all non-GAAP numbers we use are available in the Investor Relations section of the gartner.com website.\nFinally, all contract values and associated growth rates we discuss are based on 2022 foreign exchange rates unless stated otherwise. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as in other filings with the SEC. I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.\nNow I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\n\nEugene A. Hall\n\nCEO & Director, Gartner, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us. Gartner had a great start to 2022. In the first quarter, performance was strong across the business. We delivered growth in revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow. We drove acceleration in contract value, and our significant share repurchase program has lowered our share count.\nWith our strong Q1 results, we're increasing our 2022 guidance. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Gartner Research provides actionable, objective insight to executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. We continue to have a vast market opportunity across all sectors, sizes and geographies, and we're delivering more value to our clients than ever before.\nThere's a high degree of volatility and uncertainty in the world. Our clients are facing more challenging decisions than ever before. We've been incredibly agile in supporting them through these trying times. We're delivering more relevant and timely content on current pressing issues such as successfully operating in a hybrid work environment, developing strategies to attract and retain talent and managing supply chain disruptions.\nBeyond these issues, we continue to provide unparalleled insight and advice on top priorities, including transitioning to digital business, building diverse, equitable and inclusive organizations, managing cybersecurity threats and much more. Whether our clients are experiencing good times or bad and regardless of role, we deliver incredible value to enterprise leaders and their teams, and we have strong demand for our services.\nResearch revenue grew 18% in Q1. Total contract value growth was 16%, at the top end of our medium-term outlook. Within our Research segment, we serve executives and their teams through distinct sales channels.\nGlobal Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS contract value grew 14%. Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value grew 24%.\nTurning now to our Conferences business. Gartner Conferences deliver extraordinary value to an engaged and highly qualified audience. Q1 is a seasonally small quarter for our Conferences business, which performed as expected in the first quarter. We ran 5 virtual conferences in Q1. We pushed several conferences that traditionally occurred in Q1 to later in the year to facilitate running them in person. We continue to see strong demand for in-person conferences from our clients and prospects. We're taking a [deliberate-based] approach as we return to in-person experiences.\nNext week, we will be hosting our first in-person conference since our pivot to virtual in 2020. The Gartner Data & Analytics Summit will run next week in London. Attendee tickets and exhibitor space has sold out for the summit. Our clients, prospects, analysts and sales teams are eager to come together.\nAs we return to in-person conferences, we'll continue to leverage our profitable virtual conferences as a complement to our in-person conferences. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper extended project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IC research business.\nConsulting revenue grew a very strong 20% in the first quarter. So we had a great start to the year. To sustain our success over the long term, we've made targeted investments in hiring and retaining top talent that are paying off. Across the company, turnover has stabilized. We expanded our recruiting capacity last year and are adding new associates at a strong pace.\nIn Q1, we had our highest number of new hires ever. We grew headcount 4% sequentially, achieving our quarterly hiring target. We're on pace to achieve our hiring goals for 2022.\nThe world continues to face significant challenges. Beyond the unrelenting COVID-19 pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a terrible humanitarian crisis. Our thoughts are with all those who continue to be impacted.\nGartner is exiting the Russian market. In addition, we have established a free resource center to help leaders address a range of business issues that have emerged as a result of this crisis.\nIn closing, we started 2022 with strong performances. We have great momentum across the business. Whether our clients are experiencing good times or bad and regardless of role, we deliver incredible value to enterprise leaders and their teams, and we have strong demand for our services. We have a vast untapped market opportunity. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income.\nLooking ahead, we're well positioned to drive strong top line growth with modest margin expansion. As we invest for future growth, we'll continue to return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This reduces our shares outstanding and increases returns on capital over time.\nWith our strong Q1 results, we're increasing our 2022 guidance. With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian, who will give you more detail. Craig?\n\nCraig W. Safian\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Gartner, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gene, and good morning. First quarter results were strong with acceleration in contract value growth and strength in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. EPS was particularly strong as the benefit of share buybacks reduced our share count.\nWith results above our expectations, we are increasing our 2022 guidance. The improved outlook reflects the better-than-expected first quarter top line results and increased revenue from conferences we now expect to hold in person.\nFirst quarter revenue was $1.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year as reported and 16% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 70%, up 44 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $329 million, up 3% year-over-year and up 5% FX neutral.\nAdjusted EPS was $2.33, up 17%. And free cash flow in the quarter was $150 million, up 4% year-over-year. Adjusting for insurance proceeds received last year, free cash flow was up 17% on a rolling 4-quarter basis.\nResearch revenue in the first quarter grew 16% year-over-year as reported and 18% on an FX-neutral basis. Retention was very strong again and new business continued to increase. First quarter research contribution margin was 75%, up 81 basis points versus 2021. Higher-than-normal contribution margins reflect improved operational effectiveness, increased scale and continued temporary avoidance of travel expenses. We have been increasing our head count, which we expect to continue as we move through the year.\nContract value, or CV, was $4.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 16% versus the prior year. This includes our decision to exit the Russian market, which reduced CV by about $14 million.\nQuarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $80 million net of the impact of Russia CV just noted. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter even though there is notable seasonality in this metric. We saw a broad-based CV growth across all of our practices. Our technology practice grew 14%, and all of our other business practices grew at double-digit growth rates with the majority of them growing more than 20% year-over-year. From an industry perspective, retail, manufacturing and services led our CV growth.\nGlobal Technology Sales contract value was $3.3 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 14% versus the prior year. GTS had quarterly NCVI of $46 million in the quarter, again, net of the impact of exiting Russia. While retention for GTS was 107% for the quarter, up about 900 basis points year-over-year. GTS new business was up 6% versus last year, when very strong new business benefited from a post-pandemic bounce, including modestly higher than normal win backs.\nGTS quota-bearing head count was up slightly year-over-year. In the first quarter, we promoted a higher-than-normal level of front-line sellers to sales manager roles. This reflected our strong CV performance and sets us up for future growth. This March was our best hiring month since the start of the pandemic.\nOur net hiring is in line with our plan, turnover is improving, and we remain on track to achieve double-digit QBH growth this year. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement.\nGlobal Business Sales contract value was $899 million at the end of the first quarter, up 24% year-over-year, which is above the high end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. GBS CV increased $34 million from the fourth quarter, while retention for GBS was 115% for the quarter, up about 11 percentage points year-over-year.\nGBS new business was up 18% compared to last year, reflecting robust growth across the full portfolio and against a strong compare. GBS quota-bearing head count increased sequentially and is up 15% year-over-year. We remain on track to grow GBS head count at double-digit rates in 2022.\nAs with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the first quarter was $10 million, in line with our expectations. The first quarter is always a seasonally small quarter, and we pushed several conferences to later in the year to increase the likelihood of running them in person.\nContribution margin in the quarter was negative 28%, given the seasonality in revenue and normal quarterly costs. We held 5 virtual conferences in the quarter. We held Evanta meetings in both virtual and in-person formats.\nAs we look to the rest of the year, we plan to run 24 in-person conferences. We will continue to run a mix of in-person and virtual conferences as a part of our go-forward strategy for the business. I will detail our updated annual outlook for conferences shortly.\nFirst quarter consulting revenues increased by 17% year-over-year to $116 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 20%. Consulting contribution margin was 44% in the first quarter, up almost 5 percentage points versus the prior year with better-than-expected revenue and a mix benefit from strong growth in contract optimization.\nLabor-based revenues were $96 million, up 14% versus Q1 of last year and up 18% on an FX-neutral basis. Backlog at March 31 was $147 million, increasing 30% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with another strong bookings quarter.\nWe revised our backlog methodology to include the expected revenue from the out-years of multiyear agreements. This change contributed about 7 percentage points to the backlog growth rate in the quarter.\nOur Contract Optimization business was up 29% as reported and 30% on an FX-neutral basis versus the prior year. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly valuable. Consolidated cost of services increased 13% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and 14% on an FX-neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher headcount to support our continued strong growth.\nSG&A increased 27% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and 29% on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of a $24 million nonrecurring real estate charge, higher commission expense following strong CV growth in 2021 and increased hiring in sales and G&A functions.\nSG&A without the facilities-related charge would have increased 22% year-over-year and would have been 47% of revenue in the quarter. We expect SG&A expenses to increase over time as our hiring continues.\nEBITDA for the first quarter was $329 million, up 3% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 5% FX neutral. First quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance primarily reflected revenue exceeding our forecasts. Depreciation in the quarter of $23 million was down modestly versus 2021. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $30 million, up $5 million versus the first quarter of 2021 due to an increase in total debt balances.\nThe Q1 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 20.3% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 24% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q1 was $2.33, growth of 17% year-over-year. The weighted average fully diluted share count for the first quarter was 83 million. This is a reduction of more than 6 million shares or about 7% year-over-year.\nWe exited the first quarter with about 82 million fully diluted shares. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $168 million, up 7% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $17 million, up 38% year-over-year as a result of an increase in capitalized software.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was $150 million. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest CapEx needs and upfront client payments. As many of you know, we generate free cash flow well in excess of net income.\nOur conversion from EBITDA is very strong with the differences being cash interest, cash taxes and modest CapEx, partially offset by strong working capital cash inflows. Adjusting for the insurance proceeds we received last year, free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 22% on a rolling 4-quarter basis.\nOn the same basis, free cash flow was 84% of EBITDA and 159% of GAAP net income. At the end of the first quarter, we had $456 million of cash. Our March 31 debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, unused revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A.\nWe repurchased around $450 million of stock during the first quarter and about $630 million through the end of April. Last week, the Board increased the repurchase authorization by $500 million, bringing us to a total of about $1 billion available for open market buybacks. We expect the Board to continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward.\nSince the end of 2020 through the end of this April, we have reduced our shares outstanding by 8 million shares. This is a reduction of 9% from the end of 2020. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time.\nWe are increasing our full year guidance to reflect strong Q1 performance and the return of in-person conferences. We also updated guidance to reflect a stronger U.S. dollar. We now expect an FX impact to our revenue growth rates of about 260 basis points for the full year. This is up from 150 basis points based on rates when we guided in February.\nAs we detailed last quarter, 2021 research performance benefited from several factors, including QBH tenure mix, NCVI phasing within the quarters and the year, record retention rates and strong nonsubscription growth. We continue to assume that those benefits do not persist at the same levels through 2022. The growth compares also get harder as we move through the year.\nWe are taking a balanced approach based on historical trends and patterns, which we've reflected in the updated guidance. We are updating our guidance for the incremental revenue from 24 planned in-person conferences with significantly more visibility into the second quarter. We will continue to update our outlook as we have more visibility.\nFor our local 1-day Evanta events, we expect to run most of them in person while continuing to run some virtually. We expect about 1/3 of our full year conferences revenue in the second quarter this year. Consistent with our commentary last quarter, our base level assumptions for consolidated expenses continue to reflect significant headcount increases during the year to support current and future growth.\nWe have modeled higher labor costs and T&E well above 2021 levels as we've previously indicated. We will also have higher commissions during 2022 due to the very good selling performance we delivered in 2021.\nFinally, we continue to invest in our tech, both client-facing and internal applications as part of our innovation and continuous improvement programs. Our updated guidance for 2022 is as follows: we expect research revenue of at least $4.575 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 14%. The FX-neutral growth is up about 160 basis points from our prior guidance due to strong NCVI performance in the first quarter.\nWe expect Conferences revenue of at least $270 million, which is growth of about 30% FX neutral. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $430 million, which is growth of about 7% FX neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.275 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 14%. The FX-neutral growth is up about 330 basis points from our prior guidance due to strong performance in the first quarter and the shift to in-person conferences.\nWithout the strengthening U.S. dollar since February, our revenue guidance would have been about $155 million higher than previous guidance. We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.135 billion, up $100 million from our prior guidance and an increase in our margin outlook as well. Without the strengthening U.S. dollar since February, our EBITDA guidance would have been about $110 million higher than previous guidance. We now expect 2022 adjusted EPS of at least $7.80.\nFor 2022, we now expect free cash flow of at least $930 million. Our guidance is based on 82 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of April. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site.\nFinally, for the second quarter of 2022, we expect to deliver at least $300 million of EBITDA. We had a strong start to the year with momentum across the business. Contract value continued to accelerate. EPS grew mid-teens, fueled by the significant reduction of shares over the past year. We repurchased roughly $630 million in stock this year through April and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders.\nLooking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV growth over time and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from the normalized 2021 level.\nWe can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call may be recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to David Cohen, Gartner's GVP of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nDavid Cohen\n\nGroup VP of IR, Gartner, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for Gartner's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call and hope you are well.\nWith me on the call today are Gene Hall, Chief Executive Officer; and Craig Safian, Chief Financial Officer.\nThis call will include a discussion of fourth quarter 2021 financial results and Gartner's outlook for 2022 as disclosed in today's earnings release and earnings supplement, both posted to our website, investor.gartner.com.

I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.\nNow I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\n\nEugene A. Hall\n\nCEO & Director, Gartner, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us. 2021 was a great year for Gartner. We performed well across the business. Contract value growth accelerated to 16%. We delivered strong performances in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow, and we repurchased almost $1.7 billion of stock.\nResearch continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Our Research segment provides actionable, objective insight to executives and their teams. Our expert guidance and tools enable faster, smarter decisions and stronger performance on an organization's mission-critical priorities. We serve leaders across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our market opportunity is vast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. And we're delivering more value than ever.\nIn today's world, client priorities include things like transforming to a digital business, protecting cybersecurity, competing in a war for talent, building a diverse, equitable and inclusive organization, whether and how to return to offices, managing supply chain disruptions and more. So these are really hard problems. And our clients rely on us for insights they can't get anywhere else. Research revenue grew 12% for the full year. Total contract value growth was 16%, at the top end of our medium-term outlook.\nWe serve executives and their teams through distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS contract value grew 14% for the full year.\nGlobal Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value grew an impressive 24% for the year.\nEnterprise leaders and their teams benefit from the same Gartner value proposition regardless of role. We've demonstrated this in technology, supply chain, marketing and now across all the other major functions. We're providing value to our clients and prospects and our focus on relentless execution of proven practices will continue.\nOur Conferences business also delivered excellent performance in 2021. Conferences revenue grew 78% for the full year. We continue to provide great value for clients through ongoing innovation of our virtual offerings and we returned to in-person Evanta events. As conditions continue to stabilize, we are operationally prepared to return to in-person conferences where and when we can. We'll continue to leverage our profitable virtual conferences as appropriate.\nGartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 9% for the full year, with strong performances across the business in 2021.\nGartner is a growth company. We have great candidates and continue to invest in our associates in support of future growth. In 2021, we ramped up our recruiting capacity. We're seeing great success in hiring in the challenging labor market. With the rapid acceleration of our business, we have some catch-up hiring and normal growth are in plan for this year. Getting back to our normal growth hiring will position us for long-term, sustained double-digit growth. As we accelerate hiring, we plan to manage sales costs to grow roughly in line with revenue over the long term.\nA core element of our strategy is to continuously innovate and improve so we get better, faster, stronger every year. We're innovating to provide increasing value to clients through improved user experiences, interactive tools and ever greater insights. We're also continuing to improve our internal processes, so our sales, research and service associates can spend even more time working with clients and prospects.\nIn closing, we performed well in 2021. We expect to deliver a strong performance in 2022. We have a compelling value proposition and a large untapped market opportunity. Over the longer term, we're well positioned to drive strong top line growth with modest margin expansion from our normalized 2021 levels. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income. We'll deploy that cash flow to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and to make strategic tuck-in acquisitions.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. Craig?\n\nCraig W. Safian\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Gartner, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gene, and good morning. Fourth quarter results were again excellent, with acceleration in our contract value growth rate and strength in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. As our 2022 guidance highlights, we expect double-digit FX-neutral revenue growth and a margin of 20%, even while increasing our hiring and restoring costs to invest for the future.\nOur financial performance for the full year 2021 included total contract value, up 16%; total revenue growth of 15%; EBITDA growth of 57%; diluted adjusted EPS of $9.22, up 89%; and free cash flow of $1.3 billion, up 53% year-over-year.\nFourth quarter revenue was $1.3 billion, up 17% year-over-year as reported and 18% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69%, up nearly 100 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $307 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 26% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.99, up 88%. And free cash flow in the quarter was $214 million, down 10% against a very tough compare.\nResearch revenue in the fourth quarter grew 17% year-over-year as reported and on an FX-neutral basis. We drove both strong retention and new business in the quarter.\nFourth quarter Research contribution margin was 74%, up almost 180 basis points versus 2020. Higher-than-normal contribution margins reflect improved operational effectiveness, continued avoidance of travel expenses and lower-than-planned headcount.\nFor the full year 2021, Research revenues increased by 14% on a reported basis and 12% FX-neutral. The gross contribution margin for the year was 74%, up more than 190 basis points from the prior year.\nTotal contract value or total CV was $4.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 16% versus the prior year. CV growth outperformed our expectations throughout the year.\nQuarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was a very strong $266 million. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter even though there is notable seasonality in this metric.\nLooking at the quarterly NCVI across 2021, we generated more NCVI earlier in the year than we have historically. We also had a higher-than-normal level of NCVI earlier in the quarters than usual. Both of these timing factors contributed to strong subscription Research revenue in 2021. Total CV growth was led by the manufacturing, services and technology industries.\nLooking at the roles we serve, technology research, which is sold by our GTS team, accelerated to 14% growth. And all of our GBS practices achieved double-digit growth rates, with the majority growing more than 20% year-over-year. Growth in the fourth quarter was led by the supply chain, HR and sales practices.\nGlobal Technology Sales contract value was $3.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 14% versus the prior year. GTS had quarterly NCVI of $205 million in the quarter, while retention for GTS was 106% for the quarter, up almost 790 basis points year-over-year. GTS new business was up 17% versus last year.\nGTS quota-bearing headcount increased by over 80 salespeople sequentially to 3,072. We are seeing the positive effects of our investments to ramp up recruiting capacity combined with moderating attrition. We continue to be successful recruiting new salespeople. We expect to see ongoing expansion of the GTS sales team into 2022 and beyond. For 2022, we are planning to grow GTS headcount at double-digit rates.\nA regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement.\nGlobal Business Sales contract value was $874 million at the end of the fourth quarter, up 24% year-over-year, which is above the high end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%.\nGBS CV increased $61 million from the third quarter. Wallet retention for GBS was 115% for the quarter, up about 14 percentage points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 16% compared to last year, reflecting strong growth across the full portfolio.\nGBS quota-bearing headcount increased sequentially and is up 10% year-over-year. For 2022, we are planning to increase GBS headcount at a double-digit growth rate.\nAs with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement.\nConferences revenue for the fourth quarter was $107 million with reported growth of 15% and 16% FX neutral. Contribution margin in the quarter was 61%. You will recall that in 2020, we ran almost all of our conferences in the fourth quarter, while in 2021, our conferences took place throughout the year. This, plus in-person conference cancellation costs recorded in the quarter resulted in a lower contribution margin year-over-year. We held 13 virtual conferences in the quarter. We held over 140 Evanta meetings, with a mix of both virtual and in-person experiences.\nFor the full year 2021, revenue increased 78%, both on a reported and FX-neutral basis. Gross contribution margin was 62%, up more than 14 percentage points from 2020. During 2021, we incurred costs, which would have allowed us to run in-person destination conferences had pandemic conditions permitted.\nFourth quarter Consulting revenues increased by 26% year-over-year to $118 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 27%. Consulting contribution margin was 39% in the fourth quarter, up more than 12 percentage points versus the prior year quarter, with strong revenue and the mix benefit from contract optimization.\nLabor-based revenues were $87 million, up 19% versus Q4 of last year and up 21% on an FX-neutral basis.\nBacklog at December 31 was $117 million, increasing 13% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis after another strong bookings quarter.\nOur contract optimization business was up 44% on both a reported and FX-neutral basis versus the prior year. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable.\nFull year Consulting revenue was up 11% on a reported basis and 9% on an FX-neutral basis. Gross contribution margin of 38% was up over 700 basis points from 2020.\nConsolidated cost of services increased 14% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, both on a reported and FX-neutral basis. The increase was in part due to higher compensation costs and conference expenses.\nSG&A increased 27% year-over-year in the fourth quarter on a reported and FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of a $50 million nonrecurring real estate charge, higher variable compensation resulting from strong sales and overall business performance, increased hiring across the company and conference cancellation costs. SG&A without the facilities-related charge would have increased 17% year-over-year and would have been 47% of revenue in the quarter. We expect SG&A expenses to increase over time as our hiring across the business continues to ramp. The real estate charge was a result of our decision to reduce our real estate footprint as we shift to a virtual-first workplace strategy. We expect about $20 million of annual benefit beginning in 2022 as a result of the charge. The nonrecurring noncash charge is excluded from EBITDA. We continue to evaluate our real estate portfolio, which may result in additional charges in the future.\nFor the full year, cost of services increased 7% on a reported basis and 6% on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased 6% on a reported basis and 4% on an FX-neutral basis in 2021.\nEBITDA for the fourth quarter was $307 million, up 25% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 26% FX neutral.\nEBITDA For the full year was $1.29 billion, a 57% increase over 2020 on a reported basis and up 54% FX neutral.\nDepreciation in the quarter was about flat versus 2020.\nNet interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $30 million, up $5 million versus the fourth quarter of 2020 due to an increase in total debt balances.\nThe Q4 adjusted tax rate, which we used for the calculation of adjusted net income, was negative 8.3% for the quarter and included a benefit from the intercompany sale of intellectual property. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 24.1% for the quarter.\nThe adjusted tax rate for the full year was 18.1%.\nAdjusted EPS in Q4 was $2.99. This excludes nonrecurring real estate charge.\nFor the full year, adjusted EPS was $9.22.\nEPS growth for the year was 89%.\nThe weighted average fully diluted share count for the fourth quarter was 83.8 million.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $235 million, down 10% compared to last year's quarter, which was very strong. On a year-over-year basis, the timing of cash taxes had a sizable impact.\nCash flow in the quarter includes $17 million of insurance proceeds from 2020 event cancellations.\nCapEx for the quarter was $21 million, down 8% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate investments.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was $214 million. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest CapEx needs and upfront client payments. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 23% on a rolling 4-quarter basis, adjusted for the $167 million of insurance proceeds received during the year. Free cash flow was well in excess of both GAAP and adjusted net income.\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, we had $756 million of cash. Our December 31 debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A.\nWe repurchased around $1.7 billion in stock during 2021, including about $200 million in the fourth quarter. We repurchased over 7 million shares, reducing our net share count by around 7%.\nEarlier this month, the Board again increased our share repurchase authorization. We now have around $1 billion available. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and, combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time.\nBefore providing the 2022 guidance details, I want to discuss our base level assumptions and planning philosophy for 2022.\nFor Research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. Executives and their teams face uncertainty and challenges. They recognize how Gartner can help. We have demand in good times and bad. Our 2021 performance benefited from several factors, including [GBH] tenure mix, NCVI phasing within the quarters and the year, record retention rates and strong nonsubscription growth. We're not assuming all of those persist at the same levels through 2022. We've taken a balanced approach based on historical trends and patterns, which we've reflected in the guidance. If NCVI phasing, retention rates and non-subscription growth performed closer to the way they did in 2021, there would be upside to our guidance. In addition, our teams are focused on driving growth faster than what's embedded in the guidance.\nFor Conferences, we are basing our guidance on being 100% virtual for destination conferences for the full year. Destination conferences involve travel, often international and overnight stays for our clients, which can be affected by pandemic conditions and rules. As with 2021, we are operationally planning to relaunch in-person destination conferences when conditions permit. For our local 1-day Evanta events, we expect to run most of them in person while continuing to run some virtually.\nAs a reminder, we had about $10 million of extra revenue in the first quarter of 2021 related to extending the period for 2020 conference ticket use. In addition, a smaller portion of Research contracts will be attributed to the Conferences segment in 2022. Adjusted for these 2 items, Conferences revenues would be increasing by about 10%.\nFor consulting revenues, we have more visibility into the first half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. Contract optimization is seasonally slower in the first quarter and remains highly variable. Our base level assumptions for consolidated expenses reflect significant headcount increases during the year to support current and future growth. We have modeled higher labor costs and T&E well above 2021 levels, as we've previously indicated. We will also have higher commissions costs during 2022 as a result of the very strong selling performance we delivered in 2021.\nFinally, we continue to invest in our tech, both client-facing and internal applications, as part of our innovation and continuous improvement programs.\nOur guidance for 2022 is as follows: We expect Research revenue of at least $4.55 billion, which is a reported growth of at least 11% and FX-neutral growth of at least 12%.\nWe expect Conferences revenue of at least $200 million, which is down about 7%, but up about 10% adjusted for the items I mentioned earlier.\nWe expect Consulting revenue of at least $425 million, which is up 2% reported and 3% FX neutral.\nThe result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.175 billion, which has reported growth of at least 9% and FX-neutral growth of 11%. Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX headwind of about 150 basis points.\nWe expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.035 billion, which is a decline of about 20%. Based on our revenue and EBITDA guidance, we expect margins of 20%. This is based on Conferences running virtual only and also includes an FX headwind of about 150 basis points.\nWe expect our full year 2022 adjusted net interest expense to be $115 million.\nWe expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2022. As a reminder, the tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.\nOur EPS guidance is based on 83 million weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects repurchases to offset dilution of equity award issuances. We expect 2022 adjusted EPS of at least $6.74.\nFor 2022, we expect free cash flow of at least $850 million.\nIt is also important to note that we have revalued our contract value at current year FX rates, which had a modest overall impact. Our 2021 ending contract value at 2022 FX rates is $3.3 billion for GTS and $865 million for GBS. Details are included in the appendix of the earnings supplement. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site.\nFinally, we expect to deliver at least $285 million of EBITDA in Q1 of 2022.\nWe had a strong year with momentum across the business. Contract value growth accelerated and we had very strong EBITDA, revenue and free cash flow. We have been increasing hiring across the business to drive future growth. We put our capital to work, repurchasing almost $1.7 billion worth of our stock this past year.\nLooking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV growth over time and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from the normalized 2021 level. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time, and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

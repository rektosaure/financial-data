Welcome to Eaton's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nAs a reminder, today's program is being recorded.\nAnd now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Yan Jin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. With me today are Paulo Ruiz, Chief Executive Officer; and Olivier Leonetti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nOur agenda today include opening remarks by Paulo, then we will turn it over to Olivier who will highlight our company's performance in the third quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Paulo's closing commentary.\nThe press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation includes adjusted earnings per share and other non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation is in the appendix.\nA webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay.\nI would like to remind you that our commentary today will include statements related to expected future results of the company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties as described in our earnings release and presentation.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Paulo.\n\nPaulo Ruiz Sternadt\n\nPresident, COO & Director\n\nThanks, Yan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I'm happy to report we delivered solid results. From a demand perspective, we continue to see tremendous strength. On a rolling 12-month basis, our orders accelerated in Electrical Americas, up 7%, from up 2% in Q2. Our Electrical Americas backlog grew 20% year-over-year, hitting an all-time record.\nDemand in Aerospace business remains very strong as well. We posted order growth of 11% on a rolling 12-month basis and backlog expansion of 15% year-over-year. As a result, our book-to-bill for the combined segments was 1.2% on a quarterly basis and 1.1% on a rolling 12-month basis.\nAs we continued to deliver robust growth in data center market, our orders accelerated 70% and our sales were up 40% versus Q3 2024. This strong demand picture gives us confidence in our ability to deliver sustained growth and value to shareholders.\nAmong the Q3 highlights, our adjusted earnings per share were up 8% versus prior year, and our segment margins of 25% hit a quarterly record up 70 basis points year-over-year. We're also reaffirming our 2025 guidance.\nLastly, yesterday, we were excited to announce the agreement to acquire Boyd's thermal business, a global leader in liquid cooling, and I will talk through this in much more detail in the following slides. Olivier and I will dive into Q3 and the full year outlook in just a minute. But first, I'd like to share more details on how we are investing and executing for growth in our operations, starting on Page 4.\nSo earlier this year, I laid out our both new strategy with 3 pillars: lead, invest and execute for growth. All 3 are designed to accelerate our growth and create sustained value for shareholders. These 3 pillars also enable us to capitalize on key megatrends we've discussed for the last few years. Today, we will focus on invest and execute for growth.\nThe Boyd acquisition fits squarely into our strategy to invest for growth. Executing for growth involves elevating operations from good to best-in-class. It includes self-help growing the head and fixing the tail and controlling our destiny independent from end market developments. Today I'll walk you through a few examples of what we are doing and the results we are starting to see from this strategy.\nTurning to Page 5. Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of Boyd, the global leader in liquid cooling technologies for critical markets like data centers, aerospace and defense and industrial. This is a high-growth business playing a high-growth market, and we expect it to generate $1.7 billion in sales next year at an adjusted EBITDA margin of 25%. This level of sales represent significant year-over-year growth, demonstrating how the business is benefiting from strong customer demand, especially in data centers.\nAnd the business itself has a large global presence with over 5,200 employees and 16 manufacturing locations. This global presence is critical to Boyd's success as they are able to support customers almost anywhere in the world as they build out their data center infrastructure.\nOf those 5,200 employees, over 500 are engineers, which is another important part of Boyd's success. These engineers work directly with the customer teams, design the [ next chip ] platforms to understand the thermal characteristics of this next generation. And then this knowledge gets translated into Boyd's own designs.\nBoyd's manufacturing engineering teams are also involved in the design of the cooling systems to ensure the highest reliability and the production can be rapidly scaled to meet customer needs anywhere in the world. This deep application engineering expertise, combined with world-class manufacturing and supply chain, creates a powerful flywheel for Boyd to always stay ahead of the competition in terms of technology, reliability and scalability.\nOn Slide 6, we show some market data. As we talked about previously, the chip used to power AI models and other high-performance compute applications are getting more and more powerful. If you look at the data, before the advent of GenAI, the power used in a typical rack was in the 10 to 15-kilowatt range. At this level, you can cool the chip using air cooling, which is a pretty mature technology and has been around for many years.\nNow the introduction of more and more powerful AI chips, the power in each one of those racks is just skyrocketing. Take NVIDIA for example. Its GB 200 chip unveiled in 2024 uses 120-kilowatt per rack. Fast forward a year to 2025 and NVIDIA's GB 300 chip now uses 180 kilowatts per rack. And it's only increasing from there. NVIDIA's Rubin chip is expected to use 600 kilowatts per rack, and its Feynman chip 1,000 kilowatts per rack.\nNow in addition to these higher power chips requiring more and more electrical equipment, which is a great thing for our business, once you get above roughly 50 kilowatts per rack, traditional air cooling is replaced by liquid cooling. The physics of these power levels require liquid cooling the chip, otherwise performance is degraded, chips don't last as long or the chips might not work at all. So all the demand that you are seeing for GenAI chips will drive commensurate demand for liquid cooling solutions to cool those chips. The growth goes hand in hand.\nMarket estimates vary, but we believe that the global liquid cooling market will grow around 35% annually through 2028: just tremendous growth that is supported by long-term underlying factors. And to go back to my point from the prior slide, Boyd is the global leader in liquid cooling, which is why we are so excited about this business.\nWith the acquisition of Boyd, Eaton's data center portfolio will now be even bigger than before, shown in more detail on Page 7. We can now provide solutions for all major power and cooling systems from the chip to the grid. This includes all of our traditional power distribution, power quality and infrastructure products in the data center gray space. And here you can see our other 2 recent acquisitions of Fiber Bond, modular parts, and Resilient Power, medium-voltage substation transformers.\nAnd in the data center white space, we can provide everything from power distribution units, remote power panels and busway to racks, enclosures, cable tray and, in 2026, liquid cooling. And of course, I need to mention our software and services capabilities, which we historically have been focused on the gray space and the white space power distribution and power quality equipment only, and now we added the same service capabilities for liquid cooling, which we view as a really attractive avenue for growth. Truly an impressive portfolio of solutions for data centers.\nMoving to Page 8. I already talked about how this acquisition bolsters our data center portfolio. And I also want to mention how it aligns with how our customers are thinking about the future data center architectures. Starting from the chip out, there are really 5 main technology blocks that work outwards toward the utility grid. There is a thermal management system to handle heat loads, primarily from the chip, but also from other heat-generating assets like storage devices and power supplies. There is white space power distribution and infrastructure equipment to get the power to the racks. There is a great equipment to distribute, transform and condition medium-voltage AC power down to low-voltage AC and then low-voltage DC power. There is Eaton assets to connect the data center to the grid. And finally, there is software and services to monitor and manage all these power and IT assets.\nSo this acquisition of Boyd, Eaton now plays a leading position in each one of those technology blocks. One reason this is important is that we can now offer our data center customers a greater share of wallet. This is important as they seek to consolidate their supply base among a smaller set of stronger, more globally capable players.\nAnd the other important reason is that customers are increasingly looking to integrate these various systems to drive increased technical performance and more rapid deployments. This is especially true in data center white space, which is exactly where Boyd plays.\nSo overall, a really exciting acquisition for us and one that we know will allow us to continue supporting our customers today and into the future.\nNow let's pivot to execute for growth, another exciting important pillar of our strategy. So on Slide 9, these are key leading indicators in Electrical Americas. This segment is clearly the head of our portfolio, and we have an execution plan to grow it even stronger and with increased margins. Our lead indicators on this page are proof points of the generational growth opportunity ahead of us. They also show that our team is executing well to capture this growth. The visibility is unprecedented. So let me walk you through what we are seeing.\nOver the last 2 years, the mega-project announcements have increased a staggering 185%. In the same time frame, our negotiations pipeline have increased 35%, following into rolling 12-month orders up 23% on a 2-year stack and a book-to-bill of 1.1. For data centers specifically, the 2-year stack of rolling 12-month orders are up more than 100% and the data center book-to-bill is 1.7.\nElectrical Americas backlog is up 51% over the last 2 years, of which data center backlog extends over 2 years. On a 2-year stack, Electrical Americas has grown 23% organically, and we think that data centers have grown 104%.\nSo the demand indicators clearly support why we are so bullish for this business. Our position of strength in the Americas keeps resonating across the market. We are proud to have the broadest portfolio electrical products in the market, to cultivate strong and trustworthy relationships and to be the partner of choice to codesign the technologies of the future together with our key customers.\nSlide 10 showcases Electrical Global organic growth journey. Last year we grew 4%; this year, approximately 7%. We talked about the focus to increase Electrical Global margins, while we continue to make strong progress. Our 2025 guidance reflects year-over-year margin expansion of 100 basis points.\nAnd let's talk about the growth rates in Electrical Global now. Our Electrical Global organic growth is accelerating up to about 7% in our 2025 guidance for 4% last year. Our 2030 target of 6% to 9% growth for the portfolio assumes about a middle single-digit growth over the period, and we are off to a great start.\nWe are seeing order acceleration, building strong backlog and positioned to win for years to come. We've talked about being in the right markets, targeting fast-growing markets supported by secular megatrends. For example, the data center growth is impacting our business globally as governments and enterprises are prioritizing data localization and resiliency, and we are partnering with our hyperscaler customers in various parts of the world.\nAnd by the way, all these data centers need power, and we are a key beneficiary of our global utility space as well. And we have a broad portfolio with breadth and capabilities leveraged across end markets. All this enable us to win and position us to gain market share on a global front.\nThe strategy is clear, and as you'll hear from Olivier soon, we are booking sizable orders already, which is momentum to position us for strong growth for years to come.\nNow I will pass to Olivier to talk through the financials.\n\nOlivier C. Leonetti\n\nCFO, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Paulo. I'll start by providing a brief summary of Q3 results. Organic growth for the quarter was 7%, driven by strength in Aerospace, Electrical Americas and Electrical Global, partially offset by weakness in short-cycle markets including Vehicle and eMobility. Otherwise, organic growth would have been almost 10%. We generated a quarterly revenue of $7 billion and expanded margins by 70 basis points to 25%. Adjusted EPS of $3.07 increased by 8%, which is at the high end of our guidance range.\nNow let's move to the segment details. On Slide 12, we highlight the Electrical Americas segment. The business continues to execute at a high level and delivered another record quarter on operating profit and Q3 record margins. Organic sales growth of 9% was driven primarily by strength in data centers, up about 40%. Operating margin of 30.3% was up 20 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher sales and increased operational efficiencies.\nOrders accelerated to up 7% on a trailing 12-month basis, from up 2%. This represents a strong acceleration with total quarterly orders up sequentially by more than 11%. We are confident that we will have an all-time record level of orders booked in 2025.\nBook-to-bill remained at 1.1%, and our backlog grew by $2 billion or 20% to $12 billion, providing strong visibility for our organic growth outlook.\nNow I'll summarize the results of our Electrical Global segment. Total growth of 10% included organic growth of 8%, for a very strong performance for the quarter. We have strength in data center, residential, commercial and institutional and machine OEM. Regionally, we saw high single-digit growth across all 3 regions. Operating margin of 19.1% was up 40 basis points over prior year, driven primarily by sales growth, partially offset by higher inflation.\nOrders were up 2% on a rolling 12-month basis, with mid-single-digit growth in APAC and EMEA. EMEA orders increased by more than 30%, driven by data center orders, including sizable orders in the Middle East and a large order with a hyperscaler in Scandinavia. This represents strong acceleration with quarterly orders up sequentially 15%. Backlog increased 7% from prior year, while book-to-bill remained above 1 on a rolling 12 months basis.\nBefore moving to our industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the combined Electrical segment's performance. For Q3, we posted organic growth of 9% and segment margin of 26.6%, which was up 40 basis points over prior year. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders accelerated to up 5% and our book-to-bill ratio for our Electrical sector increased to 1.1. This represents continued acceleration with quarterly orders up sequentially by [ 30% ]. We are very excited to capture growth from the robust demand with strong margins in our overall Electrical business.\nPage 14 highlights our Aerospace segment. Organic sales growth of 13% remain at the high end and resulted in Q3 record sales, with broad-based strength across all markets and particular strength in defense aftermarket. Operating margin expanded by 150 basis points to 25.9%, driven primarily by sales growth.\nOn a rolling 12-month basis, orders increased 11%, driven by defense OEM and aftermarket up 16% and 14%, respectively. On a 2-year stack basis, trailing 12 months orders are up 70%. This demonstrates strong momentum with quarterly orders increasing over 9% sequentially. Our book-to-bill for our Aerospace segment remains strong at 1.1 on a rolling 12-month basis, resulting in a backlog increase of 15% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Overall, Aerospace posted a solid Q3 and remains well positioned going forward.\nMoving to our Vehicle segment on Page 15. In the quarter, the business declined by 9% on an organic basis, primarily driven by weaknesses in the North America truck and light vehicle markets. Margins are down 160 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by lower sales and higher inflation.\nOn Page 16, we show results for our eMobility business. Revenue decreased 90% from 20% lower organic, partially offset by 1% favorable FX. Operating loss was $9 million in the quarter.\nNow I'll pass it back to Paulo to go over the remainder of the presentation.\n\nPaulo Ruiz Sternadt\n\nPresident, COO & Director\n\nThanks, Olivier. Here on Page 17 is our updated guidance for the year for organic growth and operating margins. We are reaffirming our growth guidance range of 8.5% to 9.5%. We'll likely end up at the low end of this range in total, primarily due to market dynamics in our Vehicle and eMobility businesses. We are also reaffirming our margin guidance of 24.1% to 24.5% with minor revisions between Aerospace and eMobility.\nMoving to Page 18, here's the outlook for Q4 and our updated guidance for the year. For the upcoming quarter, we see EPS of $3.23 to $3.43, representing 18% year-over-year growth. We see organic growth at 10% to 12%, which is a reacceleration of growth for the company. And for the year, we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance at $11.97 to $12.17, which includes our near-term investments to position us for sustained long-term growth. And this represents 12% growth in earnings per share at the midpoint, which I promised you in March.\nShifting our perspective ahead to 2026 on Page 19, we provide our view of end market growth assumptions for the year. All in, this equates to about 7% market growth rate and [ with some ] outgrowth is consistent with our 2030 organic growth CAGR of 6% to 9%. I won't go line by line here, but this chart shows that we anticipate growth across our end markets with attractive growth for over 70% of our portfolio. In particular, the data center, distributed IT and electrical vehicle markets are expected to be the strongest, up double digits. We also expect solid growth in the utility end market along with both commercial aerospace and defense.\nIn summary, we continue to see many paths to our sustained growth, and we are confident in our end market positioning to deliver another differentiated year in 2026 of growth and strong shareholder returns.\nI will close with a quick summary on Page 20. We had a strong quarter, Q3 record revenue and an all-time record on segment profit and margins. We are seeing unprecedented demand reflected in continued order acceleration and growing backlogs. Our strategy to lead, invest and execute for growth is positioning us to capture generational demand and deliver lasting value for our shareholders.\nWe look forward to welcoming and integrating Boyd into our business and satisfying our customers with a complete solution offering. Bottom line, we have confidence in our guidance to close out the remainder of the year, and we are well positioned as we go into 2026 and beyond. And we remain confident that our brightest days are yet to come.\nAnd with that, we are happy to take your questions.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Paulo. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instruction."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.\nAnd now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Yan Jin, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's second quarter 2025 earnings call. With me today are Paulo Ruis, Chief Executive Officer; and Olivier Leonetti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Paulo. Then he will turn it over to Oliver, who will highlight the company's performance in the second quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of follows closing commentary.\nThe press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation, including adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation is in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and it will be available for replay.\nI would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Paulo.\n\nPaulo Ruiz Sternadt\n\nPresident, COO & Director\n\nThanks, Yan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I'm really pleased with the first half of the year. Our team delivered a strong set of results. Among the Q2 highlights, our adjusted earnings per share were up 8% versus Q2 2024. Our segment margins hit a Q2 record, up 20 basis points versus 2024.\nOrganic growth for the quarter was 8%, driven by growth in the Electrical Americas, Aerospace and Electrical Global. On a rolling 12-month basis, our orders accelerated in Electrical Americas, now up 2% from down 4% last quarter. Our Electrical Americas backlog grew 17% year-over-year, hitting a new all-time record.\nDemand in our Aerospace business remains very strong. We had order growth of 10% on a rolling 12 months basis and a backlog expansion of 16% year-over-year. As a result, our book-to-bill for the combined segments increased to 1.1.\nAnd we continue to deliver robust growth in the data center market as well. Our orders jumped approximately 55% and our sales were 50% up versus Q2 2024.\nA final highlight. We are raising 2025 guidance for organic growth and adjusted EPS at the midpoint. Olivier and I will dive into Q2 and the full year outlook in just a minute. But first, let's go to Page 4 to have a conversation about our investments to grow the company.\nSo on Page 4, I told you at our investor conference in March, we laid our bold new strategy. It's anchored by 3 pillars: lead, invest and execute for growth. All 3 are designed to accelerate our growth and create sustained value for our shareholders. Those 3 pillars also align very well with the key mega-trends we've discussed for the last few years with you.\nToday, we will focus on the middle pillar: invest for growth. We executed strategic investments this quarter with key acquisitions, breakthrough technologies and transformative partnerships. This momentum is unlocking growth opportunities across our portfolio. So we are accelerating our focus on high-growth and high-margin markets to maximize the opportunities ahead.\nAnd let's start with an acquisition on Page 5. We signed an agreement in June to acquire Ultra PCS. We are very excited about this deal, and we expect it to close in the first half of 2026. This acquisition strengthens our position in the fast-growing next-generation aerospace and defense markets. It ties in very well with our 2020 acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems. Ultra PCS expands our exposure to both increasing global defense, expanding, and expanding European defense market. We anticipate cost and sales synergies, particularly from growing aftermarket services, and securing new program opportunities. We expect this business to post high single digits through low teens growth over the next several years with immediate margin accretion to our Aerospace segment.\nNow moving to Slide 6. We highlight our most recent acquisition, Resilient Power Systems. This is a great example of how Eaton is investing through cutting-edge innovation. This is a game changer for our data center customers and other DC power applications.\nResilient makes solid-state transformer technology to replace traditional copper windings. It is a critical building block in the future high-power AI center designs as well as EV charging and battery storage. Our customers see this capability as critical and very critical competitive advantage for us. It will accelerate and simplify the construction of AI data centers.\nBut we're also investing for growth through strategic partnerships. You see 3 examples here on Page 7: NVIDIA, Siemens Energy and ChargePoint.\nWe've partnered with NVIDIA to transform the infrastructure of data centers, NVIDIA understands the design is shipped out and they recognize we are a partner they need. We bring incredible expertise and capabilities in power distribution architecture, including higher-voltage DC power. So we are developing power management solutions for their high-density GPUs and solving other problems in the rack.\nWe've also joined forces with Siemens Energy. This partnership unlocks opportunities where utilities can't provide enough power to data center operators. In this case, Siemens handles the on-site power generation and Eaton takes care of the modular power distribution. Together, we deliver flexible distributed power with no dependency on the grid, which means shorter project time lines and greater operational flexibility to our customers.\nFinally, we formed a partnership with ChargePoint, a leading EV charging provider. And jointly, we are developing global integrated EV charging, power distribution and software solutions. It enables vehicle electrification at scale.\nBroadly speaking, if I think about the portfolio, I hope you agree that we made strong progress in a short period of time. So we demonstrate a strong commitment and resolve to execute on our portfolio strategy. We'll continue to double down, investing in high-growth and high-margin businesses. And I'm proud of my team that delivered on our short-term commitments and, at the same time, took decisive steps in our portfolio.\nNow I will turn it over to Olivier, who will walk us through our financial performance. Olivier?\n\nOlivier C. Leonetti\n\nCFO, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThanks, Paulo. I'll start by providing a brief summary of our Q2 results. We posted 8% organic sales growth, at the high end of our guidance range, driven by broad strength in many of our end markets. We generated record quarterly revenue of $7 billion and expanded margins by 20 basis points to 23.9%. Adjusted EPS of $2.95 increased by 8%, which is at the high end of our guidance range.\nNow let's move to the segment details. On Slide 8, we highlight the Electrical Americas segment. The business continues to execute at a high level and delivered another record quarter. Organic sales growth of 12% was driven primarily by strength in data centers, up about 50%, along with strength in commercial and institutional end markets. This represents the 11th consecutive quarter with 25 or more growth on a 2-year stack basis.\nOperating margin of 29.5% was down 40 basis points versus prior year due to dilution from offsetting tariffs cost on a dollar basis and higher cost to support growth initiatives.\nOrders accelerated to up 2% on a trailing 12-month basis, from down 4%, with particular strength in the data centers, up about 55% in the quarter. This represents a strong acceleration with quarterly orders up sequentially by more than 20%.\nWithin the data center space, I highlight that there was particular strength for multi-tenant data center customers, which is consistent with the strategy we communicated earlier this year. Excluding the lumpiness from a large multiyear data center order in Q1 2024, orders for the segment were up 11%, accelerating from 4% last quarter on a rolling 12 months adjusted basis. Data center orders were up 23% on the same basis.\nEven with record sales, book-to-bill increased to 1.1 with 17% growth in our large $11.4 billion backlog, providing strong visibility for our organic growth in 2025 and beyond.\nOur major project negotiations pipeline in Q2 was up 31% versus prior year, remaining at a high level, up approximately 60% since Q2 2023. Mega projects remain strong with 65 project announcements at a value of $333 billion on a [indiscernible] basis. The U.S. economy mega project backlog is approaching $2.4 billion, up 31% year-over-year. Through Q2, about 50% of the projects have started, which still provides a multiyear runway.\nThe acquisition of Fibrebond closed on April 1, and the business is off a great start in our portfolio, exceeding our initial expectations for the quarter.\nNow I will summarize the results for our Electrical Global segment. Total growth of 9% included organic growth of 7% and 2 points FX tailwind. We have strength in data center and machine OEM end markets. We saw continued strength in APAC, posting double-digit organic growth, and ongoing recovery in EMEA, up mid-single digits organically.\nOperating margin of 20.1% was up 110 basis points over prior year, driven primarily by sales growth and operating efficiencies. Orders were down 1% on a rolling 12-month basis with high single-digit growth in APAC. Backlog increased 1% from prior year, while book-to-bill remain at 1 on a rolling 12 months basis.\nBefore to move to our industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the combined Electrical segment's performance. For Q2, we posted organic growth of 10% and segment margin of 26.3%, which was up 30 basis points over prior year. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 1% and our book-to-bill ratio for our Electrical sector remains above 1.\nOverall, we are very pleased with the Electrical business' execution in the first half of the year and remain confident in our position for growth going forward.\nPage 11 highlights our Aerospace segment. Organic sales growth of 11% remained at a high level and resulted in all-time record sets. We had growth in all end markets and particular strength in defense and commercial aftermarket. Operating margin expanded by 70 basis points to 22.2%, driven primarily by sales growth.\nOn a rolling 12-month basis, orders increased 10% with growth in all segments and particular strength in defense OEM, up 25%. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for our Aerospace segment remained strong at 1.1%, resulting in a backlog increase of 16% year-over-year and 3% sequentially.\nOverall, Aerospace posted a solid first half, remains well positioned going forward, and we are very pleased to have signed the agreement to acquire Ultra PCS, as Paulo described.\nMoving to our Vehicle segment on Page 12. In the quarter, the business declined by 8% on a total and organic basis, primarily driven by weaknesses in the North America truck market. Despite top line weaknesses, the team managed to deliver solid margins of 17%, up from 15.5% in Q1.\nOn Page 13, we show results for our eMobility business. Revenue decreased 4% from 7% lower organic, partially offset by 3% favorable FX. Operating loss was $10 million.\nNow I will pass it back to Paulo to go over our market assumptions and guidance.\n\nPaulo Ruiz Sternadt\n\nPresident, COO & Director\n\nThanks, Olivier. Strong results in Q2, and thanks for helping me shaping the portfolio.\nMoving on the assumptions for the year. Here on Page 14 is our view of Eaton's end market growth. We see no material change in our end markets from the last quarter. Most of the end markets are growing fast. The up arrows represent 80% of our revenue, over 80% of our revenue. So we have many paths to growth and we believe it's sustainable. And we see positive development in data centers and defense aerospace versus past quarter, while the other parts that aren't growing like residential, internal combustion engine, light vehicles and commercial vehicles are the smallest part of the company. We are confident in our end market positioning to deliver differentiated growth this year.\nHere on Page 15 is our updated guidance for the year for organic growth and operating margins. Big picture, we are raising our guidance for the year on both. So let's start in the middle column: organic growth. We are increasing our guidance here by 50 basis points to a range of 8.5% to 9.5%. By segment, we have raised Electrical Americas by 50 basis points; Electrical Global by 100 basis points; and Aerospace by 200 basis points. Meanwhile, the growth of Vehicle and eMobility are weaker than prior expectations from challenging market conditions, as you know.\nNow for margin guidance. As you see, our guidance is 24.1% to 24.5%, so it also increased our guidance range by 10 basis points. By segment, we have raised our expectations for both Electrical Americas and Vehicle by 20 basis points, but it's partially offset by lower margins in the eMobility business.\nMoving to Page 16. Here is our outlook for Q3 and our updated guidance for the year. For the upcoming quarter, we see EPS of $3.01 to $3.07, and we see organic growth between 8% and 9%. And the segment operating margins between 24.1% to 24.5%.\nFor the year, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $11.97 to $12.70. This represents 12% growth in earnings per share at the midpoint.\nI will close with a quick summary on Page 17. We had a great quarter.\nRecord revenue, segment profit and margins. We see order acceleration, increase in negotiation pipeline and strong growth in our backlog. This gave us the confidence and earnings guidance for 2025. And we invest in our future growth as well as we are uniquely positioned as a growth company with a broad portfolio.\nBottom line, we are delivering our financial commitments in 2025, and we are well positioned to deliver on our ambitious 2030 growth plan. We believe our best years are ahead of us.\nAnd with that, we are happy to take your questions now.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Paulo. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn it over to our operator to give you guys the instruction."

Welcome to Eaton's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's conference is being recorded.\nI will now hand the conference over to your speaker host, Yan Jin, senior Vice President of Investor Rations. Please go ahead.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, thank you all for joining us for Eaton's Fourth Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; Paulo Ruiz, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Olivier Leonetti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes the opening remarks by Paulo. Then he will turn it over to Olivier, who will highlight the company's performance in the first quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of the polls closing commentary. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation, including adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures. The recount sales in the appendix, a webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our commentary today will include statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projection due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Paulo.\n\nPaulo Ruiz Sternadt\n\nPresident, COO & Director\n\nThanks, Jin. Before we begin, I just want to take a minute to acknowledge Craig Arnold as you prepare to retire at the end of this month, for his incredible leadership over the past 25 years at Eaton, but especially during the 9 years as Chairman and CEO. He's focused on fostering a values-based culture strong attention to [ adtax ] and commitment to high standards have laid a very strong foundation for our growth. And the actions he's taken to transform our portfolio have positioned us for faster growth higher margins and better earnings consistency. So under Craig's strategic guidance, we have consistently delivered strong shareholder returns with our stock value rising from $61.65 on June 1, 2016, to $294.37 as per April 30, 2025. So thank you, Craig, for our strong leadership and the legacy you leave us with. I'm really excited and energized to be leading Eaton as such an electrifying time.\nOn that note, let's get into the results. We will start with some highlights on the quarter in which we've delivered another strong set of results to start the year. We generated Q1 record adjusted EPS of $2.72, up 13% from the prior year. Organic growth accelerated to 9% from 6% in the prior quarter with particular strength in Electrical Americas, aerospace and Electrical Global. And we also delivered Q1 record segment margins of 23.9% and which was in line with our guidance and expectations. Meanwhile, market activity remained strong and orders remained at a very high dollar value. Total company orders increased 3% versus prior quarter. And as a result, total Eaton book-to-bill ratio at [ 1.1 ] with backlog growth year-over-year and sequentially.\nWith a strong start of the year robust backlog and a strong secular trends, we are set up to deliver another year of differentiating results while we navigate through an increasingly dynamic environment. While I will go into the details on the full year outlook, at the high level, we are raising our expectations for organic growth and reaffirming our adjusted EPS, cash flow and share repurchases. Turning to Page 4 now.\nWe present this chart at our annual investor conference in March. It provides an overview of the 8 end markets we play in and the mega trends driving a generational growth opportunity for us. Few companies have the opportunity that's in front of us right now. with multiple paths to our growth. And we remain very confident in the long-term market growth prospects for our end markets. Now turning to Slide 5.\nAllow me to quickly touch on [ Fiber Bond ], an acquisition we announced at the annual investor conference and which we closed on April 1 this year. Fiber Bond is the right asset at the right time Data center players are increasingly focused on capital efficiency and deployment speed to improve their competitiveness. Fiber Bond's and innovative and customer-focused businesses positions Eaton as one-stop shop to rapidly deploy power where it's needed. By deploying outdoor modular powering closures, data center customers can also expand their IT area and generate more revenue per square foot inside the data center. In data center markets, we continue to see construction starts and put in place and showing strong growth. U.S. data center construction backlog now stands at 9 years based on the 2024 build rates, up from the 7 years of backlog we spoke about last quarter. And we are also seeing strong activity in EMEA, in APAC as well as regional and regulatory policies drive data center built out globally.\nOkay. And now I'll turn over to Olivier for the financial results.\n\nOlivier C. Leonetti\n\nCFO, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThanks, Paulo. I'll start by providing a brief summary of Q1 results. We posted 9% organic sales, well above our guidance range driven by broad strength in many of our end markets. We generated record quarterly revenue of $6.4 billion and expanded margin of 80 basis points to 23.9%. Adjusted EPS of $2.72 increased 13% from a strong start to the year above the midpoint of our guidance. Now let's move to the segment details.\nOn Slide 7, we highlight the Electrical Americas segment. Once again, the business executed at a high level and delivered another record quarter. Organic sales growth accelerated to 13%, driven primarily by strength in data center and utility end markets. Operating margin of 30% was up 80 basis points versus the prior year, benefiting primarily from higher sales. Orders from a dollar perspective remained at a high level. As expected, orders versus prior year were down 4% on a holding 12-month basis to a tough comp from 1 large multiyear percent order in Q1 2024. Excluding this lumpiness, orders for the segment were up 4% on a rolling 12-month basis, and data center orders were up 11% on the same basis. Book-to-bill remains above [ 1 ] with 6% growth in our large $10.1 billion backlog, providing strong visibility for our organic growth in 2025 and beyond. Our major project negotiations pipeline in Q1 was up 18% versus the prior quarter, remaining at a high level, up 168% since Q1 2023.\nAs Paulo discussed, we closed the acquisition of Fiber Bond on April 1. The next page summarizes the results of our Electrical Global segment. Organic growth accelerated from 5.5% last quarter to 9% this quarter, partially offset by 2% FX headwind, with strength in data center, machine OEM and Utilities end markets. We saw continued strength in APAC and a recovery in EMEA with both regions posting double-digit organic growth. Operating margin of 18.6% was up 30 basis points over prior year, driven primarily by sales growth and operating efficiencies. Orders were flat on a rolling 12-month basis with double-digit order growth [indiscernible]\nOn a sequential basis, we saw an inflection in our quarterly orders up mid-teens in EMEA and GIS up double digits and APAC up more than 30%. Backlog increased 5% over prior year and 6% sequentially, while book-to-bill remained strong above [ 1 ] on a rolling 12-month basis. Before moving to our industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the combined electrical segments. For Q1, we posted organic growth of 11% and segment margin of 26.1%, which was up 80 basis points over prior year. On a holding 12-month basis, orders were down 2%, and our book-to-bill ratio for electrical sector remains above [ 1 ]. We remain confident in our positioning for continued growth with strong margins in our overall electrical business.\nPage 9 highlights our aerospace segment. Organic growth accelerated to 13%, resulting in all-time record sales. We had growth in all end markets and particular strength in military aftermarket commercial aftermarket and military OEM. Operating margin was strong at 23.1%. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders increased 14%, up 10% from the prior quarter with particular strength in military OEM and commercial aftermarket. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for our Aerospace segment remains strong at 1.1 and resulted in a backlog increase of 16% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. We are very encouraged by the strong results from the Aerospace team this quarter.\nMoving to our vehicle segment on Page 10. In the quarter, revenue was down 15%, including an 11% organic decline primarily driven by weakness in both commercial and ICE light motor vehicle markets in North America and 4% unfavorable effects. Despite top line weakness, the team managed to deliver strong margins of 15.5% with a decremental of less than 20%. On Page 11, we show results of our e-mobility business. Revenue increased 2% to reach with 3% organic, partially offset by 1% unfavorable effect. Operating margins were flat to prior year, which continues to include investments for our growth programs. We are seeing an expanding opportunity pipeline as customers are redesigning vehicles for lower cost and improved efficiencies.\nNow I will pass it back to Paulo to go over our market assumptions and guidance.\n\nPaulo Ruiz Sternadt\n\nPresident, COO & Director\n\nThanks, Olivier. Before we walk through the details of our end market assumptions and guide I just want to address the uncertainties arising from the dynamic global trade environment. We will fully compensate for the tariff impact through the actions described on this chart. We have maintained a localized sourcing and manufacturing strategy globally for a long time. And as you know, we've recently announced large investments to increase our manufacturing presence in the U.S. Those decisions are helping us being even more resilient to the trading impacts the world is experiencing. It's also important to highlight that following COVID, we have spent the last couple of years introducing additional flexibility resiliency and digital tools into our supply chains.\nMany of those actions noted on this slide are aligned to our long-term strategy and it will take time to fully be implemented as the global landscape continues to evolve. But that's the way we run the company today. In the meantime, we have also implemented our proven playbook to control cost and limit discretionary spending. And we have and will continue to take the necessary commercial actions to offset the impact of tariffs. In dynamic markets like this, we rely on a strong Eaton culture and value of our strategic relationships with customers and suppliers so we can minimize disruption. Now we are shifting our attention to 2025 on Page 13.\nWe have our latest view on the end market growth expectations. We continue to see growth across most of our end markets with a few adjustments to our assumptions, which are highlighted on the slide. In aggregate, broad market growth is similar to the view we shared last quarter, and we are confident in our ability to outgrow the market as we outlined in our increased growth guidance. On the plus side, we are raising the defense aerospace to solid growth based on momentum we are seeing with the increased government spending. However, we now expect slightly lower growth in electric vehicles with solid growth instead of strong double-digit growth. And we have also lowered our forecast for internal combustion engine light vehicles from slight growth to a slight decline. While we acknowledge the current economic uncertainties, we remain confident the portfolio of businesses and end markets we enable Eaton to continue to deliver differentiated growth.\nMoving now to Page 14, we have our updated guidance for 2025 and Q2. One of the things we pride ourselves on here at Eaton is our ability to plan for and navigate through headwinds. Our healthy and diverse end markets, combined with our large backlog continue to provide premium visibility to support our businesses. Our teams always target high internal plans, as you know, providing greater line of sight to additional opportunities to hedge against potential pockets of weaker growth. We are raising the 2025 organic growth outlook by 50 basis points to a range of 7.5% to 9.5%. We are reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance.\nFor 2025, we reconfirm our adjusted EPS range of $11.80 to $12.20. The $12 midpoint represents 11% growth in adjusted EPS over the prior year. We are also reaffirming our cash flow and share repurchase expectations for the year and we provided guidance for Q2 on this page. This reflects the net impact of the announced tariffs and assumes the current 90-day pause on rercypical tariffs will persist through the end of the year. On the next page, we have the balance of our guidance for organic growth and operating margin. The high organic growth outlook includes increasing the Electric Americas guidance by 150 basis points to a range of 12% to 14% growth.\nMeanwhile, we are decreasing vehicle growth by 350 basis points to a range of minus 5.5% to minus 3.5%, which reflects the weaknesses in the light motor vehicles. For segment margins, our guidance range of 24% to 24.4% is 40 basis points lower than the prior guide. Our guidance reflects the impact to margins from our commercial actions offsetting the impact of tariffs on a dollar-for-dollar basis. As such, we are lowering the 2025 outlook for electrical Americas by 80 basis points and in vehicle by 200 basis points.\nAnd I will close with a quick summary on Page 16. We are in the right markets and the identified megatrends are creating some of the biggest opportunities we have seen in our lifetime. The growth opportunities are everywhere. We had a very strong start of the year, but there's a lot for us to go do. We've discussed before, high standards are deeply instilled in our culture, and we remain focused on delivering our commitments, and we are prepared to weather any uncertainty ahead.\nSo with that, I will open up for your questions.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks Paulo. For the Q&A today, guys, please leave me to your opportunity to just 1 question and then a follow-up. Thanks in advance for your cooperation. With that, I will turn it over to operator to give you guys an instruction."

Welcome to the Eaton Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Yan Jin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nHey, good morning. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; Paulo Ruiz, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Olivier Leonetti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nOur agenda today includes the opening remarks by Craig. Then he will turn it over to Olivier, who will highlight our company's performance in the fourth quarter. We will then it turn over to Paulo, who will provide the guidance for Q1 and the full year 2025. As we have done on our past calls, we're taking questions at the end of our close commentary.\nThe press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation, including the adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures, they are reconciled in the appendix.\nA webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our commentary today will include the statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projection due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Craig.\n\nCraig Arnold\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nOkay. Thanks, Yan. And we're pleased to close out the year with another strong quarterly results. I'm especially proud of how our team executed in the quarter. As you know, we have to overcome the impact of the strikes in the aerospace industry and the lingering impact of the hurricane, which [indiscernible] our Electrical Americas business.\nFor the quarter, we generated a Q4 record for adjusted EPS of $2.83, up 11% from prior year. We also delivered record segment margins of 24.7%, up 190 basis points than last year and above the high end of our guidance. And we continue to see strong market activity.\nOn a rolling 12-month basis, Electrical orders were up 12% led by Electrical Americas with orders up 16%, and orders were up 10% in Aerospace. This led to another quarter of growing and record backlogs with once again outstanding results in Electrical Americas, up 29% and in Aerospace, up 16% with book-to-bill ratios above 1 in both businesses.\nAs you can see from the chart, we're set for another strong year in 2025. Paulo will walk you through our guidance, but we do expect another year of healthy end markets, strong organic growth, margin expansion, improving free cash flow and double-digit increases in adjusted EPS.\nTurning to Page 4. We're once again providing an overview of megatrends and how they're driving growth in our end markets. You're very familiar with this chart by now, but we did want to provide an overview of how these markets performed in 2024 versus our expectations.\nThis is especially relevant in the context of our outlook for 2025 that Paulo will provide later today and at our investor meeting in March. In Electrical, our end markets performed better than expectations due to strength in data centers and in the Americas market. Strong growth in these 2 areas more than offset some unplanned weakness in residential and OEM markets.\nIn Aerospace, markets grew nicely and in line with plan, and this was despite the Boeing strike. And our vehicle market was a bit of a mixed bag with better-than-planned performance in commercial vehicles, offsetting weakness in the light vehicle market, which includes eMobility.\nOverall, we continue to see megatrends note here as important drivers of secular growth in our markets and why you should expect Eaton to post attractive growth for years to come. And this secular growth is perhaps most evidenced by the megatrend chart that you see on Slide 5 in the presentation.\nAs a reminder, [indiscernible] project is a project with an announced value of $1 billion or more, and our reference point begins in January of 2021. As you know, we've reported this data for a few quarters now, and our conclusion hasn't changed.\nEach quarter, we're seeing an increasing number of projects, higher dollar values and a growing backlog. Q4 was another record with 65 projects announced at a value of more than $150 billion.\nThrough Q4, we're now at 569 projects with a cumulative value of $1.7 trillion, and the backlog now stands at $1.9 trillion, up 33% from last year. Through Q4, approximately 15% of these projects have started, and we expect a record number of starts in 2025.\nMany of you have asked the question about cancellation rates, which we continue to monitor as well. To date, cancellations have actually been modest, around 11% and well below historical levels.\nA couple of pieces of Eaton-specific data. For projects that have started, we've won over $1.8 billion orders with a win rate of almost 40%, and we're in active negotiations on another $3.1 billion of Electrical content. So as you can see from the math, most of these projects haven't reached a negotiation stage, and we expect our orders to continue to grow.\nGiven the heightened discussions on data centers this week, I wanted to take a moment to highlight our data center business and why we have so much confidence in our outlook for continued growth. The information on Slide 6 summarizes our sales, negotiations, orders and backlog for our data center business. It includes hyperscale, colos, on-prem data centers and the major categories of cloud, training and inference. And cloud is still, by a wide margin, the largest category.\nAs you can see from the data, the rate of growth is continuing to accelerate with negotiations and orders well ahead of sales. I'll not read each of the numbers as they speak for themselves, but we'll ask that you note a few points.\nOur backlog is rapidly increasing, up 50% over prior year, which was up 70% over 2022. And as you've all seen, customers continue to increase their forecast for capital investments. Hyperscale customers alone expect to spend almost $300 billion in CapEx in 2025, up 30% from 2024.\nAnd perhaps the most notable number on page is the reference to the 7 years. At 2024 build rates, it would take 7 years to consume the current backlog. And the data center construction build rate doubled between '23 and '24. So any notion that this market will slow down is simply not consistent with any of the data that we're seeing.\nThe industry will no doubt continue to see innovation and technology developments that reduce costs. And if judged by history, this will be good for the industry and an accelerator of growth. For 2025 and for years to come, we expect data centers to be our strongest market and stand by our previous forecast, which assumed strong double-digit growth.\nNow I'll turn it over to Olivier to take us through the financial results for the quarter.\n\nOlivier C. Leonetti\n\nCFO, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThanks, Craig. I will start by providing a summary of our Q4 results, which again includes many new records. We posted fourth quarter record sales of $6.2 billion, up 6% organically or 5%, including 1 point of FX headwind. Hurricane Helene and labor strikes in the Aerospace industry negatively impacted Q4 sales by approximately $80 million or 130 basis points.\nOperating profit grew 13%, and segment margin expanded 190 basis points to an all-time record 24.7%. Adjusted EPS of $2.83 increased by 11% over the prior year. This is a Q4 quarterly record and near the high end of our guidance range. This performance resulted in an all-time record cash flow performance, including operating cash flow of $1.6 billion, up 23% on a year-over-year basis and free cash flow of $1.3 billion, up 27% versus prior year.\nI will now review the segment's quarterly results followed by a recap of the year. On Slide 8, we detail our Americas results. The business continues to execute very well and delivered another record quarter. We set new records for operating profit and margins and posted a Q4 quarterly record sales.\nOrganic sales growth of 9% was driven primarily by strength in data center, along with solid growth in commercial and institutional markets. Without the impacts of the hurricane disruptions to the business, organic growth would have been in the double digits.\nOperating margin of 31.6% was up 310 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher sales. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders remain at the -- at a high level of 16%, demonstrating continued tailwinds from the various megatrends. We had particular strength in the data center market, where activity remains very robust. For example, Dodge data shows U.S. announced data center project starts are up 99% in 2024 and 173% year-over-year in Q4 with data center construction backlog is now estimated to extend out about 7 years based on 2024 build rates.\nElectrical Americas backlog increased 29% year-over-year with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 on a rolling 12-month basis. These results closed out a record year for the business, which posted full year revenue of $11.4 billion, organic growth of 13% and margin of 30.2%, up 370 basis points over prior year. With the tailwinds from secular trends, incremental capacity coming online, strong execution and robust backlog, Electrical Americas remains well positioned as we enter 2025.\nThe next chart summarizes the results of our Electrical Global segment. Total revenue growth of 4% included organic growth of 5.5% and FX tailwind of 1.5%. We had strength in data center and utility markets.\nRegionally, we saw continued strength in APAC with double-digit organic growth and high single-digit organic growth in EMEA. Operating margin of 17.7% was down 110 basis points versus prior year primarily driven by mix. Orders were up 4% on a rolling 12-month basis.\nSimilar to sales growth, the strength was driven by the data center and utility markets. Backlog increased 16% over prior year, and book-to-bill continues to remain strong. Q4 was 1.1 on a rolling 12-month basis. For the full year, Electrical Global posted 4% organic growth with 18.4 margins.\nBefore moving to our Industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the combined Electrical segments. For Q4, we posted organic growth of 8% and segment margin of 26.7%, which was up 170 basis points over prior year.\nFor the full year, we posted organic growth of 10% and segment margins of 26%, up 220 basis points over 2023. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 12%, and our book-to-bill ratio for our Electrical sector remains very strong at 1.1. We remain confident in our positioning for continued growth with strong margins in our overall Electrical business.\nPage 10 highlights our Aerospace segment. We posted all [indiscernible] sales and Q4 record operating profit. Organic and total growth was 9% for [indiscernible] driven with growth in all end markets with commercial aftermarket.\nWithout the impacts of the Aerospace industry strikes, organic growth will have been in the double digits. Operating margin was strong at 22.9%, up 50 basis points year-over-year, mostly from higher sales.\nOn a rolling 12-month basis, orders [indiscernible] 10%, up from 6% in the prior quarter with particular strength in military OEM, commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket. Year-over-year backlog increased 16% and was up 2% sequentially. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for our Aerospace segment remains strong at 1.1. On the full year basis, Aerospace posted 10% organic growth with 23% margins.\nMoving on to our Vehicle segment on Page 11. In the quarter, total revenue was down 10%, including a 7% organic decline primarily driven by weaknesses in the North America, EMEA and APAC light vehicle markets and 3 points of unfavorable effects.\nDespite the top line weaknesses, the team executed well from a margin perspective. Operating margin came in at 18.8%, 90 basis points over prior year from improved operating efficiencies. On a full year basis, Vehicle recorded organic revenue down 5% with 18% margins.\nOn Page 12, we show results of our eMobility business. Total revenue was down 11%, including a 10% organic decline primarily driven by our customers' program launch and production ramp-up delays and 1% unfavorable FX. Operating profit was $3 million, resulting in operating margin of 1.8% for the quarter. On a full year basis, eMobility posted 4% organic growth with negative 1% margin.\nMoving to Page 13, we show our Electrical and Aerospace backlog updated through Q4. Backlog continues to be very strong with Electrical at $11.8 billion and Aerospace at $3.7 billion for a total backlog of $15.5 billion. Versus prior year, our backlogs have grown by 27% in Electrical and 16% in Aerospace. They are also increasing sequentially.\nAs noted earlier, book-to-bill ratios for Electrical and Aerospace are 1.1 and 1.1, respectively. The continued growth in our backlog underscores our high level of confidence in future demand.\nIn addition to our strong backlog growth in 2024, the next page shows the continued strength in our negotiations pipeline supports our expectation for strong markets and structurally higher organic growth rates. In Electrical Americas, the pipeline has increased nearly 4x since 2019.\nIn fact, the pipeline grew 40% year-over-year, showing acceleration versus our multiyear CAGR of 29%. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by data center, commercial and institutional and utility end markets. Within the commercial and institutional end market, growth was driven by education, government and transportation. This is even stronger than the 13% organic growth in our Electrical Americas business, which suggests continued strength going forward.\nNow I will pass it over to Craig to summarize our 2024 performance.\n\nCraig Arnold\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nThanks, Olivier. On Page 15, we summarize our 2024 financial results compared to our original guidance. You may recall that our practice is to set stretch goals for our businesses that are above our external guidance. If we execute well and markets perform as expected, it should put us in a position to exceed our guidance. This occurred again in 2024.\nThroughout the year, we demonstrated the ability to exceed our commitments and raise guidance on all key metrics. We delivered 8% organic growth, an 18% increase in adjusted EPS, all-time record margins of 24% and a 23% increase in free cash flow, all above our initial guidance.\nOf particular note, segment margins were up 140 basis points versus the original guidance midpoint and 200 basis points from prior year. And adjusted EPS of $10.80 was 6% above the $10.15 midpoint of our original guide.\nAnd as you know, every business deals with a number of market uncertainties, and life has a way of delivering unexpected surprises. So we run the company the way that allows us to absorb these unknown headwinds and still deliver our commitments and hopefully more.\nSo with a brief summary of 2024 on Page 16, and I'd say that we're once again proud of our team's execution in the year. We delivered another record year of financial results while reinvesting in the business like never before.\nBut while we're proud of our progress, we're not satisfied because we can do so much better. We're in the right markets, and the identified megatrends are creating some of the biggest opportunities that we'll see in our lifetime.\nThe growth opportunities are everywhere. Our negotiations pipeline, record orders and strong backlogs are evidence of our ability to convert on the opportunities. And we now have the capacity in place or coming soon to support even faster growth.\nWe have Eaton Business System, we call it EBS, that keeps everyone focused on getting better, running better functions, better factories and better businesses. It's how we improve our efficiency and expand margins. So now is our time, and I couldn't be more pleased with the team leading the next stage of Eaton's transformation.\nAnd on that note, I'll pass it over to Paulo, who will walk us through our key assumptions and financial guidance for the year.\n\nPaulo Ruiz Sternadt\n\nPresident, COO & Director\n\nThanks, Craig. Shifting our attention to 2025 on Page 17. We provide our view on end market growth expectations for the next year. As you can see, we continue to anticipate attractive growth markets in nearly all of end markets.\nWe're expecting double-digit growth in data center and distributed IT, commercial aerospace and electrical vehicles. For data centers, we remain constructive in our future outlook, given the strength and breadth of our secular trends.\nWe continue to see strong demand in data center market with the adoption of cloud computing and acceleration of AI technologies, including inference and training. So as more AI technology emerge, acceleration in AI usage could drive higher consumption of our AI hardware, including our electrical equipment.\nWe also expect solid growth in utility and modest growth across many of our other end markets. So we anticipate weaknesses in commercial vehicle and resi markets. But the change in resi outlook from last quarter is offset with strength in other end markets. And we do not see a change in our overall market growth between 6% and 8%.\nOverall, 2025 should be another year of significant growth with more than 85% of our end markets seeing growth. Our growth outlook is supported also by a strong order book, a strong record backlog and favorable secular trends. So we remain well positioned to deliver differentiated growth in 2025.\nNow moving to Page 18, we summarize our 2025 revenue and margin guidance. Organic growth for '25 is expected to be between 7% and 9% with particular strength in Electrical Americas at 11.5% at the midpoint. And I'll also add that healthy end markets combined once again with our large backlog continue to provide premium visibility to support our 2025 outlook.\nFor segment margins, our guidance range is between 24.4% and 24.8% is an improvement of 60 basis points at midpoint from our 2024 all-time record margins of 24%.\nNow on the next page, we have the balance of our guidance for 2025 and Q1. So for 2025, our EPS is expected to be between $11.80 and $12.20, [ a ] $12 at the midpoint and up 11% from 2024. And our free cash flow, our guidance is between $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, up 11% at the midpoint.\nWe also expect to repurchase between $2 billion and $2.4 billion of our shares outstanding. And given our strong cash position at the end of the year and our strong cash generation this year, we will leave plenty of room for strategic M&A. We have also provided guidance on this page for Q1, as you can see.\nTurning to Slide 20. We wanted to take a minute to highlight our upcoming annual investor conference on March 11, 2025. We'll be back in New York City, and we'll stream the presentation live on eaton.com. Along with myself, you will also have presentations from other senior leaders that are shown here on this page. So we are really excited to talk about the future of the company, including outlining our 2030 targets.\nWith that, I'll hand it back to Yan and the operator for Q&A.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Paulo, for the Q&A today. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instruction."

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Yan Jin. Please go ahead.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Olivier Leonetti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes operating remarks by Craig, then he will turn it over to Oliver who will highlight the company's performance in the second quarter. As we have done in our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's closing commentary.\nThe press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation, including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures. They are reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our commentary today will include statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projection due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Craig.\n\nCraig Arnold\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nOkay. Thanks, Yan. We'll start with some highlights on Page 3. And I'll lead off by noting that we delivered another strong quarter, and we're pleased with the first half of the year.\nOur teams continue to deliver on our commitments propelled by strong markets and good execution, exceeding our expectations and consensus on strong revenue, margins and earnings per share growth. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.73 in the quarter, an all-time record and up 24% from prior year. We also delivered record segment margins of 23.7%, up 210 basis points from last year. And our markets continue to be strong. On a rolling 12-month basis, electrical orders were up 9% and aerospace orders increased by 4%. This led to another quarter of growing and record backlogs, up 27% in Electrical and 14% Aerospace with strong book-to-bill ratios.\nThe strength in our orders and backlogs continue to support our view that the megatrends will keep the company growing for some time to come. We're in the early stages and once again, our markets are well positioned for the future. And our growing backlog allows us to once again raise our full year guidance. We're raising our guidance on organic growth, segment margins adjusted EPS and cash flow for the year. On balance, we're very pleased with our results, and we're well positioned for the second half of the year. Turning to Page 4.\nWe once again are sharing the key trends in end markets that are expected to drive Eaton's long-term growth. The broad number of megatrends noted on this chart have created and will continue to create a strong growth environment for the above end markets. And Eaton is uniquely positioned in that these are our primary end markets. As a reminder, we're in the early phase and expect to see growth for years to come. Today, we'll continue our practice of covering one of these megatrends and how it's impacting growth in one of our key markets.\nLast quarter, we gave an end market update on our industrial facilities and markets as well as our latest view on growth expectations in the rapidly growing data center market. Today, we'll once again provide an update on reindustrialization through the lens of mega projects where the activity just remains extremely robust. And we'll provide a summary of our growth outlook for our single largest end market commercial and institutional facilities. Before turning our attention to a specific market, we did want to once again remind you of the broad-based nature of our growth expectations. So turning to Slide 5.\nWe summarize the growth rates in our key end markets. This data has not changed from what we shared in recent quarters or at our technology showcase earlier this year. And I'd say, in many ways, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. in that the megatrends we shared are having a broad and significant impact on the growth outlook for most of our end markets, and we're seeing the benefit in our sales results, and more significantly in our orders, backlog and negotiation pipeline, all of which are at record levels and growing. And we'll share in a few slides, we're investing to support the orders and commitments that we received from our customers. Turning to Slide 6 in the presentation.\nWe once again provide a summary of mega projects that have been announced in January of 2021 in the North America market. And as a reminder, a mega project is a project with an announced value of $1 billion or more, and the list now includes 444 projects and $1.4 trillion of cumulative value. This is double where we were this time last year, and the backlog for mega projects now stands at $1.6 trillion, up some 25%. It's important to point out that we have not seen any slowdown in the number of announced projects. In fact, Q2 was one of the strongest quarters ever.\nRecently, we've seen data center and power generation/renewable projects take the lead in new project announcements, these two project types represent some 40% of announced projects in the last 12 months. And the cancellation rate continued to be modest, around 11% which is well below historical levels. Note that only 15% of these projects have started, and for projects that have started, we've won over $1.4 billion of orders and our win rate has been approximately 40%. We're actively negotiating another $1.3 billion of electrical customers. There's lots more to come here. Turning to Slide 7.\nWe continue to highlight the commercial and industrial end markets. For 2023, commercial and industrial institutional end markets represented 20% of total Eaton sales and 28% of our electrical sales. And for Eaton overall, we estimate that new office real estate exposure is only 2% to 3% of our revenues. We noted this has been a concerning point for some of you, but as you can see, it represents a very small part of our sales. While the entire category is growing, we expect to see significant strength in the institutional infrastructure segments, which represent 50% of our C&I exposure in Electrical Americas. Institutional infrastructure includes education, health care, government and includes waste and wastewater.\nI'd also point out that the electrical content in these two segments is much higher than office buildings and other light industrial projects -- excuse me, light commercial projects. And as noted, the same set of megatrends, including digitalization, energy transition [indiscernible] spending are also driving out growth in this segment. and something that we expect to continue for years to come. On Slide 8, we provide an overview of the products and software that we sell as part of our commercial and institutional building portfolio.\nWe include this slide to provide a perspective on how broadly we play across the electrical infrastructure and buildings. In fact, we have the industry's broadest set of electrical solutions. Some of the newer categories for us include energy storage, EV charging network managers, microgrid controllers that control energy behind the meter. In addition to the entire suite of digitally enabled hardware, we have our bright layer software suite that does energy management across the building and campuses, all of which are supported our comprehensive service organization. On Slide 9, we want to provide an update on our incremental growth investments.\nAs a reminder, we're investing more than $1 billion of incremental capital to support growth with $750 million in North America over the next few years. These investments expand our production capacity for a variety of products and support most of our electrical end markets. As you're aware, the market has several capacity constraints. So we're working closely with customers to ensure that our capacity additions are in line with the demand and in many cases, our contractual agreements. To provide you with a feeling of the magnitude of these investments, [ will ] impact 25 of our sites and add over 2 million square feet of manufacturing space. Overall, these projects remain on track with many sites already ramping up new capacity, additional production capacity will be coming online later this year and into the first half of 2025.\nTo note a couple of recent milestones, we recently opened a new state-of-the-art campus in Helsinki to increase capacity of UPS systems, and this obviously includes our latest energy-aware UPS. This is actually the industry's leading UPS and is 30% smaller than most of the competitive products. And most recently, we signed an agreement to build a new electrical campus in Dubai, to expand our commercial, manufacturing and support functions in the rapidly growing Middle East region. Turning to Page 10.\nWe're excited to have closed a strategic investment in NordicEPOD. NordicEPOD designs and assembles standardized power modules for the European data center market. What's unique about their solution is that it's designed to standardize and it's a pre-engineered system that allows for faster market response. The standard power module or EPOD, contains all the critical power, electrical gear, backup power, cooling and control systems needed to support a data center. The EPODs are manufactured in Norway are designed to operate in harsh weather environments, and can supply up to 2 megawatts of electrical power.\nI'd also note that the power modules are an increasingly preferred approach for many of the data center customers in Europe. And Eaton will naturally supply a significant amount of the electrical equipment and services. This is an outstanding new platform that will allow Eaton to increase our participation in the rapidly growing European data center market.\nNow I'll turn it over to Olivier, who will take us through the financial results for the quarter.\n\nOlivier C. Leonetti\n\nCFO, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThanks, Craig. I'll start by providing a summary of our Q2 results. We posted record sales of $6. 4 billion, up 8% in total and up 9% organically. This represents 9 quarters of growth of 20% on a 2-year stack. We posted record segment profit and margins. Operating profit grew 90% and segment margin expanded 210 basis points to 23.7%. Adjusted EPS of $2.73 increased by 24% over the prior year. This is a quarterly record and well above the high end of our guidance range. This performance resulted in Q2 record operating cash flow of $946 million, up 11% year-over-year, and Q2 record free cash flow of $759 million, up 10% versus prior year. On Slide 12, we summarize Electrical Americas, very strong results.\nWe continue to raise the bar, setting new records for sales, operating profit and margin. Organic sales growth remained strong at 13%, which reflects strength in data center and industrial end markets. On 2-year stack, organic growth is up 32%. Electrical Americas has generated double-digit organic growth for 10 consecutive quarters. Record operating margin of 29.9% was up 300 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher sales and manufacturing efficiencies that were partially offset by higher costs to support growth initiatives.\nOn a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 11%, demonstrating strength across the various megatrends. We have particular strength in the data center end market. Also, our major project negotiations pipeline in Q2 was up 18% versus prior year and up 42% since Q2 2022. Electrical Americas backlog increased 29% year-over-year with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 on a rolling 12-month basis. These results underscore the tailwinds from secular trends, strong execution and robust backlog that have allowed us to increase growth and margin guidance for the year which we will discuss later in the presentation.\nThis chart summarizes the results for our Electrical Global segment. Organic growth was up 3.5%, partially offset by FX headwinds. We have strength in data center markets, partially offset by weaknesses in residential end markets. Regionally, we continue to see strength in our APAC and GEIS businesses, partially offset by weakness in our EMEA business. Operating margin of 19% was up 50 basis points versus prior year, driven by higher sales and operating efficiencies, partially offset by wage inflation. Orders were up 7% on a rolling 12-month basis with strength in data center and utility end markets. Book-to-bill continues to remain strong. Q2 was 1.1 on a rolling 12-month basis. Before moving to our industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the combined electrical segments.\nFor Q2, we posted organic growth of 10% and segment margin of 26% which was up 260 basis points over prior year. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 9%, and our book-to-bill ratio for our electrical sector remains very strong at 1.1. We remain confident in our positioning for continued growth with strong margins in our overall electrical business. Page 14 highlights our Aerospace segment. We posted record sales and a Q2 record operating profit. Organic growth was 13% for the quarter, driven by strength in commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and military OEM. Operating margin of 21.5% was down 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by operating inefficiencies and higher costs to support growth initiatives that were partially offset by higher sales.\nOn a rolling 12-month basis, orders increased 4%, driven by commercial OEM and aftermarket. Within the quarter, orders increased 21% year-over-year with commercial OEM up 22% and military OEM up 53%. Year-over-year backlog increased 14% and was up 3% sequentially. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for our Aerospace segment remains strong at 1.1. And we are pleased with more than $2 billion Life of Program wins in the quarter. Moving to our vehicle segment on Page 15.\nIn the quarter, total revenue was down 4%, including a 3% organic decline and 1 percentage point of unfavorable FX. Weakness in the North America light vehicle market and a European [ truck ] was partially offset by strength in South America. Operating margin came in at 18%, 270 basis points above prior year, driven by operating efficiencies offsetting lower volume. And we are pleased to have won $83 million in mature year sales across our commercial and passenger vehicle portfolio. On Page 16, we show results for our e-mobility business.\nSales were up 18% on an organic and total basis. Our organic growth significantly outperformed the market, driven by new program ramp-ups in the European market. Operating profit was $2 billion, and we continue to incur large cost related to new programs expected to ramp up over the next coming quarters. In the quarter, we also launched major power protection programs, battery disconnect units and [ brecta ] and were awarded additional $82 million in mature year sales. Moving to Page 17.\nWe show our Electrical and Aerospace backlog updated through Q2. As you can see, we continue to build backlog with electrical stepping up to $11.4 billion and Aerospace reaching $3.5 billion for a total of $14.9 billion. Versus prior year, our backlogs have grown by 27% in electrical and 14% in Aerospace. Electrical backlog benefited from acceleration in order intake from tailwinds of the secular trends, including hyperscale orders within the data center end market. As noted earlier, book-to-bill Electrical and Aerospace are 1.1 and 1.1, respectively. The continued growth in our backlog underscores our confidence in 2024 and beyond.\nNow I'll turn it back to Craig for the end market outlook and financial guidance updates.\n\nCraig Arnold\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nThanks, Olivier. Turning to Page 18. We show a summary of our end market growth assumptions for the year. Overall, our markets continue to perform as expected, and most of these indicators have not changed from what we shared during our last two earnings calls. We are, however, seeing stronger-than-expected growth in data centers and in commercial and institutional markets in the U.S., which is why we're raising our revenue growth guidance for the year. We continue to expect growth in about 80% of our end markets supported by the key megatrends of electrification, energy transition, reindustrialization and digitalization. Moving to Page 19, we show our fiscal year organic growth and operating margin guidance.\nOverall, our 2024 organic growth is now expected to be between 8% and 9%, which is an increase of 50 basis points at the midpoint, raising our organic growth guidance in Electrical Americas by 150 basis points to 11.5% to 13.5% from 10% to 12% and in Aerospace by 100 basis points to 10% to 12% from 9% to 11%. We're lowering and tightening the range of our e-mobility organic growth guidance to 17% to 23% given the well-reported softening in some of these end markets. and we're reiterating the growth guidance for the remaining segments.\nFor segment margins, we're increasing the company's margin guidance range by 50 basis points at the midpoint to [ 23.5% ]. This is driven by the improved outlook in Electrical Americas, where we're seeing strong demand and strong operational execution. In this segment, we're increasing our margin outlook by 90 basis points to a midpoint of 28.9%. We're also reiterating our guidance for remaining segments, and we're well positioned to continue to deliver strong financial performance for the balance of the year. On the next page, we have additional guidance for metrics for 2024 and Q3.\nFor 2024, our adjusted EPS is expected to be between $10.65 and $10.75 a share, the $10.70 midpoint represents 17% growth in adjusted EPS over the prior year, a $0.55 increase over the initial [ 2024 ] guidance and a $0.30 increase over the prior guidance. We tightened the range for free cash flow and now expect $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion for operating cash flow and $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion for free cash flow, an increase of $100 million at the midpoint on both measures. For Q3, we expect organic growth to be between 8% and 9%, segment margins to be between 23.5% and 23.9% and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.73 to $2.83 a share. So let me just close with a summary on Page 21.\nOnce again, the trends driving growth in our end markets continue to play out as we expected, even better in our Electrical Americas business, driven by data center markets and the reindustrialization trend that we're seeing across multiple markets in North America. We also delivered a strong quarter of financial results and continue to see outstanding execution on our key initiatives across the company. As a result, we raised our guidance for organic growth by 50 basis points our segment margins by 50 basis points and our adjusted EPS by $0.30 at the midpoint. In the quarter, we were especially pleased to see the strength in our negotiations, our orders and our growth and backlog, all of which are at record levels, validating our medium- and long-term growth outlook. So we leave the quarter with a high level of confidence when we say Eaton will deliver higher growth, higher margins and consistent earnings growth for years to come.\nAnd with that, I'll open things up for any questions you may have.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Craig. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instructions."

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Yan Jin. Please go ahead.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Olivier Leonetti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes the opening remarks by Craig, then he will turn it over to Olivier, who will highlight the company's performance in the fourth quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's closing commentary.\nThe press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation includes adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures. They are all reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our comments today will include the statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described into our earnings release and the presentation.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Craig.\n\nCraig Arnold\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nOkay. Thanks Yan. And we'll start with some highlights on Page 3, and I'll lead off by noting that we've delivered another strong quarter this year. Our adjusted EPS was $2.40 in the quarter, well above our guidance range, our record for the quarter and up 28% from prior year.\nI'd also note that our orders came in ahead of expectations with strong order growth in Electrical, both the Americas and Global. On a rolling 12-month basis, total Electrical orders were up 7% and Aerospace orders increased by 2%. This led to another quarter of growing and record backlogs up 27% for Electrical and 11% for Aerospace, with strong book-to-bill ratios. The growth in orders and backlog support our point of view on the strength of the mega trends that we're in the early stages and that our market should be strong for years to come. And given our Q1 results, we're raising our guidance for organic growth, segment margins and adjusted EPS for the year. On balance, we're very pleased with our start to the year.\nIn the last few quarters, we shared our framework on how we think about key growth drivers for the company. This chart reflects the sixth secular growth trends that are positively impacting our business today, and quite frankly, for years to come. We continue to think Eaton is uniquely positioned in most of our businesses and are expected to see an acceleration in market-driven growth opportunities for years to come.\nIn the last 3 earnings calls, we provided a summary of progress on infrastructure spending, reindustrialization, utility and data center markets. We also shared the data center -- the data, excuse me, we're tracking on mega projects, including when they are expected to have a material impact on our revenue, and an overview on the growth expectations and drivers for our Aerospace business.\nToday, we'll once again provide you an update on what we're seeing on mega projects, but we'll also take a moment to show you the momentum that we're seeing in the nonresidential construction project market for those projects under $1 billion. Additionally, we'll provide you with a summary of the growth outlook for industrial facilities and how we're positioned in this market, and lastly, because it's such a dynamic topic, we'll provide an updated view on how our now higher growth expectations for the data center market is unfolding.\nTurning to Slide 5 in the presentation. We summarized the number of mega projects that have been announced since January of 2021. And as a reminder, a mega project is a project with an announced value of $1 billion or more, and the number is now 415 projects. Once again, this is North America data, but we are seeing a similar trend in Europe, although the dollars are not as large.\nJust a few points to note. We've now surpassed $1 trillion in announced megaprojects, double what we saw over the last -- this time last year and 3x the normal run rate. Approximately 16% of these projects have started but it does vary by type of project. For example, a large percentage of semiconductor and EV battery projects have started, but downstream chemical, power generation, renewables and data center projects have some of the lowest project start rates to date. And cancellation rates continue to be modest, around 10% and below historical rates. Using the current forecast, we expect over $100 billion to $150 billion of these projects to start this year.\nIt's also worth noting that mega projects represent 15% of total nonresident construction starts in 2023. A number that we expect to grow over the next 5 years. For projects that have started, we've won $1 billion of orders and our win rate is approximately 40%. We remain active in negotiations on another $1.4 billion of electrical content. Most of the projects represented here have not yet reached a negotiation stage.\nTurning to Slide 6. We want to highlight the largest part of nonresidential construction market, projects under $1 billion. This market is projected to be over $500 billion in 2024 and represents around 50% of the U.S. market. 56% increase since 2021 and a 16% CAGR. The market was actually up also 10% through Q1 of this year. So on mega projects grab a lot of the headlines, we're seeing significant strength in projects under $1 billion as well. And for projects less than $100 million, construction starts were up 15%, so once again, strength across the entire market. This momentum is naturally being driven by the same set of mega trends and stimulus spending that we're seeing on mega projects. The primary markets here include utility, power generation, renewable water, wastewater, manufacturing and data centers. And our win rate in this segment is approximately 35%.\nTurning to Slide 7, we highlight the industrial facilities end market. As we've reported, this end market accounted for approximately 12% of Eaton's total revenue in 2023. Reindustrialization and nearshoring are having a particularly large impact on this market. Examples include semiconductor fabrication, EV and EV battery plants as well as LNG terminals. At the same time, industrial markets are undergoing growing pressure to decarbonize to lower cost and develop more sustainable operations. These challenges are naturally driving a significant increase in CapEx investment. It's also coming at a time when technology and digitalization are providing more value to data as a service, software, and therefore, the ability to provide operational intelligence. This allows customers to move from being reactive to proactive when managing energy and uptime, saving them time and money. For us, we increased both our content per project and our average selling price. These are the drivers that support our belief that industrial facilities end market will grow by some 7% between now, 2023 and 2026.\nSlide 8 provides an overview of the products and software that we sell as part of our Industrial Solutions portfolio. As noted, we think we have the broadest portfolio of products in the market. Our solutions are sold in both process and discrete manufacturing industries and are especially well suited to take advantage of the trends we discussed on the prior page. Our solutions help industrial companies optimize performance by lowering the cost of ownership and reducing complexity. They increase operational predictability with data-driven insights and enhanced safety, protecting people and assets. In addition to hardware and software, we provide a full suite of project management services, including design, specifying, commissioning, training, remote monitoring and obviously, aftermarket service. and our bright layer industrial software platform enables customers to preempt operational challenges because of the data and insights that come from our electrical equipment.\nMoving to Slide 9, you'll see an updated view on the data center market. Last fall, in our Q3 2023 earnings call. We highlighted the data center market and shared our view that we expected the market to grow at a 16% compounded growth rate between 2022 and 2025. We want to provide an update as we've seen continued momentum in this market, driven by the rise of AI, big data and certainly edge computing. As expected, the biggest increase is coming from the very strong demand for AI data centers which is reflected both in our orders and in our negotiation pipeline. Here, orders on a trailing 12-month basis have more than doubled, and our negotiations in the U.S. have increased by more than 4x. We now think the overall market grows at a 25% compounded growth rate between 2022 and 2025. And as you know, we have a strong position in the data center market and the data center/IT channel accounted for 14% of our revenue last year.\nNow I'll turn the presentation over to Olivier to cover the financials.\n\nOlivier C. Leonetti\n\nCFO, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThanks, Craig. I'll start by providing a summary of our Q1 results. We posted a Q1 sales record of $5.9 billion, up 8% in total and organically. This represents 8 quarters of growth over 20% on a 2-year stack. We posted Q1 segment profit and margins record. Operating profit grew 27% and segment margin expanded 340 basis points to 23.1%.\nAdjusted EPS of $2.40 increased by 28% yet over the prior year. This is a Q1 record and well above the high end of our guidance range. This performance resulted in operating cash flow of $475 million, up 42% on a year-over-year basis and free cash flow of $292 million, up 40% versus prior year. As a percentage of full year guidance, both operating cash flow and free cash flow are improved versus prior year.\nOn Slide 11, we summarize Electrical Americas, very strong results. We continue to raise the bar, setting new all-time records for sales, operating profit and margins. Organic sales growth remained strong at 17%, which reflects broad-based strength in our end markets with particular strength in industrial, data center and institutional end markets. On a 2-year stack, organic growth was up 39%. Electrical Americas has generated double-digit organic growth for 9 consecutive quarters. All-time record operating margin of 29.2% was up 630 basis points versus the prior year, benefiting primarily from higher volumes, effective management of price cost and improved manufacturing efficiency, partially offset by higher costs to support growth initiatives. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 8% demonstrating a positive inflection as a result of the impact of the various megatrends. We had particular strength in data center end market. Also, our major project negotiations pipeline in Q1 was up 169% versus prior year and up 197% since Q1 2022. Electrical Americas backlog increased 31% year-over-year and was up 21% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 on a rolling 12-month basis. These results underscore the tailwinds from secular trends, strong execution and robust backlog that have allowed us to increase growth and margin guidance for the year, which we will discuss later in the presentation.\nThe next chart summarizes the results for our Electrical Global segment. Coincidently, global results are mostly flat to last year. Organic growth was up 1%, offset entirely by FX headwinds. We had strength in data center, industrial as well as commercial and institutional end markets. Regionally, we saw strength in our APAC and GEIS businesses, partially offset by weakness in our EMEA business. Operating margin was 18.3% which was flat to the prior year. Orders were up 4% on a rolling 12-month basis with strength in data center and utility end markets. Book-to-bill continues to remain strong. Q1 was 1.1 on a rolling 12-month basis.\nBefore moving to our industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the combined electrical segments. For Q1, we posted organic growth of 11% and segment margin of 25.3%, which was 430 basis points over prior year. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders inflected strongly positive, up 7% and our book-to-bill ratio for our electrical sector remains very strong at 1.2. We remain quite confident in our positioning for continued growth with strong margins in our overall electrical business.\nPage 13 highlights our Aerospace segment. We posted Q1 sales, operating profit and operating margin records. Organic growth was 9% for the quarter. Growth was driven by broad strength across all markets with particular strength in commercial OEM and aftermarket end markets, which were up 17% and 15%, respectively. Operating margin of 23.1% was up 60 basis points year-over-year, benefiting from higher volumes and effective management of price cost. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders increased 2%. Commercial OEM and aftermarket orders were particularly strong, and we expect that the military OEM order patterns will normalize in the second half. Year-over-year backlog increased 11% and was up 4% sequentially. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for our Aerospace segment remained strong at 1.1.\nMoving on to our Vehicle segment on Page 14. In the quarter, total revenue was down 2%, including a 3% organic decline, partially offset by a point of favorable FX. Weakness in the North America region was partially offset by strength in Asia Pacific. Operating margin came in at 16%, 150 basis points above prior year driven by effective management of price cost and improvement in manufacturing efficiencies, offset by lower sales volume.\nOn Page 15, we show results for our e-mobility business, Sales were up 7% on an organic and total basis. Our organic growth significantly outperformed the market, driven by new program ramp-ups. Our OEM customers continue to face execution challenges, and while we anticipate improvements throughout the year, we have remained pragmatic in our volume forecast. As a result, we will discuss shortly that our full year growth guidance of 25% to 35% remains unchanged. Growth programs and investments drove the operating loss of $4 million. We continue to incur launch costs related to our growth programs expected to ramp up over the next coming quarters. In 2023, we won new programs with more than $1.3 billion of mature year revenue, and we continue to expand our pipeline of new opportunities in 2024 with our unique technologies, driven by our electrical pedigree. This will continue to drive our growth well above the market.\nMoving to Page 16, we show our Electrical and Aerospace backlog updated through Q1. As you can see, we continue to build backlog with Electrical stepping up to $11.3 billion and Aerospace reaching $3.4 billion for a total backlog of $14.7 billion. Versus prior year, our backlogs have grown by 27% in Electrical and 11% in Aerospace. Electrical backlog benefited from acceleration in order intake from tailwinds from the secular trends, including hyperscale orders within the data center end market. As noted earlier, book-to-bill ratios for electrical and aerospace are 1.2 and 1.1, respectively. The continued growth in our backlog underscores our confidence in 2024 and beyond.\nNow I'll turn it back to Craig for the end market outlook and financial guidance updates.\n\nCraig Arnold\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nThanks, Olivier. Turning to Page 17, we show a summary of our end market growth assumptions. Overall, our markets continue to perform as expected, and most of these indicators have not changed from what we shared in our Q4 earnings call. We are, however, seeing stronger-than-expected growth in data center and in commercial and institutional markets in the U.S., which is why we're raising our revenue guidance for the year. In contrast, what many are seeing in the macro economy we continue to expect growth in 80% of our end markets, and much of this growth is supported by the large backlog numbers that Olivier shared.\nMoving to Page 18, we show our financial year organic growth and operating margin guidance. Overall, our 2024 organic growth is now expected to be between 7% and 9%, which is an increase of 50 basis points at the midpoint. We're raising our organic growth guidance in the Electrical Americas to 10% to 12% from 9% to 11%, and we're reiterating the growth guidance for the remaining segments. For segment margins, we're increasing the company's margin guidance range by 40 basis points at the midpoint to 23%. This is a result of the improved outlook in Electrical Americas, where we're seeing strong demand and strong performance. Here, we're increasing our margin outlook to 28% and a 100 basis point increase at the midpoint, and we're really [ iterating ] our guidance for the remaining segments.\nOn the next page, we have the balance of our guidance metric for 2024 and Q2. For 2024, our adjusted EPS is expected to be between $10.20 and $10.60 a share. The $10.40 midpoint represents a 14% growth in adjusted EPS over prior year and a $0.25 increase over the initial 2024 guidance. The other elements of our guidance are unchanged. For Q2, we expect organic growth to be between 6.5% and 8.5%, segment margins to be between 22.4% and 22.8%, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.52 to $2.62 a share.\nSo let me just close with a summary on Page 20. Once again, the trends driving growth in our end markets continue to play out as expected and even better in our Electrical Americas business, driven by the data center market. We also delivered a strong quarter of financial results on the back of strong execution across the company. As a result, we raised our guidance for organic growth by 50 basis points, segment margins by 40 basis points and adjusted EPS by 25% at the midpoint. And in the quarter, we were especially pleased to see strength in our negotiations, our orders and the growth in our backlog, all of which hit all-time records, validating our medium- and long-term growth outlook. So we leave the quarter with a high level of confidence. Eaton will deliver higher growth, higher margins and consistent earnings growth for years to come. Our expectations are high, and that's exactly where they should be.\nWith that, I'll open things up for any questions you may have.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Greg. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instruction."

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Yan Jin. Please go ahead.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes operating remarks by Craig, then I will turn it over to Tom who will highlight the company's performance in the fourth quarter.\nAs we have done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at end of Craig's closing commentary. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. The presentation includes adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures, the recount sales in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay.\nI would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Craig.\n\nCraig Arnold\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nOkay. Thanks, Yan. And we're pleased to report our Q4 results and record performance for the year. Our team continued to deliver our commitments, supported by strong markets and good execution. So let me begin with some highlights of the quarter on Page 3. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.55 for the quarter and $9.12 for the year, both all-time records.\nAdjusted EPS was up 24% and full year was up 20%, and we continued to post strong margins. Q4 was 22.8%, up 200 basis points and above the high end of our guidance. We also delivered strong incremental margins, 42% in the quarter, and we continue to see strong market activity. On a rolling 12-month basis, book-to-bill for Electrical and Aerospace was 1.1 and our backlog increased by 15% for Electrical and 13% for Aerospace.\nAnd as you've read, we're initiating guidance for 2024 and expect another year of strong organic growth. Double-digit increases in adjusted EPS and continued strength in cash flow. And I'll go through the full guidance details shortly. Lastly, we're announcing a multiyear restructuring program that will eliminate fixed costs and improve our overall efficiency. The program will cost $375 million and deliver $325 million of mature year benefits. So the combination of market tailwinds, our internal growth initiatives and our continued focus on operating efficiency will allow us to deliver outstanding results for years to come.\nAnd speaking of market tailwinds, let's turn to Slide 4. In the last couple of quarters, we shared our framework while we think about key growth drivers for the company. The chart reflects the 6 secular growth trends that will positively impact our business today and for years to come. And we're stepping up our investment in R&D and capital to ensure that we're well positioned to capture this growth. We think Eaton is uniquely positioned in that most of our businesses are expected to see an acceleration in market-driven growth opportunities.\nAnd our prior 2 earnings calls, we provided a summary of progress on infrastructure spending, reindustrialization, utility and data center markets in Electrical and our Aerospace business. Today, we'll provide an update on the impact from reindustrialization and how it continues to drive a record number of mega projects in North America. We'll also provide you with a framework for how to think about the timing impact on mega projects. On when a project is announced, to a negotiation, to an order and eventually to a sale.\nSo let's take a look at Slide 5 in the presentation. We've shared this data previously, and it's a good proxy for the reindustrialization trend we're seeing. You'll recall, this summarizes the number of mega projects that we have announced since January of 2021. And a mega project, once again is a project with an announced value of $1 billion or more and have been 333 of those through the end of last year, beginning in January 2021. Note that this is North America data, but we're seeing a similar trend in Europe, although the dollars are not as large.\nA few points to note. First, at $933 billion, this number is 3x the normal rate and the increase translates directly into electrical markets. As a reminder, the electrical content on these projects is typically anywhere from 3% to 5%. Second, the number continues to grow and is up 9% from Q3. This will not go on forever for sure but there continues to be strong momentum for U.S. industrial projects, and we're building a multiyear backlog. And third, about 72% of these projects are still in the planning phases and only 18% have actually started. Some 10% have been canceled or significantly delayed, but this number is actually lower than historical rates.\nFor those that have started, we've won over $1 billion in orders with a win rate of approximately 40%. And we're in active negotiations on another $1 billion of electrical content on a small subset of these total projects. So as you can see, mega projects are a compelling reason to be optimistic about the future. Turning to Slide 6. We want to highlight the timing and the duration of these mega projects as they become opportunities for our electrical business. The primary conclusion is we've not seen a significant impact from the large step-up in the number or size of mega projects yet, but it's coming.\nWhile each project is different, we put together our view of 3 representative examples of reindustrialization projects, including a semiconductor, an EV battery and a health care example. This slide indicates the number of months between an announcement of a mega project and the time we begin to negotiate it, the time from an announcement of an order -- of the time from an announcement to an order and from an announcement to a shipment. As you can see, it takes on average 3 to 5 years from when a project has announced to when it shows up in our revenue.\nSo while the gratification is certainly delayed, this is what's showing up in our backlog and providing outstanding visibility to future growth. With over $1 billion of orders that we've already won, we expect revenues to be recognized over the next several years in line with each of these products individual time lines. And just as a point of reference, our revenues in Electrical America for mega projects in 2023 was only about 3% of our total revenues. By contrast, they represent 16% of our negotiations and 6% of our orders. Hence, the conclusion that most of the impact from the significant step-up in mega projects is still ahead of us.\nAnd now let me just turn it over to Tom. But before I do, I do want to take this opportunity to thank Tom. I mean, Tom has just been an outstanding leader for Eaton in his tenure with us. And I couldn't have asked for a better partner or more effective CFO and Tom, we're absolutely disappointed to see you go, we fully understand the reason you made this decision. We wish you all the best of luck and thanks once again for his outstanding leadership over the last 3 years.\n\nThomas B. Okray\n\nSenior VP & CFO, W.W. Grainger, Inc.\n\nThanks, Craig. I'll start by reviewing how our fiscal year 2023 results compared to our original guidance. Throughout the year, we demonstrated the ability to execute on our commitments and raise guidance for all key metrics. We've delivered our third consecutive year of double-digit organic growth with a 20% increase in adjusted EPS, all-time record margins and a 48% increase in free cash flow. A particular note, organic growth and segment margins were up versus the original guidance, 400 and 110 basis points, respectively.\nFurther, adjusted EPS and free cash flow grew 11% and 4%, respectively, versus the original guide. On the next chart, we have a summary of our quarterly results, which includes several records. With respect to the top line, we posted an all-time sales record of $6 billion, up 11%. Organic growth continues to be strong, up 10% for the quarter. We have generated double-digit organic growth in 7 of the last 8 quarters with the last 7 quarters, growing over 20% on a 2-year stack. We posted operating profit Q4 records on both a margin and absolute basis.\nOperating profit grew 22% and segment margin expanded 200 basis points to 22.8%. Incremental margin was very strong at 42%. Adjusted EPS of $2.55 increased by 24% over the prior year. This is an all-time record and above the high end of our guidance range. This performance resulted in all-time quarterly operating and free cash flow records. Our $1.3 billion of operating cash flow was 9% higher than the prior year, generating 18% free cash flow margin and 103% free cash flow conversion.\nFor the full year, we also set numerous records, including record sales, segment margins, adjusted EPS and earnings and operating and free cash flow. On Slide 9, we detail our Electrical Americas results. The Electrical Americas business continues to execute very well and delivered another very strong quarter. We set an all-time record for sales, operating profit and margins. Organic sales growth remained strong at 16% with broad-based growth in nearly all end markets, on a 2-year stack, organic growth is up 36%.\nElectrical Americas has generated double-digit organic growth for 8 consecutive quarters. All-time record operating margin of 28.5% was up versus prior year, 480 basis points. Benefiting primarily from higher volumes, effective management of price cost and improved manufacturing efficiency. Incremental margin was 58% for the segment. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were down 4%. However, it's important to note that the dollar value of the orders remains high and the decline needs to be viewed in the context of the 34% order growth in Q4 of last year. As discussed in prior earnings calls, order intake is an important metric but needs to be analyzed together with record backlog.\nCurrently, in our electrical sector, we have backlog coverage of almost 3x our historical average. We've looked at multiple scenarios with meaningful order intake decline and are confident in those scenarios, given our backlog coverage that we can generate robust organic growth for several quarters, well into 2025. More specifically, Electrical Americas backlog increased 18% year-over-year and was also up sequentially resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 on a rolling 12-month basis. For orders, we had particular strength in data center, MOEM and institutional markets.\nAlso, our major project negotiations pipeline in Q4 was up 55% versus prior year and up 189% since Q4 2021. On a full year basis, Electrical Americas posted 19% organic growth with 26.5% margins, up 400 basis points over prior year. Electrical Americas posted records for full year sales, along with profit on both a margin and absolute basis. With the tailwinds from secular trends, strong execution and robust backlog, Electrical Americas is well positioned as we enter 2024. The next chart summarizes our results for the Electrical Global segment.\nLeveraging Q4 record revenue, organic growth increased to 4% from flat in Q3. We have strengthened data center, industrial and commercial and institutional markets. Operating margin of 18.8% was up 10% versus the prior year. Orders were up 1% on a rolling 12-month basis, with strength in data center and IT, utility, MOEM and industrial markets. Importantly, book-to-bill continues to remain greater than 1. On a full year basis, Electrical Global posted 5% organic growth and 19.3% margin. The business posted records for both full year sales and operating profit.\nBefore moving to our Industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the combined Electrical segments. For Q4, we posted organic growth of 11%, incremental margin of 51% and segment margin of 25%, which was up 320 basis points over prior year. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill ratio for our Electrical sector remains very strong, above 1.1. We remain quite confident in our positioning for continued growth with strong margins in our overall electrical business. Chart 11 highlights our Aerospace segment. We posted an all-time quarterly sales and Q4 operating profit record.\nOrganic growth was 8% for the quarter, with a 2% contribution from foreign exchange. Growth was driven by broad strength across all markets with particular strength in defense aftermarket in both commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket which were up 26%, 25% and 18%, respectively. Operating margin of 22.4% was down 210 basis points on a year-over-year basis, benefiting from higher volumes and effective management of price cost offset by unfavorable mix and favorable defense programs in the prior year.\nOn a rolling 12-month basis, orders increased 7% and with especially strong growth in commercial and defense aftermarket and commercial OEM. Year-over-year backlog increased 13% and was up 3% sequentially. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for our Aerospace segment remained strong at 1.1. Moving on to our Vehicle segment on Page 12. In the quarter, total revenue was up 2%, all from favorable foreign exchange. Vehicle end markets were down 500 basis points year-over-year, but the business was able to deliver outgrowth, primarily driven by higher aftermarket sales, stronger share in heavy-duty transmission and a new product launch of electrical vehicle gearing in China.\nOperating margin came in at 17.9%, 270 basis points above prior year, driven by effective management of price cost an improvement in manufacturing efficiency. Throughout 2023, we've demonstrated the ability to execute on operational improvements as shown by our 270 basis point improvement in segment margins from the first half to the second half of the year. On Page 13, we show results for our e-mobility business, we generated another quarter of strong growth, including an all-time sales record. Revenue was up 19%, 18% organically and 1% from favorable foreign exchange.\nDriven by the ramp-up of new product launches, we outpaced the market, which grew 7%. However, due to program start-up costs, the operating loss increased by $14 million when compared to the prior year. On a full year basis, eMobility posted 18% organic growth on slightly lower margins as we continue to invest in the business. We remain very encouraged by the profitable growth prospects of the eMobility segment. In 2023, we won new programs with more than $1 billion of mature year revenues. Through these wins, we continue to find opportunities to leverage expertise and differentiated technologies across segments.\nMoving to Page 14. We show our Electrical and Aerospace backlog updated through Q4. As you can see, we continue to build backlog with electrical stepping up to $9.5 billion in Aerospace reaching $3.2 billion for a total backlog of $12.7 billion. Both businesses have increased their backlogs by significantly more than 100% since Q4 2020 with electrical growing almost 200%, Versus prior year, our backlogs have grown by 15% in Electrical and 13% in Aerospace, which exceeded our expectations as we began the year. As noted earlier, both Electrical and Aerospace have book-to-bill ratios above 1.1. Our strong backlog to close the year gives us continued confidence in our growth outlook for 2024 and beyond.\nIn addition to our strong backlog growth in 2023, the next page shows the acceleration in growth of our negotiations pipeline, which supports our expectation for stronger markets and structurally higher organic growth rate. In Electrical Americas, the pipeline doubled over the past 3 years and increased a further 29% and in 2023. This is even stronger than the 19% organic growth in our Electrical Americas business, which suggests continued strength going forward.\nFor 2023, we saw $6.2 billion of projects in our negotiations pipeline in Electrical Americas alone. Now I'll pass it back to Craig to walk through the guidance and wrap up the presentation.\n\nCraig Arnold\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nThanks, Tom. Turning to Page 16, we lay out our end market assumptions for 2024. You'll recall that we provided an early look at our 2024 assumptions during our Q3 earnings call at the end of October. Today, we're updating those assumptions. And with the exception of residential markets where we have increased our outlook from down slightly to flat in commercial vehicles where we have decreased our outlook from slightly declining to declining, all of our assumptions have remained the same.\nIn contrast to what we're seeing in the macro economy, we continue to expect growth in about 80% of our end markets. And much of this growth is supported by large backlog. Turning to Page 17. As you've read, we're announcing a new multiyear restructuring program to reduce fixed costs and enhance our efficiency. While we're structurally positioned to deliver higher levels of organic growth, we also have a vast number of opportunities to improve the way we run the company. And we're at a point in time where we have the organizational capacity to take on a number of these efficiency projects that have been in our pipeline for some time.\nThe program will focus on reducing structural costs through the consolidation of rooftops, increasing shared services and deploying digital technologies. These actions will also free up time and resources in our businesses, allowing them to focus on growth and driving operational improvements. Overall, we expect $375 million of restructuring costs over the next 3 years with $325 million of mature year savings in 2027. This includes approximately 175 million charges in 2024 and $50 million of savings, both of which are included in our 2024 guide, and I'll cover those in the next several slides.\nWhile the company is performing well, we see these actions as an important part of how we'll continue to do so for years to come. Moving to Page 18. We summarize our 2024 revenue and margin guidance. Our organic growth for 2024 is expected to be between 6.5% and 8.5%, with particular strength in Electrical Americas and Aerospace, both expected to be up between 9% and 11% while eMobility is expected to grow some 30% as new programs are launched and the electric vehicle market continues to see solid growth.\nAnd I'd also add that the healthy end markets, combined with our large backlog provides actually better-than-normal visibility for our 2024 outlook. For segment margins, our guidance range of 22.4% to 22.8% is an improvement of 60 basis points at the midpoint from our 2023 all-time record of 22%. As we've communicated earlier, incremental margins of about 30% are what you should assume, and that's what's reflected in our guidance. These incrementals are consistent with our plan to step up investments in R&D and with the investments we're making to expand our manufacturing capacity, all done to ensure future growth.\nOn the next page, we have the balance of our guidance for 2024 and Q1. For 2024, our adjusted EPS is expected to be between $9.95 and $10.35 a share, $10.15 at the midpoint and up some 11% from 2023. And for operating cash flow, our guidance is between $4 billion and $4.4 billion, up 17% at the midpoint. The key drivers here are really a combination of higher earnings and improved working capital. We also expect to repurchase between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion of our shares outstanding. And given our cash position at the end of the year, at the end of '23 and our strong cash generation this year, we'll sell plenty of room for strategic M&A.\nFor Q1, we expect organic growth to be between 6% and 8%, segment margins between 21.3% and 21.7% and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.21 and $2.31 per share. Let me close here on Page 20. As we transition into 2024, I think we can all conclude that Eaton has proven that we're a changed company, a company that delivers higher growth, higher earnings and does so consistently, and we're proud of our team's record performance in 2023. But once again, we see opportunities to be better everywhere. As we look forward, we continue to experience powerful megatrends that are driving higher growth in our end markets, and we're investing to ensure that we're capturing these opportunities while gaining market share.\nWe're also continuing to optimize the way we run the company. improving our operational execution, leveraging our scale and reducing our fixed costs. This is allowing us to invest like never before in R&D, in capacity expansion in our people. So our expectations are high, and our teams are looking forward to delivering another exceptional year. So with that, I'll open things up for any questions that you may have."

Please go ahead.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Calls. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nOur agenda today includes opening remarks by Craig, then he will turn it over to Tom, who will highlight the company's performance in the third quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at end of Craig's closing commentary. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation, including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures, the [indiscernible] in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay.\nI would like to remind you that our commentary today will be including statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projection due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Craig.\n\nCraig Arnold\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nOkay. Thanks, Yan. We're pleased to report our Q3 results in another record quarter. Our team continued to deliver on our commitments, supported by strong markets and good execution.\nSo let me begin with some of the highlights on Page 3. As we've shared for some time now, megatrends, including reindustrialization, energy transition, electrification and digitalization are continuing to expand our markets, revenues, orders and negotiations pipeline as these trends are once again evident in our results in the quarter, especially in our Electrical Americas business. We posted another quarter of record financial results with strong revenue, margins, earnings and cash flow growth.\nWhile our markets continue to be strong, we're also continuing to improve on our overall effectiveness, which drove our record operating margins, and we're once again raising our earnings outlook. We're raising our '23 guidance for margins, adjusted EPS and cash flow. Our EPS growth for 2023 at the midpoint of our guidance is now 19%.\nI'd also like to highlight our growing backlog, which was up 15% in Electrical and 22% in Aerospace. And we continue to have a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 for Electrical and 1.2 for Aerospace.\nLastly, we recorded record third quarter operating cash flow of $1.1 billion, up 18% and free cash flow margins of 16%. Tom will share additional details. But overall, as you can tell, we're pleased with the results and well positioned to close out a record year.\nMoving to Slide 4. In the last quarter, we shared a framework for how we think about our key market drivers for the company. The chart notes 6 megatrends that are driving growth capital investments and how they intersect with various businesses within Eaton.\nAs you can see, we're uniquely positioned in most of our businesses and expect to see accelerated growth opportunities. It's our intention to cover each of these markets and megatrends during our earnings call and to keep you appraised of progress.\nIn our Q2 earnings call, we provided a summary of progress on infrastructure [ spending ], reindustrialization and the utility market in Electrical and our Aerospace business. Today, we'll spend a few minutes on how reindustrialization continues to drive a record number of mega projects in North America and how Eaton is positioned to win in the fast-growing data center market. We received an extensive number of questions on each of these topics and hope our updates are helpful as you think about the growth outlook for the company.\nSo let's begin with Slide 5 in the presentation. We've shared this chart previously, and the data is a good proxy for reindustrialization and what we're seeing inside of many of our markets. You'll recall this chart summarizes the number of mega projects that have been announced since January of 2021, and a mega project is a project with an announced value of $1 billion or more. Note that this is the North America data, but we're seeing a similar trend in Europe, although the dollar amounts are not as large.\nThree key points to note here. One, at $860 billion, this number is 3x the normal rate, which translates directly to future opportunities for electrical markets. As a reminder, the electrical content on these projects range from 3% to 5%.\nTwo, this number continues to grow at a faster rate. Announced mega projects grew between 25 -- grew 25% between Q3 and Q2, and Q2 was up 20% from Q1. This will not go on forever, but there continues to be strong momentum for industrial projects in North America.\nAnd third, only 20% of these projects have actually started. For those that have started, we've won roughly $850 million of orders with a win rate of approximately 40%. And we're actively negotiating another $1 billion of electric content on a small subset of these announced mega projects.\nTurning to Slide 6. We highlight the data center market. I can't think of many markets that have better secular growth dynamics than data centers. The world's appetite for data, new insights and software solutions continues to grow at an exponential rate. And natural language processing, like ChatGPT, will only accelerate this trend.\nThis is a very good thing for Eaton as we have a strong portfolio of data center solutions and the data center/IT channel represents 15% of our total revenue. While the numbers continue to be refined, we now think this market grows at a 16% compounded rate between 2022 and 2025 and likely for much longer.\nAs expected, our customers are continuing to expand their data center CapEx build-outs, some of which are being modified to support the adoption of generative AI. Just consider some of these metrics. 120 zettabytes of data have been generated in 2023, a 60-fold increase over the 2 zettabytes generated in 2010. And the amount of data generated is expected to grow to 180 zettabytes by 2025, a 50% increase over 2023.\nAnd the AI impact is just starting to show up in our order book. During Q3, we won a large order of approximately $150 million for a new AI training data center and saw a roughly 61% increase in hyperscale orders overall. These AI data centers require both high-power and high-power density and as a result, higher electrical content.\nAnother trend driving higher electric content is the need for solutions that allow bidirectional flow of power back to the grid and the ability to optimize the use of renewable energy to power data centers. So this market and Eaton are well positioned for higher growth for years to come.\nAnd on Page 7, we highlight Eaton's unique positioning in the data center market and note that we have the electrical industry's broadest portfolio of power manager solutions for data centers. Centralized data centers come in a variety of sizes with incoming power draws between 10 and 500 megawatts with the average data center of 40 to 50 megawatts, which is the variety that we show here on this slide.\nEaton, we, support the flow of electrons from where they enter the facility from our transformers to our medium-voltage and low-voltage switchgear through our electrical busway to our uninterruptible power systems all the way into the server rooms, where we offer racks and power distribution units. In addition, we have a broad suite of software and service solutions that provide real-time diagnostics, prognostics and uptime support.\nAs a rule of thumb, Eaton's market opportunity in data centers is about $1.5 million per megawatt. Here, we're distinguishing this market from the myriad of smaller data centers that exist to support many different markets and smaller applications. And we continue to improve our position in the market with our Brightlayer for data center suite of software solutions.\nThis platform is the first in the industry to unite asset management, IT and operational device monitoring, power quality metrics and advanced electrical supervision into one single application. This new software provides electrical power, power quality, distributed IT equipment performance management that improves efficiency, data accuracy and certainly uptime.\nSo overall, Eaton is well positioned and continues to build on our strength in this rapidly growing market. Given our broad set of megatrends and our growth outlook, we're naturally investing to add capacity in many of our businesses, as noted on Slide 8.\nIn fact, on the normal run rate, we're investing more than $1 billion of capital to support the growth that we see over the next 5 years. These investments expand our production capacity across a wide range of markets and position Eaton to win more than our fair share of these opportunities.\nAs you've heard, while somewhat improved, our lead times are still longer than ideal. And these investments will address the bottlenecks in our manufacturing sites. The primary investments are being made in utility markets to support transformers, both the regulators and our line insulation and production equipment and circuit breaker capacity to support the rapid growth in industrial projects and to add redundancy to our existing capability and in our global Electrical business to support growth in a number of fast-growing emerging markets, where we've been gaining share but have ample opportunities to do significantly more.\nAnd of course, we're building a completely new eMobility business and making significant investments to build out new manufacturing capacity there. These capital investments support higher organic growth, provide excellent return on investment and are indicative of our confidence in the future of the company. We've made some of these capital investments this year, while others will be layered in over the next couple of years.\nNow I'll turn it over to Tom to cover our financial results and outlook for the year.\n\nThomas B. Okray\n\nSenior VP & CFO, W.W. Grainger, Inc.\n\nThanks, Craig. I'll start by providing a summary of our Q3 results, which include several records. With respect to the top line, we posted an all-time quarterly sales record of $5.9 billion. Organic growth continues to be strong, up 9% for the quarter, building upon 6 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth and 3 quarters on a 2-year stack of mid-20s growth.\nOperating profit recorded all-time records on both a margin and absolute basis. Operating profit grew 23%, and segment margin expanded 240 basis points to 23.6%. We posted a very strong incremental margin of 46%, up sequentially from 33% in Q2 and 27% in Q1.\nAdjusted EPS increased by 22% over the prior year to $2.47 per share, an all-time quarterly record and well above the high end of our guidance range. This performance resulted in a third quarter operating cash flow record. Our $1.14 billion in operating cash flow was 18% higher than the prior year, generating 16% free cash flow margin and over 100% free cash flow conversion.\nLooking at our results on a year-to-date basis. Organic growth is up 12%. Segment margin is up 170 basis points. We generated incremental margin of 35%, adjusted EPS growth of 19%, a 73% increase in operating cash flow versus prior year and free cash flow up 90% year-over-year.\nMoving on to the next slide. Our Electrical Americas business continues to execute well and delivered another very strong quarter. We set all-time quarterly records for sales, operating profit and margins. Organic sales growth remained very strong at 19%.\nElectrical Americas has generated double-digit organic growth for 7 consecutive quarters with 6 of the quarters greater than 15%. On a 2-year stack, organic growth is up 37%. In the quarter, there was broad-based growth in nearly all end markets with double-digit growth everywhere except residential and especially robust growth in industrial, utility, machine OEM and data center markets.\nRecord operating margin of 27.7% was up 420 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher volumes and effective management of price cost. Incremental margin was 50% for the segment.\nOn a rolling 12-month basis, orders were down 3%. It's important to note that the dollar value of orders remains high, and the decline needs to be viewed in context of the 36% order growth in Q3 of last year.\nAs discussed on last quarter's call, order intake is an important metric but needs to be analyzed together with record backlog. Currently, in our electrical sector, we have backlog coverage of almost 3x our historical average. We have looked at multiple scenarios with meaningful order intake decline and are confident in those scenarios, given our backlog coverage that we can generate robust organic growth for several quarters into 2025.\nIn this regard, Electrical Americas backlog increased 19% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio above 1.1 on a rolling 12-month basis. For orders, we had particular strength in data center, industrial facilities and institutional markets.\nAlso, our major project negotiations pipeline in Q3 was up 33% versus prior year and 19% sequentially from especially strong growth in data center, institutional, government and water, wastewater markets. Data center negotiations increased almost 4x. On a 2-year stack, our negotiation pipeline was up 180%. Overall, Electrical Americas continues to have a very strong year.\nOn Page 11, you'll find the results for our Electrical Global segment. Despite flat organic growth, we posted a Q3 right sales record. We had strength in our commercial and institutional, industrial and utility markets.\nRegionally, we saw weakness in EMEA markets that were offset in other markets where growth was in line with expectations. We expect the softness in EMEA to be short term with organic growth in the segment returning to low to mid-single digits in Q4.\nOperating margin of 21.8% was up 120 basis points compared to prior year. Operating profit and margin were all-time quarterly records. Margin improvements were primarily driven by effectively managing price cost.\nOrders were up 1% on a rolling 12-month basis with strength in data center and utility markets. Importantly, book-to-bill remained greater than 1.\nBefore moving to our industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the combined electrical segments. For Q3, we posted organic growth of 11%, incremental margin of 53% and segment margin of 25.5%, which was up 320 basis points over prior year.\nOn a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill ratio for our electrical sector remains very strong at more than 1.1. We remain quite confident in our positioning for continued growth with strong margins in our overall electrical business.\nThe next slide highlights our Aerospace segment. We posted all-time quarterly sales and operating profit records. Organic growth was 10% for the quarter with a 3% contribution from foreign exchange.\nWe've posted double-digit growth in 6 of the last 7 quarters in this segment. Growth was driven by broad strength across all markets with particularly strong growth in commercial OE and commercial aftermarket, which were up 21% and 27%, respectively.\nOperating margin of 24.1% was up 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis and up 160 basis points sequentially. Growth in orders and backlog continue to be very strong. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders increased 16% with especially strong growth in commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense OEM.\nYear-over-year backlog increased 22% in Q3 and 4% sequentially, reflecting continued momentum in the Aerospace recovery. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for our Aerospace segment remains very strong at 1.2.\nMoving to our Vehicle segment on Page 13. In the quarter, organic growth was down 1%. Foreign exchange had a 2% favorable impact. We saw growth in APAC, North American automotive and EMEA markets more than offset by a decline in North American Class 8 and South American markets.\nOperating margins came in at 17.4%, 60 basis points above prior year driven by effective price cost management, partially offset by lower sales volumes. 17.4% margins represents 210 basis points of sequential increase primarily driven by manufacturing efficiency improvements.\nWe continue to pursue and win new business in growth areas such as EV torque win with a major Chinese OEM. We also have momentum winning program length extensions and volume increases with multiple OEMs globally.\nOn Page 14, we show results for our eMobility business. We generated another strong quarter of growth, including an all-time sales record. Revenue was up 19%, all organic.\nMargin improved 150 basis points versus prior year to breakeven. The result was mostly driven by higher volumes from ramping programs and improved manufacturing productivity.\nOverall, we remain very encouraged by the growth prospects of the eMobility segment. So far in 2023, we have won new programs worth $1.1 billion of mature year revenues. This is nearly a 145% increase in new program wins since the $450 million highlighted in last quarter's earnings call. Through these wins, we continue to find opportunities to leverage expertise and differentiated technologies across segments. Should be noted, we have increased our interim revenue target for 2025 by 25% from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion.\nMoving to Page 15. We show our Electrical and Aerospace backlog updated through Q3. As you can see, we continue to build backlog with Electrical stepping up to $9.4 billion and Aerospace reaching $3.1 billion, sequential increases of 5% and 4%, respectively. Both businesses have increased their backlogs by significantly more than 100% since Q3 2020. The backlog build gives us confidence in our order outlook for the quarters to come.\nOn the next page, we show our fiscal year organic growth and operating margin guidance. For organic growth, we are increasing Electrical Americas, lowering Electrical Global and eMobility while narrowing the range of our total organic growth, resulting in a 50 basis point increase at the midpoint.\nWe now expect organic growth in Electrical Americas to be 16.5% to 18.5%, up 250 basis points from our prior 14% to 16% guidance. This represents 850 basis points improvement from our initial 2023 guidance.\nFor Electrical Global, we're lowering our organic growth guidance from 6% to 8% to 4% to 6% based on weaker-than-expected end markets in Europe. For eMobility, the midpoint of our organic growth guidance is now 25% versus 35% mostly due to OEM-related delays for their EV platforms.\nFor segment margins, we're increasing our total Eaton margin guidance range by 50 basis points. This is a result of an improved outlook in Electrical Americas, where we increased the range by 150 basis points on strong demand and continued operational execution.\nWe are lowering margin guidance for Electrical Global 50 basis points due to lower growth. The 21.8% midpoint comfortably exceeds our target to reach 21.5% by 2025 and represents a 160 basis point increase versus prior year.\nIn summary, as we approach the final quarter of 2023, we remain well positioned to deliver another very strong year of financial performance.\nOn Page 17, we have additional guidance metrics for 2023 and Q4. Following our strong year-to-date performance and improved margin expectations, we are raising our full year EPS range to $8.95 per share to $9.05 per share. The $9 midpoint represents 19% growth in adjusted EPS over the prior year. We're also raising our operating cash flow and free cash flow guidance ranges by $100 million each to reflect our stronger earnings and solid working capital management.\nFor Q4, we are guiding organic growth of 8% to 10%, segment margins of 22.3% to 22.7%, representing 170 basis point improvement at the midpoint versus prior year. Adjusted EPS is a range of $2.39 to $2.49, an 18% increase versus prior year at the midpoint.\nThe next chart summarizes the progression of our guidance in 2023. Throughout the year, we've demonstrated the ability to execute on our commitments and raise guidance for all of the metrics shown. We are well on track to deliver our third year in a row of double-digit organic growth with all-time record margins in a $1 billion or nearly 40% increase in operating cash flow.\nNow I'll hand it back to Craig.\n\nCraig Arnold\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nThanks, Tom. Moving to Page 19 and turning our attention to next year. We provided our initial view on what we expect from our end markets.\nAnd first, I would note this as a starting point, we haven't changed our view on 2023. And as you can see, we're expecting attractive growth in nearly all of our markets in 2024. We expect strong double-digit growth in data centers and distributed IT segment, in utilities, commercial aerospace and electric vehicles.\nAdditionally, we expect solid growth within industrial facilities, commercial and institutional and defense aerospace. And as you [indiscernible], global light vehicle market should be modestly positive with only the residential and commercial vehicle markets experiencing a decline. So it should be another year of significant growth with over 80% of our end markets seeing solid or better growth.\nPlease note that much of this growth is supported by record backlogs, and we'll provide more detailed color on organic growth as we come together with our 2024 guidance in February of next year. As you can see from the outlook, despite mixed signals in the economy and some historical indicators of growth, Eaton remains very well positioned to deliver what we call differentiated growth in 2024 and beyond.\nSo I'll close with a summary on Page 22 -- on Page 20. Last quarter, I noted that we're feeling good about how our markets are performing. And today, I reiterate that sentiment. We continue to experience powerful megatrends that are driving a higher outlook for our end markets, and we're seeing it in our negotiations and order book.\nAnd once again, we delivered another record quarter of financial results, increased our earnings and cash flow outlook. Our orders continue to come in at historically high levels, and we continue to grow our backlog.\nI would note that our team is executing well, but we have an opportunity to be better everywhere than I'd say in every business. So the setup for 2024 is playing out as we expected, and it should be another strong year.\nWith that, we'll open it up for any questions you may have.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Craig. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instructions."

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Yan Jin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, guys. Thank you all for joining us for today's Eaton second quarter earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nOur agenda today includes the opening remarks by Craig then he will turn it over to Tom, who will highlight the company's performance in the second quarter. As we have done in our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's closing commentary. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation, including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures, the recount sales in the appendix.\nA webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projection due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation. With that, I will turn it over to Craig.\n\nCraig Arnold\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nThanks, Jin. Today, we're pleased to mark the end of the first quarter with one of our strongest performance as ever and a performance that strengthens our conviction about our long-term growth prospects. Our teams continue to deliver on our commitments, propelled by both strong markets and good execution. We'll begin with some of the highlights of the quarter on Page 3.\nWell understood at this point, megatrends, reindustrialization, infrastructure spending are continuing to expand our markets, driving our revenue, orders and backlogs. We posted another quarter of record financial performance with strong revenue, margins and earnings growth, and we executed well. And our first half performance, along with our growing backlog is what allows us to once again raise our full year guidance. We're raising our 2023 guidance for organic growth, margins and adjusted EPS.\nOur EPS growth at the midpoint of our guidance is now up 16%. Tom will walk you through the details shortly, but from my perspective, the highlights of the quarter really are our growing backlog, up 22% on Electrical and 26% in Aerospace, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 for both Electrical and Aerospace. We also generated strong operating and free cash flow, $1.2 billion and $900 million, up more than 200% and 600%, respectively.\nFree cash flow in the first half of the year is almost $800 million above prior year, so we're on track to deliver our full year guidance despite the higher growth and higher receivable balances. Overall, we're pleased with the results and well positioned for the second half.\nMoving to Slide 4, we wanted to provide a simple framework that summarizes how we think about key growth drivers across our businesses. The important megatrends are listed here on the left at Eaton markets and our segments are listed across the top of the page. At the intersection is where we see these trends having a material impact on our growth rate of our end markets. And without getting into a lot of the detail, the important message is that this long list of mega projects is impacting many of Eaton's end markets. What we intend to do during the course of our quarterly earnings call today and really into the future is really to talk about these trends and how they impact our end markets.\nToday, we'll spend a few minutes on infrastructure spending and the Inflation Reduction Act, reindustrialization and an update on mega projects as well as a look at Eaton's position in the Utility and Aerospace markets. We're highlighting the Inflation Reduction Act since its considerable upside to the initial estimates of future government spending and on mega projects because they continue to grow dramatically. We picked the Utility segment as it's quickly becoming one of our largest markets. It was approximately 15% of Electrical Americas sales last year and is running well ahead of that rate this year.\nWe received also some extensive questions from investors about our position in this market. Lastly, we'll highlight our Aerospace business through the double-digit growth outlook, ramping defense and commercial platforms, including a substantial new win on the [ Bell V-280 ] platform.\nMoving to Slide 5. We're showing an updated look at expected spending tied to the Inflation Reduction Act. Most of the spending is focused on improving U.S. infrastructure and as you can see, the estimates have increased significantly. At the time of passage, estimates on the cost impact, including credits and incentives was $271 billion. The legislation was recently rescored and government spending is now expected to be $663 billion, up nearly 2.5x due to really what is a uncapped program.\nImportantly, these tax credits, because they're uncapped, are expected to continue to grow. These dollars are naturally a strong [ catalyst ] for infrastructure spending much of it targeted at industries where Eaton will be a significant benefactor. The implementation of the IRA is in the very early stages, and we think will provide significant tailwinds over the next 10 years. Very little of this impact is currently in our order book, and none of it has impacted revenue yet.\nOn Page 6, we have an updated chart showing the continued growth of mega projects in North America. We introduced this chart last quarter. And you'll recall that we included announced projects that are greater than $1 billion in this category. The value of announced mega projects has increased by $116 billion or 20% between March and June. So the momentum continues and we'd expect the category to continue to grow at well above historical trends.\nWe've seen recent announcements for EV, semiconductor plants and new battery plants. So really across the board. And a few examples of some of the other major projects include $174 billion of downstream oil and gas or chemicals, $33 billion of LNG export terminals and $64 billion in power generation and renewable energy projects.\nJust another confirming data point, the [ Dodge ] data for U.S. industrial projects continues to expand at a record pace. With 12-month manufacturing construction starts, up 72% on a 12-month basis -- on a rolling 12-month basis and up 84% if you include LNG activity. And as a reminder, only 25% of these mega projects have started. So we're just at the beginning of this reindustrialization megatrend.\nLastly, I'll remind you that we expect each of these mega projects to have between 3% and 5% electrical content.\nMoving to Page 7, we highlight the Utility segment of the Americas business. As we reported, in 2022, this market accounted for approximately 15% of Electrical Americas revenue and represents an even bigger percent to date. We've historically viewed the Utility segment as a stable but slow growth business, generally in the low single digits. Over the next decade, Utility distribution CapEx will account for 60% of the total Utility CapEx globally, growing at a CAGR of 9%. Over the '22 to '25 period, we would expect an 11% CAGR.\nThe impact of sustainability initiatives across the globe have significantly boosted this number. This includes grid modernization, renewable energy, electrification of everything, enhance reliability and safety needs and government incentives are all contributing to this growth outlook. And while the electrical needs of the world continue to increase, our Utility customers are finding it challenging to maintain an increasingly aging grid infrastructure.\nAs a point of reference, over 70% of U.S. transmission and distribution lines are over 25 years old. We're naturally making capital investments to address the growth here and have already committed to new capacity in our 3 major product families, transformers, both the regulators and line insulation products.\nIt's worth highlighting that in this quarter, our Americas Utility business backlog has increased 45%, organic revenues grew 30% in the Americas and 20% in our Global segment.\nThe graphics on Page 8 highlight Eaton's unique position in the North America Utility market where we're primarily focused on distribution. And given the significant changes taking place in this market, including the need to integrate renewables, undergrounding for increased resiliency, the increased demand for grid services, we cannot be more pleased with what we have to offer in this segment.\nYou can see from this slide that we have a broad position in the market. In fact, we have the industry's broadest portfolio of utility solutions. This includes grid planning software, design and engineering services, a complete offering of critical utility products, automation software as well as extensive project management expertise.\nWe also offer a broad range of digitally enabled hardware, grid edge controllers for overhead, underground and for substations. Lastly, our Brightlayer solution for Utility includes distribution planning software, distribution and substation automation as well as smart grid communications sensors and demand management. So overall, we're well positioned given our substantial portfolio of hardware, digitally enabled software and solutions. And in the quarter, we support a broad range of wins in the market, including hardware solutions for voltage regulators, power distribution, digital solutions for grid planning and our software, we call [ SIM ] and smart metering and also in utility services.\nMoving to Page 9, we'd like to highlight another well-known trend, the growth in Aerospace markets. As you can see, we expect double-digit growth in each of the years between now and 2025, driven by the rebound in commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and increased defense spending. The commercial market is expected to be very strong as Airbus and Boeing are both significantly increase in production volumes and are expected to materially increase production on their most important platforms.\nFor example, Airbus is expected to increase production on the A320 from 45 to 50 per month currently to 75 per month by 2026. And Boeing is expected to increase production on the 737 from 31 per month currently to 50 per month in the '25 to '26 time frame. And global passenger air travel is expected to return to 2019 levels by the end of this year and grow at an 11% CAGR between now and 2025.\nWe also expect to see increased defense spending driven by various global conflicts, and governments allocating more dollars to war type of equipment to improve fleet readiness. Our Aerospace business is especially well positioned on key defense platforms both those targeted for modernization and on new platforms that are being ramped up.\nOn Slide 10, in addition to the high-volume single-aisle growth that you hear so much about, the next group of key platforms driving new growth today and into the future are listed here. These platforms are a good representation of important platforms ramping in the near term over the next 5 years, and critical growth platforms for future decades.\nIn all cases, we have more content than ever on each of these aircraft. In the future category, we're showing the win with the [ Bell ] on the V-28 Valor program. The V-28 is the replacement for the Black Hawk helicopter, and we have 5x more content and are still bidding for more opportunities. We put the KC-46A and the F-35 in the next category, aircraft that will be ramping in the near term and will contribute materially to our revenue growth beginning next year.\nAs you can see, our content per aircraft here is 2 to 3x the legacy platform. And lastly, we're starting to see once again growth in the wide-body market. The long-haul market has been especially weak during the COVID and post-COVID period and is now beginning to pick up. The important message here is that these programs -- as these programs ramp up, we'd expect to grow faster than our end markets given the increased content on each of these programs. So between market recovery and increased content per platform, our Aerospace business is expected to see significant growth over the next 5 years or even longer. Now I'll turn it over to Tom who will take us through the financial slides.\n\nThomas B. Okray\n\nSenior VP & CFO, W.W. Grainger, Inc.\n\nThanks, Craig. I'll start by providing a summary of our record Q2 results. Organic growth continues to be strong, up 13% for the quarter, the sixth quarter in a row with double-digit organic growth. Operating profit, an all-time quarterly record grew 21% and segment margins expanded 150 basis points to 21.6%, also an all-time quarterly record.\nWe posted solid incremental margins of 33%, up sequentially from 27% in Q1. Adjusted EPS increased by 18% over the prior year to $2.21, an all-time quarterly record and well above the high end of our guidance range.\nLooking at our first half results, we've had a very strong start to the year with organic growth of 14%, segment margins up 130 basis points, incremental margin of 30% and adjusted EPS growth of 17%. Finally, last year, we explained that we were making a deliberate decision to invest in working capital to protect our customers and their orders. With supply chains improving, we are now able to better optimize working capital. The result, together with strong earnings is a 600% increase in free cash flow in the first half of the year to $900 million.\nMoving on to the next chart. Our Electrical Americas business delivered another very strong quarter. The megatrends are having a favorable impact on our U.S. business. We set all-time quarterly records for sales, operating profit and segment margin. Beginning with the top line, organic sales growth of 19% remains very strong. Electrical Americas has generated double-digit organic growth for 6 consecutive quarters with 5 of the quarters greater than 15%.\nOn a 2-year stack, organic growth is up 35%. In the quarter, there was broad-based growth in nearly all end markets, with especially robust growth of 25% to 30% in data center, utility, industrial and commercial and institutional end markets. Operating margin of 26.4% was up 320 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher volumes and effective management of price cost.\nOn a rolling 12-month basis, orders grew 7% with particular strength in data center and distributed IT, industrial and commercial and institutional end markets. Book-to-bill ratio remains above 1. We increased backlog by 30% year-over-year and sequentially 3%. It's worth noting that we secured orders for 2 large data centers worth nearly $300 million, including content to support these customers' AI growth projections.\nFinally, our major project negotiations pipeline in Q2 was up more than 17% versus prior year and nearly 9% sequentially from especially strong growth in data center, institutional, government, health care and transportation markets. On a 2-year stack, our negotiation pipeline was up 65%. Overall, Electrical Americas continues to have a very strong year.\nOn Page 13, you'll find the results of our Electrical Global segment, which posted all-time record sales of nearly $1.6 billion. Organic growth was up 6%, which was partially offset by a small divestiture. This represents a 2-year stack of 18% organic growth. The growth was broad-based driven by strength in utility, data center and distributed IT and industrial end markets. Operating margin of 18.5% improved 20 basis points sequentially, but was down 40 basis points prior -- compared to prior year. The year-over-year decline was mostly driven by unfavorable product mix, partially offset by effective management of price cost and higher volumes.\nOrders were up 1% on a rolling 12-month basis with strength in utility and data center and IT end markets. Importantly, book-to-bill remained greater than 1.\nBefore moving to our industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the combined Electrical segment. For Q2, we posted organic growth of 14%, incremental margin of 38% and segment margin of 23.4%, which was up 200 basis points over prior year. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for our Electrical sector remains very strong at 1.2 and our record backlog grew 22%.\nWe remain very confident in our positioning for continued growth with strong margins in our overall Electrical business.\nThe next slide highlights our Aerospace segment. We posted an all-time quarterly sales record and a Q2 operating profit record. Organic growth was 14% for the quarter. We've posted double-digit growth in 5 of the last 6 quarters in this segment. Growth was driven by broad strength across all markets with particularly strong growth in commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket, which were up 21% and 30%, respectively. Operating margin was 22.5%, up 60 basis points over last year primarily driven by higher volumes.\nGrowth in orders and backlog continue to be very strong. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders organically accelerated from up 21% in Q1 to up 26% in Q2 with especially strong growth in defense, OEM and aftermarket for both commercial and defense. Year-over-year backlog growth increased 26% in Q2, in line with growth in Q1. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for Aerospace remains very strong at 1.2x.\nMoving on to our Vehicle segment on Page 15. In Q2, organic growth was up 6%. We saw particularly strong growth in North America light vehicle, APAC and EMEA markets, all up double digits. Operating margins came in at 15.3%. During the quarter, we delivered improvements in our manufacturing facilities, which contributed to sequential margin improvement of 80 basis points. We continue to win new business tied to clean technology solutions, including multiple clean commercial valve actuation programs.\nAdditionally, we've won over $60 million per year in program length extensions and volume increases with multiple OEMs.\nOn Page 16, we show results for our eMobility business. We generated another quarter of strong growth. Organic revenue was up 18%. Margin improved 100 basis points versus prior year, mostly driven by higher volumes. Overall, we remain very encouraged by the growth prospects of the eMobility segment.\nSo far in 2023, we have won new programs with more than $450 million of mature year revenues, positioning us very well to exceed our 2025 target of $1.2 billion of revenue. Through these wins, we continue to find opportunities to leverage expertise across all segments. For example, we reached an agreement with a major OEM to supply power electronics control unit for an electrically heated catalyst to meet emissions regulations.\nThis win demonstrates Eaton's ability to leverage capabilities across our entire portfolio, including core technology in both electrical and industrial businesses, such as break [ tour ], power protection and bus man fuses. We've also capitalized on our extensive vehicle expertise and added content in connectors from our Royal Power acquisition.\nMoving to Page 17. We show our Electrical and Aerospace backlog updated through Q2. As you can see, we continue to build backlog with Electrical stepping up to $9.1 billion, a sequential increase of 2%. Electrical backlog is up about 110% since Q2 of 2021 and over 200% higher than Q2 2020. Aerospace backlog is holding steady at $3 billion. This is a 30% increase since Q2 2021 and over 100% higher than Q2 of 2020. On a rolling 12-month basis, book-to-bill was 1.2 for both Electrical and Aerospace with absolute orders remaining at high levels and record backlogs, our book-to-bill over 1x is yet again a key metric that gives us confidence in our outlook into the quarters to come. With all the tailwinds in our end markets, we think it is likely that we will have high levels of backlog going forward, which enhances our visibility over the planning horizon.\nOn the next page, we show our fiscal year organic growth and operating margin guidance. We are raising our organic growth guidance for 2023 in both Electrical Americas and for the total company. We now expect organic growth in Electrical Americas of 14% to 16%, up 300 basis points from our prior 11% to 13% guidance. This represents a 600 basis point improvement from our starting 2023 guidance for the business.\nIn total, we're raising our 2023 organic growth outlook to a midpoint of 11%, up from a 10% midpoint in our prior guidance. Our strong end market growth forecast, expanding negotiations pipeline and building backlog provide tremendous visibility and confidence in this 2023 outlook.\nFor segment margins, we are increasing our total Eaton margin guidance range by 40 basis points from a prior range of 20.7% to 21.1% to a new range of 21.1% to 21.5%. This is a result of an improved outlook in Electrical Americas where we increased the range by 80 basis points on strong demand and continued strong operational execution. The increased outlook now represents a 110 basis point increase from the midpoint of our 2022 all-time record margins.\nIn summary, at the halfway mark, we remain well positioned to deliver another very strong year of financial performance.\nOn the next page, we have additional guidance metrics for 2023 and Q3. Following our strong first half performance and improved organic growth expectations for the year, we're raising our full year EPS range to $8.65 and to $8.85. At the midpoint, the $8.75, we have raised guidance by $0.35. This represents 16% growth in adjusted EPS in 2023 over prior year. We now expect currency translation to be roughly neutral and the remainder of our full year guidance remains unchanged.\nFor Q3, we're guiding organic growth of 9% to 11%. Segment margins of between 22% and 22.4% representing a 100 basis point improvement at the midpoint versus prior year, and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.27 to $2.35, a 15% increase versus prior year at the midpoint. Now I'll hand it back to Craig to wrap up the presentation.\n\nCraig Arnold\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nThanks, Tom. Now turning to Page 20. As a reminder, last quarter, we raised our growth assumption for the utility market to strong double-digit growth, and we increased our residential market outlook to flat from declining. We're now increasing our growth assumption for the commercial institutional and for data center markets to strong double-digit growth. In addition to stronger than anticipated demand for new projects, existing buildings are being retrofitted with more electrical infrastructure as EVs continue to increase their penetration in the market. And data center demand continues to remain at very high levels and we now expect to see double-digit growth in this market as well.\nThe balance of our end markets continue to perform well and are tracking along our prior projections. So while the macroeconomic outlook remains choppy, we continue to expect growth in almost all of our markets.\nI'll close with a summary on Page 21. As you can tell, we're feeling good about how our markets are performing this year, and we think that will be strong for many more years to come. In fact, the mega trends that we've discussed for some time now are expected to be even more impactful than we originally anticipated. Our markets are strong, but we also had solid execution in the quarter and delivered another strong set of results that included a number of financial records.\nAnd as we look to the back half of the year and into 2024, our increasing backlog provides great visibility on our growth outlook. As noted, we raised our guidance for growth and EPS for the second time, and our largest business, Electrical Americas continues to post new records. With that, we'll open it up for questions you may have.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Craig, for the Q&A today, please limit your opportunity to just 1 question and 1 follow-up. Thanks everyone for your cooperation. With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instructions."

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Yan Jin. Please go ahead.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes the opening remarks by Craig, then he will turn it over to Tom, who will highlight our company's performance in the first quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions ending to Craig closing commentary.\nThe press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation, including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures. They are reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay.\nI would like to remind you that our commentary today will include statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Craig.\n\nCraig Arnold\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nOkay. Thanks, Yan. We'll start with some highlights of the quarter on Page 3.\nAnd I'll lead off by noting that we've delivered another strong quarter. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.88 for the quarter, well above our guidance range, record for the quarter and up 16% from prior year. And we continue to post strong margins. Q1 record of 19.7%, up 90 basis points over prior year. Our sales were $5.5 billion, up 15% organically, our third quarter in a row of 15% organic growth.\nWe have particular strength in our Electrical Americas, which was up more than 20% and including very strong growth in commercial, institutional, utility and data center market. We also had exceptional growth in our Commercial Aerospace and eMobility businesses.\nOur orders also came in ahead of expectations for the quarter. On a rolling 12-month basis, Electrical orders were up 13% and Aerospace orders increased by 21% and which led to another quarter of record backlogs, up 39% for Electrical and 27% for Aerospace. I think it's well understood at this point, but I'd note once again that reindustrialization, infrastructure spending along with secular growth trends of electrification, energy transition and digitalization have fundamentally changed the growth prospects for our company.\nLastly, free cash flow in the quarter was nearly $300 million, driven by higher net income and improved working capital. So I'd say a good start to the year that keeps us on track to deliver our free cash flow guidance despite higher revenue and receivable balances. So on balance, I'd say we're off to a very good start for the year.\nMoving to Page 4. I'd like to once again highlight that Eaton is marking its 100th anniversary of our listing on the New York Stock Exchange. And as many of you saw, we celebrated by ringing the bell on in early March. Eaton is 1 of [ 30 new ] companies who have reached this milestone. And I'd say our longevity on the exchange and our resiliency is really a function of our ability to adapt to a changing world. But what has remained constant over that time is the spirit of innovation that guides us and our commitment to all of our stakeholders, our employees, our customers, our shareholders, communities and all of society.\nNow as Eaton stands at the forefront of perhaps the most significant growth trends that we'll see in our lifetime, we're convinced that our best days are still ahead of us. And we've been busy planning for this moment. As we look at Eaton today, we position ourselves as our customers' trusted partner across power management spectrum. And Slide 5 provides a good example of how we're playing across the electrical value chain from power generation to power distribution, to how it's consumed in various applications. We're building a business that supports our customers with a full range of end-to-end solutions beginning with deep domain expertise in specific applications and the ability to specify electrical solutions, we're now providing intelligent electrical products, offering Data as a Service, providing software solutions, doing installation commissioning and providing aftermarket services. Our role has changed from simply selling components to helping owners fulfill their changing energy needs.\nWe're also proving that we can leverage our technology and create scale solutions that serve all of our end markets. For those of you who are with us at our March meeting in New York, you saw an example of this and a new product we call Breaktor. Breaktor is a combination of a breaker and a contactor, we developed the technology in our Electrical business and have successfully sold it in our eMobility and aerospace businesses. And as the electrification of everything continues, the need for Eaton's technology and solutions will certainly continue to grow.\nAnd the primary source of this growth is coming from the mega trends that we've discussed. In addition to electrification, we're [ benefiting ] from energy transition from digitalization and the reindustrialization of the U.S. and European market, and we're seeing record capital spending levels. And as you know, this capital is being supported by an unprecedented level of infrastructure spending by governments around the world. And while early, we're tracking a large number of infrastructure-related projects.\nFor example, in our Electrical Americas business, we've already seen over $1 billion of projects and have won roughly $250 million of orders. And as this chart reflects, we're also at the beginning of a strong aerospace growth cycle and seeing rapid adoption of electric vehicles. Collectively, these trends have positioned the company for strong growth for the foreseeable future.\nNext, on Page 7 of the presentation, we provide an example of how reindustrialization is creating a record number of mega projects, and we define a major project as a project with more than $1 billion of capital. Since 2021, announced nonresidential mega projects have a cumulative value of almost $600 billion, at least 3x the historical run rate for nonresidential projects. And this is North America only. $600 billion announced over the last 9 quarters, $400 billion more than historical run rate. These projects are certainly in various phases of design, planning or construction. But as you can see, these secular trends are translating into specific projects, and they haven't slowed down. There's billions more in the planning stages, which will certainly sustain our growth for years to come.\nOn Slide 8, we take you from the $400 billion of announced mega projects and what it means for the electrical industry. We estimate that the electrical content on these projects is in a range of 3% to 5% of the total project value. This suggests $12 billion to $20 billion of incremental electrical revenue. Keep in mind, there's certainly a wide range of electrical content on various projects, and our exposure is tied more closely to building infrastructure. But assuming these projects get planned designed and built over the next 5 to 7 years, they will expand the electrical market by some $2 billion to $4 billion a year. And that's just from what's been already announced in mega projects, we naturally expect more large and small projects to come.\nI'd say these projects are a good example of how mega trends are playing out in creating a very different growth outlook for the electrical industry and one we think will run a decade or more.\nAnother helpful proof point is represented on Slide 9, where you can see how our negotiation pipeline has grown. As you can see, our negotiation pipeline has doubled from what we've seen historically. In 2022, we saw nearly $5 billion of projects in our negotiation pipeline in Electrical Americas alone. And similar to mega projects, we're seeing broad strength in manufacturing and data center, industrial and utility market. This large step-up in negotiation is further supported. Our expectations further supports our expectations for strong markets and faster organic growth as we go forward.\nAnd just one additional proof point is noted on Page 10. Here, we show a few examples of how these projects are translating into specific orders. As we reported, our electric orders have been at record levels for 2 years now. So what we're demonstrating here is how these mega projects are translating directly into large wins for our Electrical business. For example, we've won $180 million of orders to provide toll management solutions for 2 new EV plants in North America. Specifically, we're providing power distribution equipment and bright layer industrial remote monitoring software.\nAnother example is a $100 million order for a new U.S. semiconductor plant, and we're already working on Phase 2 of this project, which could be even larger. So overall, we're seeing record project announcements, record negotiations, a record set of orders that has led to record backlog. And keep in mind, the revenue impact is mostly in front of us.\nMoving to Page 11. We're also benefiting from mega trends in Aerospace and Vehicle. We're at the beginning of an Aerospace growth cycle in both commercial and defense market. Specifically, Commercial OEM build rates are expected to grow in the mid-teens over the next several years. And our commercial aftermarket should also grow by double digits as global [indiscernible] passenger kilometers continue to recover to pre-pandemic levels and beyond.\nWe've also noted the significant step-up in defense orders and expect to see a significant lift in defense revenues beginning in 2024. As a point of reference, our defense orders have more than doubled from 2019 levels. And in recent years, we've run increased content on both Commercial and Defense platforms.\nIn vehicle, electrification continues to accelerate, and we now expect global EV penetration rates to exceed 50% of global auto sales by 2030, up from our prior estimate of 40%. While we're not providing any new revenue updates today, we once again are relooking our forecast for our eMobility segment.\nAnd on Page 12, we highlighted a few key wins in our Aerospace and eMobility businesses beginning with a $500 million win for cryogenic coolers and controllers for the CityAirbus urban air mobility program. The CityAirbus win is a good example of how digitalization, software and electrification are beginning to benefit our Aerospace business. And as Tom will report shortly, we're seeing more than 30% growth in our defense and commercial aftermarket orders. And in new mobility, we continue to realize significant wins.\nThe most significant of which are coming from our power distribution product line within our eMobility business. You'll recall this is where we're able to leverage our broader electrical business and our unique breakthrough technology. Our latest set of wins comes from a leading European automotive OEM and will generate $100 million a year of mature year revenues.\nSo like Electrical, our industrial businesses are delivering significant wins tied to long-term mega trends that will support faster growth. When you combine the businesses, we're confident that our market should grow at more than 2x their historical rates. And as we've stated, we're in the early innings. These trends are expected to deliver outside growth for years to come.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Tom to walk us through Q1 financial results and updated guidance.\n\nThomas B. Okray\n\nSenior VP & CFO, W.W. Grainger, Inc.\n\nThanks, Craig.\nOn Page 13, I'll start by providing a summary of our strong Q1 results. For the third consecutive quarter, we generated organic growth of 15%. Revenue was up 13%, with the organic growth reduced by 2 percentage points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Operating profit, a first quarter record grew 19% and margins expanded 90 basis points to 19.7%, also a Q1 record. Adjusted EPS increased by 16% over the prior year to $1.88. All in, the strong organic growth and margins enabled us to report a first quarter record adjusted EPS.\nOur higher growth not only demonstrates the mega trends, but also the importance of prioritizing our customers by carrying higher levels of inventory when supply chains were challenged. Lastly, our free cash flow of $209 million was nearly $300 million above prior year and exceeded our expectations. You will recall from our Q4 call, we expected free cash flow to be relatively flat year-over-year.\nMoving on to the next chart. Our Electrical Americas business had another very strong quarter. We have set Q1 records for sales, operating profit and margin. Organic sales growth was 22%. Electrical Americas has generated double-digit organic growth for 5 consecutive quarters, including back-to-back quarters of at least 20% growth.\nOn a 2-year stack, organic growth is up 32%. In the quarter, there was broad-based growth in all end markets, with especially robust growth in commercial and institutional, utility and data center market. Specifically, we posted 25% organic growth in our data center revenues in Q1. So we continue to see very strong growth in this important market.\nUtility and Commercial and institutional were up more than 30%. It's also worth noting that we posted strong revenue growth of 17% in our residential business. The 2-year stack is over 40% growth. We're seeing strength in multifamily homes, completion of single-family homes in process and increased electrical content per home, which are more than offsetting weakness in new single-family start.\nOperating margin of 22.9% and was up 380 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher volumes. Incremental margins were very strong at more than 40%. We continue to manage price effectively to more than offset inflationary pressures.\nOrders and backlog show continued strength. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 18%, which remains at a high level with particular strength in data center, distributed IT, utility and industrial market. On a quarter-over-quarter sequential basis, orders grew 19%. We're also continuing to build backlog. Backlog was up 51% versus prior year and up 9% sequentially. In addition to the robust trends in orders and backlog, our major project negotiations pipeline in Q1 was up more than 20% versus prior year and nearly 20% sequentially from especially strong growth in data center, water, wastewater and transportation market. Overall, Electrical Americas had a very strong quarter to start the year.\nOn Page 15, you'll find the results of our Electrical Global segment which posted all-time record sales of $1.5 billion. Organic growth was up 8%, which was partially offset by headwinds from foreign exchange and a divestiture. Organic growth was driven by strength in utility, data center and distributed IT market. Our data center revenues for Electrical Global increased 32% in the quarter, utility was up 25% and distributed IT up 20%. Operating margin of 18.3% was down compared to prior year. Primarily from manufacturing inefficiencies and investment in growth, partially offset by higher sales volume and inflationary price recovery. Orders were up 4% on a rolling 12-month basis with strength in data center, commercial and institutional and utility market. Sequentially, orders grew 12%. Backlog increased 3% year-over-year and 6% sequentially.\nI'm also pleased to highlight that last month, we closed the acquisition of a 49% stake in Jiangsu Ryan Electrical Company. This is a Chinese-based business with approximately $100 million of revenue which manufactures power distribution and subtransmission transformers and will accelerate Eaton's growth in renewable energy, data center, utility and industrial market. This is Eaton's fourth JV in China in the last 2 years, allowing us to expand our market presence, serving high-growth markets inside and outside of China.\nBefore moving to our Industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the combined Electrical segment. For Q1, we posted organic growth of 16%, incremental margin of 34% and operating margin of 21%, which was 180 basis points of year-over-year margin improvement. Orders grew 13% on a rolling 12-month basis, with sequential growth in the quarter of nearly 20% compared roughly -- compared to roughly flat sequential order growth in the 6 years prior to the pandemic. Backlog grew 39% in the quarter and 8% sequentially.\nOn a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for our electrical sector remains very strong at above [ 1.2 ]. It was also above [ 1.2 ] for Q1. We remain confident in our positioning for continued growth with strong margins in our overall Electrical business.\nThe next page recaps our Aerospace segment. We posted Q1 record for sales and operating profit. Organic growth was 13%, with a 1 percentage point headwind from foreign exchange. Growth was primarily driven by strength in Commercial aftermarket, up more than 30% and commercial OEM up more than 25%. Operating margin was 22.5% and which was 40 basis points over last year, driven by volume growth and inflationary price recovery. Order growth in backlog trends also remain encouraging. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 21% organically with strength across all end markets, including continued outgrowth in defense OEM orders.\nSimilar to the second half of the year, we continue to see -- a second half of last year, we continue to see strong growth in our defense orders in the quarter with OEM and up 55% and aftermarket up more than 40%. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for our Aerospace segment remains very strong at more than [ 1.2 ] including more than [ 1.25 ] for Q1. Year-over-year backlog growth increased 27% in Q1, an acceleration from up 21% in Q4.\nMoving on to our Vehicle segment on Page 17. In Q1, revenue was up 10%, with 11% organic growth and 1 percentage point of unfavorable FX. We saw particular strong growth in both the Americas and EMEA market. Operating margins came in at 14.5%, with unfavorability to prior year, primarily due to manufacturing inefficiencies and partially offset by higher sales volume and price cost. We continue to make progress towards securing more sustainable technology wins which most recently includes multiple new programs for our e-Powertrain solution.\nOn Page 18, we show results for our eMobility business. We generated strong growth in the quarter. Revenue was up 17%, including 18% from organic growth. Margin was down 30 basis points versus prior year driven by higher manufacturing start-up costs associated with new electric vehicle programs. We remain very encouraged by the growth prospects of the eMobility segment. We continue to leverage our capabilities across our entire portfolio, including core technology in both electrical and industrial businesses.\nSince 2018, we have won $1.4 billion of mature year revenues in this business with many of these programs ramping up in 2023 and 2024. This strong momentum includes additional recent wins with Breaktor, including on next-generation battery platforms with a large European OEM.\nNext, on Page 19, we show historical backlog charts for the Electrical sector and Aerospace segments. We think it's important to illustrate how backlog has grown over time. Our record backlog was roughly $12 billion to end Q1. This is up nearly 3x the ending 2019 level. These metrics provide us with great confidence in the outlook for the full year and going forward.\nOn the next page, we show our fiscal year organic growth and operating margin guidance. We are raising our organic growth guidance for 2023. We continue to have a robust negotiations pipeline and build backlog with particular strength in Electrical Americas and Aerospace. We now expect organic growth in Electrical Americas of 11% to 13%, up 300 basis points from our prior 8% to 10% guide. We're also raising electrical global 200 basis points to 6% to 8% from 4% to 6%. And we're increasing Aerospace 200 basis points to 10% to 12% from 8% to 10%. In total, we're increasing our 2023 organic outlook by 200 basis points from an 8% midpoint to a 10% midpoint. Our strong end market growth forecast combined with building backlog provides tremendous visibility and confidence in this 2023 outlook.\nFor segment margins, we're raising our guidance range for Electrical Americas by 20 basis points to a revised range of 23.3% to 23.7%, which reflects the continued strong momentum that we have in this business.\nOverall, we are reaffirming our total Eaton margin guidance range of 20.7% to 21.1%. As a reminder, this is a 70 basis point increase at the midpoint from our 2022 all-time record margin. For eMobility, we are adjusting both the organic growth and margin ranges. This is primarily due to delayed OEM launch plans and higher start-up costs related to large new program wins. In summary, we continue to be well positioned to deliver another strong year of financial performance.\nOn Page 21, we have the balance of our guidance for 2023 and Q2. Following our strong Q1 performance and improved organic growth expectations for the year, we are raising our full year EPS range to $8.30 to $8.50. At the midpoint of $8.40, we have raised guidance by $0.16. This represents 11% growth in adjusted EPS in 2023. We're also raising our CapEx guidance from $630 million to approximately $700 million to fund additional investments for growth including in our utility business, where we continue to experience strong increases.\nFree cash flow guidance remains unchanged. For Q2, we are guiding organic growth of 10% to 12%. Segment margins of between 20.5% and 20.9%, representing 60 basis points growth at the midpoint versus prior year, and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.04 to $2.14, and a 12% increase versus prior year at the midpoint.\nNow I'll hand it back to Craig to wrap up the presentation.\n\nCraig Arnold\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nThanks, Tom. Now turning to Page 22.\nAs we continue to track our end markets, we want to provide a slightly rise look at our assumptions for the year. Once again, we do expect a mild recession 2023, and we've built that into our base case assumptions. But with healthy demand and strong secular growth trends, we continue to expect growth in almost all of our end markets, and we raised our growth assumption for the utility market from solid growth to strong double-digit growth. Here, energy transition and electrification continue to gain momentum. And we've increased our residential market from declining to flat. So while we recognize the slowdown in U.S. single-family housing market, the combination of resilient renovation market, pricing momentum and strong backlog now supports an upward revision. And as Tom noted, we posted a 17% organic growth in residential in Electrical Americas in Q1.\nThe balance of the forecast remains unchanged, and but I want to emphasize once again that despite market concerns about nonresident construction market, we have a robust negotiation pipeline, a growing backlog and strong orders. Data centers, utility, industrial, commercial institutions continued to perform extremely well. And I know that most of you have drawn reference to the declining PMI data, but I'd point out that our market and revenue growth are much more aligned with capital spending where we continue to see strong momentum. As a result, we do not expect any of our end markets to decline in 2023, and most are expected to see healthy levels of growth.\nLet me close on Page 23 with just a few summary comments. Once again, we delivered a strong quarter and set a handful of Q1 record. We delivered 15% organic growth and have record backlog. While electric orders are experiencing some expected normalization, our supply chains continue to improve, the secular growth trends and strong execution on our backlog support another strong year of growth. Having exceeded our Q1 forecast and continued secular tailwinds, we're raising our guidance for the year. Despite macro uncertainty in markets -- despite macro uncertainties, our markets are performing well, and we're improving our internal execution.\nAnd as I highlighted, we're seeing more evidence that mega trends are accelerating. And we now think our end markets will grow at more than 2x historical growth rate. These market forces are just beginning to show up in revenue and will position the company for strong growth for the decade to come.\nI'll stop here and open it up for any questions you may have.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Craig. For the Q&A today, please limit your opportunity. Just one question and a follow-up. Thanks [indiscernible] for your corporation.\nWith that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instruction."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI'll turn the call now over to Mr. Yan Jin, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSVP of IR, Eaton Corporation plc\n\nGood morning. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.\nOur agenda today, including the opening remarks by Craig, then he will turn it over to Tom, who will highlight the company's performance in the third quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at end of Craig's closing commentary. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation includes adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures. They're reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay.\nI would like to remind you that our comments today will include the statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation.\nWith that, I will turn over to Craig.\n\nCraig Arnold\n\nChairman & CEO, Eaton Corporation plc\n\nThanks, Yan. We'll begin with the highlights of the quarter on Page 3, and I'll start by noting that we delivered another very strong quarter and have again posted a number of all-time records, including adjusted earnings per share of $2.02, which is up 15% from prior year. This, despite negative impact of FX and the divested Hydraulics business, which took place in August of 2021.\nOur organic revenue growth also continued to accelerate in the quarter, up 11% in Q2 to up 15% in Q3. And I think, encouragingly, we had strength across all of our businesses with exceptional growth in Electrical Americas, in Vehicle and eMobility. We also posted all-time segment margins of 21.2%, up 130 basis points over prior year and above the high end of our guidance with incrementals of 38% in the quarter.\nI'd also note that our team continues to manage price effectively more than fully offsetting the impact of inflation. As noted here, orders continued to accelerate in the quarter as well. On a rolling 12-month basis, Electrical orders increased 27% versus 25% last quarter, and our Aerospace orders increased 22% compared to 19% last quarter. This order strength, I'd say, also led to another quarter of record backlogs in Electrical, which were up some 75%, and our Aerospace backlogs increased by 17%.\nLastly, we did start to generate positive momentum in our cash flow results. We had a strong year-on-year performance with operating cash flow up 29% and a 30% increase in free cash flow. And our free cash flow as a percentage of sales was 15.6% in the quarter. So as expected, we're starting to see improved cash flow from both higher earnings and improved working capital performance.\nMoving to Page 4. And before I turn things over to Tom to go through the quarterly results, I want to highlight a few of the key themes that are really underpinning our confidence in our long-term growth outlook. As noted here, we continue to benefit from the 3 secular growth trends that we reviewed earlier: electrification, energy transition and digitalization. And while still in the early stages, we booked some $700 million of new wins in the quarter that are directly tied to these trends.\nWithin electrification, you've all read the announcements of the very large number of manufacturing projects in the U.S. that includes new semiconductor facilities, big investments in new electric vehicle manufacturing plants, new EV battery investments and investments in EV charging infrastructure. In fact, there's been some $1.3 trillion of new projects announced this year alone. And the impact of stimulus bill is yet to show up in these numbers. These incentives will point towards large investments that are tied to improving electrical infrastructure and will deliver significant benefits over the next few years.\nThe next large growth driver is energy transition. The move away from fossil to renewables that's taken place for a number of years now, and this trend will only accelerate. And with every renewable resource addition, it requires electrical infrastructure. But it's not just, I'd say, connecting power to the grid. It's also investments in technology to keep the grid stable to manage different sources of electrical power, investments in batteries to store excess energy. And these are all products and services that we naturally provide.\nBeyond renewables, we're also seeing an increase in investments relating to improving grid resiliency, which has become a priority due to extreme weather events and really the demand for a need for energy independence.\nAnd lastly, our emerging digital society will drive higher selling prices as we add intelligence to our legacy products. We'll sell new value from data and insights and create new software solutions, all of which require data centers, an important growth segment for Eaton. These I say are just a few of the reasons why we remain confident and our electrical businesses and their ability to deliver higher levels of organic growth for some years to come.\nAnd as Slide 5 reflects, we have a number of attractive growth drivers in our industrial businesses as well. I'll begin with the most notable one, vehicle electrification. Here, the outlook for EV penetration continues to accelerate, but with new announcements coming almost every week. And I say here, not just in passenger cars, we're also seeing increasing need for electrification projects in commercial vehicles, some for the entire system but often for a subsystem of the vehicle. And I'd also note here the opportunities we're seeing tied to the acquisition of Royal Power are much larger than we anticipated, and our eMobility pipeline continues to be very robust. Just as a point of reference, our opportunity per vehicle on an EV is some 18x higher than the opportunity that we have on a traditional internal combustion engine. And you'll recall, we expect our eMobility segment to become $2 billion to $4 billion in revenue over the next number of years.\nThe next growth driver is tied to what we're doing in our legacy Vehicle business, which is finding new applications for existing technology. We're seeing a number of new opportunities for our commercial engine brake technology, for our mechanical gears that are used in electric vehicles, and for our advanced valve train actuation technology. In all 3 cases, we've already booked significant new wins here.\nThird, we're benefiting from the aerospace industry growth cycle, which, over the next several years, will continue to accelerate. Commercial passenger growth has continued to improve and it's translating into significant growth in commercial aftermarket orders, which, by the way, were up some 40% year-to-date. And commercial OEM build rates are forecasted to grow some 15% over the next 4 years.\nLastly, I'd note that with our acquisitions of Souriau and Mission Systems, we expect to see even better growth given our position on high-growth platforms and as we begin to realize sales synergies.\nOverall, just stepping back from this particular set of initiatives, we've delivered some $250 million of wins in industrial. And when added to what we noted in Electrical, we delivered almost $1 billion of growth tied to the secular growth trends in our markets.\nSo with that, what I'd like to do at this point is turn it over to Tom and ask him to walk through the quarterly results.\n\nThomas B. Okray\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Eaton Corporation plc\n\nThanks, Craig. I'll begin with noting a few key points regarding our Q3 results. Our revenue was up 8% with organic growth of 15%, partially offset by a 4% foreign exchange headwind and a 3% unfavorable net impact of acquisitions and divestitures.\nRelated to the acquisitions and divestitures, the acquisition of Royal Power increased revenue by 1% while the sale of Hydraulics reduced revenues by 3% -- by 4%, sorry, for a net of 3%. With total revenue growth of 8%, we posted solid operating leverage, with 15% growth in both operating profit and adjusted EPS.\nIt's worth noting that the foreign exchange headwind of 4% had an $0.08 impact on adjusted EPS, which was larger than our 3% guidance estimate. Further, growth in adjusted EPS of 15% would have been 22%, excluding the $0.08 impact from FX and the $0.03 net impact from acquisitions and divestitures. All in, stronger organic growth and higher margins enabled us to report adjusted EPS of $2.02 that was above our guidance midpoint.\nFinally, as we did last quarter, we continue to raise the bar with all-time records in adjusted EPS, segment operating profit and segment margin.\nMoving to the next slide. Electrical Americas had another very strong quarter. We set all-time records for sales, operating profit and margin. Revenue growth accelerated to 18% organically, driven by strength in all end markets, with particular strength in commercial and institutional, residential, industrial and utility end markets. Operating margin at 23.5% was up 180 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher volumes.\nWith respect to price, we continue to manage price effectively to more than offset inflationary pressures in the segment. In addition, our demand continues to remain very strong. Orders on a rolling 12-month basis accelerated sequentially, coming in at 36% year-over-year versus 29% in the prior quarter. Our orders were strong across the board, with particular strength in data center, utility and industrial end markets. This order growth translated into another record quarter of backlog, up 97%. On a sequential basis, backlog is up 14% versus the prior quarter. In addition to the robust trends in orders and backlog, our major project negotiations pipeline more than doubled year-over-year, driven by especially strong growth in manufacturing, data center, industrial and utility end markets.\nTurning to Page 8. Electrical Global results were also very strong, generating a Q3 record for revenue and all-time records for operating profit and margin. Organic growth was up 13% with an 8% foreign exchange headwind. Notably, this is the sixth quarter in a row of double-digit organic revenue growth. We saw solid organic growth in all regions with particular strength in our global Crouse-Hinds B-Line business and solid growth in both Europe and Asia Pacific. We posted record segment margin of 20.6%, up 50 basis points year-over-year. Similar to Electrical Americas, higher volume was a margin tailwind versus the prior year, and we continue to manage price effectively to more than offset inflationary pressures. Orders were up 14% organically on a rolling 12-month basis with strength in commercial and institutional and industrial end markets. Backlog growth remained strong at up 22%.\nBefore moving to our Industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the very strong results of our combined Electrical segment. For Q3, we posted accelerating organic growth of 16%, incremental margin of 33%, and operating margin of 22.3% with 130 basis points of year-over-year margin improvement. We also generated orders and backlog growth of 27% and 75%, respectively with more than doubling of our negotiation pipeline in the United States. We remain very well positioned for profitable growth in our overall electrical businesses.\nOur Aerospace segment results are captured on the next page. Aerospace also generated records in the quarter, with an all-time sales revenue record and a Q3 operating profit record. Organic revenue increased 8%, with 5% foreign exchange headwinds. Organic growth in the quarter was particularly strong in our commercial aftermarket and commercial OEM markets.\nEncouragingly, the military aftermarket grew in the quarter. Operating margin of 24% was up 200 basis points from the prior year, benefiting from volume growth. On a rolling 12-month basis, our order acceleration continued, now 22% versus up 19% last quarter, including military OEM markets that were also up 22%. We saw order strength in all end markets as travel continues to accelerate within commercial markets and military orders strengthened consistent with our expectations for increased defense spending. Backlog remained strong with a 17% increase over prior year and up 5% sequentially.\nMoving on to our Vehicle segment. Organic revenue grew 19%. We also experienced a 3% headwind from FX. We had strength in the North America, South America and [IEMA] markets. Our North American light motor vehicle business was especially strong with nearly 25% organic growth, while our South American business was up more than 35%.\nOperating margin of 16.8% was down 120 basis points versus prior year primarily due to manufacturing inefficiencies. However, it's important to note improvement in our ability to offset higher inflationary cost with price. This is reflected in sequential margin improvement of 150 basis points from Q2. Incremental margins on a sequential basis were up nearly 50%, with solid volume growth and continued progress on price cost.\nMoving to Page 11. We show results for our eMobility business. Revenues grew 63%, including 17% organic growth, 49% from the acquisition of Royal Power, and 3% foreign exchange headwind. We continued the trend of narrowing the operating loss on a year-over-year basis. This quarter, operating margin improved 800 basis points driven by organic volume growth and the impact from the Royal Power acquisition.\nWe are seeing continued momentum to achieve our $2 billion to $4 billion revenue target with new platform wins for power protection solutions, including additional Breaktor wins. Our opportunity pipeline remains robust for innovative power distribution, conversion and protection solutions.\nOn the following slide, we have a summary of our guidance for the year. As noted on the chart, we are reaffirming 2022 organic growth and operating margin guidance in total. Further, we are reaffirming both metrics for all segments, except eMobility operating margin. More specifically, we continue to expect organic growth in the range of 11% to 13% and operating margin from 20% to 20.4%.\nTurning to Page 13. We show the balance of guidance for 2022. We're not making significant changes to our full year outlook. We tightened our adjusted EPS range of $7.51 to $7.61 per share from the prior guide of $7.36 to $7.76. Consistent with the foreign exchange headwinds that we mentioned throughout the presentation, we increased the unfavorable translation impact to $600 million from $450 million in our previous guide. Our full year expectations for the other items are unchanged.\nWith respect to cash flow, orders and backlog have grown significantly more than our expectation. In addition, we have been and will continue to prioritize customers and profitable revenue growth at the expense of cash flow. Therefore, while we have good cash flow momentum in Q3, we have work to do to achieve our objectives.\nShifting to Q4. Highlighting a few key points on our Q4 guidance. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the $2 and $2.10 range, organic growth to be between 13% and 15%, and operating margin to be between 20.5% and 20.9%. Comparing to the prior year, adjusted EPS and operating margin guidance at the midpoint represents over 19% growth and 140 basis points increase, respectively.\nNow I will hand it back to Craig to walk us through our market outlook and wrap up the presentation.\n\nCraig Arnold\n\nChairman & CEO, Eaton Corporation plc\n\nThanks, Tom. Turning to Page 14, we provide an early look at our end market assumptions for 2023. And let me begin by saying that we are expecting to see a typical model recession next year, but don't expect it will have a significant impact on our growth given the secular growth trends, the strong orders and the record backlog that we're sitting on.\nWithin Electrical, data centers, industrial facilities and the utility market are all expected to see very good growth. Together, they account for approximately 40% of our total revenue and, quite frankly, have some of the strongest orders and backlogs in the company. As a point of reference, industrial projects announced this year so far are up some 300%. So you can see really strong momentum in these segments of the business.\nCommercial and institutional as well as machinery are expected to see more modest growth. Of note, orders in C&I continued to accelerate in the quarter with significant strength in government and institutional. And this is the segment where you'd imagine we expect to see significant benefits from stimulus spending.\nThe one relatively weak segment is expected to be residential. And while we've not seen a downturn yet and our orders are up some [23%] on a rolling 12-month basis through Q3, we do expect the [same one] of next year. I would, however, note that resi only accounts for 7% of the total company sales and that residential new build market will be somewhat offset by the renovation market, and the renovation market accounts for some 40% of our residential sales. And I'd also note that we'd expect to see higher electric content per home, which is what we've been seeing over the last number of years.\nWithin our Industrial sector, we're expecting it to be a big year for electric vehicles. Increasing government regulations and incentives and the large number of new EV introductions will keep the segment strong, quite frankly, for years to come.\nAnd in commercial aerospace and light motor vehicle markets, both expected to see a cyclical recovery. The need to rebuild inventories will support vehicle markets and the aerospace aftermarket growth and the ramp-up in commercial OEM production will drive aerospace markets higher next year.\nLastly, we expect commercial vehicle market to be flat but quite frankly at quite healthy levels. So in total, 85% of our markets are expected to see positive organic growth next year. We'll naturally provide more details on our specific organic growth assumptions during our February earnings call, but we did want to share our preliminary thinking and let you know that we expect 2023 to be another good year of growth for the company.\nAnd lastly, on Page 15, I'd like to close with maybe just a few points here. First, I'd say I'm pleased with our Q2 results, particularly with our strong margins, our earnings and our orders growth. We continue to manage the business well and delivered record profits despite ongoing supply chain challenges and inflationary environment, significant FX and interest headwinds.\nThe transformation of the portfolio has delivered what we promised, a higher-quality company with higher growth, higher margins and better earnings consistency. And for the balance of the year, we remain on track to deliver our commitments, including record operating margins, adjusted and adjusted earnings per share. And we're doing so despite offsetting once again the significant headwinds that I talked about around FX, pension and interest and these headwinds increase in Q4.\nAs we look into next year, we remain optimistic despite our recession expectations. We do expect a slowdown, and we'll be prepared in the event of a more significant downturn. We know how to flex our costs and deliver attractive decrementals. But as we've said, we have good reasons for optimism.\nSecond, the growth trends are driving strong momentum in our businesses, and we have a growing pipeline of opportunities. We're going into next year with strong momentum with record backlogs and with an expectation that many of the operational inefficiencies and supply chain disruptions will get materially better next year. So we feel great about the quarter, great about the outlook.\nAnd with that, we'll turn it back to you, Yan, for Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Yan Jin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSVP of IR, Eaton Corporation plc\n\nHi, good morning. I'm Yan Jin. Thank you for joining us for Eaton's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today include opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the company's performance in the second quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website.\nThis presentation, including adjusted earning per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures, they're reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay.\nI would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our current earnings release and the presentation.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Craig.\n\nCraig Arnold\n\nChairman & CEO, Eaton Corporation plc\n\nOkay. Thanks, Yan. Appreciate it. And we'll start with a summary of the quarter on Page 3, and I'll begin by noting that we had a strong quarter. We posted a number of all-time records, led by 11% organic growth. Our performance was particularly strong in our Electrical businesses, both in the Americas and Global. And as you can see, orders remain strong, and we continue to build record backlogs, supporting the outlook for the year and really, in many cases, I'd say, into next year.\nAnd I'd emphasize that nearly all of our end markets remain strong, but we're seeing significant strength in commercial, in industrial and data centers, and residential markets and our Electrical businesses. And in our Aerospace business, we saw strong growth, in the commercial business, both in aftermarket and in OEM. This strength, I'd say, is reflected in order growth in Electrical, which was up 25% and the Aerospace business, which was up 19% on a rolling 12-month basis. And our backlog was up some 74% in Electrical and 12% in Aerospace.\nAs reported, we also delivered adjusted EPS of $1.87, a 9% increase over prior year and an all-time record, more than offsetting a $0.12 headwind from the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. You'll recall that we own the Hydraulics business in all of Q2 last year. The $1.87 a share was close to the high end of our guidance range as well. We also posted an all-time record segment margins of 20.1%, up 150 basis points over prior year and above the high end of our guidance. So in addition to strong growth, our teams have done really an effective job of managing price to offset inflation.\nAnd lastly, we're raising our full year guidance as well. We're increasing our organic growth forecast from a range of up 9% to 11% to up 11% to 13%. And we're increasing our full year adjusted EPS to $7.56 at the midpoint, 14% year-on-year growth and despite additional headwinds from FX, from higher interest expense and lower pension income.\nMoving to Page 4, we show the financial results for the quarter. And I'll just note a few items here. First, our revenues were flat year-over-year, with 11% organic growth offset by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of some 9% and 2% from negative FX. And we're certainly very pleased with this level of organic growth, but I would also note that growth could have been much better but for persistent shortages of electronic components and COVID-related lockdowns in China.\nSecond, currency headwinds were worse than we expected in our guidance and almost $150 million impact versus prior year. As you'll see in our forward guidance, we expect this number to get worse in the second half. The FX headwinds will also reduce our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.05 in the quarter. Lastly, I'd like to emphasize that we really did achieve a number of all-time records in the quarter, including segment operating profit, segment operating margins and adjusted EPS.\nNext, on Page 5, we have the results of our Electrical Americas business, and really just a strong quarter across the board here. As you can see, organic growth up 16% and record segment margins of 23.2%. We delivered strong growth across all end markets, with particular strength in commercial, residential and industrial markets. And organic growth actually accelerated from Q1, up some 10%, with sequential acceleration in nearly all of our markets with the biggest increases coming from utility, data centers and commercial markets.\nWe did manage to -- through a number of fairly significant supply chain constraints, but did see improvements in metals and resins and logistics, but continue to see challenges in electronic components. Orders on a rolling 12-month basis were up 29%, with strength across all end markets with a range of anywhere from up 18% to up 39%. So we continue to be pleased with strong demand that we're seeing in our end markets and with our backlog, which increased some 89% to a new record level.\nOn a sequential basis, our backlog growth was up almost 20% from Q1. We also delivered record operating margins of 23.2%, up 190 points, driven largely by better-than-expected volumes. And of note, we were successful in offsetting inflation with price and expect this to continue to be on the plus side in the second half.\nTurning to Page 6. We show the results of our Electrical Global segment, which produced another very strong quarter, including all-time record sales. In fact, this is our fifth quarter in a row with double-digit organic revenue growth. Organic growth was 12%, with 7% headwind from currency. We saw growth in all regions with particular strength in data centers, commercial and industrial markets. And orders on a rolling 12-month basis were up some 19%, while our backlog grew 38% to a new record level. We also delivered record Q2 operating profits and operating margins. At 18.9%, operating margins were up some 60 basis points from prior year.\nAnd lastly, we recently closed a new joint venture in China by acquiring 50% of Jiangsu Huineng Electric, which manufactures and markets low-voltage circuit breakers in China for the renewable energy market. And I'd say here, this is our third electrical JV in China in the last 8 months, which allows us to expand our market participation by offering what we'd say is a multi-tiered portfolio of products serving this very high-growth market, both inside and outside of China. And on a combined basis, these 3 JVs increase our addressable market to about -- by about $17 billion. And so really important part of our future growth strategy coming out of these JVs.\nBefore we move to our industrial businesses, here's what I'd summarize the performance of our combined Electrical business. Overall, our electrical sector posted a strong Q2, with 14% organic growth and a 150 basis points improvement in margins. And of note, we really have not seen a slowdown in any of our markets. We continue to see strong growth in orders and backlogs are at record levels. And I'd say that the secular growth trends that we've discussed in the past, including energy transition, are clearly showing up in our order book.\nMoving to Page 7. We have a recap of our Aerospace segment. Revenues increased 19%, including 10% organic growth, 12% growth coming from Mission Systems acquisition and 3% currency headwind. Organic growth in the quarter was particularly strong in our commercial aftermarket and commercial OEM businesses. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders increased 19% while backlog was up 12%.\nIn the commercial market, as many of you read, travel continues to show positive improvements in both domestic and international markets, certainly a positive indicator for future growth and is consistent with what we saw in the quarter. I would add that while strong, our commercial aftermarket bookings are only at 85% to 90% of their pre-pandemic levels. So we still have ample room for additional growth in this particular segment. And commercial OEM activities, as you've read, also continued to recover.\nFor military markets, we expect to see increased tailwinds in defense spending, including an uptick in U.S. defense budgets. We've already seen renewed commitments from the European NATO members and expect this to lead to increased defense spending over the next several years. We're also pleased with the profitability of this segment as operating margin stepped up 90 basis points to 21.9%. You'll recall that the peak margins for our Aerospace business was 25%, so we expect this number to continue to move up over the next few years.\nNext, on Page 8, we summarize the performance of our Vehicle segment. Revenues were up 5%, which includes 7% organic growth and 2% negative currency. We had particular strength in the North America light vehicle markets and in our South America business, which was partially offset by flat performance in Europe and weakness in China largely due to the COVID lockdowns. Operating margins were down some 260 basis points, driven primarily by margin compression from inflationary costs and the normal lag in our ability to recover price in the marketplace. We do expect that the price inflation equation will improve in the second half, and it's reflected in our outlook for the year.\nTurning to Page 9. We show the results of our eMobility business. Revenues increased 55%, which includes 11% organic growth, 46% from the acquisition of Royal Power and a negative 2% currency impacts. During the quarter, we also delivered more than $70 million of material wins, including a number of wins that leverage our core competency as a company in power distribution and power protection. And while still slightly negative, we narrowed the operating losses by some 530 basis points. This improvement was delivered -- generated by higher volumes and certainly by the acquisition of Royal Power.\nI'd also note that at the 6-month point, our integration of Royal Power remains on track, and the expected synergies allowing Eaton to sell a broader solution to the marketplace is playing out just as we had hoped. Overall, we continue to make steady progress towards our 2030 goal, which is to create a $2 billion to $4 billion business with attractive 15% segment margins. And as we noted at our investor meeting earlier this year, we expect the segment to deliver $1.2 billion of revenues and 11% margins by 2025.\nNext, on Slide 10, we have the updated guidance for 2022. As you can see, for the second time this year, we're increasing our organic growth guidance for all but one of our segments really based upon continued strength in all of our end markets. We're raising our overall organic growth from 9% to 11% to 11% to 13%, on the back really of strength in our Electrical segment, where we've increased growth by 300 basis points in the Americas and 150 basis points in Global.\nFor margins, we're raising our full year guidance for Eaton to be in the range of 20% to 20.4%, which represents, at the midpoint, 130 basis point improvement over 2021. The 2 changes in the segment include increasing margin guidance for Electrical Americas by 70 basis points to 22.2% at the midpoint and lowering our margin targets for Vehicle by 120 basis points to 16.5% at the midpoint. And as we talked about, the Vehicle reduction really reflects the timing and margin compression associated with inflation versus price realization that we discussed earlier. So overall, I'd say a strong first half, including robust demand in orders, record levels of backlog, and we're very well positioned for the year.\nMoving to Page 11. We show the balance of our guidance for the year. For the second time this year, we're raising our '22 guidance for adjusted EPS, which is now forecast to be between $7.36 and $7.76 a share. And as I covered on prior pages, we're increasing our organic growth outlook to 11% to 13%. I would note this is partially offset by $450 million of negative currency, which compares to our previous guidance of negative $250 million. The stronger dollar requires us to, in this case, offset some additional $0.08 of earnings versus our prior guidance, which we are clearly doing and is reflected in our outlook.\nWe also expect that our corporate expenses will now be $20 million to $40 million above 2021 levels or between $580 million and $600 million. So another $0.04 to $0.08 headwind that we are offsetting in our adjusted EPS guidance for the year. And this is primarily due to higher interest expense and lower pension income.\nSo to recap, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance by 4% -- by $0.04 despite between $0.12 to $0.16 of incremental headwinds from FX, interest and pension. The remainder of our full year guidance remains unchanged. And now just a few highlights on our Q3 guidance. We expect adjusted EPS to be between $1.95 and $2.05 per share, organic growth to be between 13% and 15%, and segment margins to be between 20.6% and 21%. And at the midpoint of our guidance, margins are expected to be up some 70 basis points from Q2. And at EPS midpoint of $2 a share, our Q3 guidance represents 14% growth versus prior year.\nSo just wrapping up on Page 12, just to recap a few points. First, I'd say we continue to realize the benefits of our active portfolio management, which is certainly showing up in our record levels of financial performance. Second, we're seeing secular trends that are enhancing our end market growth rate now, and we fully expect this to continue into the future. We've discussed growth in electrification and energy transition and digitalization for some time now. And these trends, really, I'd say, have only accelerated.\nSo despite all the talk about a potential slowdown and downturn in the market, and we'll be ready if we have one, we're focused on investing to capitalize on what we see as the super growth cycle, driven by favorable trends and the recovery in some of our other end markets. So every time you hear sustainability, climate change and resiliency, you're really hearing about growth opportunities for our company that we're capitalizing on today and will be for the foreseeable future. And this is certainly showing up in our sales results, our orders and our backlog, which are all at record levels.\nNow these factors obviously contribute to our confidence in our ability to raise guidance for the year. But more importantly, I'd say they really give us confidence in the long-term outlook for the company. In the short term, we're working through supply chain disruptions, focusing on controlling the things that we can control, building more resilience in our operations and delivering our commitments. So with that, I'll turn it back to Yan, and we'll open it up for Q&A.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSVP of IR, Eaton Corporation plc\n\nOkay. Good. Thanks, Craig. (Operator Instructions) With that, I will turn it to the operator to give you guys the instruction."

Welcome to the Eaton fourth quarter earnings call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Yan Jin. Please go ahead.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSVP of IR, Eaton Corporation plc\n\nOkay. Good morning, guys. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earning Calls. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President and the Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today, including opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the company's performance in the first quarter. As we have done in our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website.\nThis presentation, including adjusted earning per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures, they're reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay.\nI would like to remind you that our comments today will including statements related to expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projected -- forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and presentation.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Craig.\n\nCraig Arnold\n\nChairman & CEO, Eaton Corporation plc\n\nThanks, Yan. And we'll start on Page 3 with highlights for the quarter. Overall, I'd say we had a strong start to the year, Q1 coming in modestly better than guidance despite additional headwinds and commodities in the quarter. We had a particularly strong quarter in our Electrical Global and Aerospace businesses, and this enables us to deliver a first quarter record for adjusted EPS of $1.62, a 13% increase over prior year.\nOur sales were $4.8 billion, up 10% organically from last year, and this was above the high end of our guidance range of 7% to 9%. Most of our end markets remained strong with significant strength in industrial, commercial, residential markets for electrical and commercial aftermarket and commercial OE for aerospace. And our orders continue to accelerate, allowing us to post another record for backlog.\nFor our combined Electrical business, orders on a rolling 12-month basis were up 30%, an acceleration from last quarter, which was up 21%. And our backlog for Electrical was up 76% compared to up 56% at the end of 2021. Our Aerospace business also had a significant increase in demand with orders on a rolling 12-month basis up 35% organically compared to up 19% at year-end. We also posted a first quarter record operating margins of 18.8%, which were at the high end of our guidance range, and 110 basis points over prior year. So overall, a good quarter with healthy end markets and solid execution in what remains a challenging environment overall.\nAnd I'd say we're also executing well on our strategic growth initiatives as noted here on Slide 4. Highlighted here are several new wins tied to the secular growth trends that we're focused on. We've talked about electrification, energy transition and digitalization. Overall, we continue to see an acceleration in each of these important growth drivers and are convinced that we have the right growth strategy.\nIn the interest of time, I'll highlight one of these recent wins, but we're happy to provide more detail on a follow-up call. While we're not at liberty to disclose the customer, we had another very significant win on an energy transition project. This was a very large follow-on order for EV charging stations in the U.S., where we're providing the full suite of Eaton solutions, including power distribution equipment, entity storages, inverters, control automation and remote monitoring software. And we continue to work on a number of big opportunities focused on building out the needed electrical charging infrastructure given the explosive growth in electric vehicles. Now as the world continues to embrace sustainability, our technologies will continue to play a key part of this solution.\nMoving to Page 5, we summarize our key financial metrics for the quarter. And I'll just note a few highlights here. First, 3% revenue growth included 10% organic growth, offset by net headwind of 6% from acquisition and divestitures. And this was primarily the Cobham and the Tripp Lite acquisitions, offset by the divestiture of Hydraulics. Our acquisitions added 6 points of growth, while the divestiture of Hydraulics reduced growth by 12 points. We also had negative FX of 1% in the quarter.\nSecond, with 3% revenue growth, we posted solid operating leverage with 9% growth in operating profits and even stronger adjusted growth and -- adjusted EPS growth of 13%. And third, like last quarter, both adjusted EPS of $1.62 and segment operating margins of 18.8% were Q1 records. Now this strong financial performance, we think, underscores the power of our portfolio transformation and our ability to execute well under challenging operating conditions.\nNext on Page 6, we have the results of our Electrical Americas segment. Here, revenues increased 17%, including organic growth of 10%. And just as a comparison, this compares with 5% in Q4 and 1% in Q3. The acquisition of Tripp Lite added 7 points of growth. Our organic sales growth was driven by strength in industrial and residential markets overall. And as you can imagine, we're still working through supply chain constraints, which saw modest improvements in the quarter but remain challenging.\nOperating margins were 19.1%, down 140 basis points from last year. And this decline was driven primarily by higher input costs and supply chain inefficiencies and also some increased growth-related investments. Importantly, we were successful in fully offsetting the expected inflationary costs with price increases on a dollar basis. However, we did not earn incremental margins on inflation, which did compress margins. As you'll see in our full year guidance, we expect this to improve, and we continue to expect 90 basis points of margin improvement for the full year.\nAnd as I mentioned in my opening comments, market demand remained strong. We had very strong order growth. Our rolling 12-month orders were up 31%, and this compares to up 20% in Q4. So things continue to accelerate. We had strength across all end markets with a range of up 28% to up 36%, and this led to a record backlog, which increased 86% on an organic basis. And on a sequential basis, we posted a large $1.3 billion increase in our backlog.\nMoving to Page 7, we have a summary of our Electrical Global business, where we had another very strong quarter. Our organic growth was 18% with 3% headwind from currency. We saw strength in all regions with particular strength in commercial and industrial markets. We also generated strong operating leverage, delivering record Q1 operating margins of 19.4% and incremental margins of 36%. Similar to Q4, this included some favorable mix from our exposure to growing industrial end markets, but we expect this to continue. And as we saw in the Americas, orders on a rolling 12-month basis continue to accelerate, up 27% in Q1 compared to up 22% in Q4.\nWe had strength across all end markets with a range of up 22% to up 41%%. And I say for the fourth quarter in a row, we continued to grow our backlog by 50% or more and achieved a new record in the quarter. So our Electrical Global business is very well positioned for continued strong growth overall.\nJust before we move to the industrial businesses, here's the way that I'd really summarize the performance of our combined Electrical business. The business delivered strong organic growth of 14%, built a sizable backlog which strengthens certainly our outlook for future quarters, and we improved margin by 20 basis points. So on balance, I'd say, once again, a strong quarter given the current operating environment.\nLet's move to Page 8, where we recap our Aerospace segment. As you can see, we delivered very strong results here with revenues up 38%. This includes 15% organic growth and 25% from the acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems and 2% currency headwind. Organic growth in the quarter was especially strong in commercial aftermarket and commercial OEM markets and certainly including business jets. Operating margins were 22.1%, up 360 basis points versus prior year, and incremental margins were solid at 32%.\nAnother area of strength was accelerating orders, where -- which we saw a rolling 12-month orders up 35% in the quarter, and this compares to up 19% in Q4. We also ended the quarter here with a record backlog on an organic basis, up 14%. And consistent with the broader message of industry recovery, we're currently pursuing $1.3 billion of life of the program opportunities for strategic military and commercial programs, all incremental revenue, so another segment that I'd say that's very well positioned for growth today and for years to come.\nNext, on Page 9, we have the financial summary of our Vehicle business. Revenues were up 3%, all organic. We continue to see solid growth in North America aftermarket business and in our South America business, which was offset by weakness in global light vehicle markets. As you've read, this market continued to experience significant supply chain constraints, which certainly impacted revenues in the quarter. Just as markets here begin to see some improvements, supply chain issues tied to primarily the war in the Ukraine had a particularly large impact on this market. These constraints also contributed to operating inefficiencies in our business and a 50 basis point reduction in our operating margins.\nWe're undertaking a number of price- and cost-related measures to offset the additional inflation, but it will certainly take some time to get these in place, but certainly something we plan to do before the end of the year.\nTurning to growth. During our investor meeting earlier this year, we provided an overview of how we're transforming the business by focusing on new spaces and products not tied to the internal combustion engine. And the team is seeing good progress. We continue to see new wins, including a win with a Chinese OEM for our electronic traction control devices. We're also pursuing a pipeline worth $500 million in annual revenue for our powertrain solutions for leading EV OEMs, once again, all incremental. So I'd say that we're well on our way to transforming our legacy Vehicle business by selling into EV and other new markets. And so this business is performing very much like we expected.\nMoving to Page 10, we summarize our eMobility segment. Revenues increased 52%, including 7% organic and 46% from the acquisition of Royal Power with 1% negative currency. While still negative, we narrowed the operating loss in the quarter, and then we expect to generate positive margins for the year. And the outlook for this market continues to strengthen. Consistent with what you're hearing, we're actively pursuing some $2 billion of new program opportunities, and this number is really growing every quarter.\nI'd also note that our acquisition of Royal Power added almost $600 million of pipeline opportunities focused on their innovative solutions for terminal connectors and high-voltage busbars. As a reminder here, our area of focus in eMobility is around power distribution, power conversion and power protection. And in the area of power protection, we had previously announced that when using our Breaktor technology with a major European OEM manufacturer. That customer just awarded Eaton with significant additional volume as they are expanding the use of our innovative technology to more of their vehicle platforms. And so once again, another segment where things are progressing very much in the way that we anticipated.\nNow let's turn to Page 11, where we summarize our updated organic revenue and margin guidance for the year. Overall, and I'd say despite uncertainties in the broader macro environment, we continue to experience strong demand in our end markets. We're increasing our guidance on organic growth for all segments, which results in Eaton's total organic growth stepping up from a range of 7% to 9% to our -- now our expectation of 9% to 11%. This growth outlook, I'd say, is easily supported by our ongoing growth in orders and growing backlog.\nFor margins, we're reaffirming our full year guidance for Eaton at 19.9% to 20.3%, which represents a 120 basis point increase over 2021 at the midpoint. Note, while we've increased organic revenues, we're maintaining our margin outlook. And I'd say this is largely due to additional inflation that we've experienced in the year and expect to see for the balance of the year. We continue to increase prices to offset inflation, but I'd say we're experiencing kind of a normal timing impact and not getting a normal margin on top of inflation.\nWithin Electrical, we're reaffirming our margins for Electrical Americas and increasing the guidance range for Electrical Global by 10 basis points. We've also increased margins for our Aerospace business by 20 basis points and eMobility by 50 basis points. These 3 segments are offsetting the lower margins that we're now expecting in our Vehicle business due to margin compression from the new wave of inflation that we experienced in the quarter and expect for the year and some inefficiencies as well in our operations. But at the midpoint, we expect to deliver record margins and to be north of 20% for the first time in Eaton's history. So on balance, a very strong year.\nTurning to Page 12, we provide the balance of our guidance for the year. We're raising our '22 guidance on adjusted EPS to between $7.32 and $7.72, which is 14% growth at the midpoint and reflective of what we think is going to be a strong year. We're increasing our organic growth, as we talked about, from 9% to 11%. And this is partially offset by $250 million of negative currency compared to our original guidance, where we thought currency would be flat for the year. So if you think about it, we're also offsetting approximately $0.10 of headwinds from negative currency in our earnings. But for the new FX headwinds, we'd certainly be taking our guidance up more than we did today. And we did complete $86 million of share repurchases in the quarter, and we're on track for a full year guidance of $200 million to $300 million for the year.\nLastly, our Q2 guidance includes adjusted EPS forecast between $1.78 and $1.88 for Q2; organic revenue growth between 7 -- excuse me, 9% and 11%; negative currency, we think, will be $75 million; and 8% net revenue impact from M&A. For segment margins, our Q2 guidance is 19.1% to 19.5%, which is a sequential improvement of 50 basis points at the midpoint from Q1. And if you adjust for the $0.10 headwind from M&A, our year-on-year EPS growth in Q2 would be 12%, so roughly in line with our full year guidance for the year of 14%.\nLastly, on Page 13, I'll summarize by making here just kind of a few closing comments. As many of you heard at our Investor Day and as I highlighted at the start of the presentation, we continue to experience accelerating growth in our end markets. The secular growth trends are really playing out very much the way we anticipated, and it's really underpinning our strategy as a global intelligent power management company. We're delivering key project wins, for sure, that are also accelerating our growth rate. These 2 revenue drivers are certainly showing up in our order book and growing backlog. So very much just a case of markets inflecting positively. And despite high inflation and supply chain challenges, we're growing our margins.\nI would also point out that based upon our Q1 actuals and Q2 guidance, we expect to generate 46% of our full year adjusted EPS in the first half, and this is in line with our historical averages of -- for first half earnings. So as the global economy continues to face unprecedented number of challenges, I'd say you can count on our team to continue to execute well to deliver our commitments in both the short and the long term.\nSo with that, I'll turn it back to Yan for Q&A.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSVP of IR, Eaton Corporation plc\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks, Craig. Now it's time for the Q&A. I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instruction."

Please go ahead.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSVP of IR, Eaton Corporation plc\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm Yan Jin, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earning Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today, including the opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the company's performance in the fourth quarter. We'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments.\nThe press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website.

Thanks, Yan. Let's start on Page 3 with a few highlights of the quarter, and I'll begin by saying that, and despite what's now very well publicized and ongoing supply chain issues, our team delivered solid results in the quarter and a record performance for the year. And in Q4, we generated adjusted EPS of $1.72, a fourth quarter record.\nOur sales of $4.8 billion, up 6% organically. And I'd say here, we had particular strength in residential, data centers and in industrial markets. And I'd say also our aftermarket businesses in both commercial aerospace and vehicle continued to deliver strong growth. We were certainly impacted by supply chain constraints, which had an impact on our revenue, and I'd say especially in our Electrical Americas and our Vehicle segment.\nThe good news is the markets remained strong. Order growth accelerated in the quarter, and we ended the year with a record backlog. For our combined Electrical business, orders were up 21% on a rolling 12-month basis, and our backlog was up 56%. Our Aerospace business also had a significant increase in orders, up 19% on a rolling 12-month basis, and the backlog was up 16%.\nWe also continue to post strong segment margins, 19.3% in the quarter and a Q4 record. And I'd say here, the actions that we've taken to mitigate inflation, our portfolio changes and the restructuring savings are all contributing to the strong incremental margin performances. I'd also note that we benefited from favorable mix in the quarter. And I'd say that our portfolio changes continue to be an important part of our strategy.\nWe're pleased to have completed the Royal Power Solutions transaction a few weeks ago. And the addition of Royal Power will allow us to accelerate our growth in eMobility, and actually in the broader electrical market as the economy continues to adopt more electric solutions. So I'd say, I think you'd agree that we're not sitting still. We're managing the things that we control operationally, while continuing to advance our strategic agenda.\nMoving to Page 4. I'll highlight a few additional points on our quarterly results. First, total revenues of up 2%. We increased operating profit by 14%. So continue to demonstrate strong operating leverage. Second, acquisitions increased revenues by 7%, which was more than offset by the sale of Hydraulics, which was a 10% headwind. And while not complete, we're certainly pleased with our progress on the portfolio. We continue to drive changes to support our overall goals of creating a company with higher growth, higher margins and more earnings consistency.\nThird, I'd just point out that our margins of 19.3%, as I noted, were above the guidance range of 18.8% to 19.2% and I think a good indicator of our team's ability to execute operationally while once again, managing the things that are in our control. And lastly, we noted both adjusted EPS of $1.72, and second, margins of 19.3% were Q4 records in the face of these significant supply chain constraints that we've been dealing with.\nNext, on Page 5, we show the financial results of our Electrical Americas segment. Revenues were up 13%, 5% organic and 8% from the Tripp Lite acquisition. The organic sales growth was really driven by strength in residential, industrial and data center markets. And on a sequential basis, our organic growth did step up from 1% in Q3 to 5%. So we're making progress but still, as I noted, continue to be impacted by supply chain constraints. In some cases, our ability to meet demand was also impacted by labor availability as we had the spike in the Omicron version, certainly at the end of the year.\nOperating margins of 19.2% were down 190 basis points year-over-year, and the decline was driven really by higher input costs, labor and supply chain inefficiencies and disruptions in our facilities. And on price recovery, we're making good progress. We made good progress in the quarter, but certainly not fast enough to prevent some margin erosion on the net between inflation and price and the way that plays through to operating margins.\nAnd as noted in my opening remarks, market demand remained strong, which was reflected in orders and the growth in our backlog. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up some 20%, accelerating from up 17% in Q3 and 13% in Q2. And our backlog reached another record, up 57% from last year, and that's 7% higher than it was in Q3. The strongest markets continue to be residential and data centers. And I'd say here also beyond orders, we also have strong momentum in our negotiation pipeline, which was up some 11% in the quarter.\nTurning to Page 6. We summarize our Electrical Global segment. And as you can see, we delivered really strong results in this segment. Organic growth was 15% with strength in all regions and particular strength in commercial data center and industrial markets. We also delivered significant operating leverage with operating margins of 19.5% and incremental margins of 40%. We did have a little bit of favorable mix here from our exposure to industrial end markets, but we do expect this to continue.\nLike the Americas, orders remained strong, a 22% increase on a rolling 12-month basis and a step-up from the 17% number we posted in Q3. And our growth -- and our backlog remained above 50%. In this segment, the order strength was especially strong in data centers, residential and utility markets. Yes, so I'd say overall, I'd say that our Electrical Global business had a very strong quarter on top of a strong year and is really carrying a lot of strong momentum into 2022.\nMoving to Page 7, we summarize the results for our Aerospace segment. As you can see, we had a strong quarter. The industry recovery has certainly begun. Revenues increased 40%, 4% organic, 37% from the acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems. And currency had a 1% negative impact.\nAftermarket and biz jet. This was partially offset by weakness in military markets. Operating margins were 24.9%, an all-time record and up 660 basis points from prior year. In the quarter, we had solid incremental margins of more than 40%, which were helped by favorable mix, particularly the growth in aftermarket and by our portfolio actions.\nAnother bright spot in the quarter was the growth in orders in backlog. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders turned positive in Q3 and were up 19% in Q4 with particular strength in commercial markets. Commercial transport, biz jets and commercial aftermarket were all up significantly. And lastly, our backlog was up 16% from last year.\nNext, on Page 8, we show the financial results of our vehicle business. Revenue was down 2%: 1% organic, 1% from currency. We had strong organic growth in North America truck and in our South America business, which was offset by weakness in global light vehicle markets. As you're aware, we had certainly significant supply chain constraints in this segment, including a number of customer shutdowns that impacted our revenue. We do have -- we think the worst is behind us here, and we'll see improvement in supply chain-related disruptions this year. Overall, I think our team executed well, delivering solid margins of 16.4% and decremental margins of 30%.\nTurning to Page 9. We have the results for our eMobility business. Revenues were up 4% with growth in North America and Asia, partly offset by weakness in Europe. Like our vehicle business, we experienced significant supply chain constraints and customer shutdowns in this segment. And operating margins were a negative 9.1% as we continued to invest heavily in R&D and start-up costs associated with new program wins.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we acquired Royal Power Solutions in January, and it will be reported within the eMobility segment. This is an important acquisition. It's part of our strategy to improve the long-term growth rate of Eaton. First, it expands our addressable market for eMobility with a portfolio of highly engineered terminal connectors for electrical applications.\nSecond, Royal Power has a strong track record of profitable growth and will continue to grow as the electrical content in vehicles continue to expand. And third, Royal will allow us to offer a more complete customer solution as we bundle their products with our own power protection and power conversion products that we're selling in eMobility markets.\nAnd I'd say here, with organic growth momentum, the completion of Royal Power acquisition, we're well positioned to realize our long-term objective here, which is building a new $2 billion to $4 billion eMobility business inside of Eaton. And our cumulative new program wins are now at $800 million of material revenue when you include the impact of new wins from Royal Power.\nMoving to Page 10. I'll just take a minute to recap 2021 performance before we turn our focus to 2022. First, we delivered strong organic growth for the year, up 10%, with significant strength in our Electrical Global segment, up 15%; Vehicle, up 21%; and eMobility, up 16%. And I'm especially proud of the team for delivering record segment margins of 18.9%, a 250 basis point improvement over 2020 despite the challenging supply chain environment. Our team executed at a high level and delivered incremental margins of 43%.\nWe also had one of the most transformative years in the history of the company when you think about the portfolio. We completed $8 billion of portfolio actions towards our goal of building this high-growth, higher-margin company with more earnings consistency. And we're off to a good start in 2022 with another value-enhancing acquisition in Royal Power.\nThe result of our disciplined execution, the transformative portfolio of actions allowed us to deliver 35% growth in adjusted EPS. And importantly, our shareholders were well rewarded for their commitment to Eaton with a total shareholder return of 47% for the year. Our 2021 results certainly set a high bar for what we expect of ourselves and I'm sure what you expect of others of us as well. But we're up for the challenge, and we think the best years are still in front of us.\nSo let's just turn our focus to 2022. On Page 11, we show organic growth and margin guidance by segment. Overall, we expect organic growth to be 7% to 9%. Starting with our Electrical businesses. Americas and Global are both expected to grow 7% to 9%, and we expect these businesses to see growth really across all end markets, with particular strength continuing in data centers, distributed IT and industrial markets.\nIn Aerospace, we expect organic growth of 10% to 12% with strong growth in both commercial OE and aftermarket channels. Our base assumption here is that travel continues to expand from the COVID impact the downturns without any significant new variant. And we expect low single-digit growth in military markets. For Vehicle, we're anticipating organic growth of 7.5% to 9.5% with strength in both light motor vehicles and truck markets. And in eMobility, we're expecting organic growth to be 11% to 13% driven by the continued strength in electric vehicles.\nAnd just turning to segment margins. We expect Eaton to be between 19.9% and 20.3%. At the midpoint, this is a 120 basis point improvement over our record margins that we delivered in 2021. And we expect to see margin expansion in all of our segments.\nTurning to Page 12, we cover the balance of our 2022 guidance. Organic growth, as we noted, is expected to be 7% to 9%, with acquisitions and divestitures subtracting 3.5%, and currency is expected to be flat. We're also forecasting cost to be flat and our tax rate to be between 16% and 17%. Adjusted EPS is projected to be in a range of $7.30 to $7.70, at the midpoint of $7.50, a 13% increase. Operating cash flow is expected to be between $3 billion and $3.2 billion, and CapEx will be approximately $650 million.\nAt the midpoint, our operating cash flow is expected to increase 15% versus last year. Our free cash flow is expected to be between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion and at the midpoint of $2.5 billion, also a 15% increase. This represents free cash flow to sales of approximately 12% and free cash flow to net income of approximately 100%. And we expect share repurchases to be between $200 million and $300 million, and this really reflects our pivot to what we think is going to be a higher priority on tuck-in acquisitions.\nAnd lastly, our Q1 guidance is as follows. We expect adjusted EPS to be between $1.55 and $1.65, organic revenue growth to be up 7% to 9%, segment margins to come in between 18.4% and 18.8%, and we expect our tax rate to be between 15% and 16%.\nAnd if you'd just allow me for a moment, if I could just close with, once again, Page 13, which is a brief summary on how we think you should think about the company. I'd say, first, our top line is supported by strong secular growth trends. And I'd say of note, most of this growth impact is just beginning to show up in our revenue. So most of it's still out in front of us.\nWe've proven that we know how to expand margins and are comfortable with our ability to deliver 11% to 13% EPS growth over our planning horizon. We also have clear capital allocation priorities and a disciplined approach to M&A, which we think is paying off. As a result, I'd say we're a different company today. We've transformed our portfolio. We're now a company that will deliver higher growth, better margins, more earnings consistency. And I'd say, once again, we're not done.\nWe also have a long-standing commitment to ESG. It remains at the forefront of what we do every day. In fact, the sustainability for us is really a part of how we drive growth in the company. Many of you have gotten to know our Chief Sustainability Officer, Harold Jones, and you'll be hearing more from him at our investor meeting next month.\nIn the short term, you can count on us to continue to manage through these operating challenges as a result of COVID, the supply chain disruptions and labor shortages by managing the things we can control. 2021, we think, was an important proof point on our journey to transform the company, and we're proud of our results. More importantly, we're ready to do it again this year.\nNow I'll turn it back to Yan, and we'll be happy to address your questions.\n\nYan Jin\n\nSVP of IR, Eaton Corporation plc\n\nThank you, Craig. (Operator Instructions) Thank you, once again, for your cooperation. With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instructions."

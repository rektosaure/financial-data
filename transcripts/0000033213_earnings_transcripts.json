[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Cameron Horwitz, Managing Director, Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.\n\nCameron Jeffrey Horwitz\n\nAnalyst, U.S. Capital Advisors LLC\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2025 earnings results conference call. With me today are Toby Rice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeremy Knop, Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, Toby and Jeremy will present their prepared remarks with a question-and-answer session to follow. An updated investor presentation has been posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website, and we will reference certain slides during today's discussion. A replay of today's call will be available on our website beginning this evening.\nI'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. Actual results and future events could materially differ from these forward-looking statements because of factors described in yesterday's earnings release, in our investor presentation, the Risk Factors section of our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and the subsequent filings we make with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update forward-looking statements. Today's call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our most recent earnings release and investor presentation for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. With that, I'll turn the call over to Toby.\n\nToby Z. Rice\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThanks, Cam, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter results built upon EQT's strong track record of operational and financial outperformance. Our performance this quarter resulted in $484 million of free cash flow attributable to EQT, which is net of $21 million of onetime costs associated with the Olympus transaction. We have now generated cumulative free cash flow attributable to EQT of more than $2.3 billion over the past 4 quarters with natural gas prices averaging just $3.25 per million Btu, highlighting the differentiated cash flow generation capabilities of EQT's low-cost integrated business model.\nProduction was near the high end of guidance despite price-related curtailments as we continue to benefit from robust well productivity and compression project outperformance. Our tactical approach to volume curtailments in response to volatile local pricing resulted in another quarter of significant price realization outperformance with our corporate differential coming in $0.12 tighter than the midpoint of guidance despite local basis widening after we provided Q3 guidance.\nOperating costs were also lower than expected across the board, driving record low total cash cost per unit and underscoring ongoing benefits from water infrastructure investments and midstream cost optimization. Capital spending came in roughly $70 million below the midpoint of guidance, supported by further upstream efficiency gains and midstream optimization. Our team set multiple EQT and basin-wide records during the quarter, including our highest pumping hours ever in a month, our fastest quarterly completion pace on record and the most lateral footage drilled and completed in a 24-hour period. Simply put, our execution machine is firing on all cylinders.\nTurning to our acquisition of Olympus Energy. We closed the transaction on July 1 and completed the full integration of all upstream and midstream operations in just 34 days. This marks the fastest operational transition in EQT's acquisition history. Our teams have already achieved significant operational improvements since taking control of the assets. An example of this is in the Deep Utica, where we drilled two wells during the third quarter at a pace that was nearly 30% faster than Olympus' historic performance, driving an estimated $2 million of per well cost savings. Deep Utica inventory represents significant long-term upside optionality on the Olympus assets, which we ascribed 0 value to in the purchase price.\nOlympus' production also provides a significant supply source to feed the Homer City data center project that we announced last quarter, underscoring how assets can become more valuable once they are part of EQT's platform and our ability to unlock sustainable growth. Shifting to our growth project pipeline. We have made significant progress with the various in-basin power projects that we announced last quarter and are seeing additional opportunities to provide natural gas supply and infrastructure to service new load growth in Appalachia.\nWe also completed an exceptionally strong and oversubscribed open season on our MVP Boost expansion project. Demand far exceeded our initial expectations. And as a result, we collaborated with our vendors and partners to upsize the project by 20%, increasing capacity to over 600,000 [ dekatherms ] per day. Even with the additional capacity, the region's appetite for Appalachian natural gas remains greater than what we can currently provide, a clear signal of continued market strength and long-term demand growth.\nThe MVP Boost project is 100% underpinned by 20-year capacity reservation fee contracts with the leading Southeastern utilities, highlighting the depth and durability of these customer commitments. We estimate a 3x adjusted EBITDA build multiple for the expansion project, highlighting how strong the economics are for low-risk infrastructure investments in our midstream business. Once expanded by the Boost project, MVP will have a total capacity of 2.6 Bcf per day of gas, which is more than 1 Bcf per day greater than current flow rates on the MVP mainline due to downstream bottlenecks, which will be solved when the Transco Southbound and northbound expansion projects are completed in 2027 and 2028. This additional takeaway should come online at the same time that in-basin power demand is inflecting higher, which we expect will drive improvement in Appalachian pricing over the coming years. In fact, the futures market is already starting to take note with M2 bases futures in 2029 and 2030, tightening by more than $0.20 over the past few months.\nIn summary, our third quarter performance once again demonstrates the power of EQT's integrated model and our relentless drive for continuous improvement. From record-setting operational efficiency through seamless acquisition integration and advancement of strategic growth projects, all aspects of our business are performing at a high level. The strength and consistency of our results, even in a moderate gas price environment reflects the quality of our company, the durability of our low-cost structure and depth of our opportunity set. The foundation we've built at EQT is strong. Our strategy is working, and our future has never been brighter. I'll now turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy T. Knop\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Toby. Our strong financial results and free cash flow outperformance left our balance sheet in a stronger-than-expected position during the third quarter. Despite approximately $600 million of cash outflows from closing the Olympus transaction, the previously disclosed legal settlement and working capital impacts, our net debt balance ended the quarter just under $8 billion.\nWe continue to target a maximum of $5 billion of total debt, which is 3x unlevered free cash flow before strategic growth CapEx at a $2.75 natural gas price. With $19 billion of forecasted cumulative free cash flow attributable to EQT over the next 5 years at recent strip pricing, we have plenty of capacity to execute on our capital allocation priorities. Which include investing in high-return strategic growth projects, further deleveraging, steadily growing our base dividend and building cash to opportunistically buy back shares.\nLast week, we increased our base dividend by 5% to $0.66 per share on an annualized basis as we begin returning permanent cost structure improvements and synergy capture to shareholders. Now that our credit ratings are stabilized, and we are on a glide path of further balance sheet strengthening. We have now grown our base dividend at an approximate 8% compound annual growth rate since 2022. This is a testament to our confidence in the sustainability of our business and a corporate free cash flow breakeven price that is among the lowest in North America. We will continue to look for ways to recycle structural cost savings into future growth. Ensuring that our base dividend is bulletproof through commodity cycles.\nTurning to LNG. We signed offtake agreements with [ Cimpress Port Arthur next decades, Rio Grande and Commonwealth LNG ] beginning in the 2030 and 2031 time frame. These SPAs represent patient execution of the LNG strategy that we began formulating in 2022. We as we waited for the right time to gain exposure to high-quality facilities with geographic diversification, competitive pricing and favorable credit terms. We intentionally positioned our exposure to begin after the 2027 to 2029 window, which we have flagged for several years as a potential period of global oversupply. This oversupply should result in a trough period of new LNG FID activity and lower prices should stimulate new international demand, setting the stage for tightening fundamentals concurrent with the commencement of our contracts.\nWhile we remain bullish on domestic demand growth, we believe that international growth will increase even faster, and it is important to have the right exposure in our portfolio to these markets. Our strategy of signing SPAs on tolling arrangements provide with less downside risk and greater upside optionality than netback deal structures. Our structures give us complete end market flexibility. Allowing us to provide tailor-made solutions to in-market customers globally with varying contract tenors and price benchmarks over the 20-year lives of these contracts. We are taking the same direct-to-customer approach to LNG that we have deployed domestically with utilities and data centers.\nWe expect to enter into sales agreements and regasification capacity covering a large portion of our LNG exposure in the coming years, leaving us with a geographically diversified portfolio of customers and pricing exposure.\nOur recent discussions with international buyers give us confidence in the long-term LNG demand outlook and suggest the desire to contract with an integrated U.S.-based natural gas producer that can offer greater flexibility than legacy LNG suppliers due to their short exposure at Henry Hub.\nIt's worth noting that EQT is the second largest marketer of natural gas in the U.S., ahead of all upstream and midstream peers as well as the super majors. LNG marketing is a natural bolt-on to our existing capabilities, and we've been building our expertise over the past several years. While the U.S. market has significant demand tailwinds over the near and medium term, global growth in natural gas demand should far outpace the domestic market over the long term. We expect natural gas demand outside the U.S. to rise by 200 Bcf per day between now and 2050. And highlighting the tremendous opportunity for U.S. producers that can directly access international markets. However, that access will only be available to producers that have a combination of scale, low-cost structure, multiple decades of quality inventory and investment-grade balance sheet and strong environmental attributes, all of which are hallmarks of the differentiated platform we have built at EQT.\nTurning to natural gas macro. We see a supportive setup emerging as we head into year-end with a tightening balance driven by factors, including surging LNG demand and slowing associated gas supply growth as crude oil prices weaken.\nOn the demand side, the U.S. is on track to exit 2025 with over 4 Bcf per day of incremental LNG demand compared to year-end 2024, the largest annual increase since the U.S. began exporting LNG almost 10 years ago. The start-up of Golden Pass and continued ramp-up of the Corpus Christi Stage 3 expansion are expected to add another 2.5 to 3 Bcf per day of demand by year-end 2026, providing a further tailwind for U.S. natural gas prices.\nLooking ahead to winter weather, several major forecasters are calling for one of the coldest winners in over a decade as early indications suggest a transition from El Nino to a moderate lamina phase. This transition tends to produce below normal temperatures across key U.S. consuming regions, including the Midwest and Northeast. A return to sustained cold could drive a meaningful rebound in residential and commercial heating demand tightening inventories and accelerating the drawdown pace by late Q1.\nFinally, on the supply side, we anticipate flat associated gas volumes through the first half of 2026. The rig reductions in capital discipline we've seen across major oil basins this year are beginning to translate into lower associated gas growth, particularly from the Permian. Should Brent and WTI prices remain in the 50s as OPEC increases production and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East ease, oil prices could approach breakeven economics for many producers and further discourage incremental oil activity. Together, these trends point to a tighter supply picture emerging into 2026 and 2027, supporting a more durable recovery in U.S. gas prices.\nIn sum, the U.S. gas market is entering a critical inflection point. rapidly growing LNG demand and slowing associated gas production going to a constructive setup in 2026, which could be bolstered further should a cold winter manifest. That said, we remain vigilant over the medium term due to the wave of new Permian pipeline scheduled to be completed by the end of 2026 and an increasing risk of LNG oversupply later this decade, which we believe could temporarily back up gas supply into U.S. storage and set up another short down cycle.\nWrapping up, I want to point out a couple of items on our updated guidance and provide a few thoughts as we think ahead to 2026. Our fourth quarter production and operating expense guidance includes the impact of 15 to 20 Bcfe of strategic curtailments during October as our teams continue to optimize around in-basin pricing volatility.\nAdditionally, recent IRS guidance suggests that we will not be subject to AMT in 2025, and thus, we now expect to pay minimal cash taxes this year, which will save nearly $100 million relative to our prior forecast.\nLooking ahead to 2026, we expect to maintain production volumes at a level consistent with our 2025 exit rate. We expect maintenance CapEx in line with 2025 plus the full year impact of the Olympus acquisition. As our compression projects are completed and base decline shallow, we expect maintenance CapEx to decline towards $2 billion later this decade.\nAs we highlighted last quarter, we have an expanding backlog of high-return infrastructure growth projects, which will unlock sustainable growth for our upstream business. We are excited to allocate the first dollars of our free cash flow after maintenance CapEx and to these opportunities, which we believe will create more long-term shareholder value than any other reinvestment opportunity available to us today.\nOur total capital spend in the years ahead will be based on the quality of the investment opportunity set in a given year, and we hope to continue sourcing opportunities and unlocking differentiated value across our integrated platform. Our pipeline of projects provides a low-risk, high-return reinvestment opportunity that is unique to EQT, allowing us to drive sustainable cash flow per share growth and compound capital for shareholders for years to come. And with that, I'd like to open the call to questions."

Thank you for joining us today for the investor presentation for the FY '25 Full Year Results of EQT Holdings Limited. My name is Mick O'Brien, I'm the Managing Director of Equity Trustees, and I'm joined today by our CFO, Johanna Platt. We've got 45 minutes scheduled for this morning, and our agenda is that I'm going to provide a summary of the business' performance. I'll then hand over to Jo, and she will take you through the financials in detail. I'll then close with an update on our strategy and the outlook, and then we'll open to questions at the end through the chat feature in this menu.\nSo the key points for FY '25 have been strong financial performance, experiencing record growth in funds under management, administration and supervision and strong top line revenue growth. We've had a turnaround in expenses as we successfully closed out the 3-year strategic projects agenda as we flagged at the half year. We've successfully delivered on the project agenda by fully completing the integration of AET and delivering the new technology platforms and finally exiting the discontinued Corporate Trustee Services business segment in the U.K. and Ireland. Lastly, I'm pleased to say we realized more than the planned synergies relating to the AET acquisition.\nNow this page shows the key highlights of the year. I'm pleased to say the results reflect an improvement in both the statutory and the underlying profit measures. The key financial metrics for FY '25 that we had a very strong uplift in net profit after tax due to the completion of the 3-year strategic project spend and the continued growth of the business. Net profit after tax increased by 60% to $33.2 million. Funds under management, administration and supervision or FUMAS as we call it, grew to $254 billion, up 28% on the prior year, driven by the growth in CSTS through a combination of new appointments and growth in size of the existing portfolio of schemes and superannuation funds.\nRevenue grew by 7% to $182.5 million. The underlying net profit before tax was $53.7 million, an increase of 4% on the prior year, primarily driven by CSTS' profit growth. Earnings per share grew by 60% to reach $1.2426 per share and the Board has declared a second half dividend of $0.56 bringing the total dividend for the year to $1.11, an increase of 7% on the prior year. Finally, the total shareholder return at 30th of June was 9.7%. So FY '25 represents the end of a 3-year journey for us to position Equity Trustees as the Australian's leading trustee company.\nLet me go through our major objectives and the delivered outcomes. Trustee Wealth Services following the acquisition of AET has positioned itself as the leader in almost every state in Australia and each sector of trusteeship strongly grown its Health & Personal Injury book throughout the year. Our second objective was to drive growth in Corporate Trustee Services. This business has great momentum. There's been 126 new schemes over the last 3 years, of which there were more than 50 new appointments in FY '25. Portfolio of listed vehicles has continued to expand with a portfolio of 27 active ETFs and listed investment trusts now in place and more coming on as we speak.\nAnd we proudly took on the Responsible Entity roles for the largest IPO in Australia last calendar year and also the largest IPO in Australia in this calendar year so far. We completed the protracted process of exiting the U.K. business and is now in the final stages of liquidation with no more expense to come. And finally, our investment in the modernization of our core technology platforms has been successfully delivered. We have a new trustee platform for Trustee Wealth Services called NavOne. We have Workday in place for human capital management, payroll and financial reporting. We migrated our technology infrastructure to the cloud whilst upgrading our cyber security systems.\nWhilst technology investment remain a key for the business going forward, the breadth of the agenda will be more focused and will be focused on CSTS in FY '26. This slide shows revenue and margins over each of the last 6 halves. You can see revenue growth in the last half has been 4%. Compound revenue growth over the last 3 years has been 15% per annum. Importantly, you can see the margin improvement. We now have a reversion of our statutory result to our underlying result as we forecast. The underlying EBITDA margin has increased from 26.6% to 34.4% in the half and the statutory EBITDA margin from 31.3% to 35.2%.\nGoing forward, you will only see statutory results without any underlying measures. And we continue to track against our strategic T4 targets, the client satisfaction, employee engagement, shareholder value and our impact on the community. We've seen a slight decline in client satisfaction, although we still maintain healthier results with positive Net Promoter and Loyalty Scores. The decline has been attributed to the significant client transitions we did to the new NavOne platform throughout the year. And then we expect those results to improve in FY '26 with this NavOne platform. T2 employee engagements held steady at 72%. The shareholder value continues to grow, the statutory EPS is up 60% as I mentioned before. Our community impact is high again in FY '25 with $170 million of charitable grants made throughout the course of the year. It's down on FY '24 off the back of lower dividend income in the Australian equity market coming into our relevant trusts.\nNow the impact on the business of regulatory developments continues to be significant. The team managed an extraordinary volume of regulatory challenge and other regulatory loads during the course of the year. The most significant developments were the introduction of the financial accountability regime in March and the introduction of a significantly strengthened superannuation Prudential Standard CPS 230, starting at -- on 30th of June relating to operational risk management. And a raft of other changes were implemented during the year and more is shown currently.\nNow there have been 2 well-documented issues that I will comment on. The first one relates to negative title trust for the Noongar community in Perth. Following the WA Ombudsman's tabling of the report in the Western Australian Parliament last week regarding purchase of property intended to address our [indiscernible] in the community, we released an ASX statement stating that we disagree with the finding of the WA Ombudsman, and we consider we have fulfilled our responsibilities as trustee and will respond to that report in due course. We remain deeply committed to the purpose of that trust and the intent of that trust as we always have. And we note that the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, ACNC, did not reach the same conclusions as the WA Ombudsman.\nThe second one relates to the Shield and First Guardian Master Funds. I start by acknowledging the deeply difficult circumstances for individuals who have been affected by these events relating to the Shield and First Guardian Master Funds. We're engaging with the regulators and the broader industry and are committed to collective industry action that further protects investors' interests. One of our 2 superannuation trustees had exposure to 2 of those schemes. The exposure was within 2 of our superannuation funds. The amount of funds invested in the 2 schemes under our superannuation trusteeship was less than 1/4 of the reported $1.1 billion total investments in those 2 schemes.\nImportantly, Equity Trustees was not the responsible entity of either of those schemes and has no relationship with other parties involved, financial advisors, dealer groups, lead generators, responsible entities, fund managers and property developers. Equity Trustees governance program identified irregularities in some applications made by Venture advisors in late 2023. We promptly ceased accepting applications from those advisors, and we reported Venture Egg to ASIC as we're required to do under an AFSL, believing another AFSL holder is potentially breaching its license conditions.\nEquity Trustees is extremely disappointed that members' benefits are likely to be negatively impacted, and we'll be taking every action possible to keep members informed, engage with the regulators and achieve the best possible member outcomes. We do expect a distribution from the Shield Master Fund within the next 12 months. Equity Trustees is cooperating fully with any inquiries or investigations being undertaken by ASIC and APRA. Equity Trustee Superannuation Limited, the trustee entity, has received and responded to multiple notices from ASIC requesting information. ASIC has not alleged any breaching of law by Equity Trustee Superannuation Limited.\nWe continue to work collaboratively with all the stakeholders to deliver industry-wide improvements that support a robust and resilient financial services system. Now let me move to Trustee Wealth Services results. So Trustee Wealth Services has continued to grow revenue and FUMAS in FY '25 at a steady pace. Revenue has doubled over the last 3 years, aided by the acquisition of AET and importantly and pleasingly, the achievement of $7 million in synergies from that acquisition. You can also see on this slide that we are now showing the split of revenue between asset-based and non-asset-based fees.\nThe growth rate of revenue in FY '25 was just over 3%, and that reflects the exit of the AET platform business and also some one-offs in FY '25, which Jo will walk you through later. The CSTS, corporate has continued to go from strength to strength in FY '25. We established 53 new schemes or took on other trustee appointments in FY '25, including, as I said, the largest IPOs of last calendar year and so far this calendar year, showing we are the trusted partner in this market. The client growth in driving the year-on-year revenue growth, [ is expected ] to have a strong performance from FY '25 continuing on across all the subsegments of Fund Services, Custody and Debt & Securitisation Services.\nThe split of market-related and nonmarket-related revenue is really important for this business because it can distort the results. Typically, nonmarket-related fee arrangements are at a lower level and often because they may involve directed type roles or the scale of funds is so significant. You can see the $33 billion in FUMAS growth that occurred, about half was attributable to market-related fee arrangements and half to nonmarket-related fee arrangements. The pipeline remains really strong for the start of FY '26. In the superannuation business, we're the leading independent superannuation trustee in the Australian market.\nThe recent regulatory activity is driving higher compliance demands and heightened risk is reinforcing our essential role in the financial ecosystem. During the year, we onboarded 4 new funds for $6.7 billion of FUMAS. We also had to merge 3 other funds, which resulted in reduced revenue. Nevertheless, overall revenue increased by 8% in superannuation during the year. We also manage operational risk financial reserves for some of the superannuation clients, and they flow through our balance sheet. This results in interest costs and offsetting interest revenue, which is effectively neutral to profit.\nThe growth in those holdings in FY '25 contributed about $1 million of the revenue growth of the year. And this table shows investment performance in alpha terms across the key portfolios. Our asset management team currently managed $6.4 billion of funds. You can see the recent performance in Australian equities and one of our global equity strategies has been challenged. But generally, we've got very positive alpha generation across each of these asset classes over most of these time periods.\nSo now let me hand over to Jo to take you through the results in some detail.\n\nJohanna Platt\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Mick, and good morning to everyone, and I'm pleased to present to you today the financial results for EQT for FY '25. Firstly, to review the key lines of the P&L. As previously mentioned, revenue for FY '25 was $182.5 million, up 7% or $12 million. CSTS revenue growth contributed $8.5 million of this increase, driven by $3 million of new business and net inflows into existing schemes, $3 million due to the impact of positive investment markets and $1 million of incremental offer-related revenues and a further $1 million of regulatory-related project revenue.\nTWS revenue increased by $3 million, the net impact of the benefit of AET synergies of $2 million, new business and net flows of $2 million and the impact of positive investment markets of $4 million. This was, however, offset by the impact of the exit of the AET platform business at $1.5 million and nonrecurring and lost business revenue of $2 million. Operating expenses increased by 8.3%. And whilst this was above the revenue growth rate, there were a number of transition issues that contributed to this outcome, which I will talk to further in an upcoming slide.\nUnderlying net profit before tax was up 4.1% to $53.7 million and margin softened slightly by 80 bps to 29.5%. Importantly, nonoperating expenses declined by $6.6 million to $4.9 million in FY '25 due to the wind down of the AET integration and technology deployment activity. The after-tax profit impact of the discontinued CTS-EU business was $0.7 million as the U.K. business was deregistered by the regulator in December and is now in the final stages of liquidation. Therefore, NPAT increased by just over 60% to reach $33.2 million, driven by the growth in underlying profit and the reduction in nonoperating expenses and the progressive -- exit of the discontinued business.\nGiven that FY '25 was a story of 2 halves, it's useful to walk through the results on a half-over-half basis. In the second half of '25, revenues increased by $3.7 million, driven by CTS and the impact of new business and growth performance in existing schemes. Operating expenses declined by $1.5 million in the second half due to the $2.7 million reduction in people costs resulting from the restructure that occurred in the first half, offset by increased administrative and marketing costs of around $1.2 million, approximately half of which are one-off in nature.\nNet profit before tax margins improved by 4.5% to reach 31.6% in the second half, reflecting the reduced cost base of the unified operating model of TWS. Nonoperating expenses further declined by $3.5 million to $0.7 million in the second half, as I've mentioned before, relating to the closeout of the strategic project activity. Therefore, NPAT increased by nearly $8 million half-over-half, reflecting $5 million reduction in expenses and $3.7 million uplift in revenue.\nTurning to the reconciliation between underlying net profit before tax and NPAT. And as Mick mentioned, hopefully, the last time we shared this slide, the number and value of adjusting items reduced significantly in FY '25. Nonoperating expenses were $4.9 million and the impact of the discontinued CTS-EU business was a loss of $0.7 million on an after-tax basis. To note, the effective tax rate in FY '25 was 30.4%, a reduction from 32% in FY '24 due to the decline in EU losses and nondeductible project costs.\nThis page sets out the movement in operating expenses from FY '24 to '25. As previously noted, they increased by 8.3% or $9.8 million. There was a net increase in people costs of $2.9 million. It's the net effect of a $4.2 million increase relating to additional resources to support growth in CSTS, a $1.9 million impact due to our annual remuneration review and a $3.4 million reduction in TWS staff costs due to the integration of AET.\nTechnology operating costs increased by $2 million due to the impact of moving to a cloud-based data service and the annualized impact of licenses for Workday, Salesforce and NavOne and additional cybersecurity services. Finance costs increased by $1 million due to the increased value of the offer facility, which is recovered by revenue. Outsourcing costs increased by $2.9 million as the transition of custody and fund administration services to HUB24 was completed.\nOther expenses increased by $1 million, in part relating to the launch of our new website and the costs for our first digital Active Philanthropy campaign. Given that people-related costs make up -- sorry, we're doing second half, focusing on the change in operating expenses half-over-half, this slide bridges from first half to second half. Operating expenses decreased by $1.5 million over this time, driven by a $2.7 million reduction in people costs relating to TWS.\nThere were minor changes in technology, finance and legal costs and mostly driven by elevated regulatory activity and other expenses increased by $1.4 million, as I mentioned before, relating to marketing and -- marketing and digital marketing campaign costs. Given that people costs make up 2/3 of our expenses, we wanted to share a high-level view of our employee count across FY '25. This graph shows the count of employees at June '24, December '24 and now at June '25 for TWS, CSTS and corporate functions.\nAs you can see, TWS employee count reduced by 53 over the first half of FY '25, a decrease of 20% as a result of the change to a single operating environment supported by NavOne. The number of employees in CSTS increased by 13 to support the growth in our portfolio whilst the headcount in technology and risks reflected the reduction in technology activity and some open roles in risk, which have subsequently been filled. The vacancy rate at June 30, '25 was 3.9%, a slight increase on our prior year measure of 2.6%. However, we consider this within normal range.\nTurning to segment performance. Here's a short-form P&L and waterfall of net profit before tax for TWS. Whilst reported revenue grew by $3.1 million or 3.1%. This was the net result of a $3.5 million reduction in prior year nonrecurring revenue relating to the AET platform exit and one-off state management and trustee fees. This was offset by $6.6 million of revenue growth relating to AET synergies new business of $2.3 million, $4.6 million impact of investment market improvements and an offset of lost business of $2.1 million.\nOperating expenses increased by 5.3% or $3.7 million. The main driver here was the impact of the HUB24 custody fees increases of $2.7 million and people costs reduced by $1.7 million, the net effect of the restructure that occurred offset by annual rent reviews. Increased technology costs of $1.0 million were incurred in part due to NavOne licenses and the flow-on of the corporate expense increase related to technology that I referred to earlier.\nThe impact of transitioning the business to a single operating model resulted in some carriage of duplicate costs in the first half, and this resulted in a decline in profit over prior year of $0.6 million and a slight compression of margins by 1.5%. Given the change in TWS business over FY '25, it's important to explain the progression in profit and margins half-over-half, which I'll cover on this page.\nThis waterfall bridges from second half net profit before tax in '24 through to second half '25 for TWS. Over this time, net profit before tax has increased by $1.4 million, driven by revenue on essentially a flat cost base. Profit margins increased to be 30.8% in the second half of '25, 3.9% higher than the first half.\nTurning to CSTS. Strong revenue growth, as we've mentioned previously, of $8.5 million or 11.9%. $1.1 million of this growth related to the $15 million increase in the value of all facilities, as we previously noted, and the balance was the result of $7 million of new business or additional funds into existing schemes, plus the additional $3 million market impact and $1 million of super regulatory project revenue. This was offset by $3 million decline due to either closed or [indiscernible].\nExpenses increased by 12.4% or $6.2 million. This was driven by people costs as we previously noted, additional headcount and employees deployed into this business. The increase in offer financing costs, as we previously noted, is offset by revenue and an allocation of the increased corporate technology costs into this business. Margins softened slightly by 40 bps to 30% and FUMAS growth was around 30% for both subproducts.\nAs Mick noted, the Board declared a $0.56 per share dividend for the second half, bringing the total to the year for $1.11, a 6.7% increase. The payout ratio on NPAT was 89% at the top end of the Board-approved target range. And as you can see, there is a clear progression of increased dividends aligned with underlying and now statutory earnings growth over the last 4 years. Turning to share a summary of cash and cash flow. Total cash and cash equivalents increased by nearly $18 million in FY '25.\nOperating cash flows of $40 million were broadly flat year-over-year. However, this included nearly $4 million of restructure payments relating to the integration of AET. Net cash relating to investing activities was $3 million due to reduced capital expenditure in FY '25. Cash outflows relating to corporate movements increased by $21 million to total $40 million. This included a $5 million increase in dividend payments and a $5 million repayment of a $10 million facility drawn down in FY '24, which was put in place to support the integration of AET.\nAnd finally, closing on balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains investment grade with total equity increasing nearly $5 million to $404 million and gearing reducing to 10.4%. In explaining the balance sheet, it is important to note the accounting of the ORFR facilities, which are represented as an equal and offsetting asset, cash and liability line. These increased by $15 million in FY '25, and we project this will increase by a further $50 million in FY '26.\nPleasingly, trade receivables and accrued income reduced by nearly $4 million due to improvements in invoice processes and collections activity. As I mentioned previously, corporate borrowings reduced by $5 million due to a part repayment of a facility, and we will be conducting a capital review of our allocation in the first half of '26. Thank you. And I'll now hand back to Mick to close our presentation with an update on our strategy and FY '26 outlook.\n\nMichael Joseph O’Brien\n\nMD & Director\n\nThank you, Jo. As we continue our journey to be Australia's leading trustee business, it's timely to reflect upon the strengths of the business. Firstly, our model, the independent trustee model is increasingly favored by the market and our market leadership has us well positioned to capitalize on that trend. Secondly, the growth of the investment markets is set to continue. It's underpinned by the growth in the superannuation sector and also the growth of -- into generational wealth transfer, and we're well positioned to capture that in all of our business segments.\nThirdly, the enduring income profile of our business is attractive. Trustee appointments are generally very long term in nature and revenue is positively correlated to market movements. EQT continues to have a strong balance sheet, as Jo mentioned, with low gearing. We have an experienced leadership team with a proven track record of M&A and integration success. After a period of being internally focused while the integration of AET has continued, we're now actively engaging in inorganic opportunities.\nFinally, our assets, our highly engaged and capable people, our culture, and now we have a refreshed technology stack, meaning we're well positioned to enhance our operational processes and deliver great service to our clients. So our strategic priorities in FY '26 continue to leverage our marketing positions in each business to capture ongoing growth, particularly in CTS, design and deploy digital solutions to enhance the client experience in safety and automate activities and leverage our expertise to meet high regulatory demands and actively engage in conversations to shape future regulation.\nLet me finish with the outlook for FY '26. Firstly, we need to note that the economy continues to face geopolitical uncertainty, which we are exposed to most directly through movements in investment markets. Based upon our business plans and pipeline of new business, particularly in CTS, where we provide responsible entity services to fund managers, we expect a really positive outlook for FY '26.\nWe expect more moderate levels of growth in trustee wealth services, and we expect the new technology solutions to boost efficiency and service levels [indiscernible] confirm that going forward, our statutory profit performance will be the focus and the statutory result is now reverted to the underlying result.\nOur operating expenses for technology are forecast to now run at a more normal level of $2 million in FY '26 with the majority of projects being focused upon CTS and the rollout of enhanced workflow and data automation and monitoring tools in that business.\nWe also want to acknowledge the risk landscape and expect the standards of regulators to continue to increase, and this will -- we will continue to invest as appropriate to ensure we meet those standards and expectations, and we're well positioned to do this, and we think we can manage this at this stage while maintaining our margins. So that brings us to the end of the presentation. I'm now happy to take questions. They are in the chat function. So we've had some that have been provided to us. I'm going to start with those first."

I'd like to welcome everyone to EQT Q2 2025 Quarterly Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Cameron Horwtiz, Managing Director, Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.\n\nCameron Jeffrey Horwitz\n\nAnalyst, U.S. Capital Advisors LLC\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2025 earnings results conference call. With me today are Toby Rice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeremy Knop, Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, Toby and Jeremy will present their prepared remarks with a question-and-answer session to follow. An updated investor presentation has been posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website, and we will reference certain slides during today's discussion. .\nA replay of today's call will be available on our website beginning this evening. I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. Actual results and future events could materially differ from these forward-looking statements because of factors described in yesterday's earnings release, in our investor presentation, the Risk Factors section of our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and in subsequent filings we make with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our most recent earnings release and investor presentation for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Toby.\n\nToby Z. Rice\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThanks, Cam, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter results continue to showcase strong momentum at EQT. Production was at the high end of guidance, benefiting from robust well productivity and outperformance from compression projects. Year-to-date, our compression program is ahead of schedule, below budget and driving production uplift well above expectations, showcasing continued synergy capture from the Equitrans acquisition.\nCapital spending came in approximately $50 million below the low end of guidance, driven by midstream spending optimization, continued improvements and completion efficiency and lower well costs. Our team set a new EQT record for completed [ footage ] per day during the quarter, and we believe there is still significant room for additional improvement. This strong performance resulted in approximately $240 million of Q2 free cash flow attributable to EQT despite $134 million of net expense incurred relating to a litigation settlement that resolved outstanding securities class action litigation.\nWe view this settlement as a positive step forward for EQT as it resolves remaining, meaningful legacy liabilities inherited by current management. Without this legal expense, second quarter free cash flow attributable to EQT would have totaled approximately $375 million, materially exceeding expectations. To put into perspective, cumulative free cash flow generation totaled nearly $2 billion over the past 3 quarters despite natural gas prices averaging just $3.30 per million Btu over this period, highlighting the differentiated earnings power of EQT's low-cost platform.\nShifting gears. We closed on our acquisition of Olympus Energy on July 1, funding the deal with $475 million of cash on hand plus the issuance of approximately 25.2 million shares active purchase price adjustments. Recall the assets comprise a vertically integrated, contiguous 90,000 net acre position offsetting EQT's acreage in Southwest Appalachia with 500 million cubic feet per day of net production and over a decade of core Marcellus inventory, along with significant upside optionality from the deep Utica.\nThe teams are off to a fast start integrating the assets, and we expect to have the bulk of operational integration items complete within the next 30 days. We also see the opportunity to organically bolt on low-cost acreage around the Olympus assets, which could materially expand inventory duration in this area. Turning to strategic growth opportunities.\nAs discussed over the past several quarters, we have cultivated a significant pipeline of low-risk, high-return projects that should drive sustainable growth for our midstream and upstream businesses in the years ahead. Several of these projects recently crossed significant milestones, thus derisking the path to value creation. First, we are concluding the open season of our MVP Boost project, which is set to add 180,000 horsepower of compression to the MVP mainline and increased capacity from 2 to 2.5 Bcf per day. This project will provide additional takeaway from Appalachia into Virginia to serve the Southeast markets, unleashing reliable, low-cost, low emissions natural gas into a region that is seeing significant demand growth.\nAs a result of strong project momentum, we have elected to jump start long lead time orders this year in order to derisk the MVP Boost construction time line. We are also continuing to advance the MVP Southgate project and expect to receive the FERC environmental assessment in October of this year. MVP Southgate will provide 550 million cubic feet per day of capacity from MVP mainline into the Carolinas, serving anchor customers Duke Energy in the public service company of North Carolina.\nThis project will significantly enhance the reliability of natural gas delivery into this key growth market, reducing energy costs for consumers and support the replacement of coal. MVP Southgate and MVP Boost are projected to begin service in 2028 and in 2029, respectively, following the anticipated commencement of the Transco Southeast supply expansion.\nAdditionally, we are working to finalize our 20-year definitive agreement with the Frontier Group of companies to provide, long-term natural gas supply for the shipping port Industrial Park project Northwest of Pittsburgh. The project will convert a retired coal power plant into a large-scale 3.6 gigawatt natural gas power generation facility with peak natural gas consumption of approximately 800 million cubic feet per day. The project has secured a partner to build a co-located data center facility to support AI infrastructure and contemplates several phases of development beginning in 2027 and ramping through 2028, providing significant upstream growth optionality for EQT to meet increasing demand.\nWe are also working to finalize our 20-year definitive agreement with Homer City redevelopment to build midstream pipeline infrastructure and be the project's exclusive supplier of natural gas. Once completed, Palmer City will be the largest natural gas power plant ever built in North America, with an existing grid interconnection for added reliability to support AI data center loads across its 3,200 acre campus.\nThe facility will consist of 7 new gas turbines powered by 665 million cubic feet per day of EQT's low emissions natural gas. We plan to leverage our newly acquired Olympus assets to supply the facility as it ramps up before reaching peak capacity in late 2028. Additionally, we signed an agreement to build midstream infrastructure serving a new 610-megawatt combined cycle natural gas power plant in West Virginia, with gas demand of approximately 100 million cubic feet per day that will serve the PJM market. This project is poised to be the state's first large-scale gas-fired power plant and is being developed by a global investment-grade power company in partnership with a marquee private equity sponsor.\nIn service for the project is expected in 2028 and the commercial structure includes a 10-year term with recontracting optionality. We also secured a new gathering contract with a large private producer to expand capacity on our Saturn pipeline system in West Virginia. This project is expected to be in service in 2027 with a 10-year initial term and is backed by attractive minimum volume commitments. This opportunity highlights success with our strategic initiative to grow Equitrans third-party business, which further lowers EQT's free cash flow breakeven by driving stable, fee-based revenue growth.\nCollectively, these projects represent a pipeline of nearly $1 billion of organic investment opportunity with premium, low-risk supply agreements which we estimate will generate an aggregate free cash flow yield of approximately 25% once fully online. This is particularly noteworthy given the relatively low-risk annuity-like cash flow streams from the infrastructure components of these projects, which are underpinned by the deepest, highest quality natural gas resource in the United States.\nFurther, this free cash flow yield is prior to any potential benefits from local basis improvement in the upstream growth optionality created by these projects. The shipping port and Homer City facilities, the West Virginia power plant, the increase in MVP utilization plus the MVP Boost expansion represent new Appalachian gas demand of nearly 3 Bcf per day. This demand will be served in large part by EQT volumes flowing predominantly through EQT infrastructure, underscoring the differentiated growth opportunity for EQT.\nThrough our integrated platform, we are demonstrating what responsible, sustainable growth looks like for oil and gas companies. This means partnering with end users to enable new demand then meeting that demand with supply backed by firm contracts rather than simply chasing commodity price signals. This tremendous opportunity is unique to EQT enabled by the past 5 years of strategic work transforming our business and highlights what is possible when you have the combination of a low-cost structure, scale, integrated high-quality infrastructure, a multi-decade core inventory and investment grade credit ratings.\nAs we highlighted last quarter, the next leg of our corporate strategy is built on the dual pillars of reducing cash flow risk and creating pathways for sustainable cash flow growth. And these projects represent a tangible step forward in executing that strategy. I also want to give a special thank you to our leadership in the state of Pennsylvania. Senator McCormick and Governor Shapiro as well as the administration in Washington for taking bold steps to unlock the vast economic potential of the region and shining a spotlight on the massive opportunity for technology and AI to prosper in the Pittsburgh area. As we have demonstrated, EQT is ready to do its part and deliver affordable, reliable and low carbon energy to power this growth.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy T. Knop\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Toby. Our strong second quarter results and free cash flow generation drove continued deleveraging of our balance sheet. We exited the quarter with $7.8 billion of net debt, down approximately $350 million compared to Q1 and marking nearly $6 billion of debt reduction over the past 3 quarters. The recent closing of the Olympus transaction accelerates our deleveraging plan and enhances our debt to free cash flow metrics. Pro forma the transaction, we remain on track to achieve our year-end 2025 net debt target of $7.5 billion. .\nOver the medium to long term, we plan to operate with a maximum of $5 billion of net debt, which is roughly 3x free cash flow before strategic growth CapEx at a $2.75 natural gas price. As a result, we will continue to focus on debt paydown, even after achieving this near-term $7.5 billion target. In higher parts of the commodity cycle, we plan to accumulate cash on the balance sheet and drive net debt well below $5 billion, creating significant flexibility for countercyclical buybacks and to build capacity for high confidence reinvestment and growth even during the low parts of the commodity cycle.\nTurning to our recently announced pipeline of growth projects. We expect these projects to create a collective growth CapEx opportunity of approximately $1 billion over the next several years, and we expect to begin spending capital on associated infrastructure in 2026 with investments spaced out over a multiyear period. We structured the 2 data center projects as Index-plus style deals on fixed volume commitments.\nSimilar to our existing contracts with the Southeastern utilities, these contracts give us confidence in leaning into moderate, midstream and upstream growth due to the lower risk nature of these agreements. Similarly, the midstream growth projects were all backed by fixed fee contracts and minimum volume commitments, providing low-risk, high-return earnings growth pathways for EQT.\nWhile we cannot disclose specific contract terms or end customers, before the impact of upstream volume growth or basis tightening, we expect these projects to add approximately $250 million of recurring free cash flow by 2029. Initially, we will reallocate volumes to fill this new demand, followed by steady, mid-single-digit multiyear growth. We have the capacity to grow production by at least 2 Bcf per day to backfill these volumes, which means we've set the stage to responsibly grow the business by at least 30% over the coming years.\nThese sustainable growth opportunities distinguish EQT among industry peers while also providing unmatched risk-adjusted exposure to natural gas prices. Furthermore, we are as confident as ever that Appalachian basis should structurally tighten through the end of the decade, and we indexed the supply deals to local pricing points to benefit from this uplift relative to Henry Hub, in addition to the contractual premium.\nTurning to capital allocation. As we achieve our deleveraging goals and organically grow the business, we will measure our free cash flow available to invest after the deduction of maintenance CapEx only. Of that remaining bucket of free cash flow, we plan to allocate first dollars toward high-return, low-risk sustainable growth projects like the ones discussed today. These large projects follow on the heels of the strategic growth investments in water infrastructure and compression that we have made over the past 2 years and are now the key drivers of the operating efficiency gains and outperformance we've become accustomed to seeing in our quarterly results.\nWe expect this high return reinvestment to drive sustainable earnings growth which should enable us to confidently grow our base dividend and ensure it is bulletproof in all parts of the commodity cycle. Beyond organic growth and our base dividend, we plan to use excess free cash flow opportunistically to further reduce debt, patiently build up cash or opportunistically buy back a significant amount of shares during the market down cycle.\nTurning to hedging. We tactically added a modest amount of hedges for the upcoming winter to take advantage of call SKU in the options market. We hedged 10% of costless collars for December through February at an average price floor just above $4 per MMBtu and an average ceiling price around $7 per MMBtu. Note our updated hedge table also includes hedges that were [ novated ] with the Olympus acquisition, covering approximately 5% of our production through Q1 2027.\nWe will continue to patiently look for hedging opportunities like this and position EQT to realize higher-than-average gas prices through the cycle. Turning to natural gas macro, while there are near-term headwinds primarily due to production growth, we continue to hold a structurally bullish view for prices as we look out to 2026 and 2027.\nFirst, on the supply side, there is growing evidence that associated gas growth is slowing. The oil-directed rig count has declined by approximately 50 rigs or roughly 11% since April. While Brent and WTI pricing has rebounded off their April and May lows, we believe global oil markets still lean towards oversupply, particularly given OPEC's strategy to rapidly add back barrels and defend market share.\nThat backdrop suggests U.S. oil activity will remain subdued into next year as operators stay disciplined and focused on shareholder returns. Critically, this curbs a major source of incremental gas supply. At the same time, the demand picture continues to strengthen as we expect a meaningful step-up in LNG exports by Q4 with Plaquemines LNG reaching full rate and Golden Pass LNG beginning operation.\nThis increase is on top of the 2.5 Bcf per day of LNG demand growth we've seen since the beginning of 2025 and should quickly tighten balances, especially as U.S. dry gas supply struggles to keep pace. Based on recent and upcoming FIDs, U.S. nameplate LNG capacity should grow to north of 30 Bcf per day by 2030, which we believe will drive structurally higher U.S. pricing next decade. At the same time, Qatar recently delayed the in-service of their new LNG capacity from early to mid-2026, further increasing our bullish near-term outlook.\nDue to surge in gas production, the current market is loose with storage levels 6% above normal, but this environment is self-correcting. Lower pricing in the near term should disincentivize dry gas producers who are chasing prices by increasing activity, especially in the marginal Haynesville play, where well productivity is beginning to degrade, a clear sign of inventory exhaustion.\nShifting to guidance. We have issued an updated outlook pro forma the Olympus transaction. Our updated 2025 production guidance range is 2,300 to 2,400 Bcfe, which includes approximately 100 Bcfe of production contribution from Olympus in the second half of the year. We are lowering our operating expense guidance range by approximately $0.06 per Mcfe, driven by accretion from the Olympus transaction and continued base business outperformance, while keeping price differential guidance unchanged.\nAs you recall, last quarter, we reduced our full year capital guidance as tangible evidence of efficiency gains. Despite the acquisition of Olympus on July 1, and and the associated $100 million of incremental second half spending, we are maintaining our full year capital guidance range of $2.3 billion to $2.45 billion. This is once again a tangible representation of continued efficiency gains within our base business, which without Olympus would have driven our capital spending well below the low end of guidance.\nAll told, production is up, operating costs are down, and capital efficiency continues to improve. And finally, we have modestly increased capital contributions to equity method investments, reflecting our decision to preorder the compression horsepower for MVP boost due to the growing backlog for this equipment. Note this is not an increase in CapEx, but simply a decision to pull forward an existing expenditure from 2026 into 2025.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call back over to Toby for some concluding remarks.\n\nToby Z. Rice\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThanks, Jeremy. To conclude, we've posted another stellar quarter of both operational and financial results, with the outlook continuing to improve. Our pipeline of differentiated strategic growth projects that we discussed today, places EQT in a peerless position within the industry and underscores the differentiated investment opportunities emerging from our integrated platform.\nWe have unlocked sustainable growth, while also increasing free cash flow durability, the combination of which we expect to drive cash flow growth and further valuation multiple expansion for shareholders. The momentum at EQT has never been stronger in the sense of purpose and excitement inside the company has never been greater. With that, I'd now like to open the call to questions."

Rice\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThanks, Cam, and good morning, everyone. '25 is off to an exceptional start at EQT, with the first quarter generating the strongest financial results in the recent company's history. Production was at the high end of guidance robust well performance and minimal winter impact, thanks to the proactive collaboration between our opting teams. We tactically surged our production by 300 million cubic feet per day during the quarter by opening chokes into strong winter demand and capitalized on robust Appalachian pricing, driving our core parental $0.16 tighter than expectations. Our differentiated strategy of volumes during periods of oversupply and surge in production reprice environment underscores our capital-efficient approach to utility and was a key driver behind this quarter's record-setting performance.\nOperating expenses and capital spending during the quarter were below the low end as efficiencies and synergies continue to perform expectations. These stellar results drove more than $1 billion of free cash flow during the quarter with natural gas prices averaging just $3.60 per million Btu. This level of free cash flow generation is nearly 2x consensus free cash flow estimates of the next closest natural gas producer and underscores the differentiated earnings power of our low-cost integrated platform. These results are a tangible demonstration of the impact of our strategic decisions over the past several years, creating a peerless natural gas that generates durable free cash flow during down cycles while also having the greatest ability to capture upside pricing.\nShifting gears. We announced our agreement for the highly accretive bolt-on acquisition of Olympus Energy's upstream and midstream assets for $1.8 billion -- of 26 million shares and $500 million of cash. The purchase price equates to an attractive 3.4x adjusted EBITDA and a 15% unlevered free cash flow yield at strip pricing on average over the next 3 years. As the 3-year cumulative free cash flow per share accretion of 4% to 8% from the acquisition at natural gas prices ranging from $2.50 to $5 per million\nThe Olympus assets comprise a vertically integrated contiguous 90,000 net acre position offsetting EQT's acreage in Southwest Appalachia, net production of approximately 500 million cubic feet per day. The assets are positioned adjacent to several proposed power generation projects in the region, providing potential strategic value upside through future gas supply deals. The acreage position has over 10 years of core Marcellus inventory, assuming activity levels with an additional 7 years of upside from the Utica. The integrated nature of Olympus' assets and high-quality inventory drives an unlevered free cash flow breakeven price that is compelled to EQT's peer-leading cost structure.\nPro forma for the Olympus transaction, year-end 2025 net debt at recent strip pricing is forecast to be approximately $7 billion. What is modestly deleveraging from a credit metric perspective with pro forma 2025 net debt to adjusted EBITDA dropping by 0.1x at recent strip pricing. We expect the transaction to close in early Q3 and plan to issue pro forma guidance as part of our second quarter earnings.\nTurning to our 2025 forecast. We continue to capture synergies from the Equitrans acquisition with actions taken to date, resulting in approximately $360 million of annual savings, an increase of $85 million relative to our last update driven by CapEx savings and system and receipt optimization. We have now captured 85% of guided total synergies and see the potential for ongoing initiatives to drive upside beyond our original forecast. Importantly, these synergy numbers do not include the up optionality added through integration that has allowed us to beat our differential guidance 3 quarters in a row, which represents additional value created beyond our stated synergies.\nWith robust synergy capture, ongoing operational efficiencies and strong well performance, we are raising our full year production outlook by 25 Bcfe while simultaneously lowering the midpoint of 2025 capital spending guidance by $25 million, both of which are prior to the impact of Olympus. It's noting our updated 2025 volume guidance is roughly in line with our maintenance production prior to the sale of our Northeast PA non-operated assets last year. It means efficiency gains asset outperformance and the repressuring of wells from our curtailment strategy have backfilled nearly half of Bcf a day of production in 2025, all while reducing capital and activity levels. This illustrates the tremendous momentum we've experienced at EQT over the past 12 months, and we see no signs of slowing we look ahead.\nAs we continue to derisk our balance sheet, we expect to our base dividend and positioned to opportunistically and countercyclically repurchase shares. We have built a solid foundation underpinned by a peer-leading cost structure drives durable free cash flow The next leg of our strategy is built on the dual pillars of reducing cash flow risk and creating pathways for sustainable cash flow growth. Achievement of these 2 goals should result in both greater through-cycle free cash flow generation and a higher trading multiple, driving differentiated shareholder value creation.\nAs it relates to organic growth, we have a rapidly expanding pipeline of in-basin demand opportunities, which could provide us with the option to sustainably grow both our midstream and upstream businesses to serve these new facilities. Recent media reports of sizable gas-fired power generation and data in Appalachia substantiate our expectations for 6 to 7 Bcf per day of local demand growth by 2030. We are in discussions with roughly a dozen proposed power projects in the region for midstream and firm gas supply solutions and see EQT exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on this setup given our production scale, inventory duration, less infrastructure, investment-grade credit ratings and low emissions credentials.\nAs these discussions mature, we have significant supply flexibility, thanks nearly 2 Bcf per day of gross production sold locally in Appalachia. This provides volumes that we can redirect into attractive firm supply arrangements while creating a longer-term growth option to partially or fully backfill this production. This opens up a differentiated avenue for EQT to drive sustainable production growth directly linked to end-user demand.\nI'd like to remind everyone that even before any in-basin supply arrangements, EQT already has a significant realized pricing tailwind from the firm sales deals we signed with the major Southeastern utilities at the end of 2023. These deals are the main driver behind the upcoming tightening of our corporate gas price differential, which is forecasted to from around $0.60 this year to around $0.30 in 2028. This means that to have a $600 million pre-tax annual free cash flow tailwind and when we believe many of our peers will see free cash flow margin degradation into core inventory exhaustion.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy T. Knop\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Toby. Our stellar first quarter results and more than $1 billion free cash flow generated during the quarter drove significant delevering of our balance sheet. We exited the quarter with $8.1 billion of net debt, down from $9.1 billion at year-end 2024,and $13.7 billion at the end of the third quarter. We tendered for approximately $750 million of notes during the quarter and completed a successful exchange offer for outstanding EQM Midstream notes, which simplifies our balance sheet and reporting moving forward.\nAs Toby mentioned, the accretive acquisition of Olympus Energy's upstream and midstream assets accelerates our delevering plan as pro forma net debt is by 6% while increases by 8%, thus enhancing our debt to free cash flow metrics. The acquisition has an immaterial impact on our absolute debt balance as we forecast exiting the year at $7 billion of net debt on a pro forma basis. We continue to target $5 billion of net debt on a medium-term basis and at recent strip pricing forecast achieving this goal by the middle of 2026.\nTurning to hedging. Rapid delevering positioned us to add no incremental hedges during the quarter, and we remain unhedged in 2026 and beyond. Our position at the low end of the cost curve acts as a structural hedge, which in turn facilitates unmatched exposure to high-priced scenarios by limiting our need to financially hedge. Instead of defensively hedging, we can now patiently look for opportunities to capture asymmetric SKU in the options market, which positions EQT to realize higher than average gas prices through the cycle.\nTurning to the macro, amid the risk off sentiment sweeping through the market, I want to share some thoughts on the natural gas macro landscape, which is positioned as a safe haven with strengthening fundamentals. We have talked for some time about the natural gas market being structurally better than pricing indicated due to the successive events of LNG facilities going down in warm winters. Despite consensus thinking that this past winter was particularly cold, as measured by heating degree days, winter was in fact in line with the 10-year average, and inventory balances have tightened rapidly. Importantly, this occurred on the eve of a step change increase in LNG demand in '25 and 2026.\nOn the supply side, we believe U.S. gas production needs to exit 2025, near 108 Bcf per day and approach 114 Bcf a day by the end of 2026. Given current production levels in the 104 to 105 Bcf per day range, we need to see a rapid increase in activity levels on reduction or pricing will reset significantly higher to suppress demand and balanced inventories. Our assumption has been that half of this growth would come from associated gas in the Permian and half from growth in the Haynesville. However, OPEC has decided to once again defend market share and start bringing back near record low of spare capacity, spending oil prices toward the 50s at the same time the trade war broke out.\nAt this price level, we expect to see a slowdown in Permian activity in other less economic oil basins shifting to declines. Meanwhile, in the Haynesville, we still have nativity pickup and believe any activity additions will be disproportionately impacted by tariff-driven inflation. Thus, we are increasingly uncertain as to where this required production growth will come from in such a short time and are increasingly bullish gas prices.\nOn demand side of the equation, we do not expect notable disruptions from recent macro events. A reminder, natural gas demand is primarily driven by winter heating, power demand, industrial demand in LNG and pipeline exports, and has a negligible correlation to macroeconomic demand cycles. Looking back at a worst-case scenario from 2020, industrial demand declined by less than 1 Bcf per day or less than 1% of total demand, and we don't believe a modest recession to have nearly the demand impact is COVID.\nFurther, we do not expect any impact to LNG exports in the medium term due to low inventory levels in Europe and thus expect exports to flow at full capacity. We are also observing a faster-than-expected ramp-up from the new Plaquemines LNG facility, which is operating above nameplate capacity. If this outperformance continues and Golden Pass comes online before year-end in accordance with Exxon's guidance and his recent FERC filings indicate as possible, substantially more production that will be required to keep 2026 in balance. All told, we are more bullish medium-term gas prices today than we were last quarter.\nDuring risk-off period like we've seen recently, the market has trouble distinguishing signal from noise. However, we are convinced that when the dust settles and the fundamental picture becomes more clear, natural gas prices are positioned to move materially higher, particularly in 2026. The longer this macro uncertainty remains and a slower the activity response, the more bullish we become.\nTo wrap it up, as demonstrated through our record-breaking results, we continue to deliver on our promises tangibly proving the power of our integrated platform and the unique in power of our business in all market cycles. Our ability to quickly adapt to market conditions and a capital efficient there, while concurrently driving operational efficiencies is fueling outsized free cash flow generation. Looking ahead, we see a clear path for sustained momentum and continuing to create differentiated value for shareholders.\nWith that, I'd now like to open call to questions."

My name is JL, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the EQT Q4 2024 Quarterly Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Cameron Horwitz, Manager Director, Investor Relations and Strategy. You may begin.\n\nCameron Jeffrey Horwitz\n\nAnalyst, U.S. Capital Advisors LLC\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and year-end 2024 earnings results conference call. With me today are Toby Rice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeremy Knop, Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, Toby and Jeremy will present their prepared remarks with a question-and-answer session to follow. An updated investor presentation has been posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website, and we will reference certain slides during today's discussion. A replay of today's call will be available on our website beginning this evening.\nI'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. Actual results and future events could materially differ from these forward-looking statements because of factors described in yesterday's earnings release, in our investor presentation, the Risk Factors section of our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, and in subsequent filings we make with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.\nToday's call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our most recent earnings release and investor presentation for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. With that, I'll turn the call over to Toby.\n\nToby Z. Rice\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThanks, Cam, and good morning, everyone. 2024 was a transformational year for EQT, marked by both record-setting operational accomplishments and bold strategic positioning at unprecedented speed. The highlight of the year was closing of the Equitrans acquisition in July, which created America's only large-scale integrated natural gas company. After only 6 months, our integration process is now 90% complete, with synergies captured to date exceeding base case expectations, building on our growing track record of value-enhancing M&A followed by successful efficient integration.\nOur rapid execution speed has driven the capture of more than $200 million of annualized base synergies or 85% of our forecasted plan. Our 2025 budget also reflects a much faster-than-expected impact from our midstream compression investments. As tangible evidence, we now expect to turn in line 10 to 15 fewer wells annually while maintaining current production levels, with more reductions in savings expected in the years ahead.\nIn upstream operations, our teams shattered multiple company efficiency records last year, resulting in a 20% increase in completed lateral footage per day relative to 2023. These efficiency gains are carrying over into 2025, allowing us to drop from 3 to 2 frac crews in April as we are choosing to prioritize cost savings instead of production growth. It is important to note that until recently, we planned to run a third frac crew for the most of 2025, highlighting our continued momentum into the end of the year.\nAs a result of these efficiency gains, we expect our 2025 average well costs to fall by approximately $70 per foot compared to 2024. Additionally, well productivity continues to improve, which drove 65 Bcf of production outperformance in 2024. Had we not curtailed volumes in response to market conditions, our production would have exceeded the high end of our original guidance by 3%. We expect this performance will carry into 2025 in the form of more volume in a higher price environment without having to increase activity or capital.\nDuring the fourth quarter, EQT's operational momentum resulted in outperformance across the board. We delivered production at the high end of guidance and CapEx 7% below the low end of guidance. Our tactical curtailment strategy improves realized pricing. And once again, the teams kept operating expenses in check, driving cost to the low end of guidance. EQT generated more than $750 million of net cash provided by operating activities and nearly $600 million of free cash flow during the fourth quarter alone, despite Henry Hub averaging just $2.81 per million BTU. These results showcase the unparalleled earnings power of our integrated low-cost platform and underscore EQT's unrivaled free cash flow durability even at low gas prices.\nTurning to reserves. Pro forma for our nonoperated asset sales, EQT's year-end 2024 proved reserves were essentially unchanged year-over-year at approximately 26 Tcfe despite the SEC price deck dropping from $2.64 to $2.13 per million BTU, underscoring the resiliency of our premier low-cost Appalachian reserve base. At strip pricing, the PV-10 of our proved reserves totals approximately $28 billion. However, this value only includes 3 years of our more than 30 years of future inventory and excludes the value associated with our third-party midstream revenue that MVP and Hammerhead pipelines and our 1.2 Bcf per day of premium firm sales deals with the major utilities in the Southeast market.\nThe total value of our proved reserves at strip pricing plus these other core assets equates to roughly our current enterprise value. That means investors can own EQT today and essentially get our peer-leading inventory depth for free, underscoring what is still an unrivaled value proposition for investors.\nShifting to our 2025 outlook. We are initiating a production guidance range of 2,175 to 2,275 Bcfe with a midpoint that is 125 Bcfe above the preliminary 2025 volume outlook referenced last quarter. This strong outlook is driven by robust well performance, completion efficiency gains, and earlier-than-expected benefits from compression investments. We will continue running just 2 to 3 rigs and recently elected to drop from 3 to 2 frac crews beginning in April to prevent our efficiency gains from tipping the business into growth mode. This minimal level of activity juxtaposed against our 7-plus Bcf a day of gross production underscores our operational momentum and our world-class assets.\nAs it relates to our investments, we have established a 2025 maintenance capital budget of $1.95 billion to $2.1 billion. We have also allocated $350 million to $380 million to value-creating growth projects beyond maintenance, including $130 million in Equitrans compression investments. Our reserve development capital budget of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion is down nearly 10% per unit of production compared to 2024 when normalized for curtailments and approximately 15% below 2023 levels. We expect our continued efficiency gains and compression investments will drive this number down even further over the coming years.\nAt strip pricing, we expect EQT to generate approximately $2.6 billion of free cash flow in 2025, $3.3 billion in 2026, and approximately $15 billion cumulatively over the next 5 years. To wrap up, material efficiency gains, robust well performance, and Equitrans integration momentum continued to drive outperformance across the board. The momentum within EQT is at its highest level since we took over the company in 2019, and we are excited to continue showcasing the power of our platform in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy T. Knop\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Toby. I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter results. First, we delivered sales volumes of 605 Bcfe at the high end of guidance, driven by operational momentum that Toby discussed. Normalized for curtailments, production would have come in at approximately 632 Bcfe or 6.9 Bcfe per day, a tangible demonstration of our operational momentum. While on the topic of production, it is worth noting that we experienced less than 1 Bcf of freeze-offs during the polar vortex events last month compared with 13 Bcf during Winter Storm Elliott in 2022. Greater alignment and collaboration with our new midstream colleagues drove the step change improvement in performance.\nTurning to pricing. Our differential came in $0.13 tighter than the midpoint of our guidance range as we curtailed volumes early in the quarter during the weakest periods of local pricing before surging volumes back when pricing strengthened. This is the second consecutive quarter of material realized pricing outperformance due to tactical curtailments, underscoring how our curtailment strategy creates shareholder value without disrupting operations or impairing productive capacity in a volatile market.\nTo further demonstrate the value of this strategy, amid cold winter weather and strong local pricing in January, we opened up chokes on many of our wells, providing customers additional volume to meet winter demand while simultaneously exposing more production to high local pricing. Year-to-date in 2025, we've realized $20 million of revenue uplift from this strategy while delivering record levels of company production.\nFourth quarter operating costs came in at $1.07 per Mcfe, at the low end of our guidance range due to production outperformance and gathering, LOE and G&A expenses below expectations. CapEx of $583 million was 7% below the low end of our guidance range due to efficiency gains and lower midstream spending. It's worth noting that aggregate CapEx during the second half of 2024 came in nearly $200 million below the midpoint of our expectations, again tangibly highlighting our capital efficiency momentum.\nOn the midstream side, third-party pipeline revenue was $166 million, 7% above the high end of guidance. MVP capital contributions of $60 million were 14% below the low end of guidance, and MVP distributions of $53 million were in line with expectations. EQT generated $756 million of net cash provided by operating activities and $588 million of free cash flow during the fourth quarter despite Henry Hub averaging just $2.81 per MMBtu, underscoring the unparalleled nature of our low-cost business model during all parts of the commodity cycle.\nTurning to the balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we delivered on our asset sales promises a year ahead of schedule to derisk our balance sheet and position our hedge book for a rising price environment. In December, we closed on the sale of our remaining nonoperated Northeast Pennsylvania assets and Midstream joint venture. Proceeds from these transactions totaled $4.7 billion, which we used to fully repay our term loan, fund the repayment of senior notes and pay down our credit facility. We exited 2024 with $9.3 billion of total debt and $9.1 billion of net debt compared to $13.8 billion and $13.7 billion, respectively, at the end of the third quarter.\nIt's worth noting that our net debt at year-end reflects the impact of $475 million of working capital usage during the quarter, the bulk of which should reverse in 2025. At strip pricing, we expect to exit 2025 with net debt of approximately $7 billion, comfortably below our target of $7.5 billion. In the medium term, we plan to reduce our absolute debt balance towards $5 billion to bulletproof our balance sheet and credit ratings so that we can play offense during the next down cycle when others are forced to play defense. For reference, this debt balance equates to approximately 5x free cash flow and at $2.75 Henry Hub price, which is a price point where many of our peers are free cash flow neutral to negative.\nTurning to hedging. Our rapid asset sale execution and bullish outlook for pricing in 2025 and 2026 positioned us to add no incremental hedges during this quarter. Recall, we tactically sculpted our hedge book to have material upside to improving macro conditions later this year. Our hedge percentage falls to approximately 40% in Q4 with 100% of our hedges becoming wide colors with ceilings of $5.50 per MMBtu in November. We remain unhedged in 2026 and beyond, providing investors full exposure to an increasingly bullish setup for prices. Our position at the low end of the cost curve acts as a structural hedge, which in turn facilitates unmatched exposure to high price scenarios by limiting our need to financially hedge.\nAs previously communicated, we plan to approach future hedging patiently and opportunistically in order to capture asymmetric skew in the options market. In essence, this approach positions us to monetize volatility and realize higher-than-average gas prices through the cycle.\nTurning to the macro landscape, 2 years of low commodity prices resulted in upstream underinvestment. This supplied backdrop, combined with an unusually cold winter, ramping LNG exports and robust power demand has catalyzed an inflection in natural gas prices over the past quarter. While gas prices have already surged, we think there is still room to run and cannot recall as wide of a disconnect between the equity and commodity markets as we are observing today.\nThe Haynesville is suffering from years of underinvestment and increasingly scarce inventory depth and we believe will be much slower to respond than the commodity markets or pricing. Appalachia is largely pipeline-constrained and there are no new pipelines out of the Permian until late 2026. Simply put, it will take too long to increase gas production to meet the step change increase in demand during such a short time. And we believe the market may have to balance inventories through demand destruction in the hands of higher prices in 2025 and 2026.\nLooking further ahead, we are eyes wide open that nearly 5 Bcf per day of new Permian gas pipelines are slated for completion in late 2026 just before Qatar brings 6 Bcf per day of LNG on the global market. With these medium-term headwinds and the fact that capital spending would not result in additional production until mid-2026, we do not have plans to invest in production growth this year and view the coming inventory imbalance at higher prices as a phenomenon of the timing mismatch of supply and demand, amplified by a cold winter and the theme of too little gas storage capacity.\nAlongside a broader bullish backdrop for natural gas, the underlying fundamentals in Appalachia continue to strengthen with tightening base as one of the most underappreciated themes. Robust demand in the Southeast region has driven MVP flows to maximum capacity of 2 Bcf per day this winter, contributing to Eastern storage levels moving from near 5-year highs last fall to near 5-year lows today. As a result, our production sold into the local M2 market and our MVP volumes sold at Station 165 have received robust pricing.\nDuring the January cold spell, Station 165 spreads to Appalachian price points rose to more than $25 per MMBtu, underscoring the tremendous upside option value embedded in our MVP capacity during periods of high demand. Longer term, we continue to see 6 to 7 Bcf per day of incremental Appalachian demand by 2030 driven by load growth, coal retirement and pipeline expansions. At the same time, we believe many producers in Appalachia will see productivity degradation or run out of inventory entirely, further tightening local fundamentals.\nM2 basis futures are beginning to reflect this reality, tightening by approximately $0.30 between 2026 and 2030 over the past 2 years. EQT is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the setup as we have the highest quality and longest-duration inventory in the basin paired with a replicable world-class infrastructure. These characteristics, our investment-grade credit ratings and low emissions credentials make EQT the go-to company for new power projects and position the business for sustainable future production growth.\nTurning to capital allocation. At recent strip pricing, we expect to generate approximately $2.6 billion of free cash flow in 2025, which we plan to allocate toward debt repayment. With our balance sheet derisked, we plan to steadily and sustainably grow our base dividend over the years ahead and position to opportunistically repurchase shares when the market is fearful. Beyond 2025, our integrated business is ideally situated to support Appalachian demand growth, positioning EQT to provide sustainable, low-risk organic growth for shareholders, a key attribute missing from the industry today.\nWe are in the process of generating a backlog of low-risk, high-return midstream investments to support this demand growth, which would in turn unlock modest upstream production growth from our decades of high-quality inventory. We have uniquely positioned EQT among the energy landscape, offering investors not only the best risk-adjusted exposure to natural gas but also idiosyncratic growth opportunities that should allow us to compound capital and create differentiated value over the long term. And with that, I will turn it back over to Toby for concluding remarks.\n\nToby Z. Rice\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThanks, Jeremy. The past 5 years have been an incredible journey. In this time, we have transformed EQT into America's only large-scale integrated gas producer, becoming the must-own natural gas company. Looking forward, we will continue our pursuit of becoming the operator of choice amongst all stakeholders, and we've got a great setup in front of us. Costs are going down, operational efficiency gains continue, asset quality shining, our inventory is still staying deep. Capital intensity is improving. Deleveraging plans are ahead of expectations, the E-Train integration and synergy capture both ahead of schedule.\nDurable midstream growth projects are entering our program and Appalachia fundamentals are strengthening in demand for our product across this country is surging. 2025 is poised to deliver a banner year. We are excited to demonstrate the differentiated benefits and earnings power of our business in the years ahead. The bullish inflection in natural gas fundamentals supercharges our excitement. And when we look at the 2026 free cash flow and beyond, investors still have the opportunity to own our premium story and assets at a discounted valuation compared to peers. With that, I'd now like to open the call to questions."

Rice\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThanks, Cam, and good morning, everyone. This week marked a significant milestone in the history of our company as we close the acquisition of Equitrans Midstream transforming EQT into America's only large-scale vertically entered natural gas business. To put the significance of our combined companies into perspective, EQT's assets compass nearly 2 million acres of leasehold, leasing more than 6 Bcfe per day with almost 4,000 low-cost remaining drilling locations. More than 2,000 miles of lines with greater than 8 Bcf a day of throughput. Nearly 500 miles of water lines, 33 Bcf of natural gas storage 800,000 horsepower of compression almost 950 miles of critical transmission infrastructure plus the newly commissioned 300-mile Mountain Valley pipeline, all of which are located at the gateway of Appalachia and ideally positioned to serve growing U.S. and international natural gas demand for decades to come. This combination creates a differentiated business model among the U.S. energy landscape as EQT is in the absolute low end of the North American natural gas cost curve. A low cost structure is the only competitive advantage one can have in a commodity business. And with the closing of Equitrans acquisition, EQT's unlevered free cash flow breakeven price is projected to be $2 per million Btu with further downside potential upon synergy capture. This cost profile structurally derisks our business in the low parts of the commodity cycle, which in turn, eliminates the longer-term need to defensively hedge. Thus unlocking unmatched upside to higher price environments. We believe the sustainable cost structure advantage, combined with our scale, peer-leading inventory depth, low emissions profile and world-class operating team offers the best risk-adjusted exposure to natural prices of any publicly investable asset in the world.\nI also want to well Equitrans employees and shareholders to the EQT crew. We're excited to get to work unlocking the potential of our combined company's asset base. With the acquisition closing a full quarter ahead of our rig time line, we estimate savings of nearly $150 million relative to our initial underwriting assumptions upside synergies. We are also able to more rapidly mobilize our integration team, which has a proven track record of turning around EQT and integrating 3 large-scale acquisitions over the past several years. Including seamlessly onboarding an entire midstream division with the XcL acquisition last fall. This accelerated closing amplifies our momentum and pulls forward our time line to synergy capture. We have continued to study synergy potential since announcement and have identified further upside potential driven by completion efficiency gains through water asset integration which is on top of early from uplift results that are exceeding our high-end synergy assumption. We plan to share additional details as our teams work through the integration process.\nSwitching gears, June 14, 2024, our historic moment of progress for our country as natural gas began flowing through Mountain Valley Pipeline. The gas moving through this critical infrastructure will provide low-cost, low emission energy to millions of Americans, while strengthening our national security. The upstream development underpinning flows on MVP will generate hundreds of millions of dollars of royalties every year to local communities in the Appalachian region, while supporting well-paying private sector jobs. Downstream, the delivery of low-cost Appalachian gas will strengthen the competitiveness of American manufacturers whose energy input costs will be a fraction of the paid by global competitors, which should further support our manufacturing renaissance in America.\nMVP will also provide utilities access to cheap, reliable fuel to power America's data center and artificial intelligence build-out, which is one of the strongest secular growth stories in the world. Since announcing the Equitrans acquisition earlier, we have fielded significant inbound interest from end users of gas in the region, you're scoring the depth of demand and the value of EQT's MVP capacity.\nMVP's volumes alone are estimated to reduce carbon emissions by up to 60 million tons per year via displacement of legacy coal generation, which to put in context, is 5 times initial reductions associated with Tesla's electric vehicles. In fact, thanks to MVP's completion, EVs in the Southeast region can now run on low-emission EQT gas delivered through MVP rather than the coal generation powering many of them today.\nGiven the regional exposure, upstream inventory depth and counter-product quality, we believe MVP is among the most valuable natural gas pipelines in the world and EQT is honored to be the operator and steward of this critical infrastructure.\nIn the second quarter results. we experienced yet another quarter of operational outperformance marked again by incremental efficiency gains. A tangible example of this on our recent Mallory C Pad in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, where our top hole rigs recently drilled the fastest well to kickoff point in EQT history, with the overall average drilling time to kick off point across the pad being 25% faster than the wells we drilled in 2022. This efficiency improvement is resulting in tangible well cost savings as the average top hole drilling cost on the Mallory C Pad came in 14% below our predrill estimate.\nWithin completions, recent improvements in logistics planning and water throughput have driven materially faster completion times on our latest wells. Our average footage completed per day is up 6% year-over-year thus far in 2024. But our most recent pads, I think new logistics techniques have outpaced our average 2023 completion speed by more than 35%, indicating the potential for material future capital efficiency improvements.\nNotably, the average excludes a pad we are currently fracking, which to date have seen completed footage per day that is a whopping hud in 20% faster than our 2023 program average and set a new EQT record with more than 3,200 feet of lateral completed in a single day. As I mentioned previously, we believe the integration of EQT and Equitrans Waters can help sustain these completion efficiency improvements as streamlining water logistics is one of the most imperative elements to systematically increasing completed footage per day.\nDespite efficiency gains accelerating activity into Q2, our scheme quarter CapEx still came in below the midpoint of our guidance range, highlighting how operational efficiency gains are driving tangible per well cost savings. Alongside well cost savings, we are also seeing strong well performance across our asset base, which drove upside to our second quarter volumes despite price-related curtailments. As shown on Slide 6 of our investor deck, this represents a continuation of the track record of productivity gains that have been a hallmark of EQT since new management took over in 2019. Over this period, third-party data shows, we have seen a nearly 40% improvement in average EUR per lateral foot, while most of our peers have seen productive degradation as core inventory is exhausted. As a result, EQT is now generating the highest average EUR per foot of any major operator across the Appalachian Basin.\nI also want to highlight this productivity movement has come despite a material increase in field pressures across Equitrans' gathering system for the same period, which essentially makes it more difficult to flow our wells. We see significant upside from investing in compression to lower system pressures, which in turn should further improve well productivity and further reduce our upstream maintenance capital requirements in future years.\nOn Slide 7 of our investor deck, we highlight data from 3 recent in-field examples showing how impactful adding compression and lower line pressure can be on existing wells. After lowering system pressures by approximately 300 ESI, we saw per well production rates immediately jumped by roughly 50% and average across the 3 projects. Over the first 12 months post pressure reduction, we forecast cumulative production gains ranging from 18% to 27%, which in effect lowers our base EQT decline rate, and we believe will translate to higher EURs per well. Notably, the average production uplift from these projects is approximately 2x more than what we assumed in our $175 million per annum of upside synergies with the E-Train deal, indicating for even more positive benefit than we originally expected. These concrete examples underscore the impact of adding compression to lower system pressures on thousands of producing wells that comprise EQT's base production. This uplift on base volumes should, in turn, allow us to drill fewer wells to maintain production, driving sustainable improvements in long-term capital efficiency. We are currently in the process of identifying optimal compression locations across the E-Train system and expect the tailwinds from lower maintenance capital to begin accruing in 2026.\nTurning to our recent ESG report. I am proud to highlight that we took another material step forward towards our ambitious environmental goals as our 2023 Scope 1 and 2 legacy production segment, greenhouse gas emissions declined by 35% year-over-year to approximately 281,000 tons. We have now reduced our historical Scope 1 and 2 production emissions by nearly 70% over the past 5 years and are squarely on track to achieve our ambitious and peer-leading net zero goal by 2025.\nFrom an emissions intensity perspective, we achieved our 2025 greenhouse gas emissions intensity goal of 160 tons per Bcfe, a full year ahead of schedule. We, at methane, after significantly outperforming our pneumatic device replacement time line, the method intensity from our production operations is now 0.0074%. And which is more than 60% below our 2025 goal and 97% of the One Future 2025 target, making EQT among the lowest methane intensity producers of natural gas anywhere in the world.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy T. Knop\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Toby. Before I summarize Q2 results, I want to take a moment to thank our shareholders for the tremendous show of support in last week's vote on the Equitrans acquisition. Of EQT shares cast more than 99% voted in favor of the deal despite this being an unconventional acquisition relative to what investors have become accustomed to in upstream M&A over the past decade. We see this vote underscoring the strong support from investors. They share a philosophical view that being at the absolute low end of the cost curve will create differentiated and sustainable long-term value amid a volatile commodity price landscape.\nSince taking over EQT and [ 2013 ], we as a management team have never been more convicted that this company is on the right strategic path, and we look forward to continuing track record of execution on behalf of our shareholders.\nShifting to second quarter results. As planned, we curtailed 1 Bcf per day of gross production throughout most of the quarter. which, along with nonoperated curtailments impacted net production by approximately 60 Bcfe during Q2. Despite curtailments strong operational efficiency and well performance drove production of 508 Bcfe, above the high end of our guidance range. Per unit operating costs came in at $1.40 per Mcfe, below the low end of guidance due to LOE and G&A expenses coming in below expectations. CapEx also came a point of guidance despite an accelerated development pace as efficiency gains drove lower-than-expected well costs.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We're off to a fast start on our deleveraging plan as we repaid $600 million of 2025 senior notes last month with strong cash on-hand in proceeds from the Equinor transaction. We exited the quarter with net debt of roughly $4.9 billion, down from $5.7 billion at the end of 2023. Concurrent with the closing of Equitrans, we also upsized our revolver from $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion, which speaks to the depth of support from our bank group. This revolver is on par with the largest companies in the energy industry and gives us ample liquidity to handle any foreseeable natural gas price scenario moving forward. With the close of Equitrans this week, pro forma gross debt is expected to be approximately $13.5 billion, inclusive of the remain of Equitrans of 40% preferred equity at closing. With the deal closing sooner than we originally anticipated, we expect our deleveraging timetable to be pulled forward by approximately 6 months.\nOn the midstream side, we plan to pursue a minority equity sale of Equitrans as regulated assets, which are projected to generate approximately $700 of adjusted EBITDA. This strategy will allow EQT to retain full operational control and upside value associated with synergy capture and future pipeline expansions. We're also marketing the remaining 60% of our nonoperated assets in Northeast Pennsylvania and are in active discussions with both domestic and international buyers.\nWe continue to target reducing our long-term debt to $5 billion to $7 billion and are highly caught in achieving our goal. Alongside planned asset sales, we have further derisked our deleveraging plan by increasing our near-term hedge position. We're approximately 60% hedged in the second half of with an average floor price of roughly $3.30 per MMBtu and approximately 60% hedged in the first half of 2025 at an average floor price of roughly $3.20 per MMBtu. We are actively building our hedge position in the second half of 2025 in order to bulletproof our deleveraging plan in any reasonable natural gas price scenario.\nTurning briefly to the Appalachia macro landscape. While the pace of Eastern storage builds has moderated, absolute storage levels remain high on the back of warm winter weather last year, thus pressuring Appalachia pricing this year. In response to market fundamentals, we continue to tactically curtail production, including over the past weeks and expect to continue this tactical curtailment program during the upcoming fall shoulder season. To this end, our second half 2024 production guidance assumes 90 Bcfe of anticipated curtailments, which should have a meaningful impact on both Eastern and total U.S. storage levels as the market wraps up injection season. I want to highlight that normalized for the roughly 180 Bcfe of total curtailments that we expect this year, our production would have been above the high end of our original 2024 guidance range which speaks to the productivity and operational efficiency gain we spoke to a few minutes ago.\nWhile Appalachian storage is elevated today, the startup of MVP last month should provide support to Appalachian differentials moving forward. To put EQT's impact in context, assuming MVP flows at just half of its capacity on average for a year, implies 300 to 400 Bcf of gas, otherwise would end up in Eastern storage that now will be directed to the Southeast demand centers. Given total maximum Eastern storage is roughly 975 Bcf, MVP flows represent a material and structural shift in local supply and demand fundamentals, which in turn should help tighten local basis over the coming years. In fact, between MVP, coal retirements and organic load growth, we see implied Appalachia demand approaching 41 Bcf per day by 2030 compared with 35 to 36 Bcf per day of current basin supply, which should translate to better local pricing and present a sustainable growth opportunity for EQT at some point in the coming years, given we have the deepest, highest quality inventory of any operator in the basin.\nTurning to guidance. We issued pro forma Q3 and Q4 metrics on Slide 29 of our investor presentation. Our cash operating expenses are expected to range from approximately $1.10 on to $1.25 per Mcfe in the second half of the year, which at the midpoint is roughly $0.25 per Mcfe below our stand-alone operating expenses in Q2. This reflects the benefit of eliminating expenses associated with the Equitrans acquisition or the most notable movement being our gathering rates, which are forecasted to decline from $0.59 per Mcfe in Q2 to just $0.05 to $0.09 per Mcfe in the second half of the year. Inclusive of the benefits from third-party revenue and the full run rate distribution of our MVP ownership, our net operating expense should equate to roughly $0.75 to $0.85 per Mcfe by the fourth quarter which is approximately $0.60 per Mcfe lower than stand-alone EQT and drive some of the relative advantage of our vertically integrated cost structure.\nIt's also worth highlighting that we do not embed any of the $250 million of base synergies into our Q3 or Q4 numbers as we have conservatively modeled base synergy capture beginning in mid-2025. As I mentioned previously, our second half 2024 production outlook embeds approximately 90 Bcfe of strategic curtailments this fall, which we will opportunistically execute should gas prices remain depressed.\nI'd note that curtailments are driving approximately $0.05 per Mcfe of upward pressure on our second half 2024 cost structure. So our 2025 expenses should be even lower than the ranges I cited previously. While we still need to go through our full budgeting process for 2025, we preliminarily expect an all-in pro forma capital budget in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion. Beyond 2025, we forecast long-term pro forma capital spending ranging from $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion per annum prior to capturing the $175 million of upside annual synergies we laid out with the Equitrans acquisition announcement.\nSaid another way, our long-term capital spending inclusive of Equitrans should essentially be in line with stand-alone EQT capital spend in 2024. And this is before capturing upside synergies, which speaks to the structural capital efficiency improvements accruing in our upstream business. At recent strip pricing, we forecast pro forma cumulative free cash flow of approximately $16.5 billion from 2025 to 2029 and an average annual gas price of roughly $3.60 per MMBtu over this period.\nEven assuming a $2.75 natural debt over this period, EQT will still generate north of $9 billion of 5-year cumulative free cash flow, while the bulk of our peers would be cash flow neutral or negative, underscoring the power of our low-cost structure and highlighting how EQT is uniquely positioned to create differentiated shareholder value in all parts of the commodity cycle.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Toby for some concluding remarks.\n\nToby Z. Rice\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThanks, Jeremy. In closing, July 10 marks the 5-year anniversary of the EQT takeover. It has been a lifetime of work, but passed by in the blink of an eye. We have been reflecting recently on what this management team has accomplished together, taking a struggling company with great assets and transforming it into a best-in-class producer recognized as an industry leader. We have increased production over 50% from 4 Bcfe per day to 6.3 Bcfe per day and have transformed our free cash flow cost structure from $3 per million Btu to a purely $2 per million Btu through operational improvements and thoughtful and accretive M&A deals. Normalized for natural gas prices we have grown the free cash flow generation of EQT by 5x and increased free cash flow per share by nearly 2x, and we have prepared our balance sheet and reattained investment-grade credit ratings.\nToday, executing at a high level operationally, with identified opportunities and completions and midstream set to drive yet another step change in operational improvements. We are executing financially with a fast start to our deleveraging plan and robust support from our bank group and shareholders. And we are executing strategically at an industry-leading pace as we continue to transform EQT into the energy company of the future.\nI'd now like to open the call up for questions."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Cameron Horwitz, Managing Director, Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.\n\nCameron Jeffrey Horwitz\n\nAnalyst, U.S. Capital Advisors LLC\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2024 earnings results conference call.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Toby.\n\nToby Z. Rice\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThanks, Cam, and good morning, everyone. Last month, we announced our agreement to acquire Equitrans Midstream, a transaction that will transform EQT into America's first vertically integrated large-scale natural gas business. As we described in our conference call last month, this deal catapults EQT to the absolute low end of the North American natural gas cost curve, providing free cash flow durability in the low parts of the commodity cycle while simultaneously unlocking unmatched price upside by mitigating defensive hedging needs, thus providing investors with peer-leading risk-adjusted exposure to natural gas prices. This combination is anticipated to drive our long-term free cash flow breakeven price to approximately $2 per million BTU, which is $0.75 below the peer average and $1.50 below the marginal cost of supply in the Haynesville.\nThis gap between EQT and both average and marginal natural gas producers is a sustainable advantage, which is rare to find among any commodity business and ensures EQT is best positioned to create through cycle value for shareholders, while other producers are forced to either chase commodity prices with the drill bit in a similar fashion to what has led to historical industry, value destruction or defensively hedge a significant amount of production, thus limiting the ability to capture value in the up cycle.\nAlong with the material cost structure advantage, the combination of EQT and Equitrans will also create an integrated well to watch solution that will help enable Empower growing demand associated with the data center and artificial intelligence booms that are burgeoning across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.\nOur base case view suggests the proliferation of data centers along with growth in other electricity-intensive markets such as electric vehicles to drive an incremental 10 Bcf per day of natural gas demand by 2030. While there is a plausible upside case that could take this number up to 18 Bcf per day. This\nmeans growth in the power generation segment that exceed LNG exports as a bullish demand catalyst for the natural gas market this decade and this structural baseload demand growth story resides at the doorstep of our asset base. Our 1.2 Bcf a day of capacity on MVP, along with the long-term firm sales arrangements we announced with investment-grade utilities last year, means EQT's low emissions natural gas will be a key facilitator of the data center build-out occurring in the Southeastern United States and will give us significant exposure to premium Transco zones 4 and 5 price points.\nDue to the confluence of LNG facilities pulling gas South on Transco and power demand growth in the Southeast, we expect this region will become even more desirable than the Gulf Coast later this decade. As a result, we intend to pursue an expansion of MVP through additional compression to increase capacity from 2 to 2.5 Bcf per day, which will provide additional affordable, reliable and clean Appalachian natural gas to our downstream utility customers.\nOn top of the tremendous opportunity to service customers in the Southeast where we already have first-mover advantage through our record-sized physical gas supply deals with utilities we announced last fall, EQT is ideally situated to meet significant growth in power demand within PJM as well. Our analysis suggests the combination of data center build-outs and additional coal retirements could generate up to 6 Bcf a day of incremental natural gas power demand in our own backyard by 2030.\nWhether it's in the Southeast or at the doorstep of our asset base in Appalachia, EQT is well positioned to capture this thematic tailwind through our material inventory depth and integrated business model that will create a one-stop shop to provide clean, reliable and affordable natural gas that will be foundational to meeting America's power needs as we embark on what will be a transformational journey into the age of AI.\nTurning briefly to first quarter results. The significant operational momentum we achieved last year has carried into 2024, which facilitated better-than-expected results across our drilling and completion teams in Q1. The continuation of highly efficient operational execution, along with strong well performance and lower-than-expected LOE associated with our water infrastructure investments drove outperformance relative to consensus expectations across every major financial metric during the first quarter. We continue to find new innovative ways to push the envelope of what is possible and I want to thank our entire crew for their relentless pursuit of operational excellence.\nShifting gears. Last week, we announced an agreement with Equinor to sell a 40% undivided interest in our nonoperated natural gas assets in Northeast Pennsylvania. Consideration is comprised of $500 million of cash and upstream and midstream assets worth more than $600 million, implying EQT is receiving total value north of $1.1 billion in this transaction. For perspective, we attributed approximately $1.1 billion of value to 100% of the Northeast PA non-op assets when we originally acquired them as part of our Alta acquisition. And the assets have already generated free cash flow in excess of that amount in the past 2 years. So this transaction marks an incredibly successful outcome for shareholders and a strong start to our deleveraging plan.\nThe upstream assets we are receiving include approximately 26,000 net acres in Monroe County, Ohio, directly offsetting EQT operated existing core acreage in West Virginia. We are also receiving an average working interest of 14% in more than 200 producing wells that EQT currently operates in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, along with a 16.25% interest in the EQT-operated Sealy and Warrensville gathering systems servicing this acreage. Following the closing of this transaction, EQT will own 100% of the Sealy and Warrensville gathering systems which aligns with our strategy of lowering cost structure via vertical integration.\nI'd also note, our teams have identified significant operational synergy potential across the operated assets as well as longer-term upside associated with the liquids-rich Marcellus in Monroe County. The nonoperated assets we are selling have forecasted 2025 net production of approximately 225 million cubic feet per day while the operated assets we are receiving have forecasted 2025 net production of approximately 150 million cubic feet per day.\nComparing to $1.1 billion of total value to the 225 million cubic feet per day of total production we are selling, implies a roughly $4,900 per Mcf flowing production multiple. While looking at metrics using net divested production and comparing this to the $500 million of cash consideration equates to roughly 6,700 for flowing Mcfd production multiple.\nWe believe these attractive transaction metrics speak to the value of the high-quality natural gas assets, which are increasingly being coveted by international buyers looking to get exposure to the U.S. natural gas market. This transaction highlights that we are wasting no time jump starting the deleveraging plan we laid out with the Equitrans announcement and creating additional shareholder value in the process.\nThe sale of our remaining 60% interest in these nonoperated upstream assets and the option to monetize regulated or noncore midstream assets at Equitrans gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to achieve our debt repayment goals, and we look forward to updating the market as we make additional progress on this front.\nTo sum up, first quarter results demonstrate a continuation of peak performance at EQT. Our announcement of the Equitrans acquisition is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to vertically integrate one of the highest quality natural gas resource bases in the world, creating a one-stop shop to provide natural gas that will meet the growing data center and power generation needs at the doorstep of our asset base. And our recent transaction with Equinor illuminates significant hidden value embedded in our nonoperated natural gas assets and gets us off to an extremely strong start towards achieving our deleveraging goals. I'll now turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy T. Knop\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Toby, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by summarizing our first quarter results beginning with sales volumes, which totaled 534 Bcfe. As previously announced, we curtailed 1 Bcf per day of gross production beginning in late February and through all of March in response to the low natural gas price environment resulting from warm winter weather.\nAlong with nonoperated curtailments, we estimate the total impact was 30 to 35 Bcfe during the quarter. Thus, normalized for curtailments, first quarter production would have been toward the high end of our guidance range, underscoring strong operational efficiency and well performance during the quarter.\nDespite the curtailments during the quarter, our per unit operating costs still came in at the midpoint of our guidance range at $1.36 per Mcfe. A significant contributor to this was the outperformance on LOE, which came in below the low end of our guidance range. This LOE beat represents a continuation of the trend of LOE outperformance we highlighted throughout 2023, as our strategic investments in water infrastructure continue to drive tangible cost structure reductions.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Recall, we retired all of our outstanding convertible notes, which eliminated $400 million of absolute debt over the past 2 quarters. We also liquidated the capped call that we had purchased in conjunction with issuing the convertible notes for cash proceeds of $93 million. Additionally, we issued a $750 million 10-year bond and use the proceeds to reduce our term loan balance from $1.25 billion to $500 million while extending the maturity by 12 months to June 2026.\nWe exited the first quarter with total debt of approximately $5.5 billion and roughly $650 million of cash on the balance sheet, leaving a net debt position of approximately $4.9 billion at the end of the quarter, down from $5.7 billion at the end of 2023. Subsequent to quarter end, we used $205 million of our cash balance to fund the previously announced buyout of a minority equity partner in EQT operated gathering systems in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, which closed earlier this month.\nThis acquisition is expected to add approximately $30 million to our 2025 free cash flow outlook, highlighting an attractive free cash flow yield on assets that are annuity-like and have near zero execution risk due to EQT's existing operatorship of both upstream development and the midstream system.\nWe intend to apply the remainder of our cash balance, along with the $500 million of cash proceeds from the Equinor deal towards debt reduction, which will allow us to make swift and significant progress toward the deleveraging goals that we laid out with the Equitrans announcement. We also recently added to our Q4 2024 and first half 2025 hedge book to further derisk our deleveraging plans.\nWe are now between 40% and 50% hedged for the remainder of 2024 with an average floor price of approximately $3.40 per MMBtu. We are also approximately 40% hedged in Q1 and Q2 of 2025 with average floor prices ranging from roughly $3.05 to $3.30 per MMBtu.\nUpon closing the Equitrans acquisition and achieving our debt targets, we anticipate limiting defensive programmatic hedging to less than 20% of our production in a given year. Going forward, our $2 Henry Hub free cash flow breakeven price provides a structural hedge as the Equitrans acquisition strips out the operating leverage from our business, limiting our need to financially hedge. This unique dynamic provides EQT's investors differentiated upside torque to natural gas prices and peer-leading downside protection simultaneously.\nTurning to the 2024 outlook we issued, second quarter guidance and updated our full year production outlook to reflect voluntary production curtailments in response to the current low natural gas price environment. Our second quarter production outlook and per unit metrics embed the expectation that we will continue to curtail 1 Bcf per day of gross operated production through the end of May.\nOur updated full year production guidance also captures this assumption and embeds additional optionality for further curtailments this fall should natural gas prices remain low. We believe our strategy of near-term curtailments while maintaining steady operations is the right approach to this market for EQT. In contrast to high-cost producers who need to cut activity to reduce CapEx in hopes of remaining free cash flow positive.\nIt is also important to remember that production is fungible between old wells and new wells so it makes little sense to defer new well TILs versus simply turning off production today. Our production today is a product of our investments in the last 2 to 3 years. And our CapEx investments today have little impact on the volume this year, but rather drive volumes in 2025 and 2026, when the futures market suggests gas prices will be higher than they are today.\nEQT is positioned to take this approach as a result of our low-cost structure and strong balance sheet. And this is a good reminder of why we refer to a low-cost structure as our strategic North Star. We also embedded a June startup for MVP and our updated outlook on the heels of Equitrans' filing for in service with the FERC this week. This represents a meaningful milestone as MVPs in service is a contractual condition precedent to closing the Equitrans acquisition and will finally allow EQT to provide much-needed natural gas to consumers in the Southeast region to meet growing power demand, displace coal and improve grid reliability.\nAs Toby mentioned, upon closing of the Equitrans acquisition, we intend to pursue expanding MVP from 2 Bcf per day to 2.5 Bcf per day to meet additional demand growth expected in the Southeast region. This expansion will be achieved through the addition of compression to the existing pipe rather than laying new steel and thus has a low execution and regulatory risk profile and high returns with an estimated build multiple of just 4 to 5x EBITDA.\nTurning to Slide 7 of our investor presentation, we provided more granular details on how the Equitrans transaction is expected to impact EQT's pro forma cost structure. While we are still working through some of the nuances of exactly how the transaction will be accounted for in our financial statements, this cost walk should give investors a good framework for thinking about the pro forma impacts of the transaction.\nIn summary, we expect the transaction to drive a pro forma unlevered cost structure improvement of approximately $0.50 per Mcfe. Base synergies equate to approximately $0.12 per Mcfe and upside synergies provide a further $0.08 improvement. So the cost structure benefits to EQT from the Equitrans deal could total approximately $0.70 per Mcfe over time. That is a monumental impact.\nThe advantage arising from this cost structure improvement is evident on Slide 10 of our investor deck, where we show cumulative 2025 to 2029 free cash flow for pro forma EQT and natural gas peers at gas prices ranging from $2.75 to $5 per MMBtu. EQT's pro forma free cash flow durability is peer leading at $2.75 natural gas prices as we project approximately $8 billion of cumulative free cash flow versus most peers to our free cash flow negative at this price deck.\nAt the same time, free cash flow and an upside price environment, pro forma cumulative free cash flow generation of a staggering $26 billion. And importantly, most peers will actually have much less upside than shown here as they are likely to defensively and programmatically hedge away much of the commodity price upside to protect the downside risk resulting from high operating leverage.\nThis underscores how the Equitrans acquisition drives free cash flow durability and down cycles while unlocking the ability to capture asymmetric upside in high-priced environments, given limited financial hedging needs. I want to close by sharing a few observations from the more than 100 meetings we've had with EQT and Equitrans shareholders in the wake of our acquisition announcement.\nWhile we have already experienced a high grading of our shareholder base over the past several years, the Equitrans transaction has further accelerated this trend as the merits of pairing the characteristics of a major integrated company with the superior long-term demand profile of natural gas is resonating extremely well. And we have been encouraged by the near unanimous support for the transaction from some of the world's largest, most thoughtful long-term fund managers, including shareholders of Equitrans who have expressed excitement in owning significant stakes in the new EQT.\nWe think our easy-to-own business model will be increasingly coveted by long-term coffee can style investors who are structurally bullish natural gas long term. and we look forward to demonstrating this differentiated value proposition for shareholders as we navigate the volatile world ahead. And with that, we'd now like to open up the call to questions."

Please go ahead.\n\nCameron Jeffrey Horwitz\n\nAnalyst, U.S. Capital Advisors LLC\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and year-end 2023 earnings results conference call.

Please refer to our most recent earnings release and investor presentation for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Toby.\n\nToby Z. Rice\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThanks, Cam, and good morning, everyone. Coming into 2023, I sat down with our leadership team, and we set our overarching corporate mission and goal for the year with 2 simple words: peak performance.\nI wanted our fourth year since the takeover of EQT to be our best one yet, and the crew certainly came through in delivering on that mission. I want to take a few moments to briefly reflect on the incredible accomplishments from this organization that we achieved over the course of 2023.\nOn the operations front, we set multiple drilling world records and achieved our highest completion efficiency pace ever with 2023 monthly pumping hours per crew up more than 15% year-over-year. Importantly, this incredible operational pace came amid a 22% improvement in our 2023 EHS intensity, which was even better than our 15% target and underscores our unwavering commitment to safety at EQT.\nOn the financial front, despite a challenging natural gas price environment, EQT generated nearly $880 million of free cash flow in 2023, retired north of $1.1 billion of debt and raised our base dividend by 5%. This financial performance is a clear demonstration of our advantaged position at the low end of the North American natural gas cost curve and highlights that EQT is poised to thrive regardless of where we are in the commodity cycle.\nOn the M&A front, we closed on the strategic acquisition of Tug Hill and XcL Midstream and integrated the assets at a record pace. Our team has wasted no time driving material operational performance improvement on the assets. With the latest EQT operated Marcellus drilling costs coming in more than $200 per foot or nearly 55% lower than Tug Hill operated wells. This recent performance suggests the potential for even more upside than the $150 per foot of well cost savings we discussed last quarter, which, as a reminder, is additive to $80 million of largely infrastructure-related synergies we originally announced with the deal.\nOn the marketing front, EQT's low-cost peer-leading inventory depth and environmental attributes enabled us to sign the largest long-term physical supply deals ever executed in the North American natural gas market with some of the country's leading utilities. With much stronger-than-expected power generation growth in many regions of the United States and natural gas providing the ideal low-carbon dispatchable complement to renewable generation, we expect gas-fired power demand will surprise the upside over the coming decade and EQT's unique ability to meet this demand should result in additional margin capture opportunities moving forward.\nWe also made material progress executing on our differentiated LNG strategy, leveraging our significant Gulf Coast firm transportation capacity to sign HOAs covering 2.5 million tons per annum of LNG tolling capacity or roughly 5% of our total natural gas production. Our more integrated approach to LNG exposure compared with peers gives us direct connectivity to end users of our gas globally, and we have seen strong interest from prospective international buyers.\nWhile there has been some noise around LNG permitting of late, the outcome of COP 28 demonstrates the world has spoken deeming natural gas is critical in facilitating the energy transition while ensuring energy security. It is abundantly clear that nations around the world currently powered by coal, desperately want and need greater access to natural gas and ultimately, political posturing will reconcile with this reality if we, as a society, are truly intent on achieving global climate goals.\nOn the ESG front, we announced a first of its kind public-private forestry partnership with the state of West Virginia, which will create one of the highest quality, most verifiable nature-based carbon sequestration projects anywhere around the globe. We have already seen solid momentum on this project to date, and we are incrementally confident in EQT's ability to become the first energy company of meaningful scale in the world to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions. This impressive list of achievements is a showcase of what is possible when you combine a world-class asset base with an industry-leading digitally enabled team underpinned by a culture of excellence and teamwork.\nTurning to our reserve report. EQT's 2023 proved reserves totaled 27.6 Tcfe, which was up 2.6 Tcfe relative to 2022, largely driven by additions from the Tug Hill acquisition.\nImportantly, even with the SEC price deck dropping from over $6 per million Btu at year-end 2022 and to $2.64 at year-end 2023, EQT's proved reserves prior to the impact of Tug Hill were slightly higher year-over-year, underscoring the economic resiliency of our world-class low-cost Appalachian reserve base.\nWithin our proved undeveloped reserve category of roughly 8 Tcfe, we have just 417 gross locations booked or roughly 3 years of development, representing only 10% of our derisked inventory of nearly 4,000 gross locations. It's also worth highlighting that we estimate an additional 2 Tcfe of reserves not captured in our bookings associated with our nonoperated position in Northeast Pennsylvania as we book limited PUDs on this asset, given we only have timing visibility out 3 to 6 months.\nAdditionally, we've taken a conservative stance with limited reserve bookings for Tug Hills go-forward Utica inventory in West Virginia, which should be a source of reserve upside over time. Using the year-end 2023 SEC price deck of just $2.64 per million BTU, the PV-10 of our proved reserves is approximately $12 billion. Assuming recent strip pricing, this value jumps to almost $23 billion. And again, this describes credit to just 3 years or 10% of our remaining inventory.\nI'd also note our reserve valuation is calculated prior to the impact of our firm transportation portfolio to the value accruing to EQT for marketing arrangements. Like the MVP firm sales contracts we announced last quarter are incremental to these PV-10 values. We see the consistency and economic resiliency reflected in our reserve report as an important channel check for investors that highlights EQT has among the highest quality, lowest cost natural gas asset base anywhere in the world.\nLooking to 2024, we are initiating 2024 production guidance of 2,200 to 2,300 Bcfe, which includes some flexibility to curtail volumes should natural gas prices remain weak. Our program contemplates running 2 to 3 rigs, 3 to 4 frac crews and turning in line 110 to 140 net wells. As shown on Slide 6 of our investor deck, this activity level juxtaposed against our large production base underscores the incredible capital efficiency and quality of our assets. As EQT is generating the most gross operated production per rig of any natural gas operator in the United States by a wide margin.\nLooking at our spending profile, we are setting a 2024 maintenance capital budget of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion, including maintenance, land and infrastructure spending. We have also tactically allocated $200 million to $300 million for strategic growth projects across water infrastructure, gas gathering and land that are opportunistic in nature and highly symbiotic with our upstream operations. Jeremy will give more details later on, but these projects generate the best risk-adjusted returns in our portfolio, derisk our upstream execution allow us to replenish inventory at extremely attractive costs and facilitate the compounding of capital for shareholder value creation.\nAt the midpoint of our maintenance capital and production guidance ranges, our implied 2024 maintenance capital efficiency equates to $0.89 per Mcfe. And our unhedged maintenance NYMEX free cash flow breakeven is $2.50 to $2.60 per million Btu.\nWith contractual gathering rate reductions, the shallowing of our base decline, improving basis from the firm sales arrangements we announced last quarter and reductions in interest expense, our all-in NYMEX free cash flow breakeven price should be on a glide path down towards $2.30 per million Btu over the next several years.\nWe believe this economic profile is in a class of its own relative to the rest of the industry. Where we expect to see upward pressure on cost structure over this period associated with operators shifting to lower quality inventory in both the Haynesville and parts of Appalachia. This differentiation is highlighted by the fact that we project EQT will generate cumulative free cash flow of almost $9 billion over the next 5 years at a natural gas strip that averages approximately $3.40 per million BTU over this period.\nThis gas price is roughly equivalent to the fully loaded corporate marginal cost of supply in the U.S. required to simply break even from a free cash flow perspective, let alone to generate returns for shareholders. Said another way, higher cost natural gas producers will at best generate no shareholder value at the current strip over the next 5 years while EQT is set to generate more than 40% of our enterprise value and free cash flow over the same time frame. This stark contrast underscores why cost structure is our North Star at EQT and why we strive not to be the biggest, but to be the highest quality, most resilient company that can generate durable free cash flow both in up cycles and in down cycles.\nThis is the essence of sustainability and value creation in a commodity business. And we believe our shareholders are uniquely positioned to reap the rewards of EQT's unrivaled combination of scale, peer-leading low-cost inventory depths and best-in-class emissions profile.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Knop\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Toby, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by summarizing our fourth quarter results, which highlight our operational momentum as we closed out the year. .\nSales volumes of 564 Bcfe was toward the high end of our guidance range, reflecting continued best-in-class execution from our drilling and completion teams, along with strong well performance. Our per unit adjusted operating revenues were $2.75 per Mcfe, and our total per unit operating costs were $1.27 per Mcfe. Which were at the low end of our guidance range driven by lower-than-expected LOE and G&A expenses.\nIt's worth noting that we outperformed LOE expectations every quarter in 2023 with total absolute LOE coming in $40 million below our internal forecast. Driven largely by more efficient water handling facilitated by the investments we've made in water infrastructure.\nCapital expenditures were $539 million, which were in the lower half of our guidance range, reflecting the operational efficiency gains Toby mentioned previously.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Last month, we completed several transactions that eliminated debt, reduced interest expense, simplified our balance sheet and established an important 10-year pricing reference point. Which is the longest dated bond outstanding of our natural gas peers and underscores the market's confidence in our inventory duration.\nFirst, we retired all outstanding convertible senior notes due in 2026. Which eliminated more than $400 million of absolute debt. Recall, our fully diluted share count already included the shares associated with our convertible notes. We simultaneously liquidated the capped call that we had purchased in conjunction with the issuance of the convertible notes for cash proceeds of $93 million. Pro forma the convertible note retirement, our total debt outstanding is currently $5.5 billion, which equates to a 1.6x leverage when annualizing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA.\nFollowing the convertible note settlement, we executed a highly successful $750 million 10-year bond offering last month. The proceeds of which we used to pay off 60% of the term loan that we borrowed in conjunction with the closing of the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream acquisitions. We saw extremely strong demand from the credit market with a peak order book of almost $6 billion and the bonds pricing at a tight 1.65% spread to comparable U.S. treasury rates. Which is similar to credit spreads of many of the highest quality large-cap companies in the broader energy sector.\nIn conjunction with the bond offering, we also extended the maturity of our remaining term loan from mid-2025 to mid-2026, providing ample flexibility for maturity management moving forward.\nIn terms of capital allocation, we will continue to prioritize debt paydown until we achieve our $3.5 billion gross debt target. Our capital allocation philosophy is underpinned by an unwavering focus on establishing a fortress balance sheet, countercyclical and opportunistic share repurchases and a steadily growing base dividend. This long-term focused value investing framework has received resounding support from our increasingly high-quality shareholder base, and we will continue to allocate capital in accordance with this first principles framework.\nLooking ahead to 2024, we are setting an annual production guidance range of 2,200 to 2,300 Bcfe, which is underpinned by a fully loaded maintenance capital program of $1.95 million to $2.05 billion. Additionally, we are investing $200 million to $300 million into several strategic growth projects in the form of midstream and water infrastructure and infill land capture this year. These opportunistic investments are significantly value enhancing and I want to take a moment to highlight the merits of each of these.\nThe acquisition of XcL Midstream last year created a full-service midstream platform within EQT. And through this platform, we are already sourcing proprietary opportunities that generate strong risk-adjusted returns and robust free cash flow yields, even superior to those of our core Marcellus wells. While at the same time derisking our upstream operations.\nAs shown on Slide 10, we are investing in 3 Midstream growth projects this year, comprised of the Clarington Connector, the OAKGATE Pipeline and the Pacific Coast compression project. The combined capital associated with these projects is approximately $115 million, and once fully operational, these projects should generate aggregate annual free cash flow of nearly $50 million in the form of superior price realizations. This implies these investments will generate an aggregate free cash flow yield of nearly 40%, which is extremely attractive given the absence of price risk and the annuity-like cash flow profile over a 20-year asset life. We forecast a total return on investment of roughly 8x and the aggregate net present value of these projects is estimated at $250 million, implying value creation for shareholders equivalent to roughly $0.60 per share.\nDespite only having this Midstream business for just 6 months, these initial projects provide a glimpse into the long-term opportunity we see for this new business line. Reinvestment opportunities of this quality only come about because of the symbiotic relationship between our midstream and upstream teams working in alignment together. We believe this approach to growing shareholder value is differentiated among peers. Especially in a $2 gas world. And intend to cultivate this platform so that it becomes an even more impactful driver of shareholder value creation over time.\nWithin our reserve development CapEx, we've also allocated $80 million to expand our existing water infrastructure assets in West Virginia. As shown on Slide 12 of our investor deck, we expect 2024 investments into our water infrastructure to drive annual savings of $20 million, implying a 25% free cash flow yield on our invested capital.\nOur EQT-owned water system has materially increased the amount of water produced that we can recycle, which is having a tangible impact on our cost structure as demonstrated by our LOE coming in below forecast every quarter last year. Translating to $40 million more free cash flow than originally forecasted.\nTurning to land. We have roughly $100 million allocated to opportunistic infill leasehold growth in mineral acquisitions this year. As shown on Slide 13 of our investor presentation, opportunistic leasehold additions organically replenished 65% of the acreage that we developed over just the past year. Which is a pace of replenishment that can materially expand our years of inventory when aggregated over time. We believe this ability to organically backfill developed inventory is a unique feature among U.S. shale plays that largely exists only within Southwest Appalachia due to the land configuration and historic development activity.\nWe are seeing notable opportunities to add to our acreage position at extremely attractive prices this year given the low commodity price environment, which we were able to capture due to our strong financial position. To put into context, the value creation potential of deploying leasehold capital, we highlight a very tangible example on Slide 13 of our investor presentation.\nIn 2022, we infill leased acreage and increased our working interest by 18% in our Polecat North development located in Greene County, which we brought online last year. The incremental interest we added in this project through organic leasing is projected to generate a 90%-plus free cash flow yield in year 1 alone and nearly 55% of annual free cash flow yield over the first 5 years and a return on invested capital of roughly 7x the strip pricing.\nThis example highlights why we see these tactical land expenditures as an extremely attractive reinvestment of capital while simultaneously extending inventory duration, which can, in turn, help facilitate additional strategic initiatives such as signing long-term supply agreements.\nA key point I want to leave you with on these growth projects is whether it's land capital, infrastructure investments, our acquisition strategy, long-term agreements with utilities or our base upstream business. We are incredibly intentional about aligning these decisions to ensure they symbiotically work together to enhance each other and collectively result in optimal risk-adjusted compounding of shareholder capital in the decades ahead.\nIn essence, this is the definition of terminal value. And through building a successful track record of these decisions, we expect this to be reflected in our stock price.\nLastly, I want to quickly touch on our cost structure guidance given the moving pieces with the imminent startup of MVP. We are guiding full year transmission expense to $0.42 to $0.44 per Mcfe. Which is up approximately $0.10 year-over-year driven by the costs associated with MVP. This is partly offset by an accompanying contractual step-down in our gathering rates. Which we forecast to be in the $0.52 to $0.54 range for 2024, down from roughly $0.65 in 2023.\nWithin our 2024 corporate differential guidance of $0.50 to $0.70. We conservatively assume EQT flows only a portion of our MVP capacity due to downstream limitations at Station 165. In the winter months, we should be able to flow at higher rates on MVP and realize a greater premium on downstream pricing. Thus, the cash flow uplift associated with MVP will be seasonal in nature until downstream expansion projects come online.\nIt's also worth highlighting that we have roughly 50 MMcf per day of our Station 165 pricing exposure hedged through financial instruments and firm physical sales through 2025 and which provides downside protection should there be any further price pressure downstream of MVP over the next few years.\nWith nearly 2.5 Bcf per day of upcoming project expansions at Station 165, and significant demand pull from the Southeast region, our ability to flow volumes on MVP and associated realized pricing should progressively improve over the coming years. Culminating in the commencement of our firm sales contracts in 2027 that are projected to improve our corporate-wide differential by $0.15 to $0.20, driving a $300 million-plus uplift in annual free cash flow generation.\nTurning to Slide 11 of our investor presentation. We announced the proposed acquisition of an additional 34% ownership in the EQT operated Sealy and Warrensville gathering system in Northeast Pennsylvania for $205 million in cash, and we currently expect the transaction to close in late Q1 or early Q2.\nEQT currently owns 50% of this gathering system. So our pro forma ownership will increase to 84% based on terms agreed to in the purchase agreement. Subject to the potential exercise of certain preferential purchase rights. Recall, this gathering system was part of the Alta acquisition we completed in 2021, which has been a significant source of value creation for EQT. The purchase price implies we are acquiring these assets for a double-digit free cash flow yield underscoring how this deal allows us to reinvest capital into durable, long-lived infrastructure at an attractive rate of return with near zero execution risk, given we operate both the system and the upstream development underpinning the assets.\nConsistent with our broader strategy to reinvest capital into assets that improve our corporate cost structure, our greater ownership in the system will immediately lower our overall free cash flow breakeven price by more than $0.01 per Mcfe upon close. We are currently looking at ways we can shift even more development activity onto this system over the coming years, which could drive additional upside to the transaction.\nMoving to hedging. We tactically added to the front end of our 2024 hedge position earlier this year. Leaning into the price spike that occurred ahead of the winter storm in January. We have now greater than 50% of our first quarter 2024 production volumes hedged with a weighted average floor price of $3.87 per MMBtu. Which has derisked a significant portion of our free cash flow outlook for the year.\nWe have nearly 50% of our second quarter production hedged with a weighted average floor of $3.39 per MMBtu. And roughly 40% of our Q3 production covered at a weighted average floor price of $3.42 per MMBtu. Additionally, we've recently added some 2024 winter hedges. Taking our fourth quarter hedge coverage up to more than 20% with a weighted average floor price of $3.47 per MMBtu.\nTurning to Appalachian basis differentials were relatively wide during the fourth quarter, driven by an elevated Eastern storage level and rising production associated with multiple operators completing wells that were deferred from earlier in the year.\nOur strong basis hedge position again paid dividends this quarter, boosting our corporate-wide realized natural gas price by $0.08 per MMBtu. As it relates to the increase in Appalachian supply, after peaking at just under 37 Bcf per day in December, production in the basin has fallen by roughly 1.5 Bcf per day and we anticipate further declines in the Appalachian supply through the second quarter.\nOn the local demand side, it's noteworthy that PJM recently doubled its 15-year annualized load growth forecast from 0.8% to 1.6%. This equates to nearly 7 gigawatts of additional power demand by 2027, in more than 10 gigawatts by 2030. Which, if satisfied by natural gas, would translate to nearly 2 Bcf per day of additional local demand by the end of the decade. This trend of increasing local demand juxtaposed against a relatively flat basin supply and the commencement of MVP should provide a structural tailwind for local pricing over the coming years. which we do not believe is currently priced into the basis futures market.\nAs it relates to Lower 48 supply, it's worth highlighting that a prominent data vendor revised its year-to-date supply estimates downward by 1 to 2 Bcf per day this week. We had suspected certain data sources were overstating production, and this downward revision validated the market is not as oversupplied as many previously thought. Assuming production simply stays flat at the current revised level and weather is normal through the injection season, end of summer gas storage will be roughly in line with the 5-year average level.\nI'll close by sharing a few philosophical thoughts on what we believe it takes to not only survive but to Thrive is a natural gas producer and a macro backdrop that we expect will be characterized by unpredictable volatility for the foreseeable future. The real long-term winners in this business will not be the biggest companies that gain scale simply for the sake of scale, but will instead be the companies that have a corporate cost structure that is currently and in the future at the low end of the cost curve.\nA low cost structure is the only competitive advantage one can have in a commodity-driven business, which is why it is our North Star and drives nearly all of our strategic decision-making.\nWhile we are believers that future natural gas prices will be higher on average. We do not believe that prices will be stable at the $4 to $5 level, like the prevailing consensus view. And building a business around this assumption of average prices is likely to end poorly. Until we return to a world where we can build necessary domestic infrastructure, we believe we are more likely to see prices either around the $2 level they are today, to force high-cost producers to curtail production and activity were materially higher to curtail demand. As pricing becomes the only variable left to balance natural gas inventories.\nSaid another way, we believe an increasingly fat-tailed distribution of outcomes. That is a critical distinction, and we're already seeing the manifestation of this dynamic with prompt month pricing at this moment. However, EQT is at the low end of the cost curve and will be moving even further down the cost curve over the next 5 years due to our contractual gathering rate reductions in long-term MVP firm sales agreements. This outcome is by design as our philosophy toward creating value in a cyclical, volatile commodity business has underpinned every one of our strategic decisions over the past several years. The culmination of these decisions has created a unique opportunity for investors, deploy capital into the preeminent natural gas platform that is positioned to generate peer-leading shareholder value through all parts of the commodity cycle over the long term.\nAnd with that, we'll open the call to questions."

The third quarter saw a multitude of positive highlights and record-breaking performance at EQT, including closing the strategic acquisition of Tug Hill and XcL Midstream in late August. As shown on Slide 5 of our investor deck, with roughly 60 days under our belt post closing, we currently have 74% of total integration milestones actions completed. To put this in context, this is a record pace for EQT and the most efficient integration yet despite significantly greater deal complexity relative to Alta and Chevron.\nThe successive improvement in our integration pace is reflective of leveraging lessons learned from previous transactions to refine our integration playbook, which is unique to EQT's proprietary digital platform and is a repeatable process that we have honed with each successful acquisition. I want to take a moment to send a huge shout-out to the EQT crew for all the hard work that has facilitated the incredible integration efficiency achieved over the past 2 months.\nAlongside efficiently integrating the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream assets, the teams have identified multiple areas of potential operational improvements that we did not contemplate when underwriting the acquisition. We broadly see these opportunities falling into 2 buckets comprised of well-designed and operational efficiencies. As it relates to operational efficiencies, I want to first talk about third quarter performance for stand-alone EQT and then provide some stats on what the teams have already achieved on the Tug Hill assets.\nAs shown on Slide 7 of our investor deck, after posting stellar second quarter operational performance, both our drilling and completions again set new internal and world records in 3Q. Recall last quarter, we highlighted EQT's world record of drilling over 18,200 feet in 48 hours on the same run. This record lasted a mere 60 days as our team bested that effort by drilling 18,264 feet in 48 hours on our Denver 5H well in August. On the completions front, our teams are firing on all cylinders with third quarter pumping hours per crew averaging north of 400 hours, which is an all-time high pace for EQT. This includes besting our prior record for monthly pumping hours twice during the quarter, with 2 crews each achieving north of 500 pumping hours in a month.\nTo put this into context, the theoretical maximum pumping hours in a month for a single frac crew is roughly 600 hours after accounting for minimum maintenance time, so our teams are knocking on the doorstep of perfection. This performance reflects our strategy of aggressively attacking all facets of the supply chain to eliminate as many bottlenecks as possible for our completions team, and our Q3 execution underscores the dividends accruing from these efforts.\nTurning back to Tug Hill. As shown on Slide 6 of our investor deck, our teams are wasting no time unleashing EQT's industry-leading operational progress as we've taken over the assets. To put some numbers around this, in just 60 days since taking over operations, our completions team has already increased the amount of stages completed per day by 35% relative to legacy Tug Hill development, and we see room for additional upside as our teams optimize water handling and sand logistics across the asset base.\nOn the drilling front, since taking over operations, our team has already improved horizontal drilling speeds by 50% relative to legacy Tug Hill performance and driven down horizontal drilling cost per foot by more than 40%. As we high-grade equipment and fully implement EQT best practices, we expect further efficiency gains that will allow us to drop drilling activity on Tug's acreage from 2 rigs to 1 by the end of the year all while still drilling the same amount of lateral footage year-over-year in 2024. Our teams also plan to methodically test various EQT well design changes on the Tug Hill assets, including cluster spacing, clusters per stage, proppant loading, proppant type and casing weight, to name a few. While it's still early to quantify the full impact of efficiency gains and operational synergies on the Tug Hill assets, we preliminarily see the potential for up to $150 per foot of well cost savings associated with these efforts.\nThe potential impact from optimizing well design parameters and improving operational efficiencies represent value creation upside on top of the $80 million of synergy value potential we announced with the deal. As a reminder, the original synergies we discussed were only driven by water system integration, firm transport optimization and land spend efficiencies, which should accrue over the next several years.\nLooking ahead to 2024, while we are still in the process of fine-tuning our pro forma operation schedule, we preliminarily expect to run 3 horizontal rigs and 3 to 4 frac crews in total next year, which is a level of activity that maintains production at approximately 2.3 Tcfe per annum. At current strip pricing of approximately $3.40 per million BTU next year, we preliminarily see roughly $1.7 billion of pro forma free cash flow in 2024 and cumulative free cash flow of approximately $14 billion from 2024 to 2028. As shown on Slide 11 of our investor deck, this equates to cumulative free cash flow of approximately 60% of our enterprise value, which is the highest not only among our gas peers but also the broader upstream energy sector. We believe this outlook underscores the tremendous absolute and relative value proposition of EQT shares even after strong relative stock performance over the past several years.\nShifting gears to Slide 8 of our investor presentation, we are excited to announce that we have signed 2 10-year firm sales agreements with investment-grade utilities covering all 1.2 Bcf per day of our capacity on MVP that will commence concurrent with the completion of downstream expansion projects in 2027. Recall, we had previously entered into an AMA for 525 million cubic feet per day of our MVP capacity, which we have restructured into an 800 million cubic feet per day firm sales arrangement with the same counterparty and entered into an additional 400 million cubic feet per day firm sale with a separate counterparty. These are 2 of the largest long-term physical supply deals ever executed in the North American natural gas market, and we believe signal the buyers confidence in EQT's unique ability to deliver reliable, clean and affordable natural gas supply to millions of customers in the southeastern part of the United States.\nThese agreements also highlight how EQT's scale and depth of inventory are catalyzing the expansion opportunities downstream of MVP, which will bring gas further into the Southeast demand centers where it is critically needed to replace coal-fired power generation and meet the region's climate goals. To put the environmental benefits into perspective, assuming EQT's natural gas displaces coal-fired power generation, the combined impact of these supply agreements would result in approximately 40 million tons per annum of emissions reductions, which is equivalent to taking more than 8 million gasoline-powered vehicles off the road every year.\nOn top of the environmental benefits, these deals should create a win-win economic impact, providing cash flow uplift for EQT while concurrently dampening natural gas price volatility for consumers in the Southeast region. Recall, our capacity on MVP will initially receive pricing at Station 165, but as downstream projects and these new firm sales arrangements commence, EQT's capacity will be debottlenecked and our pricing exposure will shift to a blend of premium demand areas, including Henry Hub and Transco Zones 4 and 5 South. To put the impact of this in context, we see these firm sales arrangements and associated downstream debottlenecking projects increasing our annual free cash flow by more than $300 million beginning in 2028.\nAt the same time, the debottlenecking of EQT supply further into the Southeast should dampen natural gas price volatility for consumers in the region, improve grid reliability and materially reduce the risk of service interruptions. In our view, these agreements represent clear and tangible examples of EQT's ability to generate differentiated shareholder value out of each molecule while simultaneously fostering better outcomes for American consumers by leveraging our unique platform consisting of peer-leading scale, a strong investment-grade balance sheet, low cost structure, deep high-quality inventory and advantaged environmental attributes.\nTurning to LNG. Last month, we announced a heads of agreement for liquefaction services from Commonwealth LNG facility in Cameron Parish, Louisiana to produce 1 million tons per annum of LNG under a 15-year tolling agreement. This comes on the heel of a prior HOA with Lake Charles LNG and upon completion of definitive agreements will take our total committed LNG tolling capacity to 2 million tons per annum or roughly 270 million cubic feet of gas per day. The Commonwealth agreement is a continuation of our LNG strategy we described on our last call, which entails diversifying a portion of the 1.2 Bcf per day we delivered to the Gulf Coast via firm pipeline capacity into international markets.\nAs a reminder, EQT is pursuing a differentiated and more integrated approach to international exposure through tolling arrangements, which we believe provide the best combination of upside exposure with downside risk mitigation. Our strategy gives us direct connectivity to end users of our gas globally, allows for end market structuring flexibility and superior downside protection. We are currently pursuing signing SPAs with prospective international buyers as well as additional opportunities to increase our tolling exposure. Our scale, low-cost structure, peer-leading core inventory depth and environmental attributes uniquely position us to compete and win in the global energy arena. And we believe the international market will increasingly covet EQT's molecules as a long-duration secure supply source that can drive meaningful emissions reductions via coal displacement, similar to the precedent we are setting in the U.S. Southeast market with our newly announced firm sales agreements directly with utilities.\nShifting to Slide 16 of our investor deck, we recently announced a first-of-its-kind public-private partnership with the state of West Virginia to identify and implement forced management practices across the state. Facilitated by the state's Department of Commerce, Division of Forestry and Division of Natural Resources, the partnership brings together EQT's transparent, data-driven approach to emissions reduction and West Virginia's commitment to the conservation, development and protection of its renowned forest lands to advance Appalachia's position as a premier world partner in decarbonization. We plan to deploy advanced soil probe technology from our partners at Teralytic, which allow for real-time soil measurement to ensure the quantification of carbon reduction is accurate and transparent.\nWe will also leverage our strategic partnership with Context Labs to provide full digital integration and accountability of our carbon reduction effort. Operational efficacy of these projects will be assured and audited by West Virginia University's Natural Resources Analysis Center, a multidisciplinary research and teaching facility. We believe the processes being deployed in our partnership with West Virginia will create one of the highest-quality, most verifiable nature-based carbon sequestration projects anywhere around the globe. The output of this effort will be a key enabling factor for EQT to become the first energy company in the world of meaningful scale to achieve verifiable net zero Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions.\nTurning to Slide 17 of our investor presentation. We were excited to see the Appalachia Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub, or ARCH2, recently selected as 1 of 7 hydrogen hubs in the country to receive DOE funding to accelerate the deployment of U.S. hydrogen technologies and contribute to decarbonizing multiple sectors of the economy. As a reminder, ARCH2 is a collaboration initiated by EQT, the state of West Virginia, Batel GTI Energy and Allegheny Science and Technology. The broader ARCH2 team is comprised of multiple entities with operations across the Appalachian region, spanning the hydrogen value chain as well as technology organizations, consultants, academic institutions, community organizations and NGOs that will provide commercial and technical leadership for the development and build-out of the hub.\nThe DOE has allocated up to $925 million to ARCH2, noting the hub will leverage the region's ample access to low-cost, low emissions natural gas to produce clean hydrogen and permanently sequester CO2. Along with the decarbonization impact, ARCH2 is anticipated to facilitate various community benefits, including the potential to create more than 21,000 high-paying jobs. The selection of ARCH2 deeply reinforces the critical role natural gas, particularly Appalachia natural gas, will play in our nation's transition to a lower carbon energy future, and EQT is uniquely positioned to be at the forefront of this process.\nIn terms of EQT's participation, we are in the early stages of formulating a high-level development plan with rigorous assessment of project economics to better understand value creation potential, and we expect minimal capital requirements over the next couple of years. Over the medium term, EQT will have significant optionality to evaluate and participate in projects within the ARCH2 hub all while retaining complete flexibility as it relates to our level of exposure. Outside of our direct participation, we expect ARCH2 will also have second-order effects of driving greater in-basin demand for EQT's low emissions natural gas and could present opportunities for us to leverage our subsurface expertise and 1.9 million net acreage position for CO2 sequestration.\nWhile still very early in the evolution of ARCH2, we believe EQT's participation in the hub, along with various other pillars of our new venture strategy, are planting the seeds that have the potential to catalyze the transformation of natural gas into the holy grail of cheap, reliable and zero carbon energy. I'll now turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Knop\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Toby, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by briefly summarizing our third quarter results, which as a reminder, includes 39 days of contribution from the Tug Hill and XcL assets. Sales volumes in the third quarter were 523 Bcfe, comprised of 491 Bcf of natural gas and 5.2 million barrels of liquids. We note third quarter production volumes included roughly 5 Bcfe of curtailment principally in response to weak local demand and approximately 8 Bcfe associated with lower-than-expected nonoperated turn-in lines and curtailments.\nOn a per unit basis, adjusted operating revenues were $2.28 per Mcfe, and our total per unit operating costs were $1.29, down from $1.37 in the second quarter, reflecting the accretion benefit from a partial quarter contribution of Tug Hill's low-cost assets and lower-than-expected LOE due to increased produced water recycling. Capital expenditures, excluding noncontrolling interests, were $445 million, including stand-alone EQT CapEx of approximately $400 million, which was at the low end of our guidance range, reflecting the continued operational efficiency gains Toby mentioned previously.\nAdjusted operating cash flow and free cash flow were $443 million and negative $2 million, respectively. It's worth noting, however, free cash flow was negatively impacted by $28 million of nonrecurring expenses from the Tug Hill transaction, without which we would have generated positive free cash flow during the quarter.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, we provided guidance on Slide 33, which reflects a full quarter of contribution from Tug Hill and XcL Midstream acquisitions. It's worth highlighting that the midpoint of our GP&T guidance range of $1 per Mcfe is roughly $0.10 lower than our stand-alone GP&T in the second quarter, which underscores the cost structure accretion from the low breakeven Tug Hill and XcL assets. I'd also note our fourth quarter production outlook embeds expectations of curtailments in the first half of the quarter, given elevated Eastern storage and seasonal demand weakness.\nWhile we're still early in the budgeting process and working through the optimization of our development schedule for 2024, we preliminarily expect to run 3 rigs and 3 to 4 frac crews next year, which should allow us to maintain pro forma production at approximately 2.3 Tcfe. We anticipate free cash flow of roughly $1.7 billion next year at recent strip pricing of approximately $3.40 per MMBtu, which equates to a 2024 free cash flow yield of 10%. On a cumulative basis, we project nearly $14 billion of free cash flow from 2024 to 2028, which is roughly 60% of our enterprise value and 80% of equity market capitalization. This means at our current valuation, investors have the opportunity to buy the premier natural gas company in North America with the most scale, the deepest and highest quality inventory and among the lowest cost structures and the best credit rating at a material discount to peers.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Recall, we funded the cash consideration of the Tug Hill and XcL acquisition upon close in August with $1 billion of cash on hand and $1.25 billion of term loan borrowings. We exited the third quarter with $5.9 billion of total debt, including $400 million related to equity-light convertible notes, which equates to an LTM leverage of 2.1x, though we note this figure includes the full impact of financing the Tug Hill and XcL acquisitions with just 39 days of EBITDA contribution. For reference, excluding Tug Hill and XcL impacts, we estimate LTM net debt to EBITDA would have been approximately 1.25x at the end of the third quarter.\nDespite rising treasury yields, EQT's credit spreads have tightened, highlighting our strong credit profile. Recall, we were upgraded to Baa3 by Moody's shortly after we closed the Tug Hill acquisition, so we are now investment-grade across all 3 credit rating agencies. I will also note that EQT has the lowest 5-year bond yields among natural gas-weighted peers, 100 basis points below the average, which also reflects the strength of our credit quality, an unwavering commitment to low leverage and our differentiated scale, inventory quality and low cost structure.\nAs it relates to capital allocation, we remain pleased with the execution of our shareholder return framework to date, and we'll continue with our opportunistic all-the-above strategy with our North Star being the countercyclical long-term compounding of cash flow. Consistent with our track record, we will maintain a strong bias towards debt repayment over the coming quarters, at least until we achieve our 1x leverage target at $2.75 per MMBtu natural gas pricing, which will provide a fortress balance sheet through all parts of the commodity cycle. This will, in turn, minimize downside risk to our enterprise while allowing us to limit the need to defensively hedge and cap what we anticipate being unpredictable asymmetric price movements to the upside in the years ahead.\nWe also continue to rigorously assess new investment opportunities with strong risk-adjusted returns that improve the quality of our business, similar to our West Virginia water system we highlighted last quarter. With the XcL Midstream team now part of EQT, we are actively exploring opportunities to deploy capital into differentiated infrastructure investments that can debottleneck our upstream production, allow us to durably compound cash flow at very attractive rates of return with minimal risk while simultaneously improving our operational efficiency.\nOur share buyback program also remains a key tool for opportunistic execution at points in the cycle where we see favorable risk-reward potential for generating returns well in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. Recall, at our current share price, we have generated an approximate 40% return for shareholders on the roughly $600 million of share repurchases we have executed to date, which is the highest amongst our peer group, and we still have approximately $1.4 billion remaining under our existing authorization.\nAnd finally, sustainable long-term base dividend growth is a key pillar of our shareholder return strategy, and to this end, we recently raised our dividend by 5% to $0.63 per share on an annualized basis. Since initiating our dividend in late 2021, we have now increased it by more than 25% cumulatively over that period, which underscores our confidence in the sustainability of our business and a corporate free cash flow breakeven price that is amongst the lowest in North America. As we eliminate structural costs from the business through actions such as debt repayment, share repurchases and synergy capture, we expect to continue growing our base dividend over time without putting upward pressure on our corporate cost structure.\nTurning to the macro environment. We see several factors lending support to the natural gas market in 2024 and beyond. First, strong gas-fired power generation, resilient LNG export demand and lower-than-expected production this summer reduced expected storage overhang than many were forecasting back in the spring by over 300 Bcf. Second, while we do expect some incremental supply from associated gas in connection with new Permian pipeline capacity commencing in the fourth quarter, we see Lower 48 volumes exiting this year flat to slightly down compared to Q3 of 2023. And we see further declines in the first half of 2024 as the impact from a 25%-plus drop in gas rigs since March begins to set in, especially in the high decline Haynesville play where the rig count remains well below maintenance levels.\nThird, the progress demonstrated commissioning the Golden Pass and LNG facilities has been encouraging and will create structural tailwinds, allowing LNG demand to reach a record 15 Bcf per day even before the facilities are fully operational. Fourth, we expect natural gas power generation to continue taking away share from coal as the investment case for coal weakens further, with the market increasingly turning to cleaner burning natural gas. We expect coal production to drop by over 20% year-over-year in 2024 as the effect of the recent wave of coal retirement takes hold, and a tightening coal market will further support the natural gas fundamentals in the power sector moving forward, where total gas equivalent demand for coal still stands at 14 Bcf per day in the United States alone.\nMoving to hedging. We tactically added to our hedge position during the quarter to further derisk a portion of our expected free cash flow and debt repayment goals. We now have greater than 40% of our Q1 through Q3 2024 production hedged, inclusive of Tug Hill's volumes with a weighted average core price of approximately $3.60 per MMBtu and a weighted average ceiling of $4.10 per MMBtu. Note, our hedge position remains strategically tilted towards the first half of 2024, where we see the most potential downside risk should normal weather again not materialize. While protecting near-term cash flow and prioritizing our debt repayment goals, we are intentionally creating the flexibility to maintain maximum upside price exposure in late 2024, 2025 and beyond when the natural gas market looks increasingly tight and we see the potential for pricing to move asymmetrically higher.\nAs it relates to basis, Appalachian differentials have been relatively wide of late, driven by elevated Eastern storage levels, a byproduct of the warm prior winter. Our strong basis hedge position paid dividends this quarter, boosting our corporate-wide realized natural gas price by $0.12 per MMBtu. We have roughly 80% of expected fourth quarter local volumes covered with basis hedges that are in the money relative to the current strip so we remain in an advantaged position near term. Over the medium to long term, we see several factors that could lend structural support to Appalachian bases, including the commencement of MVP and additional coal-fired power retirements in the PJM market, creating incremental demand upward of 4 Bcf per day.\nAs it relates to MVP timing, we're encouraged by the recent Equitrans and FEMSA consent order and continue to model the first quarter of 2024 in-service date. The outlook for MVP increasingly derisks expansion projects to move production further into the Southeast U.S. are progressing. As Toby highlighted, EQT's scale, quality and depth of inventory, low cost structure and investment-grade balance sheet uniquely position us to help facilitate these expansion projects. This dynamic is underscored by the 1.2 Bcf per day of long-term firm sales agreements that we recently signed with investment-grade utilities in the Southeast region. These deals create a win-win outcome as they underpin the debottlenecking of downstream markets and directly link EQT's volumes to a market price at a meaningful premium to Henry Hub while simultaneously providing utility customers with surety of low-cost natural gas supply for decades to come.\nUpon commencement, we see these agreements and the associated debottlenecking projects improving our 2028 corporate-wide differentials by $0.18 per Mcf, which in turn should drive more than $300 million of annualized free cash flow uplift in 2028 and beyond. These deals provide EQT long-term supply growth optionality that is paired with sustainable utility demand, dynamics which could drive an even greater uplift to long-term free cash flow over time. Importantly, these contracts and debottleneckings occur around the same time our gathering rates with Equitrans complete the contractual step down from $0.80 today to $0.30 per Mcf in 2028, further accelerating the decline in our free cash flow breakeven price and supercharging the free cash flow growth at a time when we expect other gas plays like the Haynesville to be approaching inventory depletion, thus driving up the marginal cost of natural gas.\nQuite simply, the difference between a higher marginal cost of natural gas experienced by peers compared to EQT's declining cost structure should uniquely accrue to EQT's shareholders in the form of free cash flow growth and value creation. These firm sales agreements represent examples of the various differentiated opportunities we are seeing arise from EQT's gravity and momentum as the clear operator of choice for the highest-quality long-duration inventory in the North American natural gas market. And we believe these opportunities will ultimately allow us to continue to create differentiated shareholder value relative to peers in the years ahead. Importantly, these types of opportunities are not simply due to scale but underpinned by EQT's world-class assets, coupled with a culture and teams that are relentless in their pursuit of excellence as the operator of choice and driven to maximize value for shareholders.\nI'll close by highlighting Slide 12 of our investor presentation, which illustrates an internal analysis of the natural gas price required to generate sufficient free cash flow such that a gas producer generates a simple 10% return on current respective enterprise value, what we view to be the most basic tenet of shareholder value creation. We believe the days of wellhead IRRs driving activity levels amongst U.S. gas producers are in the rearview mirror as this behavior related to the destruction of hundreds of billions of dollars of capital in the last decade. Put very simply, wellhead IRRs on D&C CapEx are unrelated to corporate returns and cost of capital. Instead, we see the marginal cost of U.S. natural gas supply beholden to a fully burdened corporate cost curve that requires a sufficient return on corporate capital or enterprise value, not just a return on field level CapEx.\nI want to highlight a few observations from this slide. First, the marginal molecule of U.S. gas supply is coming from the Haynesville, requiring a natural gas price of approximately $3.50 per MMBtu to even begin generating cash flow in maintenance mode, meaning below this price, no shareholder value is being created and inventory optionality is being depleted. On the other hand, EQT is at the low end of the cost of supply curve, which translates to structurally more durable through-the-cycle free cash flow generation and returns for our shareholders and also less need to defensively hedge away gas price upside.\nFurther, we see the price required to generate corporate return for Haynesville producers already at north of $4 per MMBtu based on current market valuations. On the other hand, EQT shares are pricing in a level embedding a mid-$3 gap price, providing a superior entry point to gain exposure to natural gas prices and in a superior risk-adjusted manner due to EQT's lower cost of supply. As previously noted, our contractual gathering rate improvement, unrivaled depth of repeatable low-cost inventory and new firm sales agreements will drive EQT's cost of supply even lower over the next 5 years in contrast to the rest of the industry, which will likely see upward pressure over this period as peer producers move toward lower-quality inventory. As a result, we believe EQT is uniquely positioned to capture a disproportionate amount of natural gas price upside relative to peers in the years ahead. I'll now turn the call back over to Toby for some concluding remarks.\n\nToby Z. Rice\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThanks, Jeremy. To conclude today's prepared remarks, I want to reiterate a few key points. Number one, the momentum and gravity at EQT right now is unrivaled, and I have never felt anything like it in my career. We are executing at record levels, signing historic physical supply deals that simultaneously maximize the value of each molecule and provide secure supply to end customers while cutting emissions and executing on a vision to create the preeminent low-cost producer of natural gas on the global stage.\nSecond, integration of the Tug Hill and XcL assets is blazing ahead at record pace, which speaks to the power of our proprietary digital platform and continued refinements of our integration playbook. Third, after a stellar second quarter, our drilling and completions teams yet again set new internal and world records in Q3. Fourth, this superior operational execution is facilitating additional value creation potential on the Tug Hill assets, with EQT's team already improving drilling and completion efficiency by 40% in just 60 days of operating the assets, driving the potential for $150 per foot of well cost savings.\nFifth, the firm sales agreements we announced associated with our MVP capacity are materially accretive to our long-term free cash flow outlook and shareholder value and highlight the differentiated opportunities arising from EQT's peer-leading scale, low cost structure, inventory depth and environmental attributes. And finally, sixth, our first-of-its-kind public-private forced management partnership with the state of West Virginia should create one of the highest quality, most verifiable nature-based carbon sequestration projects and should help facilitate EQT becoming the first energy company in the world of meaningful scale to achieve net zero emissions. And with that, I'd now like to open the call to questions."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the EQT Q2 2023 Results Conference Call.\n[Operator Instructions]\nCameron Horwitz, Managing Director, Investor Relations and Strategy. You may begin your conference.\n\nCameron Jeffrey Horwitz\n\nAnalyst, U.S. Capital Advisors LLC\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2023 results conference call. With me today are Toby Rice, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jeremy Knop, newly appointed Chief Financial Officer; and David Kane, outgoing Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, the team will present their prepared remarks with a question-and-answer session to follow. An updated investor presentation has been posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website and we will reference certain slides during today's discussion. A replay for today's call will be available on our website beginning this evening.\nI'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. Actual results and future events could materially differ from these forward-looking statements because of factors described in yesterday's earnings release and our investor presentation, the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K and in subsequent filings we make with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update forward-looking statements.\nToday's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our most recent earnings release and investor presentation for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Toby.\n\nToby Z. Rice\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThanks, Cam, and good morning, everyone.\nBefore speaking to second quarter results, I want to say thank you again to Dave for being a great colleague and friend over the past 3 years. Your knowledge and experience during a unique time in EQT's history combined with a thoughtful approach and heart made you a favorite of all who had the pleasure of working alongside you. I want to thank you for your tremendous contribution to EQT, and we are excited to see your continued success into the next phase of your life.\nI also want to introduce Jeremy Knop, who is taking the reins from Dave as our new Chief Financial Officer. Jeremy joined EQT in 2021 as the EVP of Corporate Development and has extensive experience in strategic decision-making, investment management, capital allocation, M&A and transaction execution from his time at EQT in previous roles at Blackstone and as an investment banker.\nJeremy's strategic value-oriented mindset and deep understanding of our business instills great confidence that he will continue to drive value creation, strengthen our balance sheet and ensure the realization of our long-term vision.\nHis exceptional leadership skills and unwavering focus on value creation, make him the ideal candidate to steer EQT toward continued success. Jeremy's proven track record and dedication to leading purpose-driven teams make him an invaluable asset to our executive group, and we look forward to the meaningful impact and contributions he will undoubtedly make in his new role.\nNow turning to Q2 results. Our operations teams built upon the momentum we achieved in the first quarter with notable execution on both drilling and completions. As shown on Slide 6 of our investor presentation, our drilling team recently set an EQT record by drilling 12,318 feet in 24 hours on our STL [ AA12 ] Green County and followed this up setting a new world record by drilling 18,200 feet in 48 hours on the same run. This is not just one-off execution.\nHowever, as we recently ran a benchmarking exercise that shows EQT is consistently achieving best-in-class drilling results. Specifically, we found that EQT's recent Southwest Appalachia wells were drilled at a rate of penetration greater than 60% faster than peers, which means that even with materially longer laterals, our average spud to TD days are 20% less than nearby operators. To further put this point in context, one horizontal EQT rig can drill roughly 300,000 more lateral feet per year relative to our peer average, which is why we can maintain greater than 5 Bcfe per day of net production running just 2 to 3 horizontal rigs. A few contributing factors to this performance include diligent landing zone targeting, best-in-class geo-steering and innovative use of rotary steerable tools. It's all about people, planning, the right equipment and execution.\nTurning to completions. Slide 7 shows our team replicated the solid efficiency gains achieved in Q1, with first half 2023 frac crew pumping hours up roughly 20% year-over-year and in line with peak levels experienced in early 2021. Not to be outdone by our drilling performance, our completions group set 2 records of their own in Q2. First, our team completed and drilled out 20,818 feet of lateral on our Michael 4A12, which at nearly 4 miles, is one of the longest completed laterals in the history of U.S. sales development and an internal EQT record.\nOur completion team also beat our previously set world record during the quarter by drilling out 262 frac plugs with a single roller cone bit, which was 90% above the prior peer record. I want to give a big shout-out to both our drilling and completion teams for the excellent performance and continuing to push the envelope when it comes to achieving peak performance. This stellar execution allowed us to achieve the midpoint of second quarter production guidance even in the face of lower-than-expected liquids volumes from downtime at the Shell ethane cracker and few in expected non-operated TILs, which negatively impacted our production by a combined 12 Bcfe relative to our forecast.\nAfter a challenging 2022 environment where operations performance was plagued by third-party issues, our teams have resumed peak execution driving best-in-class performance. Another highlight of the quarter was LOE, which came in at just $0.08 per Mcfe and averaged $0.07 per Mcfe in the first half of the year. A contributing factor to EQT's peer-leading LOE is our ability to efficiently handle water, which speaks to the benefits from the West Virginia water system that we've invested capital into building over the past several years.\nAs a reminder, our West Virginia water system currently comprises 28 miles of installed water pipe and 250,000 barrels of water storage. Alongside the LOE benefit, our percentage of produced water recycled continues to climb as we target 90% this year, up from roughly 70% in 2020.\nOur West Virginia water system is an example of our ability invest capital into projects that have strong risk-adjusted rates of return and add structural resiliency into our free cash flow generation. Specifically, we have invested $80 million into our West Virginia water system to date and have realized $20 million of associated annualized cost savings, implying this investment is generating a highly attractive 25% free cash flow yield. We are currently finalizing plans for similar projects that will facilitate water connectivity between our West Virginia and Pennsylvania assets, which should provide further resiliency and LOE reduction opportunities moving forward.\nLastly, we retired $800 million of incremental debt during the second quarter, taking another material step forward towards achieving our balance sheet objectives. We have now retired a total of $1.9 billion of debt since initiating our shareholder returns framework in late 2021, which has driven a meaningful reduction in our leverage and was a key enabler of achieving our investment-grade credit ratings.\nMoving forward, we will continue to prioritize debt paydown until achieving our leverage targets as a bulletproof balance sheet ensures that EQT can maximize value creation through all parts of the commodity cycle and to provide investors the best risk-adjusted exposure to natural gas.\nTurning to LNG. As highlighted in our press release, we recently signed an HOA with Lake Charles LNG to supply 1 million-ton per annum or 135 million cubic feet per day under a 15-year tolling agreement. This deal aligns with our strategy of allocating a portion of the 1.2 Bcf per day we have covered via FT to the Gulf to international markets and gives us the flexibility to sell our guests directly to end users globally.\nWe have spent the last 1.5 years studying the nuances of LNG export opportunities and believe the strategy we are pursuing provides the best combination of upside exposure with downside risk mitigation. Relative to the netback structures that are commonly being signed, EQT is pursuing a more integrated approach with direct connectivity to end users of our gas. This strategy allows us to creatively structure deals with downside price protection, obtain visibility into global downstream markets and interact with a wide array of potential customers. We plan to pursue signing one or more SPAs with prospective international buyers and have additional opportunities to increase our tolling exposure, though we will remain measured in our approach as we ensure the best risk-adjusted outcomes for EQT.\nAs America's largest natural gas producer, we have played a critical role in providing energy security to the United States while driving significant emissions reductions via coal displacement. Our scale, peer-leading inventory depth and environmental attributes uniquely position us to facilitate these objectives, both domestically and abroad, and we are excited to begin unleashing EQT is reliable low emissions natural gas on the global stage.\nTurning to our recently released ESG report. We received multiple accolades highlighting our ESG leadership over the past year and made continued material progress toward our goal of net 0 Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2025. Some of these accolades include being just 1 of 14 upstream companies globally to achieve the UN's OGMP 2.0 gold standard, receiving an A grade rating from MIQ for our peer-leading methane intensity, increasing our MSCI rating to AA reflecting our ESG risk mitigation actions and being named one of the top workplaces in the U.S. I Energage for the third consecutive year.\nLooking specifically at emissions, our 2022 Scope 1 and 2 production segment, GHG emissions totaled just 433,000 metric tons, which was 20% lower year-over-year and 50% below 2018 levels prior to new management taking over at EQT. It's worth noting that the bulk of our pneumatic device replacement was completed in the second half of 2022. So 2023 emissions should see a further benefit from this initiative. We expect the completion of our pneumatics replacement to further lower our methane intensity from 0.038% in 2022 to near our 2025 target of 0.02% this year, which is 90% below the future 2025 target and makes EQT one of the lowest methane intensity upstream producers on the planet.\nBetween increasing operational efficiencies and replacing our pneumatics, we have now reduced our absolute emissions to essentially as low as possible under current technologies. From here, we are preparing multiple nature-based projects to generate our own carbon offsets that will leverage cutting-edge soil probe technology to ensure the quantification of these offsets is accurate and transparent. These projects will help offset our remaining emissions and be a key enabling factor for EQT to become the first energy company in the world of meaningful scale to achieve a verifiable net 0 Scope 1 and 2 emissions.\nTurning to Slide 9 of our investor presentation. We commend the House and Senate for passing the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which included the approval of the Mountain Valley Pipeline and begins to address critical permitting reform components. We see the completion of MVP as imperative to addressing increasingly unaffordable and insufficient electricity in the Southeastern United States while simultaneously allowing the region to achieve its climate goals. Its inclusion in this bill shows that permitting reform is not a political bargaining chip but instead, a necessity recognized by a bipartisan government acting for the good of all Americans.\nWhile the recent stay from the Fourth Circuit Court creates some timing uncertainty, we still expect MVP to enter service by the first half of 2024. As it relates to EQT, our capacity on MVP has limited impact to our free cash flow in the near term, assuming current future strip pricing. That said, the pipeline brings much needed breathing room to Appalachian infrastructure and should lower high line pressures in certain parts of the field that can in turn lessen the risk of system outages moving forward. Longer term, the completion of MVP should catalyze multiple southern expansion projects that will bring gas further into the Southeast demand centers where it is critically needed to replace coal-fired power generation and meet the region's climate goals.\nWe believe this will in turn drive better price realizations and materially enhance the value that MVP brings to EQT over the coming years while simultaneously lowering energy prices for consumers in the Southeast. I'll conclude with a few comments on our pending Tug Hill acquisition. While the transaction has taken modestly longer than we anticipated to close, we continue to work constructively with the FTC and expect we will complete the transaction in Q3. As a reminder, Tug Hill and XL Midstream bring low-risk, high-quality assets offsetting our existing acreage that should drive an additional $0.15 decline in our corporate free cash flow breakeven price providing even greater resiliency to our business moving forward. I'll now turn the call over to Dave.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks, Toby. It's bitter sweet to be on my final conference call after 3.5 amazing years at EQT and over 30 years on Wall Street and in the corporate world. I'm honored to have left my mark on this company, and I feel a deep sense of pride in all that we have accomplished in a relatively short period of time. Since I joined in January of 2020, the stock is essentially quadrupled. We regained investment-grade credit status and EQT was added to the S&P 500 Index.\nEven with this, EQT is truly a unique organization on a trajectory that I believe will create tremendous value for years to come, which is why I'm excited to remain a long-term shareholder in this company. I'm also thrilled to see Jeremy appointed as EQT's next CFO. I've seen his exceptional execution capabilities first hand, and I'm extremely confident he is the right person for the job.\nJeremy and I have worked closely together on many aspects of the business, including financial policy, capital allocation and hedging, which will ensure strategic continuity and a smooth transition of the role. With that, I'd like to say 1 final thank you to all our stakeholders for your support. And I'll now turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Knop\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone.\nI'm extremely excited and grateful to take the reins from Dave as EQT's next Chief Financial Officer. Since joining the company in 2021, I've been continually impressed by the depth and quality of EQT's assets. The company's world-class execution capabilities and the heart, trust and teamwork that flows among our employees. I believe these attributes materially differentiate EQT in today's energy landscape and set the stage for us to drive meaningful value creation for our shareholders.\nOur high-level financial strategy will remain consistent with the execution you've come to expect from us over the past several years with a focus on ensuring we always maintain a bullet proof balance sheet, continued execution of our value-oriented shareholder return framework and thoughtfully investing capital in ways that structurally improve our business. I'm excited to make an even more impactful contribution to the organization and look forward to engaging in even more dialogue with our shareholders in my new role.\nTurning to second quarter results. Sales volumes were 471 Bcfe in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. As Toby highlighted, our drilling and completions team saw extremely strong field-level execution during the quarter, which allowed us to offset the negative impact of downtime at Shell's ethane cracker and lower non-operated TILs associated with the broader slowdown in gas-directed activity, which combined reduced quarterly net production by 12 Bcfe relative to our forecast.\nNote that we have applied a greater risking to our ethane production forecast going forward to better account for continued operational issues as a cracker as Shell works to bring it fully online.\nOur pre unit adjusted operating revenues were $2.11 per Mcfe and our total per unit operating costs were toward the low end of our guidance range at $1.37, resulting in an operating margin of $0.75 per Mcfe. Capital expenditures, excluding noncontrolling interests, were $470 million, in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. Adjusted operating cash flow and free cash flow were $341 million and negative $129 million, respectively. We also saw a $96 million working capital benefit driven by declining accounts receivable and lower margin postings, which offset much of the total cash impact from negative free cash flow during the quarter.\nTurning to the balance sheet. A strong credit profile and ample liquidity remain core to our operating philosophy and will provide access to differentiated value creation opportunities for EQT shareholders moving forward. Our balance sheet remains very strong with trailing 12-month net leverage exiting the quarter at 1.1x, down from 1.6x a year ago. We exited the second quarter with $3.5 billion of net debt and $1.2 billion of cash on hand.\nAs shown on Slide 12 of our investor deck, we further built upon our track record of debt retiring with $800 million of incremental debt retired during the second quarter. This was comprised of the $300 million tender offer for our sixth and [ one eighth percent ] 2025 senior notes and the full redemption of our 5 and 5/8% 2025 senior notes. Since rolling out our shareholder return framework in 2021, we've now retired over $1.9 billion of total debt, which has eliminated nearly $90 million of annual interest expense. Despite the challenging natural gas macro environment this year, we expect our leverage to remain well in check as we forecast exiting 2023 with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.3x at current strip, excluding the pending Tug Hill acquisition.\nAt the end of the quarter, liquidity stood at $4.9 billion, comprised of $1.2 billion of cash, $2.5 billion of availability under our credit facility and a $1.25 billion term loan that we have in place for the pending Tug Hill acquisition.\nMoving to hedging. Second quarter results highlighted the beneficial position of our 2023 hedge book as we realized $237 million of cash NYMEX hedge gains for the quarter, inclusive of deferred put premiums. The recent strip, we expect full year NYMEX cash hedge gains of approximately $440 million net of deferred put premiums. Looking into 2024, we opportunistically added to our hedge position to de-risk a portion of our expected free cash flow and debt repayment goals. We currently have 30% of our 2024 production hedged with a weighted average floor price of $3.64 per MMBtu, a weighted average ceiling of $4.14 per MMBtu.\nNote, our hedge position is strategically tilted towards the first half of 2024, where we see the most potential downside risk should normal winter weather, again, not materialize. By protecting near-term free cash flow and prioritizing our debt repayment goals, we are intentionally creating flexibility to maintain maximum upside price exposure in late 2024, 2025 and beyond when the natural gas market looks increasingly tight, and we believe pricing is asymmetrically skewed to the upside, while at the same time, mitigating downside risk.\nAs it relates to basis, Appalachian differentials have widened for the balance of 2023, driven by elevated Eastern storage levels, a byproduct of the warm prior winter. The current [indiscernible] future strip implies more than $1.50 per MMBtu differential to NYMEX this fall, which is a price level below cash costs for many producers. EQT is well positioned here, however, as we have roughly 90% of balance 2023 local volumes covered with basis hedges that are solidly in the money relative to current strip.\nOn MVP, we modeled a first half of 2024 in service date to acknowledge there could be some risk to the timetable based on the recent activity from the Fourth Circuit Court. When MVP does come online, higher transmission expense associated with our capacity should be largely offset by a combination of the immediate material step down in our gathering rate and better price realizations, resulting in a negligible impact to EQT's free cash flow in the near term.\nHowever, as Toby mentioned, we see significant opportunity to move production further into the Southeast U.S. over time as expansion projects are completed. This will occur at a time when Gulf Coast volumes supply in the area shift more towards satisfying LNG export demand, which will likely contribute to better price realizations and value for our MVP capacity over time.\nTurning to the natural gas macro landscape. Fundamentals are largely playing out as we expected. As discussed on our last earnings call, we anticipated additional gas-directed activity cuts given prices fell well below mini producers breakeven across the U.S. Activity reductions have played out with 35 gas rigs laid down across the U.S. in the second quarter, 22 of which were in the high-cost Haynesville play, a nearly 40% fall from the peak in a very short amount of time. We expect incremental gas rig drops for the rest of 2023, albeit at a much slower pace relative to the last few months.\nThe large year-to-date reduction in drilling activity should moderate supply from current levels and help support prices for the balance of 2023 and as we head into 2024. We also note over 45 oil-directed rigs were laid down during the second quarter and oil activity is now roughly 15% below highs set late last year. Further declines in oil-directed activity will likely result in associated gas growth underperforming relative to consensus, blending additional structural support to natural gas prices in 2024 and 2025.\nAnother area of significant market support has come from strong gas-fired power demand. Lower spot natural gas prices and materially weaker-than-expected wind generation drove approximately 3 Bcf a day of higher natural gas power generation during the second quarter. Specifically, wind generation underperformed expectations by a staggering 20 million-megawatt hours. Most of this shortfall was met by natural gas generation, demonstrating the need and the value of reliable generation to compensate for inherent volatility of renewables.\nLNG performance during the quarter remained strong as Europe and China listed U.S. cargoes to refill storage and meet demand from record-breaking heat realized in May and June. Some of this strength was offset by major maintenance at [indiscernible] half in June, but this has since been completed. Looking ahead, we anticipate 6 Bcf a day of incremental nameplate LNG capacity online by year-end 2025, which should create a significant tailwind for natural gas fundamentals over the next several years.\nTurning to oilfield service pricing. The rate of change in inflationary pressure has slowed meaningfully over the past several months, and we're starting to see leading indicators of potential softening in certain areas. Recent indications suggest steel casing prices have declined 15% to 20% relative to the recent peak, and we should start to see the benefits of this beginning in late Q3 as we deplete our current inventory.\nFor reference, deal associated with casing and wellheads makes up around 10% of our total well costs. In terms of drilling and completions, we are currently running 2 horizontal rigs and 2 to 3 frac spreads. Given our focus on consistent execution of our combo development strategy, we lock in the bulk of our rigs and frac spreads under long-term contracts. This strategy has paid dividends for us over the past several years as our rates have been consistently below the spot market.\nAnd the quantity needed is much lower than peers due to our higher efficiencies. We do see the opportunity for some modest downward pressure on big ticket items. As our contracts roll off, we're exploring ways to improve our efficiencies that could translate into incremental downward pressure on well costs. While still too early to predict with precision, we preliminarily see the potential for our total well cost to decline by up to 5% year-over-year in 2024.\nTurning to guidance. We are reiterating our 2023 production outlook of 1,900 to 2,000 Bcfe. Our 2023 capital budget of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion excluding the pending Tug Hill acquisition and our per unit operating expense in differential ranges. On Slide 33 of our investor deck, we provide adjusted EBITDA, operating cash flow and free cash flow outlook at various natural gas prices for the remainder of 2023.\nAt recent strip pricing, 2023 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $2.8 billion, and 2023 free cash flow was anticipated to be roughly $900 million prior to the impact of our pending acquisition.\nAs it relates to capital allocation, we are pleased with the execution of our shareholder return framework to date, and we'll continue with our opportunistic all of the above construct moving forward. As a reminder, since initiating our framework in late 2021, we have retired more than $1.9 billion of debt, repurchased more than $600 million of stock and pay an annual base dividend of $0.60 per share which we grew 20% last year relative to our initial dividend.\nAs it relates to our buyback execution, we believe our opportunistic strategy is generating superior results as our current share price suggests we have generated a weighted average return of 31% for our shareholders versus a negative 5% on average for the peer group.\nLooking ahead and consistent with our track record, investors should expect we will maintain a bias towards debt repayment until we achieve our target of 1x leverage at [ $2.75 ] per MMBtu natural gas prices, which will ensure a bulletproof balance sheet through all parts of the commodity cycle. This will, in turn, minimize the downside while allowing us to limit the need to defensively hedge and cap what we expect to be unpredictable, asymmetric price movement to the upside in the years ahead. We will also continue to rigorously assess investment opportunities with strong risk-adjusted returns that improve the quality of our business while compounding cash flow, which is the foundation of sustainable shareholder value creation in any business, similar to our West Virginia water system that Toby highlighted earlier.\nOur buyback remains a key tool for opportunistic execution that points in the cycle where we see favorable risk reward potential for generating returns well in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. And finally, sustainable long-term base dividend growth will remain a key pillar of our shareholder return strategy moving forward.\nI'll close by highlighting Slide 3 of our investor presentation. which I think elegantly summarizes the value proposition at EQT. We believe our modern data-driven operating model, significant scale, peer-leading inventory quality and depth, ESG leadership and low investment-grade cost of capital make EQT one of the most compelling investment opportunities in the market today.\nHowever, despite these characteristics and strong relative stock performance recently, EQT trades at the highest 5-year cumulative free cash flow yield as a percentage of enterprise value amongst the gas peers, meaning we could buy back more of our enterprise value with organically generated free cash flow at strip pricing.\nInterestingly and as is illustrated on the left side of Slide 11, thanks to our relentless focus on achieving the lowest free cash flow breakeven at our current stock price, EQT shares simultaneously provide among the least downside in a long-term $3 gas price scenario and the most upside in a $5 gas price scenario, again, when measured by the next 5 years of cumulative free cash flow relative to enterprise value. Whether investors fully appreciate this or not, is this cash flow is realized, it should drive our equity value higher by definition. And we believe this will propel further share price outperformance.\nThis signals to us the market is only scratching the surface of appreciating EQT's strategically advantaged position and high-quality assets, and I look forward to helping identify and capture significant value for shareholders in my new role moving forward. I'll now turn the call back over to Toby for some concluding remarks.\n\nToby Z. Rice\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThanks, Jeremy.\nTo conclude today's prepared remarks, I want to reiterate a few key points. Number one, EQT's operational execution has been on point in 2023 with our drilling and completion teams, setting multiple internal and world records during the quarter. Number two, we continue to successfully implement our value-oriented capital returns framework with an incremental $800 million of debt retired in Q2, taking our cumulative debt retirement to more than $1.9 billion since late 2021. Number three, our recent HOA for tolling capacity at Lake Charles represents an initial step in progressing our LNG strategy, which seeks to diversify a portion of our production into international markets and achieve the best combination of upside exposure with downside risk mitigation. And four, we strategically added to our 2024 hedge position which ensures the accelerated achievement of our debt retirement goals while simultaneously providing shareholders maximum upside exposure to gas prices in late 2024, 2025 and beyond. And lastly, number five, our 2022 ESG report underscores our peer-leading environmental performance with a 20% year-over-year decline in EQT's production segment scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, moving us yet another step closer toward the realization of our ambitious 2025 net 0 emissions goal. I'd now like to open the call to questions."

Rice\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThanks, Cam, and good morning, everyone. While the current natural gas macro environment has created some headwinds for U.S. natural gas producers at large, the price pullback is reinforcing EQT's confidence in our corporate strategy and illuminating several facets of differentiation relative to our peers. A key pillar of distinction has been EQT's M&A strategy where we have taken a disciplined approach to acquisitions specifically focused on assets that lower our cost structure.\nThe current gas price environment underscores the benefits of this strategy with enhanced free cash flow durability through the bottom parts of the commodity cycle allowing for accretive capital allocation decisions, resiliency and corporate returns and greater consistency and operational cadence.\nOur pending Tug Hill acquisition further builds on this M&A strategy as it is expected to drive an additional $0.15 decline in our corporate free cash flow break-even price, providing even greater resiliency to our business moving forward.\nAnother area where EQT is differentiating itself is through our evolved hedging strategy. While we no longer have financial needs requiring hedging given material improvements in our balance sheet, we have evolved into opportunistic hedgers, predominantly using wide collars to derisk free cash flow at the bottom part of the cycle, while maintaining material upside exposure toward natural gas prices.\nThis strategy is paying off in real time as EQT has among the best hedge books of any natural gas peer in 2023, with 62% of our production covered via floors with an average strike price of $3.38 per MMBtu.\nIn conjunction with our M&A and cost-reduction efforts, our hedge book is a key factor driving our full year 2023 corporate NYMEX free cash flow breakeven down to less than $1.65 per MMBtu.\nA third pillar of EQT's strategy driving distinction among peers is our opportunistic capital returns approach. When we rolled out our return framework in late 2021, we did so under the premise that we would look to maximize returns to shareholders via our capital allocation decisions, which requires a tactical and thoughtful approach to both debt repayment and equity repurchases. With more than a year under our belt of returning capital to shareholders, we believe our underlying approach and execution is generating superior results, which is exemplified by the fact that we have achieved the best return on our equity buybacks among our peer group and retired a material amount of debt at discounts to par as interest rates have risen.\nA fourth element of differentiation comes on the environmental front as EQT has taken material steps forward in achieving our peer-leading goal of net zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from production operations by 2025. We highlighted the material benefit of completing our pneumatic device replacement initiative a year ahead of schedule with our fourth quarter results. And we are building upon this momentum with recent announcements of strategic partnerships directed at advancing the development of low carbon intensity, natural gas products and generating verifiable carbon offsets.\nIn short, we believe the key tenets of our corporate operating philosophy are laying the foundation for differentiated and sustainable long-term value creation for EQT, and you can expect continued execution upon our proven strategy going forward.\nNow turning to first quarter results. 2023 got off to a very strong start across the board at EQT. As shown on Slide 7 of our investor presentation, we replicated the solid efficiency gains we achieved late last year in the first quarter with frac crew pumping hours up 35% year-over-year as the third-party infrastructure constraints that slowed our operational pace in 2022 moved firmly into the rear view.\nThese efficiency gains facilitated our first quarter production coming in 2% above the midpoint of guidance, while our CapEx came in 7% below the midpoint of our expectations. Our advantaged firm transportation portfolio allowed us to achieve an average differential of $0.16 above NYMEX. While operating expenses came in 2% below the midpoint of our guidance on lower-than-expected LOE, production taxes and G&A.\nCombined, these factors drove free cash flow of $774 million during the first quarter which is EQT's highest quarterly free cash flow and significantly derisks our free cash flow generation for the year. I want to personally thank all members of our crew for their hard work in facilitating this execution as we have made significant strides toward our goal of achieving peak performance this year.\nOn the capital return front, we repurchased nearly 6 million shares or $200 million of stock during the first quarter at an average price of less than $34 per share. We also retired $210 million of debt principal during the quarter at an average cost of 96% of par. Even with these significant returns to shareholders, we exited the quarter with greater than $2.1 billion of cash on hand, up from $1.5 billion at year-end 2022.\nOur net debt at the end of the first quarter was approximately $3.3 billion compared with the $4.2 billion at the end of 2022. Our net debt to trailing EBITDA currently stands at 0.9x, underscoring the tremendous balance sheet progress we have achieved over the past several years.\nIn terms of full year guidance, we are reiterating our $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion capital budget, which excludes our pending Tug Hill acquisition. As a reminder, our 2023 budget includes $100-plus million of nonrecurring capital associated with third-party constraints that shifted roughly 30 TILs into 2023 and assumes 10% to 15% of year-over-year oilfield service cost inflation.\nAs it relates to the latter, we are seeing a notable trend of flattening out in oilfield service costs as industry activity moderates and we believe the stage is set for some degree of softening in the second half of the year, which, if manifested, would provide upside to our current outlook.\nOur 2023 production guidance is unchanged at 1,900 to 2,000 Bcfe, and we are operationally on track to get back to 500 Bcfe per quarter of run rate production by the middle of this year. That said, as we mentioned last quarter, the lower end of our guidance range contemplates scenarios where we slow our production cadence for the year should natural gas prices continue to deteriorate.\nAnd we have the flexibility to make game time decisions on our cadence as the year progresses. On Slide 32 of our investor presentation, we've provided an updated range of 2023 adjusted EBITDA, operated cash flow and free cash flow outlooks at various natural gas prices for the remainder of the year.\nAt recent strip pricing and factoring in first quarter actuals, we forecast 2023 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.9 billion and free cash flow of roughly $1 billion this year, implying a 9% free cash flow yield at the bottom part of the commodity cycle.\nAs shown on Slide 5 of our presentation, our free cash flow generation has significant durability and duration, with our internal forecast projecting cumulative free cash flow from 2023 to 2027 of greater than $12 billion at strip pricing and excluding the benefit of Tug Hill.\nThis equates to more than 105% of our current market capitalization and greater than 80% of enterprise value, underscoring the significant value proposition embedded in EQT shares even after the recent decline in strip pricing. Our free cash flow outlook gives us tremendous confidence in being able to achieve our absolute debt target of $3.5 billion pro forma for the Tug Hill acquisition, while also being able to continue to opportunistically retiring our stock via our $2 billion share repurchase authorization.\nTurning to our environmental initiatives. We announced multiple key projects over the past few weeks. First, we entered into a strategic partnership with Context Labs to advance the development of verified low-carbon intensity natural gas products and carbon offsets.\nThrough tracking, reporting and verification of critical emissions data, this strategic partnership will support us in achieving our industry-leading emissions reduction targets. With a focus on emissions quantification, operational analysis and the certification of natural gas production, we plan to work with Context Labs to scale emissions mitigation across the full energy value chain.\nContext Labs will provide an enterprise-wide deployment across EQT's asset footprint, with the goal of achieving full digital integration of our carbon intensity data. The resulting creation of certified low-carbon intensity products will add another dimension to EQT's already robust and digitally enabled organization.\nWe view the emissions profile of our natural gas as a strategic asset for our shareholders, and this partnership will further aid in illuminating the relative value of our product and ensure EQT's molecules remain among the most coveted in the world.\nAdditionally, we announced EQT's first nature-based carbon offset initiative earlier this month. We partnered with the Wheeling Park Commission, a public park in West Virginia, Teralytic a soil analytics company and Climate Smart Environmental Consulting to implement forest management projects with the goal of generating carbon offsets in our own backyard. These projects will span more than 1,000 acres of forest land and we will utilize Teralytic's soil probe technology to ensure the quantification of offsets is accurate and transparent.\nEQT has been an industry leader in reducing operational emissions, and our natural gas already has some of the lowest greenhouse gas intensity in the world. Nature-based projects like this, which are supported by cutting-edge technology that ensures accuracy and transparency, will offset our remaining emissions and be a key enabling factor for EQT to become the first energy company in the world of meaningful scale to achieve verifiable net zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions.\nAs it relates to the pending Tug Hill acquisition, we have been constructively working with the FTC and believe we are on track to close the acquisition around midyear. Due to the relative value structure of the deal with a meaningful equity component and the interim free cash flow since the deal's effective date of July 1, 2022, we expect the price paid at closing to be roughly $2.3 billion of cash and approximately 48 million shares, which at a $33 per share price equates to a closing value of roughly $3.9 billion.\nWe note this deal structure contrasts with other recent transactions in the industry, which were cash heavy and thus more levered to commodity prices. This consideration mix, along with Tug Hill's cost structure have served as a hedge for EQT as gas prices have fallen as evidenced by the deal accretion more than doubling since announcement, all while leverage has stayed in check.\nIn summary, our strong first quarter results underscore that the third-party infrastructure challenges we faced last year are in the rearview and EQT is back to peak performance. We generated our highest quarterly free cash flow, repurchased a material amount of equity and debt and exited the quarter with an improved leverage position and over $2.1 billion of cash on hand.\nWhile the current natural gas macro environment does present challenges, it also illuminates the relative advantages of EQT's corporate strategy, underpinned by large-scale combo development, a disciplined M&A focus on low-cost assets, a risk-adjusted hedging strategy and opportunistic capital returns. This unique corporate profile has laid the foundation for significant value creation through all parts of the commodity cycle. And we look forward to building on our successful track record of execution on behalf of all of our stakeholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid M. Khani\n\nCFO, EQT Corporation\n\nThanks, Toby, and good morning, everyone. I'll briefly summarize our first quarter results before discussing our balance sheet, the macro landscape, hedging, 2023 guidance and use of our free cash flow.\nSales volumes for the first quarter were 459 Bcfe or 2% above the midpoint of our guidance range. Our per unit adjusted operating revenues were $4.11 per Mcfe and our total per unit operating costs were $1.34, resulting in an operating margin of $2.70 per Mcfe.\nCapital expenditures, excluding noncontrolling interests, were $464 million or 7% below the midpoint of our guidance range as operational efficiencies exceeded expectations.\nAdjusted operating cash flow and free cash flow were $1.24 billion and $774 million, respectively. We also had a $426 million working capital tailwind during the quarter, largely driven by declining accounts receivable from decreasing prices with a further tailwind expected in Q2 and Q3.\nOur capital efficiency for the quarter came in at $1.01 per Mcfe, which was approximately 10% better than what was implied by the midpoint of our guidance ranges, driven by outperformance on both production and capital spending. Note that as we complete the excess TILLs that were shifted from last year, our second half capital efficiency should improve by double digits relative to the first half.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our strong credit profile and ample liquidity remain a core tenet, underpinning our operating philosophy and will provide a differentiated value for opportunities for EQT moving forward. Our balance sheet position continued improving with trailing 12-month net leverage exiting the quarter at 0.9x, down from 1.2x last quarter and 1.9x a year ago.\nWe exited the first quarter with $3.3 billion of net debt and $2.1 billion of cash on hand, inclusive of the $1 billion in proceeds from our notes offering. This week, we extended our $1.25 billion term loan to the end of 2023, which aligns with the timing of the amended purchase agreement and provides timing flexibility.\nThe bank term loan, along with our cash balance, gives us the flexibility and confidence to fund the cash portion of the Tug Hill deal independent of any bond proceeds that we raised last fall.\nAs Toby mentioned, we continue to actively progress our debt retirement initiatives. We retired $210 million of senior notes principal in the first quarter primarily via open market purchases at an average price of 96% of par. Since unveiling our capital returns framework, we have retired more than $1.1 billion of debt principal, which has eliminated nearly $40 million of annual interest expense.\nOur commitment to a bullet-proof balance sheet is being recognized by the credit rating agencies. S&P and Fitch reaffirmed our investment-grade credit ratings over the past several weeks, with stable outlooks at both agencies, even as natural gas prices have temporarily receded. As we further execute our objective of achieving $3.5 billion of gross debt pro forma for the pending Tug Hill acquisition, we believe additional credit rating upgrades are possible.\nI'd like to also briefly highlight Slide 10 of our investor presentation, which shows our track record of materially growing our asset base while lowering our net debt. At year-end '19, our net debt was $5.3 billion. Our proved reserves were 17.5 Tcfe and our net production was 4.1 Bcfe per day.\nFast forward to 2022. We increased our proved reserves to 25 Tcfe and our production to 5.3 Bcfe per day through the Chevron and Alta acquisitions and organic reserve growth, all while decreasing our net debt to $3.3 billion through the end of the first quarter.\nSaid another way, we have grown our asset base by 30% to 40% while simultaneously lowering our net debt by a comparable percentage over the 3 years and our plan for additional debt reduction post closing the Tug Hill acquisition should more acutely highlight this track record.\nTurning to a few brief thoughts on the gas macro landscape. The combination of warm winter weather and the Freeport outage left roughly 400 Bcf of excess natural gas in storage this winter. The market is in process of rationing this excess gas with the balancing items likely to be split between low production and increased gas-fired power demand.\nOn the former, declines in gas directed activity has accelerated as of late with pricing falling well below many producer breakevens across the U.S., and we believe additional gas-directed activity declines in the coming months to moderate the pace of storage injections by roughly 200 Bcf.\nAs it relates to power generation, over 7,000 megawatts of U.S. coal generation is set to be retired in 2023 and we are seeing gas take further share from coal in the power stack to the tune of roughly 2 Bcf per day this year. With the average cost of coal rising materially in 2022, the coal to natural gas switching floor has increased by 50% or more and we believe this is a structural shift given the massive underinvestment in coal capacity.\nThere are several avenues of upside potential that could drive additional market timing above our current base case expectation, including higher sustained LNG exports, greater industrial demand, and reduced imports from Canada, given a tight Canadian storage market. We expect continued volatility in natural gas prices as gas and coal activity moderates and storage overall is an inadequate buffer relative to peak demand.\nMoving to hedging. Our 2023 hedge book underscores our evolved hedging philosophy that seeks to provide investors with the best risk-adjusted exposure to natural gas prices. We have 62% of our 2023 production covered with floors at an average weighted price of $3.38 per MMBtu, which provides significant cash flow protection and downside pricing scenarios while maintaining upside exposure.\nWe also have 10% of our '24 volumes hedged at a weighted average floor price of $4.20 per MMBtu and a weighted average ceiling of $5.40 per MMBtu. Given our expectation of improving natural gas macro fundamentals, as the year progresses, we will opportunistically look to add to our 2024 hedge position at the appropriate time.\nAs it relates to basis, we are seeing a material benefit from our expanded firm transportation portfolio which was reflected in our first quarter differential coming in at a $0.16 premium to NYMEX as we captured favorable pricing spreads during the quarter. We continue to expect additional opportunities to expand our FT position as other Appalachian operators release existing firm transportation capacity.\nAs it relates to MVP, Slide 8 of our investor presentation illustrates the project's impact on EQT's cumulative free cash flow. While the benefit of MVP is interrelated with the spread between NYMEX and local Appalachian prices, the current future strips suggest MVP has an immaterial impact on our cumulative free cash flow as higher price realizations are largely offset by higher transportation expense.\nThat said, we continue to be staunch supporters of MVP as the project is necessary to ensure energy security for the Southeastern region of the United States while achieving its carbon-reduction goals via the phaseout of coal-fired generation. We were encouraged to see Energy Secretary Granholm's show of support for MVP and broader energy infrastructure this week with notable comments on how these projects will deliver dependable energy to Americans while supporting the reliability of the electric grid.\nFor reference, our model assumes MVP starts up in the second half of 2024 and we will adjust assumptions if needed. Importantly, gathering rates contractually begin declining in 2025 independent of MVP's success, providing a further tailwind to free cash flow as margins widen by $0.15 from current levels, adding approximately $300 million of annual pretax free cash flow by 2028.\nTurning to guidance. We are reading our 2023 production outlook of 1.9 to 2 Tcfe. This range provides significant flexibility to respond to evolving macro conditions, with the low end of our production guidance of product's potential outcome of moderating activity should natural gas prices continue to decline.\nWe are currently running 2 operating horizontal rigs and thus not contemplating reducing rig activity, but we have flexibility around our completion cadence as well as our choke management program.\nWe are also reiterating our 2023 capital budget of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, excluding the pending Tug Hill acquisition, which embeds 10% to 15% year-over-year oil field service inflation.\nAs it relates to leading edge inflation trends, we are experiencing a flattening out of steel costs and starting to see long-haul logistics prices softening. We believe this is a signaling of some degree of price relief on local logistics such as sand and water hauling and could enable further completion efficiencies.\nWhile still too early to predict with precision, we believe this backdrop could set up for some degree of net price relief for EQT by the fall and upside potential to our free cash flow outlook later in 2023 and into 2024. As a reminder, $100-plus million of our budget is associated with turning in line wells that slipped from 2022 into 2023 due to third-party constraints and thus is not anticipated to carry forward into future periods.\nThis dynamic, along with the shallowing of our base PDP decline is anticipated to drive 5% to 10% improvement in our capital efficiency in 2024 and beyond, independent of any oil field service cost relief.\nOur per unit operating expense range is 2% per Mcfe lower at the midpoint driven by lower production taxes and G&A. We're also lowering the range of our average differential forecast for the year to negative $0.35 to negative $0.60 per Mcfe, driven by narrowing local basis and the benefits from our firm transportation portfolio.\nOn Slide 32 of our investor deck, we provide adjusted EBITDA, operating cash flow and free cash flow outlooks at various natural gas prices for the remainder of 2023. At recent strip pricing, 2023 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $2.9 billion and 2023 free cash flow is anticipated to be roughly $1 billion implying a free cash flow yield of 9% at the bottom part of the cycle.\nAs it relates to cash taxes, we continue to expect our remaining federal NOLs to offset the bulk of our 2023 taxes. Our 2024 cash tax rate would be approximately 5% to 7% of operating income or $120 million to $170 million at current strip pricing, increasing to the low 20% range in 2025 and beyond, which is fully captured in our cumulative free cash flow outlook.\nTurning to capital allocation. We repurchased almost 6 million shares during the first quarter and have retired a total of more than 20 million shares under our buyback authorization at an average price of roughly $30 per share. Our buyback strategy is opportunistic in nature as we seek to maximize the return generated for investors, and we are pleased with our execution to date as we have generated the best buyback return among the gas peer group.\nWe've also retired $210 million of debt principal during the quarter at an average price of 96% of par, taking our total debt principal retired to $1.1 billion since initiating our capital return framework. This focus on debt retirement has driven our net leverage down a full turn over the past year, highlighting our commitment to a bulletproof balance sheet.\nLooking ahead, our cash position affords us tremendous flexibility as it relates to financing the cash portion of the pending Tug Hill acquisition. As we work constructively with the FTC and approach deal closing, we plan to maintain cash on hand to effectively prefund a portion of our expected debt paydown post deal close.\nWe will also look for opportunities to buy back additional stock post deal close, especially in light of the value accretion and the cost structure improvements that Tug Hill and XcL assets will bring to EQT.\nAs Toby mentioned, we see greater than $12 billion of cumulative free cash flow from 2023 through 2027 at today's lower strip even before factoring the benefits of the pending Tug Hill acquisition, leaving us with plenty of firepower to fully achieve and exceed our debt retirement goal and our equity buyback authorization.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Toby for some concluding remarks.\n\nToby Z. Rice\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThanks, Dave. To conclude today's prepared remarks, I want to reiterate a few key points: One, first quarter results were robust across the board at EQT, underscored by strong operational efficiencies, lower-than-expected capital spending and higher price realizations from our advantaged firm transportation portfolio; two, the solid performance facilitated $774 million of free cash flow, underscoring our cash generation potential even in a lower natural gas price environment; three, we've built upon our track record of thoughtful opportunistic capital returns during the quarter with nearly $550 million of returns via share repurchases, debt retirement and our base dividend; four, our commitment to a bulletproof balance sheet is evident as net debt declined by roughly $900 million during the quarter, and we exited Q1 with over $2.1 billion of cash on hand; and finally, the current natural gas macro environment is giving us even greater confidence in our differentiated corporate strategy underpinned by efficient large-scale combo development, a disciplined M&A focus on low-cost assets, a risk-adjusted hedging strategy and opportunistic capital returns.\nI'd now like to open the call to questions."

In addition to Christian and Kim, today Gustav, Head of our Business Development team will be participating in our quarterly webcast and will do so from here on. We will present the results for about half an hour, as normal, before opening it up to Q&A. If you have registered ahead of the call, you should have received an email with your personal PIN code to participate in the Q&A, a new procedure.\nAnd with that, I'll hand over to Christian. Next slide, please.\n\nChristian Sinding\n\nCEO & Managing Partner, EQT AB (publ)\n\nThank you, Olof. Good morning and welcome everyone. 2022 was the most transformative year in EQT's history, despite the headwinds and uncertainties during the year. Through the combination with BPEA, add-ons and real estate and Life Sciences and new funds, we created a diversified global leader in active ownership strategies. We strengthened the EQT's Executive Committee, reflecting our diverse global footprint and our added focus on scaling the EQT platform. We had an active fundraising agenda with the successful close of a number of funds, including in growth and ventures, and we've made good progress in our flagship fundraisings.\nIn the business lines, EQT continued to make selective thematic investments, and we drove and preserved value across all of our existing portfolios, with all key funds continuing to perform on or above plan. However, the deterioration in market conditions, of course, resulted in a drop in investment and exit activity and value creation was largely flat, despite robust performance in our portfolio companies. As a result, reported carried interest was lower and we slowed down our hiring pace with additional focus on cost and efficiency. And as you can see on the right, the combined EBITDA landed at EUR 1.06 billion for the year. Having activated the latest generation of flagship funds, management fees are set to grow in 2023 while we do scale our global platform. Recently, we're seeing signs of the macro situations and markets turning more constructive, which is good, but we do plan for continued uncertainty. The fundraising market will continue to be affected by lower liquidity for investors for some time, which is now resulting in longer fundraising timelines.\nOn the investment side, with a global platform, a team of exceptional people, and more than EUR 50 billion of dry powder, I'm quite confident in our ability to seize investment opportunities ahead. And our deal flow remains solid. The long-term trend to investing in private markets remain strong, driven by our proven ability to generate good risk-adjusted returns. And many investors across the world remain under-allocated to the asset class. Having said that, deal activity across private markets is somewhat cyclical, as we saw in 2022. But at some point, markets and activity levels will rebound and the longer trend of private markets remains positive and growing. We've also seen a more constructive start to 2023. Whether the current situation turns out to be a shorter downturn or a recession, our priority is always to come out stronger, and this requires sharpening our future-proofing capabilities and continuous decisions in managing our portfolio and transactions. With EQT's governance model and the insights we gain from our 250-plus portfolio companies globally, allow us to do exactly that, and that is to take action.\nLooking back, some of the best investments were made in times of volatility. After the financial crisis, we did some strong deals, such as Atos Medical, KMD, Tampnet, and Anticimex, deals that delivered between 3 and 10x gross multiples of invested capital. And since then, we've sharpened our thematic investment strategy, sharpened our portfolio construction methods, and have much deeper value creation skills and tools to create long-term value.\nLooking at past cycles, our key funds have always delivered at least 2 extra turns and as always, generated carry. And we have 10 years-plus of time in each fund to secure such returns. But the journey hasn't always been smooth, we've seen IPO windows come and go, funding markets dry up, higher interest rates and deep recessions and market corrections like the dot-com implosion and the financial crisis. But we always maintain a long-term perspective. So in this recent hot cycle, we did not maximize leverage in our portfolio companies. We did not pursue hyped assets or financial engineering, like SPECs or cryptocurrency.\nAnd nor did we assume that valuation levels will remain at record high levels in our underwriting. And in fact, the average expected exit multiple in EQT IX was 4x lower than the entry multiple. So we want to own the right companies and assets, supported by long-term macro trends which we can transform through active ownership. Resilient, market-leading companies also see robust valuations throughout the cycle. And our deal flow remains strong, supported us by being local with locals in every single country where we invest.\nOur investment approach is built upon the belief that delivering strong returns goes hand-in-hand with creating a positive impact and that these are mutually reinforcing, in fact. With our scale, the value of the assets we manage is more than EUR 210 billion. We make a difference as an active owner, like committing all of our companies to the science-based targets. Over 1,000 clients globally trust us with their capital, and most of our clients are managing capital for pensioners and savers around the world. Thus, we have a responsibility to develop these companies in a manner which creates long-term value. Under EQT ownership, we work to future-proof our investments. We create more sustainable companies that will attract the best people and have resilient business models, which digitize operations, invest in R&D and in people, and we build global platforms through consolidation. Of course, we also need to drive efficiencies and cost measures when needed, and drive transformation of industries like, for example, GETEC Energy Services, which we exited last year.\nOver the past years, valuations have benefited from low rates and availability of capital. As these tailwinds abate, it will be more important than ever to transform companies and assets through active ownership in our view. To grow revenues, expand margins, gain market share, derisk assets. And this is what active ownership means. Take IFS, for example. Since 2015, we've appointed a new management team, upgraded the organization, almost tripled sales and more than doubled the margin. We've sharpened the company's focus on 5 core verticals, strengthened the sales force and accelerated new customer acquisition, becoming a global leader and making more than 9x multiple of invested capital.\nEQT is well placed to continue to make attractive investments is now clearly -- and now is clearly an interesting time to invest. We have EUR 50 billion of dry powder at our disposal. We're local with locals, as I said. And we have the people and the EQT network advisors, more than 600 of them, to support due diligence and bring deep sector expertise to our companies and management teams. And valuations and the bid-ask spread between buyers and sellers is starting to settle.\nWe invest in sectors supported by secular growth trends, often providing essential services to society. In private capital, we have Envirotainer and SPT Labtech in health care. We actively pursue public to privates like Billtrust and va-Q-tec, and corporate carve-outs as well. These are areas where we have deep experience, also including tech service transactions, for example, in Asia. In real estate, we're investing in sound locations, primarily in logistics supported by long-term trends. We improve the assets and we have strong relationship to lease space with our hands-on approach to global blue chip tenants. We upgrade those assets to the highest energy efficiency, making them more sustainable and more valuable. In Infra, we have strong deal flow across sectors, all of which are connected to important societal themes, such as climate and energy transition where the need for capital and competence is immense. With an estimated incremental annual $3 trillion of investments for energy and land use systems to deliver on net zero ambitions by 2050, as well as the digitalization of society and the aging populations.\nSo, I'd actually like to show you what this means in practice with a short video.\n(presentation)\nI hope that brought some of our investments to life. Good. So resilience and value-creation, these are not given in any business. We're continuously evaluating risks and reassessing value-creation plans in all of our investments. And to mention a few recent examples, we were early to extend debt maturities in our companies and focus on pricing and procurement when the market shifted. We reviewed and upgraded boards and management competencies, accelerated bolt-on acquisitions and performed a full re-underwriting of the private EQT portfolio to ensure that we remain on track in our funds.\nThe conclusion is that we have a robust portfolio. On average, portfolio companies grew revenues more than 20% last year and EBITDA growth was close to 18%. Having said that, we also do have pockets of underperformance. Certain companies have been impacted by COVID lockdowns, supply chain issues and rising labor costs. And while top line has been robust in most cases, some of these companies have seen slower EBITDA growth in the last year.\nIn real estate, similar to other businesses, we're focused on sectors with long-term demand drivers and robust supply and demand fundamentals. Despite the uncertain market situation with higher interest rates and softer global demand for real estate, the net operating profit from our properties continue to grow close to double-digit.\nThe fundraising market has become somewhat more challenging and timelines are being extended, also for flagship fundraisings. So fundraisings which took less than 12 months before the downturn, will now probably take more than 12 months to raise in the current environment. We have the capacity to make that happen. Looking back at the last 4 to 5 years, institutions have increased their commitments to alternatives. Fundraising cycles have been shorter than normal, and given the strong performance in private markets, institutions have reallocated capital from public to private markets. At the same time, financing in M&A markets were wide open and the net liquidity for clients was positive.\nThe main driver of the softer fundraising market currently is less liquidity. As the financing, M&A and IPO markets were closed or constrained in 2022, institutions were getting some less money back. And thus new commitments actually exceeded distributions last year. Having said that, 2022 was a strong fundraising year for EQT. In fact, we raised more capital than we've ever done in any year before with EUR 31 billion raised. EQT also has strong relationships with its clients. We distributed EUR 40 billion over the last 24 months in exits, and we've continued to realize the exits, notably at or above valuation marks during the past year. We have a young portfolio and a strong performance across the board, as you see, and we're investing behind strong secular trends.\nAs we enter 2023, our immediate priorities are to realize the full potential of our recent combinations. For example, the private capital sector teams are now working as one global team, sharing insights and working together. With a more challenging fundraising environment, we'll work with our clients to complete ongoing fundraises and scale our recently launched new initiatives. And we'll continue to optimize our global platform while strengthening our future-proofing capabilities across sustainability, digitalization and artificial intelligence with Motherbrain. We continue to evaluate and develop new products, which would provide access for a wider set of private wealth clients to invest with us. And, of course, we'll remain razor focused on performance, performance, performance.\nSo with that, I hand over to Gustav.\n\nGustav Segerberg\n\nHead of Business Development, EQT AB (publ)\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. By way of introduction, I head up our business development and I'm part of the EQT's Executive Committee. In the recent years, I'm focused on growing our global presence, leading the acquisitions of Exeter, LSP and BPEA. Today, I want to start by providing an update on the EQT Exeter transaction and the development since the acquisition now 2 years ago. Since then, fee-generating assets under management have grown by almost 3x and EQT Exeter is today a global top 10 player within real estate. In addition to the EUR 22 billion of fee-paying AUM, we have another EUR 4 billion of commitments which will be fee-paying as we invest the capital.\nSince the acquisition, EQT Exeter has had a very active exit agenda with over EUR 10 billion in realizations, hence derisking the track record of the existing funds, both in the U.S. and in Europe. These exits have been -- mostly been large portfolio realizations, where the funds have sold the assets, but EQT Exeter continued to manage the portfolios through so-called managed accounts, and therefore, also continue to charge management fees. This is due to the unique setup of EQT Exeter, being a real estate operator and being vertically integrated with a in-house leasing team and an in-house development management team.\nAt the same time, EQT Exeter has also been very active on the fundraising side, on the back of industry-leading returns, and today we have over EUR 12 billion of dry powder to deploy.\nAt the time of the acquisition, the key short-term lever was to scale up within logistics. And during 2022, we've raised both the value-add fund and the Core Plus fund in the U.S. The Core Plus fund is approximately 3x larger than the previous fund. And the value-add fundraise is still ongoing with over $4.5 billion raised to date, hence more than doubling the size of the last fund, despite being raised in probably what's the most difficult fundraising year for a long time. The real estate market is experiencing uncertainties, with higher inflation, higher interest rates and global supply chain disruptions. EQT Exeter is, of course, also impacted by this. However, mitigated by the focus on sectors with long-term demand drivers in markets with stronger demand and supply fundamentals, and also by the significant exit wave that we saw in 2021. Going forward, the focus is to take advantage of the repriced investment market with the significant dry powder, as well as to continue to expand into other sectors and asset classes, such as within multi-family.\nNow moving over to BPEA. We're very excited to have a scaled platform in Asia, especially in today's markets, where we see weakness in Europe and North America, whereas Asia is providing a very interesting diversification opportunity with an uncorrelated cycle and different drivers of growth and return. Asia is supported by positive long-term trends across GDP growth and middle-class population, creating significant investment opportunities in the years to come. As a result, the expectation is that, private markets across Asia will grow significantly quicker than the rest of the world and that global firms, such as ourselves, will continue to take market shares. Having a large investment platform in Asia is also providing benefits with our Asia clients, as we can serve them better, provide better access to people and knowledge and build stronger relationships.\nThe Asia market has been relatively resilient over the past year, with continued investment and exit activity, and financing markets have been and remain more constructive. As a result, BPEA have used these markets to return almost 50% more than been invested in 2022, further improving distribution to the clients. Fund VIII is just over 15% invested, which means that we have around $9 billion of dry powder to invest. The first joint step in building out the platform in Asia is the mid-market growth strategy, using the existing team and platform to invest across technology, health care and services, and where we've already done a couple of transactions, taking advantage of the current market opportunity. A key focus during 2023 will be to continue to work on a global cooperation, use best practices and learnings across the platform, in areas such as, for example, capital markets, sustainability, value-creation toolbox and digitalization.\nSo moving into the client side, we continue to see a long-term growth potential within Private Wealth. Private Wealth represents about half of the global wealth, and only 1% is allocated to actively manage alternative assets, which we, like many others, expect to increase over time. For us, this is a significant opportunity as Private Wealth today represents less than 10% of our commitments in the close-ended funds and we do not have any semi-liquid funds. As most of you know, Private Wealth and especially the semi-liquid market is currently experiencing some headwinds, which we are closely monitoring. We're focusing our efforts within Private Wealth on increasing the share from Private Wealth within our close-ended products by strengthening the relationships with our key distribution banks. And in addition, we're also working -- continuing to work around the semi-liquid structures, and we expect to launch certain products during the course of this year.\nI will now hand over to Olof to share a little bit more details on the ongoing fundraisers.\n\nOlof Svensson\n\nHead of Shareholder & Bondholder Relations, EQT AB (publ)\n\nThank you, Gustav. Having raised EUR 31 billion in 2022, the market is becoming more challenging, as we said. But we raised EUR 31 billion over the past year, and that includes Ventures III at hard cap, EQT growth above target, the EQT Exeter's fourth U.S. Core Logistics Fund, and its second Office and Life Science funds. BPEA VIII closed at hard cap and we progressed various fundraisers, including our flagship fundraises. If you look at EQT X, which was initiated in January 2022, this has commitments of EUR 16 billion as of today, including commitments of about EUR 1 billion confirmed in the first weeks of this year. We expect EQT X fundraising to be substantially completed during the summer.\nWhen it comes to BPEA, we are establishing a mid-market growth strategy. And as you know, we launched Infrastructure VI late 2022 and we have closed out about EUR 3 billion. We expect a similar pattern to EQT X for Infra VI, with strong re-ups in the first close. Demand for Infrastructure is healthy, and we expect the vast majority of our Infrastructure fundraisings, including Active Core in 2023. With regards to EQT Exeter, we raised $4.5 billion for EQT Exeter's U.S. Industrial Value VI Fund and expect to wrap up fundraising above the original $4 billion target. And we have 2 further EQT Exeter fundraisings in the market currently.\nIf we look at our AUM development, in 2022, AUM increased by EUR 39 billion or more than 50%. About half is attributed to BPEA. BPEA had AUM of about EUR 22 billion as of closing. Step-downs of EUR 9 billion refer primarily to the activation of EQT X and Infrastructure VI. EQT IX saw step-downs of about EUR 2 billion and in Infrastructure V, step-downs impact about EUR 5 billion. But Infrastructure V has made investments which have not yet closed and has capital earmarked for CapEx rollout, and this will actually increase the AUM by about EUR 2 billion compared to the year-end numbers in our report. Closed exits in 2022 reduced AUM by almost EUR 6 billion and the AUM number is also affected by FX. The BPEA funds are USD-denominated and at the current FX, the BPEA euro equivalent AUM number is about EUR 20 billion. And the EQT Exeter funds are largely USD-denominated and the equity and infrastructure funds also have USD sleeves, which are converted to euro as we report our AUM numbers.\nLet's next turn to the investment activity. After a busy year in 2021, we saw investment activity drop by 40% while exit volumes dropped by 60%. Broader market uncertainties resulted in a gap between buyer and seller expectations and financing markets were clearly constrained, which limited the scope for larger deals, in particular. We still did certain thematic investments in 2022 and EQT X is now 10% to 15% invested. Infra VI announced its first investment in December and is 0% to 5% invested. And deal activity remained solid in Asia, as Gustav said, with BPEA VIII being 15% to 20% invested. Financing markets remain constrained and the rates are considerably higher compared to a year ago, of course, but there are signs of a marginal improvement in the debt markets. We continue to see debt packages of EUR 2 billion to EUR 3 billion being feasible and for the right situations, there could be scope to do larger debt financing, including bank funding we think.\nWith regards to our existing portfolio, financing structures remain robust. Infrastructure, we recently completed certain refinancings, which were done at substantially similar terms to what we saw prior to the downturn. We have no material refinancings coming up, although we typically swap floating rates to fixed, which means we have some hedges being renewed. Whilst we expect near-term activity to be muted, it's a dynamic market with some signs of improvement. We may consider realizing certain infrastructure assets for example where demand for inflation and downside-protected assets is strong. We may pursue certain exits in private equity across the world as well.\nWith regards to new investments, we are actively evaluating several thematic opportunities. In private capital, we're evaluating deals in our core sectors, including health care and tech. In real estate, we're active -- in real assets, sorry, we're actively looking at digital infrastructure, energy transition themes and we think it's possible, based on the investment pace that we currently see in our flagship funds that investment cycles are close to the 3-year averages, which we have seen historically. Lastly, real estate activity levels have slowed down significantly and we are mainly doing smaller transactions at the moment but see interesting opportunities as we said.\nBefore handing over to Kim, let me also mention that lockups on about 7 million equity shares expired in 2022. The shares are held by Exeter employees, and the expiry is in line with the agreements set at the time of the combination with Exeter. To the extent any of these or other previously released shares were to be sold, the process would be coordinated by EQT AB. And with that, I will hand over to Kim.\n\nKim Henriksson\n\nCFO, EQT AB (publ)\n\nThank you, Olof, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing our fund valuations over the past year. Fund valuations were largely stable for infrastructure and for BPEA, and somewhat down for our private equity business outside Asia. Our equity and infrastructure companies grew their top line on average at over 20%, and saw EBITDA growth of approximately 18%. Around 1/4 of this growth came from add-ons. So the underlying organic growth remains solid. Almost all of our companies in the key funds are EBITDA positive. So it's a robust portfolio with long-term financing in place and a strong ability to pass on inflation. Our core sectors and focus areas, such as health care, digital infrastructure and tech see continued robust interest and transaction multiples. However, a few portfolio companies saw headwinds impacting EBITDA growth in '22. We do expect to hold companies on average longer than in the recent past. This could result in somewhat lower IRRs but gross MOIC expectations are largely unchanged.\nNext slide, please. Let's next break down the valuation drivers using 3 of our key funds which are fully invested and in value-creation mode as examples. As mentioned, strong operational performance supported valuations in 2022, which is the case in all these examples. In EQT VIII, this was offset by lower reference valuation multiples. Across the key funds multiples were down by about 10% year-on-year. Not all multiples are down, some relevant transaction multiples and infrastructure are higher. Infrastructure valuation methodologies include both multiples and discounted cash flow analysis, and valuations are typically resilient. We have a few listed holdings in our private capital funds, in EQT VIII in particular, which are valued at the last closing share price of the period. On an average basis, our listed holdings traded down in 2022.\nOn a general note, a meaningful portion of our equity and infrastructure funds, especially the earlier vintages, have already been realized. As those exits are cemented in the underlying valuation of the funds, this means only a portion of companies in those funds are actually seeing valuations move. On average, exits in 2022 were made at a 26% premium to the valuations of these assets in our funds, which supports our view that we had cautious valuations in our books coming out of COVID.\nNext slide, please. The lower exit activity and flattish valuations translates into lower recognition of carried interest and investment income in 2022. Management fees increased by 22% versus last year or 15% excluding BPEA. On a combined like-for-like basis, the growth was around 23%. In the reported numbers, EQT X was included only for 5 months, BPEA VIII only for 2.5 months and Infra VI only since mid-December, meaning that we expect the growth to continue into 2023. As a result of the lower carry and FTE growth in 2021 and '22, our total EBITDA and EBITDA margin is down versus 2021. Excluding carried interest and investment income, however, the margin continues to grow as we have activated our latest generation of funds and we continue to scale our platform globally. We're very strict on our cost development in this market environment and have taken actions during the year and slowed down hiring, which I will revert to.\nNext slide, please. The closing of BPEA took place in mid-October, meaning our financials include 2.5 months of contribution in '22. As previously communicated, the business model and financial profile of BPEA is similar in many ways to our own. The transaction is accretive as of closing, even though we do not expect any material cost synergies. Looking at our combined financials, i.e., if closing had occurred on January 1, then we would have had combined management fees of EUR 1.6 billion and an EBITDA excluding carried interest of EUR 826 million, which is equivalent to an EBITDA margin excluding carried interest and investment income of 51%. Including carry, the EBITDA margin would have been 57%. BPEA VIII started generating management fees in September '21 and the final close at hard cap occurred in September '22.\nCommitments raised during '22 generated slightly above EUR 10 million of catch-up phase prior to closing of the combination. The increase in management fees year-on-year for BPEA's full-year number is largely driven by the full-year effect from BPEA VIII. As you may have noticed in the report, our effective fee margin increased compared to H1 and was 1.48%. This was driven by BPEA's effective management fee rate which in general is higher than our other funds. Fund VII entered carry mode in 2022, driven by a combination of exits and rebounding valuations, driving the fund from 1.8x to 2.0x MOIC in Q4. BPEA VI also contributed to the full-year number.\nNext slide, please. Around 2/3 of our cost base consists of personnel costs. Around half of the FTE increase in 2022 came from business combinations including BPEA, LSP, Bear Logi and Redwood. The other half is from organic growth, in anticipation of our next generation of funds in strategic growth areas, such as capital raising and private wealth, and in our future-proofing capabilities. As mentioned, during the year, we have slowed down the hiring pace significantly. We're focused on efficiencies and scaling the EQT platform. Areas where we may consider further hiring include private wealth and North America and APAC. Total cost per average FTE in 2022 is somewhat lower than in 2021. Variable compensation levels are lower for the year and the variable compensation going forward is depending on how the performance develops. With growth in headcount in more expensive regions and functions, the average cost could increase from levels seen last year, everything else equal.\nTo summarize our financial year in 2022, our total profitability in 2022 is impacted by lower carried interest and investment income. Revenue growth excluding carry remains high and profitability is increasing. When looking into 2023, we expect this to continue following recent fundraisings, and a very cautious approach to cost growth. In an environment with significant uncertainty, we have a solid cash position and we are receiving our contractually recurring management fees in January and July. In addition, if we were to need it, we have an undrawn revolver of EUR 1.5 billion. Carry expectations follow the same pattern as mentioned before, i.e., in the near term, carry is likely to be delayed, given market developments but our carry expectations over the longer term remain.\nWith that, I hand back to Chris for a wrap-up.\n\nChristian Sinding\n\nCEO & Managing Partner, EQT AB (publ)\n\nThank you, Kim. So in summary, the market environment [deteriorated] in 2022, but during that time we really strengthened our global platform. Our industry is seeing long-term growth and there will be a rebound in activity levels. And we saw some really bright spots here during early 2023. Overall, we're in a good place. Our deal flow remains strong, we are in active fundraising year in 2022, and we have a significant amount of dry powder to deploy in this market. The majority of our fundraising in 2023 is in infrastructure, where demand is robust and we are confident in our targets. With BPEA, we've created a scaled global platform, and I'm quite confident that we're in a solid position to navigate this market and use it to further strengthen our firm and deliver for our clients.\nSo with that, we'll open up for questions. Thank you."

Please refer to our most recent earnings release and investor presentation for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Toby.\n\nToby Z. Rice\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, EQT Corporation\n\nThanks, Cam, and good morning, everyone. The energy macro landscape remains volatile as the world continues to grapple with the structural undersupply of natural gas. Thanks to American-sourced LNG, Europe has done a commendable job refilling its storage over the past few months. But those thinking that the singular goal is making it through winter failed to understand the scale of the problem at hand. Any doubt that the European energy crisis is going to be multiyear in duration, ended a few weeks ago with the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines.\nDomestically, natural gas production has increased as of late, which is helping to ensure the U.S. has the energy it needs to meet demand this winter. That said, electricity prices in many parts of the country will remain extremely elevated, highlighting the continued challenges we face connecting natural gas supply with demand due to a lack of pipeline infrastructure.\nAs many of you know, since unveiling our unleashed U.S. LNG campaign in March, we have been on a relentless mission to educate policymakers on the driving factors limiting U.S. producers' ability to meet the critical energy needs of consumers, both domestically and abroad. The social pain caused by crippling energy prices around the world is unacceptable to us at EQT. The U.S. has the recoverable resources necessary to single-handedly double the global LNG market, providing both energy security and meaningful decarbonization through the replacement of foreign coal.\nWhile recent setbacks around permitting reform have been unfortunate, we continue to believe the U.S. public's overwhelming desire for additional natural gas production and infrastructure will be heard. To help ensure that this is the case, we recently spearheaded the launch of a new coalition, the Partnership to Address Global Emissions, or PAGE Coalition. PAGE brings together responsible energy producers, leading climate advocates and labor groups to advocate for the infrastructure that is critically required to increase production and exports of U.S. natural gas to lower global emissions, reduce inflation and provide energy security to America and our allies.\nPAGE provides another avenue for EQT to help progress truly sustainable energy solutions that are required to have a meaningful impact on lowering global emissions, while simultaneously providing a tool to end the global energy crisis that is bringing unnecessary pain to consumers around the world.\nTurning to the third quarter. It was an active one at EQT as we announced the bolt-on acquisition of Tug Hill and XcL Midstream. As highlighted in our conference call last month, this deal checks all of the boxes of our guiding M&A principles, has significant industrial logic given direct offset to our existing leasehold in West Virginia and brings over 11 years of core inventory that immediately competes for capital inside EQT's portfolio.\nThe acquisition drives accretion on free cash flow per share, NAV per share, lowers our cost structure and derisks our business, all while maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. The acquisition implies, we are paying a sub-$3 per million Btu long-term natural gas price, underscoring the attractive risk-adjusted return profile for our shareholders.\nGiven the low-cost nature of Tug Hill's assets, we expect our corporate NYMEX free cash flow breakeven to drop from approximately $2.30 to $2.15 per million Btu on a pro forma basis, which adds further resiliency to our free cash flow profile through all parts of the commodity cycle. As a reminder, we did not bake in any synergies when underwriting this deal, but we highlighted $80 million of per annum potential and additional subsequent work by our teams suggest the opportunity for further upside largely due to greater confidence in water system integration benefits.\nWe continue to expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year and look forward to providing pro forma guidance after closing. Concurrent with the Tug Hill acquisition announcement, we raised our year-end 2023 debt reduction target by $1.5 billion to $4 billion, and doubled our stock buyback authorization to $2 billion. We've made material progress towards our debt reduction goals with $830 million of debt retired year-to-date.\nOn the buyback front, while securities laws prohibited us from repurchasing stock for a significant amount of the quarter due to the Tug Hill transaction, we have been active, post deal announcement, repurchasing 3.6 million shares for approximately $150 million since mid-September. Recall, we repurchased roughly 10 million shares in Q1 at an average price of around $23 per share and effectively retired 5.7 million shares through our convertible note repurchases in Q2 at an implied share price of $37 per share.\nCombined with our activity over the past few weeks, we have now reduced our fully diluted share count by more than 19 million shares this year at a weighted average price of $31 per share. Looking ahead, we still have approximately $1.6 billion remaining on our buyback authorization, providing significant dry powder to repurchase our shares at an extremely attractive valuation. We will also look to redeploy cash savings from retiring debt, repurchasing shares and our realization of Tug Hill synergies into additional base dividend growth moving forward.\nAlso in the third quarter, we announced a collaboration with the state of West Virginia, Battelle, GTI Energy and Allegheny Science & Technology to form the Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub, or ARCH2. Appalachia is ideally suited to lead the charge in clean hydrogen production in the United States given abundant, low-cost, low emissions natural gas, interconnected infrastructure and storage, existing transportation networks and proximity to major end-use markets.\nThe ARCH2 team is comprised of entities with operations across the Appalachian region, expanding the hydrogen value chain as well as technology organizations, consultants, academic institutions, community organizations and NGOs that will provide the commercial and technical leadership for the development and build-out of the hub. Coalition plans to apply for the DOE's Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub funding opportunity, which seeks to provide $8 billion in federal funding to accelerate the deployment of U.S. hydrogen technologies and contribute to decarbonizing multiple sectors, while enabling regional and community benefits. We plan to submit our concept paper to the DOE this winter and our full application by next spring, with final DOE hub selection expected in the fall of 2023.\nDuring preparation of the concept paper and full application, EQT and the rest of the ARCH2 coalition will design the hydrogen hub and develop projects that span the hydrogen value chain from production through transportation and storage, all the way to end use. For the funding opportunity announcement issued by the Department of Energy in September, the winning hub teams will be awarded between $500 million and $1 billion, which can help subsidize all the projects included in the application.\nIn terms of EQT capital commitments, we do not anticipate incurring any significant spending related to ARCH2 until the latter part of this decade. The ARCH2 announcement comes at an ideal time as the world is demanding cheaper, more reliable and cleaner energy, and we believe the use of EQT's extremely low emissions natural gas to create clean hydrogen can act as a strategic foundation for America's transition towards decarbonization. Our participation in ARCH2 is just one of many pillars across our broader new venture strategy, which is designed to uniquely position EQT and forging new paths and opening new markets as we progress into a lower carbon future.\nTurning to operations. As shown in Slide 11 of our investor deck, our shift to combo development in 2019 as new management took over EQT has resulted in multiyear well productivity improvements. Our 18-month lateral normalized recoveries are up almost 45% since 2019, which is greater than 2x the productivity increase experienced across broader Appalachia over the same period. This outperformance has been largely driven by the implementation of our evolved well design and mitigation of parent-child effects through large-scale combo development.\nWhile our underlying well productivity has been strong, multiple third-party and logistical constraints this year have led to almost 30% less wells turned in line versus our original plan, pushing activity into 2023. These third-party constraints, along with water restrictions due to drought conditions in parts of the basin, negatively impacted our 2022 production by more than 150 Bcfe or 7% compared with our original volume expectations.\nStrong well productivity and great work by EQT's team to optimize field operations have helped to buffer the impact and clawed back almost 50 Bcfe of this volume impact. The net effect is our full year 2022 production is trending to the low end of our prior guidance range, while our full year 2022 CapEx is also trending towards the lower end of our prior outlook. While third-party challenges have been disappointing this year, they also underscore the opportunity we have in front of us to integrate the Tug Hill and XcL assets to maintain greater control over infrastructure build-out, facilitating more pipeline connectivity and enable additional operational flexibility across our asset base moving forward.\nShifting to market dynamics. We were very pleased to see EQT added to the S&P 500 earlier this month. We view inclusion in this index as another testament to our premier asset base, success of our modern, digitally enabled operating model and the overall sustainability of our business. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work evolving EQT into a world-class organization that competes with the top companies across all segments of the economy.\nI'll wrap up by saying that despite EQT's stock performing reasonably well on a year-to-date basis, we believe the market has now remotely begun to reflect the intrinsic value of our business or relative quality versus peers. We are at a unique point in time as the North American natural gas market is in the process of an unprecedented structural shift as it is debottlenecked through LNG, and the world is increasingly recognizing the role natural gas will play in providing affordable, reliable and low-carbon energy for decades to come.\nEQT is among the best positioned companies in the world to benefit from this secular trend, underpinned by our capital-efficient asset base, unrivaled depth and quality of inventory and declining midstream fees. We believe these characteristics combine to create a superior value proposition for investors and will ultimately be reflected in our share performance as these factors are converted into durable free cash flow that we can compound over time.\nI'll now turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid M. Khani\n\nCFO, EQT Corporation\n\nThanks, Toby, and good morning, everyone. I'll briefly summarize our third quarter results before discussing our balance sheet, hedging and guidance updates.\nSales volumes for the third quarter were 488 Bcfe, which was modestly below the midpoint of our guidance range. As Toby mentioned, third-party and logistical constraints put a governor on our activity during the quarter, limiting our TILs to just 16, versus our guidance range of 22 to 32. Our adjusted revenues for the quarter were $1.7 billion or $3.41 per Mcfe, and our total per unit operating costs were $1.42. As a result, our operating margin was $1.99, about $0.90 or 85% higher than last year.\nCapital expenditures were $349 million, below the low end of our guidance range largely due to lower-than-expected completion activity. Adjusted operating cash flow was $940 million and free cash flow was $591 million, bringing our total year-to-date free cash flow to approximately $1.7 billion. Our free cash flow also reflected a basis differential of $1.02 per Mcfe, wider than our guidance of $0.80 to $0.90 per Mcfe due to wider local differentials and an unplanned outage on the NEXUS system.\nOur capital efficiency for the quarter came in at $0.72 per Mcfe, which was a 4% sequential quarterly improvement resulting from lower capital spending. On Slide 26, we highlight our capital efficiency has averaged $0.70 per Mcfe on a year-to-date basis, which is 35% below the gas peer group average despite the third-party issues impacting the timing of our production this year.\nTurning to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, our trailing 12-month net leverage stood at 1.3x, down 0.3 turns from the prior quarter. To fund the Tug Hill and XcL acquisition, we raised $2.25 billion of debt, which is leverage neutral to our existing profile. This is comprised of raising $1 billion of senior notes and $1.25 billion of term loans, with strong support from both our banks and our institutional investors. Despite a challenging credit environment, we priced our 2 tranches of senior notes at 175 to 200 basis point spread to respected treasuries with further tightening in the secondary market. This enabled us to lower funding cost and implement efficient repayment terms.\nWe see the successful debt financing as another testament to the underlying credit quality of our business and value the support we receive from our banks and bondholders. As highlighted with the deal announcement, we raised our year-end '23 debt reduction target from $2.5 billion to $4 billion, which will take our gross pro forma debt down to approximately $3.5 billion. With our debt trading below par due to the Fed raising rates, we have even more principal purchasing power. Once we achieve our absolute debt target, we will have a bulletproof balance sheet with leverage of 1 to 1.5x using a conservative $2.75 per MMBtu NYMEX gas price. We have already executed $830 million of debt reduction goal this year and expect to make material additional progress over the coming quarters given the robust projected free cash flow generation.\nLooking at liquidity, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.6 billion, comprised of an essentially undrawn credit facility and $88 million of cash. Two positive liquidity items to point out. First, we replaced approximately $180 million of letters of credit with surety bonds during the quarter. And second, we received $196 million from Equitrans Midstream subsequent to quarter end, as we exercise our option to receive cash in lieu of a portion of near-term fee release.\nNow moving over to hedging. As mentioned on our Tug Hill acquisition call, we added to our legacy hedge book in the third quarter, taking our hedge volumes from 50% to 60% next year through the purchase of deferred premium puts with an average strike price of $4.65 per MMBtu. We've also executed on the majority of our plan to hedge 60% of Tug Hill's production next year through the combination of deferred premium puts and collars with an average floor price of $5.53 per MMBtu and an average ceiling of $10.80 per MMBtu.\nOn a pro forma basis, we have approximately 60% of our 2023 production hedge, with floors at an average strike price of $3.30 and approximately 45% covered with ceilings at an average strike price of $5.65 per MMBtu. We remain unhedged for 2024, and we'll be looking for opportunities to begin building out our hedge position.\nTurning to guidance. As Toby mentioned, the third-party and logistical constraints have reduced our planned 2022 TILs by approximately 30% versus our original outlook. Strong underlying well performance and field optimization have mitigated the impact to 2022 sales volumes, which are now expected to be 1,925 to 1,975 Bcfe or roughly in line with the lower end of our prior guidance range. We are also lowering our full year capital expenditure guidance to $1.4 billion to $1.475 billion, excluding acquisitions to reflect the lower TIL count.\nWhile we're in the midst of the budgeting process for 2023, our supply chain contracting strategy puts us in a strong access and cost position given our multiyear sand and frac crew contracts. We plan to give more fulsome details once we provide 2023 guidance, but we expect EQT to experience inflationary impacts that are at the lower end of broader industry ranges for next year.\nGiven our structurally superior hedge position next year, we expect our 2023 free cash flow to expand by approximately 90% year-over-year at recent strip pricing prior to the effect of Tug Hill, and after factoring in cash taxes, providing differentiated free cash flow per share growth to our shareholders.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Toby for some concluding remarks.\n\nToby Z. Rice\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, EQT Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave. To conclude today's prepared remarks, I want to reiterate a few key points. One, the pending Tug Hill and XcL acquisition underscores our disciplined M&A strategy, adding low-risk bolt-on assets to our business with clear industrial logic, a compelling valuation, material cost structure accretion and the opportunity to capture meaningful synergies.\nTwo, we have returned approximately $1.5 billion of capital to shareholders this year, including almost $600 million of share repurchases and convertible note retirements at an average price of $31 per share. And our updated capital returns framework on the back of the Tug Hill deal provides material room for additional shareholder returns moving forward.\nThree, our move to combo development has driven significant well productivity gains since we took over EQT in 2019. And this tailwind, along with our team's optimization efforts, has allowed us to ameliorate the impact of third-party constraints this year.\nFour, the ARCH2 hydrogen hub collaboration has the potential to lay the foundation for the next leg of decarbonization efforts at EQT, taking advantage of differentiated access to vast low-cost, low emissions natural gas in Appalachia.\nAnd finally, we were honored to join the S&P 500 earlier this month and see our inclusion in the index representing another significant milestone on EQT's journey to becoming the operator of choice for all stakeholders.\nI'd now like to open the call to questions."

Together with Christian, Caspar and Kim, we will present the results for about half an hour before opening up for Q&A. As always, in order to ask questions, you need to be dialed in to the conference line.\nWith that, I hand over to Christian. Next slide, please.\n\nChristian Sinding\n\nCEO & Managing Partner, EQT AB (publ)\n\nThanks, Olof. Good morning, and welcome all. In the first half, we continue to take steps towards building a global leader in active ownership strategies. We announced the combination with BPEA, completed the smaller acquisitions of LSP, Bear Logi and Redwood.\nInvestment and exit activity slowed down due to the market conditions, but we've also continued to make selective new deals and exits. In the busy fundraising market, we're making good progress, having already closed about 2/3 of the new EQT X fund. Overall, fundraising timelines are being stretched in this market.\nWith regards to talent, we're happy to have secured strong talent during the past years. We always hire in anticipation of growth. We have great teams in place to invest our funds, manage our platform and serve our clients. Given the more challenging economic environment, we're now being more restrictive in hiring of course.\nOur commitment to leading the way in terms of future proofing and performance remains. Our key funds continue to perform well, but we are preparing, of course, for more challenging times. In sustainability, we've taken a further step by establishing a sustainability committee on the board. And similarly, we're continuously strengthening our digital approach, where Alexandra Lutz is now leading our Motherbrain team that now consists of 28 data scientists.\nIn terms of financials, we're about to take the next step in our development as we add EQT X launch in for VI during the fall and we closed the combination with BPEA.\nNext slide. We ended last year with preparing for higher inflation and rising rates. We now also see spiking energy prices and the global economy is facing a number of uncertainties. Our senior team members have all lived through these kinds of economic cycles before. We've dealt with the dot-com bubble, the global finance crisis, and most recently, the COVID pandemic. We've learned from every market downturn and come out stronger every time.\nImportantly, we've always supported our portfolio companies and protected capital for our clients. In fact, since inception, the key funds have all realized at least 2x gross MOIC regardless of cycles. Being a long-term owner with 10-plus year funds means every fund will need to navigate different macro environments. It's certainly part of our model.\nAnd we have generated care in every single fund, every single key fund in our history. The fundraiser support we see today despite the market turmoil is the result of having -- EQT having delivered strong returns for our clients for almost 3 decades.\nNext slide, please. As mentioned, the environment we are operating has changed significantly and rapidly. When markets were strong, we strived to never become complacent. And to be prepared for any macro scenario is as a part of our model. It's at the core, actually, what we call future-proofing. So we're entering this period of uncertainty stronger. Now let me tell you why.\nFirst of all, we have a global platform solely focused on active ownership and diversified across geographies and asset classes. 32% of our AUM is in infrastructure with 48% in private capital and 20% in real estate. Being active owners means that we can take action very quickly.\nFor example, we started preparing our companies for a downturn already in early Q1 this year. We've had a very active exit agenda for years with an announced realizations of around EUR [30] billion in 2021 alone. We can, therefore, be very selective when it comes to exits in this market.\nAlso, we have a young portfolio, which has been invested thematically. In fact, the oldest fund and equity is through 2015, and Infra only has one company left in its 2012 fund. This means that we have the resources to continue to develop our companies. They're invested in long-term secular growth trends and have a robust financing structures. It also means that we don't have a tail of older often underperforming companies, which equally also are much more difficult to exit in particular during more challenging times.\nSo overall, given our track record of returns, we believe we're well positioned in this market. Post-closing of the BPEA transaction, we expect to have more than EUR 50 billion of capital to deploy, we call dry powder, including Infra VI. Most likely the next few years will provide unique investment opportunities for our various funds, and I know that we have the right teams in place to find and develop those opportunities. Next slide, please.\nAcross strategies, we've doubled down on our thematic approach in recent years. This is about finding industries and companies that are less correlated with the economic cycle. That's actually one of the key learnings we've had from previous cycles when we held, for example, building products and investments or other cyclical companies as we entered the downturn. That's not the case now. We now clearly invest based on long-term secular trends. Deals over the past years have been within our connected world, software, e-commerce, logistics and digital infrastructure, health and well-being, radiology clinics, dental technology, for example, and climate and energy transition like renewables and EV charging networks.\nAnd these are market leading companies that are able to pass on pricing increases and thus many of our investments actually provide a natural hedge to inflation. As a result, we expect our companies to have a relatively lower correlation with the economic cycle. And of course, as active owners, we will continue to build them through R&D add-on acquisitions and other future proofing actions.\nIn private equity, 90% plus is invested in health care, technology and tech-enabled services. It's a well-diversified portfolio, mainly invested across the Nordics, U.S. and Europe. The investments in EQT IX have been underwritten on average at a 4x exit multiple discount to the entry level. So we were somehow expecting that the high valuations we've seen over the last years would come down.\nAnd we've stayed disciplined on leverage despite the very strong credit market seen in recent years. In fact, the average level of leverage in EQT IX is lower than it was in EQT VIII. In Infrastructure, we invest in companies and assets providing essential services to society. The companies are often asset-based or with long-term contracts with high cash flow visibility and inflation protection.\nEdgeConneX, for example, has contracted inflation protection and were proactive in placing orders ahead of anticipated price increases. Another example is evidia, whose contracts include inflation indexation clauses. The portfolio also includes several assets that EQT intends to transform into regional or global platforms, like SAUR, our water services business. And that we find a number of opportunities coming now in energy transition, digital infrastructure and beyond.\nIn real estate, we're mainly investing in logistics, where strong demand and low supply underpins rental growth. Our model also here is hands-on and value-added and local with locals with specialist investment teams focused by geography and property sector. And this also includes driving more energy-friendly solutions into all the buildings, which is increasingly important, both for lowering costs with the energy crisis that we have, while also becoming more sustainable. Next slide, please.\nOver the past year, the portfolio of companies in our key funds within private equity grew sales by 25% and EBITDA by 18% compared to the previous 12-month period. In Infrastructure, the corresponding sales growth was 22% while EBITDA grew by 17%. And if you look at the first 5 months of 2022 through May, the portfolio of companies across private equity and infrastructure together grew sales at 20-plus percent compared to the first 5 months of 2021, whereas EBITDA grew mid-teens. So still strong operating performance.\nA majority of this growth is organic, further paced by add-on acquisitions and in line with our value creation strategy. Also importantly, the types of companies we invest in have long profitability track records. So 98% of the capital and 96% of the capital in private equity and infrastructure, respectively, you see on the slide there, is invested in companies which were EBITDA positive over the past 12 months.\nAs we showed on the previous page, about 95% of our AUM is in private equity, infrastructure or real estate. And we've had some questions on this. Less than 5% of our AUM is currently in the ventures and growth business lines, where by definition, many of the companies are not yet profitable.\nLooking at invested capital across EQT, that number is even smaller and closer to around 3% of AUM. Having said that, this is an interesting environment for earlier stage strategies to deploy capital. Some of the best investments ever in venture capital in Europe, for example, were made during the global financial crisis.\nInterestingly, we're yet to invest almost 75% of the EQT growth fund and we're still fundraising Ventures III. Similar to EQT, BPEA is generally seeing strong operating performance in its portfolio of companies as well in Asia. With an attractive portfolio, BPEA has had realizations this year-to-date of $2 billion. And as a result of those elements, BPEA's first half valuations also are robust despite lower public market references. And the fundraising of BPEA Fund VIII is going well. Across all of our strategies, we're taking advantage of active ownership to create value.\nAnd with that, I'll hand over to Caspar, who will talk about our fund valuations.\n\nCaspar Callerstrom\n\nDeputy CEO, EQT AB (publ)\n\nThank you, Christian. Next slide, please. So fund valuations in H1 have remained largely stable, both at EQT and at BPEA, despite the market turmoil. There are various drivers, both positive and negative behind the valuations, which I will cover in a bit more detail.\nStarting with factors impacting valuations negatively. First, most of the valuations in private capital are multiple based with comparable multiples, and our equity funds are down between 15% to 20% in Q2 compared to the year-end multiples.\nSecond, our listed companies are valued at the closing price at the end of the quarter. This impacts the valuations in private equity, whereas we have no listed holdings in infrastructure. In Infra, valuations are, to a large extent, based on discounted cash flows. A couple of factors are offsetting the negative valuation effects.\nFirst, as Christian mentioned, operational performance across portfolio companies in private equity and infrastructure remain strong. We're continuously reviewing the outlook and budgets for the portfolio companies, which is accounted for in the valuations. A few portfolio companies are experiencing headwinds in this environment, but there are also some that benefit of, for example, higher energy prices.\nSecond, we've secured exit at strong valuations levels. In EQT VIII, IFS and Workwave were, for example, marked at 2.1x cost in our year-end portfolio valuations, and we realized the assets at 3.0x in Q1. Similarly, Facile was marked at 2.5x the money at Q1 valuations, and we realized the exit at 3.2x now during the second quarter.\nAnd despite these strong exits, EQT VIII is now valued at 2.4x, down from 2.6x before. So this does not mean that we will always exceed fund valuations, but it does show that we tend not to have too optimistic valuation assumptions. And more generally, I would characterize our valuations as being more resilient, both when the markets trade up sharply and when they trade down sharply. As such, we did not markup valuation significantly in Q4 last year when public market valid. This is now the third consecutive quarter of largely flat valuations.\nAnd if you look at Infra and health care sector, if you look at those sectors where we have significant exposure, the public market indices have actually been relatively flat or looking back to Q3 last year.\nLastly, and I've said this before, we value entire companies and the value of a company is different to the price of a marginally traded share in the public market. Next slide, please.\nAs Christian mentioned, we're always thinking proactively about risks. Clearly, not all risks can be anticipated, but it's important to have the right toolbox, competencies and forums in place to identify and manage risks proactively. We've developed these tools based on our learnings over many cycles. To give a couple of examples, the EQT Global Investment Forum meets regularly to share insights from across our global platform, and this will be further strengthened as we add the insights and experience which the BPEA team brings to the platform.\nOur cybersecurity team has been working proactively across portfolio companies this year and many years before for that matter. And our Capital Markets team continuously ensures that portfolio companies have strong financing structures in place. We've also selectively added competencies to management teams and boards to make sure portfolio companies have the right teams in place to manage a more challenging environment. Let me share some perspectives on how we manage risks.\nWe never had any meaningful exposure to Russia. We had no companies headquartered there and has not been a target market for fundraisings. The few portfolio companies, which have had any exposure, such as sales or service contracts related to Russia, were immediately recommended to wind down such operations and affected employees have been relocated. None of the companies or assets in the main equity Infra or real estate funds have any remaining material exposure.\nWhen it comes to inflation, the portfolio companies across private equity and infrastructure have a high ability to pass on higher costs. The portfolio companies have low exposure to raw materials, transportation companies are, for example, affected by higher fuel prices. But on the other hand, we also hold power producers, which are beneficiaries.\nSimilarly, we see higher staff costs in some of our social infrastructure companies, which often have inflation-linked contracts. Exeter expects to be able to raise rents over time, while construction costs may go up. This also supports valuation and rent level over time. Higher financing costs may also reduce supply and competition for new investments. We see continued strong demand for thematic assets such as logistics assets.\nWhen it comes to financing structures, most companies have no covenants or covenant-light structures. Financing are either fixed rate or hedged with interest rate swaps or caps. Debt financings typically cover the expected ownership period. The average debt maturity across the private equity portfolio today is over 4 years. In Infra, it's over 5 years. Next slide, please.\nWe have raised over EUR 14 billion in H1 2022. And EQT X is already 2/3 towards the fund size. We expect active fundraising for EQT X to be materially concluded within 2022 with the final close expected in 2023. Similarly, whilst the combination with BPEA is yet to close, we note that fund raising for BPEA's VIII flagship fund is proceeding well.\nAnd as we mentioned in the BPEA announcement, we expect them to reach about EUR 20 billion in AUM by 2022, which they have already reached. We anticipate healthy interest in infrastructure and real estate fundraisings. We expect to launch fundraising for EQT Infra VI in the third quarter, with most of the fundraising to take place in 2023.\nWhen we activate the fund for management fee purposes will depend on the investment pace in Infra V, which is currently 70% to 75% invested. It's a busy fundraising market, which is evident primarily in the U.S., where some of our clients are already at their target allocation towards private equity, which is accentuated by the drop in public equity valuations, the denominator effect. As a result, new fund initiatives will take longer to raise in this market, and we expect existing clients to represent a large share of our ongoing fund raises.\nWhilst we have a clear ambition to continue to grow our client base in the U.S., it's a strength in this environment to have a diversified global client base. Many of our APAC-based investors are, for example, continuing to increase allocations to private markets. Looking ahead, we see a strong long-term growth in private markets paced by rising allocations from both institutional investors, but also private wealth and over time, the mass affluent markets where access to private equity will increase. This is an area we're looking at, at various structures to access new segments.\nI will now hand over to Olof.\n\nOlof Svensson\n\nHead of Shareholder Relations, EQT AB (publ)\n\nThank you very much, Caspar. And as you just heard, we had a number of ongoing fundraisings, which together with our existing funds and the combination with BPEA means we expect to have over EUR 50 billion of capital to deploy.\nOn the sourcing side, we continue to combine our sector-based thematic strategy with our locals with locals approach. We have a long-term approach to new investments, often following companies for a long time before we invest.\nIn EQT IX, for example, 12 out of 15 companies were acquired outside of broad auctions. The investment teams are evaluating a number of opportunities, including corporate carve-outs, add-on acquisitions to existing companies and even certain public companies, which we have followed for years.\nIn private equity, a majority of the pipeline is in our core sectors, such as health care and tech. And in infrastructure, we see interesting opportunities across our focus sectors. The energy transition in Europe further accelerates the shift from fossil-based energy production. The digitalization trend will continue to drive significant investments into digital infrastructure. And we see a significant investment gap in infrastructure across Europe and the U.S., while public sector spend is constrained.\nNext slide, please. Investment and exit activity has slowed down meaningfully given the market backdrop. We announced investments of EUR 5 billion in the first half of the year, down from EUR 8 billion in the first half of last year, and exits of EUR 4 billion compared to EUR 10 billion in the same period last year.\nAs Caspar mentioned, we have had a couple of exits such as facile and IFS at strong multiples. And we expect private market valuations for resilient, profitable market-leading companies in our core sectors to continue to be robust.\nBPEA, as Christian mentioned, have closed 2 new investments in their fund during the last quarter, and their fund is now around 15% invested. BPEA have seen realizations of about $2 billion across Fund VII and VI during the first half despite the more challenging market conditions.\nTurning to the financing market. It's clearly important for deal activity. And in this regard, the banks are much more -- much less active given the market environment. The liquidity pool, however, is open for well-structured credits in defensive sectors, which is typically the types of sectors we invest in. We have as such, successfully placed recent financings with private credit funds. When it comes to new deals, we run different financing tracks in parallel to make sure we find the best structure and terms.\nIn Infra, the fundraising sources are more diversified as we also benefit from infrastructure style financings. All of the financings are coordinated by our Capital Markets team, headed by James Yu in London and EQT Exeter has its own dedicated real estate financing team.\nAs we look ahead, we have a number of exits and investment opportunities in the pipeline, including a few active situations. However, we will be patient to achieve the right terms.\nAnd with that, I will now hand over to Kim.\n\nKim Henriksson\n\nCFO, EQT AB (publ)\n\nThank you, Olof, and good morning, everyone. Before I jump into our financial development during the period, I just want to take a step back and walk through the key pillars of our financials.\nThe bulk of our revenues are contractually recurring management fees. The investor commitments are long term, i.e., 10-plus years, and our fee margin has been stable at around 1.4%. From EQT X and the combination with BPEA and eventually, the activation of EQT Infrastructure VI, we expect a meaningful increase in management fees. We have historically done a good job of creating value for our investors, allowing us to maintain a profit sharing in the form of carried interest.\nThe profit split is generally 80-20, and of total carry generated, EQT AB gets 35% of the 20%. We just have a sizable future carried interest if all of our funds continue to develop on or above plan.\nIf all our key funds, including EQT X, performs on plan, we will make approximately EUR 6.7 billion in carried interest. As of H1 '22, we had only recognized approximately EUR 0.8 billion, there's considerable upside potential. And this excludes BPEA, where we're acquiring the right to carry in recent and all future funds.\nLooking at our expenses, they are largely driven by our FTE base. Personnel costs constitutes approximately 2/3 of the cost base. And our business model is scalable, but remember that we tend to hire ahead to secure future growth. Given the market conditions, we will continue to hire, albeit much more selectively. And as a reminder, our target is to have between 55% to 65% EBITDA margin over time.\nWe use our balance sheet mainly for 3 purposes. One, we invest in EQT funds to get contractual right to carried interest; and two, we support new strategies with temporary capital; and three, we use our balance sheet for strategic M&A.\nWe have a very modest leverage, and we have substantial cash, including the proceeds from the sustainability-linked bonds issued earlier in the year. The cash component of the BPEA combination is, therefore, fully funded. Next slide, please.\nFollowing that introduction, I want to jump into our AUM development. AUM increased slightly in H1, driven principally by gross inflows due to the closing of LSP and new fund commitments in EQT growth and Ventures III, along with Exeter Office Value Fund II.\nAs you heard Christian mention, we've closed out about 2/3 of EQT X already as of today. However, investor commitments will only be included in our AUM from the first fee date. This is currently driven by the closing of the first deal in EQT X, which is expected during Q3.\nAnother increase in our AUM will come with the closing of BPEA expected in Q4 '22. BPEA's fee-generating AUM as of Q2 '22 was approximately EUR 20 billion, as already mentioned. We may activate EQT Infra VI in '22, but this depends on the investment pace of Infrastructure V. And as Caspar mentioned, most of the fundraising will take place in 2023. Next slide, please.\nMoving over to our financials. As you can see on the left-hand side, we have experienced significant growth during these last years, and 2021 was an exceptionally strong year with a significant increase in management fees from EQT IX, Infra V and the closing of the acquisition of Exeter.\nWe are expecting a similar step change with the upcoming activation of EQT X, the launch of Infra VI and the closing of the BPEA acquisition. Looking at the H1 '22, our revenues increased to EUR 733 million and carried interest during the first half primarily relates to EQT Infrastructure III and thus to transactions which were signed prior to the period.\nKeep also in mind that we had a meaningful impact of retroactive fees in H1 '21 related to 2020 then. As a consequence of continued growth of our organization and in anticipation of the previously mentioned initiatives, H1 EBITDA decreased year-over-year to EUR 413 million.\nOur LTM, EBITDA margin was approximately 62%. And looking at H1 in isolation, it was 56%. Next slide, please. As I mentioned before, we see that we have considerable carried interest potential if our key funds perform according to plan. This slide simply illustrates how much carried interest EQT AB is entitled to if all of our key funds develop according to plan.\nAnd mind you, EQT VII, VIII and Infra III are developing above plan and are continuing to experience resilient performance. As a theoretical example, if we were to realize the portfolio at today's valuations, we would be entitled to approximately EUR 1.2 billion in carried interest.\nGiven that we have recognized approximately EUR 0.8 billion carry to date as of H1 '22, it implies that close to EUR 6 billion of carried interest is remaining to be recognized on our P&L in the coming years based on the current funds. Next slide, please.\nWe've grown our total operating expenses by approximately EUR 100 million and added a total of 467 FTE plus year-over-year. Focusing on H1 this year, we added roughly 300 FTE plus, of which about 100 joined from Redwood, Bear Logi and LSP. As such, we've had more than 200 new joiners so far. And in addition to the employees needed to support the growth of our flagship strategies, we have hired talent for our new strategies.\nWe have strengthened our central platform, including our digital and sustainability teams, and we have further strengthened our capital raising and fund operations teams. So we are cautious of adding a lot of cost, but a large part of hires are connected in various ways to strategic initiatives such as building up new distribution channels.\nPost-closing of the BPEA transaction, we're about to grow the year meaningfully. And as Christian mentioned, we expect to have north of EUR 50 billion of dry powder to deploy. With our existing teams and recent hiring efforts, we now have great teams in place to manage the next leg of growth. The majority of our hiring for 2022 is done, and the hiring pace is set to slow down in the second half of the year for 2 reasons.\nFirst, we have actively hired ahead for the growth I just mentioned. And secondly, we will be more selective in hiring decisions given the market environment. Something else to note is that we don't necessarily see costs per FTE increasing for the group as a number of the recent and planned hires are in our central operations or in EQT Exeter, which has a lower cost per FTE.\nTogether with Christina, who has now joined us as COO, we will continue to optimize our operations, including our cost structure. And we also look very much forward to welcoming about 250 people who will join us from BPEA once the combination closes. Next slide, please.\nI outlined how our balance sheet works a little bit earlier, but I wanted to come back to this topic quickly. Looking at our assets, they include primarily financial investments into EQT funds and our sizable cash position. And our liabilities, on the other hand, consists of the sustainability-linked bonds totaling EUR 2 billion with different long tenors.\nWe're well funded, and we have the BPEA cash consideration already financed. Our flexibility stays high. And on top of that, we have a revolving credit facility of EUR 1.5 billion, which is undrawn. We have a solid credit rating with an A- rating from Fitch, and our leverage level is very low relative to our size.\nWith that, I hand back to Christian for some closing remarks.\n\nChristian Sinding\n\nCEO & Managing Partner, EQT AB (publ)\n\nThank you, Kim, for that excellent walk-through. So to summarize, we've seen a rapid change in the market environment this year, and activity levels have slowed down as a result.\nHowever, I do believe that we're entering this period of uncertainty stronger. We're well prepared for whatever may come. Our portfolio consists of thematic investments. Over 90% of the companies in private equity and infrastructure were EBITDA positive over the past 12 months.\nThe underlying performance of the company has been fairly healthy over the past 12 months. But of course, we are closely monitoring activity levels in demand and addressing risks and issues proactively. Fund valuations have been largely flat for 3 consecutive quarters despite the strong operational performance and also recent exits, which did exceed fund valuations as Caspar described.\nFlagship fundraisings are progressing well at EQT and BPEA despite being a busy market. Fundraising actually in general will take longer to conclude in this market. Furthermore, we expect to have more than EUR 50 billion to be deployed. You've heard that. These are really interesting times to invest. So to have that dry capital -- dry powder is quite important, and that's what we are building and will build during the rest of the year and into next year with Infrastructure VI.\nIn terms of our financials, EQT is about to take the next steps in building its platform with the activation of EQT X, the combination with the BPEA and the upcoming launch of EQT Infrastructure VI in Q3.\nSo with that, I thank you for listening, and we now open up for questions."

It's been another busy quarter as we continued EQT's strategic growth journey, launched new strategies and continued making investments and exits despite macro geopolitical uncertainties.\nTogether with Christian, Caspar and Kim, we will summarize and reflect on the first quarter. And as always, there will be a Q&A after the presentation. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd with that, I hand over to Christian.\n\nChristian Sinding\n\nCEO & Managing Partner, EQT AB (publ)\n\nThanks, Olof, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we've taken an important step towards building a global leader in active ownership strategies. And we continue to perform well for our clients across various funds, across our various funds. At the same time, the year has started off distressfully with the war in Ukraine and continued conflicts in other regions around the world. We're, of course, deeply saddened by these human tragedies. And thus, as the war broke out in Ukraine, we immediately urge portfolio companies to wind down any activities in Russia. We've also seen strong support from the EQT network in helping Ukraine with humanitarian needs, including from portfolio companies like Schülke Hygiene.\nTurning to EQT's strategic agenda. We recently announced the combination with BPEA. And we're also thrilled to formally close the combinations with LSP and the Bear Logi team in Q1. Furthermore, EQT had quite a busy quarter when it comes to fundraising, with launching EQT X and Active Core Infrastructure and also having several other ongoing fundraisings across the group. At the same time, deal activity has continued despite the market turmoil, albeit at a somewhat slower pace compared to the very active quarters we had last year.\nOn the people side, we're now over 1,300 EQTarians globally, and we're continuing to strengthen the firm in terms of talent. And with that, I'm so happy to build EQT's Executive Committee with Christina Drews. She's going to join as EQT COO in June, and she's going to be leading the scaling of our operating platform going forward. And finally, we've preemptively funded the cash portion of the BPEA transaction through a bond, and we further strengthened EQT's financing structure through a larger revolver.\nNext slide, please. So let's take a step back and look at our strategic journey. With BPEA, we have a scaled platform in Asia. And as a result, EQT will have a truly global footprint. And this brings several advantages. First of all, our clients have further opportunities to invest with us across geographies and strategies. Secondly, we can share knowledge and insight across global teams to be a smarter investor and owner. Third, we can leverage our platform on a global scale, be it, for example, our leadership in sustainability, our expertise in digital transformation and AI, now with Motherbrain actually being more widely adopted across the platform and with Asia becoming truly global. And like EQT, BPEA is also performing well during these somewhat turbulent times in the world. So for these reasons, the client feedback around our combination with BPEA has been overwhelmingly positive, and we're really looking forward to the closing in Q4.\nFurthermore, with our position now, we have an opportunity to scale our strategies on a global basis, which I'll come to on the next page. Next slide, please. So with BPEA, EQT is going to be local with locals in 25 countries, covering around 80% of global GDP. And looking ahead, we have a long-term opportunities to scale all of our strategies now on a global basis. And to give a few examples of this, starting with real estate. We now have a team of over 60 people in Asia Pacific alone. And over time, we're going to build our real estate franchise in that region within logistics, multifamily and office, which means that we will have allowed all those 3 investment areas covered by real estate globally.\nIn Private Capital, we have a strong track record in North America now, and we have an opportunity to really expand our investment strategy in that region. And in Asia, of course, in addition to Private Capital, which BPEA brings, we've done now a number of infrastructure investments that are performing well, and our capabilities, they are only getting stronger with this combination. Of course, we also continue to grow organically with the platform and the expertise that we have in our business. So -- but nevertheless, we're going to continue to evaluate M&A opportunities to complement the franchise, whether it might be in specific regions or through adding thematic expertise. Near term, of course, we would primarily only consider smaller opportunities as we focus on making sure to maximize the potential and integration of our recent combinations.\nNext slide, please. So we're all facing a number of challenges in the world. For example, with inflation and higher rates of interest or the war in Ukraine, which, of course, beyond the tragic loss of life has also triggered a spike in energy prices and potential food shortages across the world. There are global social inequalities, and we have the climate emergency. So at EQT, where working continuously to adapt to these types of challenges, trying to find opportunities in those challenges and also managing our risks proactively. We're really seeking possibilities to make a positive impact and create returns for our clients through active ownership, through really building the company's investments that we make. And as a result of our thematic investment strategy, underlying portfolio company performance remains strong, as you've seen, and valuations also remain solid in our funds.\nEven within inflationary challenges, the combination of pricing power and productivity gains support earnings overall in our portfolio, and most of the sectors we invest in and still enjoy robust multiples. This also goes for real estate where we see stable valuations and in the themes we're investing behind and the types of assets we're investing in, a real inflation protection. Having said this, of course, we're also impacted by external factors and are following up all of our investments very, very closely.\nOn the exit side, it is now a little bit harder to find common ground between buyers and sellers. And even though the M&A market remains fairly active as seen in our exit of IFS and WorkWave, for example, the IPO market now is effectively closed. Historically, these kinds of IPO windows come and go. And in the meantime, we continue, of course, with driving value creation in those companies that are looking to go public. In our sectors, there's still robust interest, and we expect to continue to drive divestments this year across all of our business lines.\nSo how are we thinking about new investments in this market? Well, we're discussing these matters a lot, of course, in the global invested forum, and we're being highly selective. First of all, we renew our conviction in EQT's robust strategy of thematic investing. This is really about finding long-term societal needs and backing companies that can help accelerate those trends through our value-creation plans and future-proofing actions. Secondly, ensuring that we use our portfolio resources to drive full potential in each company, in each asset and truly integrating sustainable transformation into the core of every business and every asset.\nThirdly, ensuring sound capital structures designed not to maximize leverage but to support the value-creation plans, that's a have been our philosophy since day 1. Fourthly, remaining vigilant on risks to matters like gray swans. And what I mean by gray swans is things like the recent pandemic and the war in Ukraine, 2 examples that were known risks that I think we all could have been even better prepared for, but really starting to discuss those elements and making sure that our Boards and management teams are ready for external shocks.\nAlso, we're, of course, looking into demand costs in the value chains, pricing and cybersecurity, where we have a task force, an internal one that's highly capable, so we can really track what's happening out in all of our companies and all the portfolio companies and portfolios, so we can stay ahead of the curve. And looking more broadly, if we have our thematic investment strategy plus being local with locals in every country we invest in. So with that, our pipeline remains robust for the year. And one example of this is in the decarbonization and energy transition part of our investment strategy where we see a lot of investments that need to be accelerated in order to manage higher energy prices and also reducing a dependency on imports of energy.\nSo turning to the next page, kind of a case in point, we are really working to continuously raise the bar when it comes to our environmental ambitions. We were the first private market firm to set science-based targets last year and we now accelerate that reach net zero on all companies by 2040, which is 10 years earlier than required. More than 40 of our portfolio companies are already driving their formal action towards net zero and all our companies are obviously working on it and preparing it. In addition, we have new fund investments like Vinted, Covanta and Cypress Creek Renewables, demonstrating how we drive the environmental transition through either circularity, waste reduction or green energy generation -- green electricity generation.\nAnother interesting example is Formo, a company in EQT Ventures, which is developing animal-free dairy products, driving cutting-edge synthetic biology to become truly regenerative. Very interesting company. Another example is Oterra, which is leading the world in moving from synthetic food and colorings, which are unhealthy to natural colorings, which are much more healthy. So in total, we've recently invested more than EUR 10 billion in climate and environmental companies and assets, and we do this across various business lines rather than in a specific fund and thus, staying truly thematic. And with that, I hand over to Caspar.\n\nCaspar Callerström\n\nDeputy CEO & COO, EQT AB (publ)\n\nYes. Thank you. We've been busy when it comes to fundraising activities in Q1. And this will continue throughout the year. It's a quite crowded and competitive fundraising market out there with, I would say, most of our peers also raising flagship funds this year. And this also then coincides with the broader macro uncertainties that Chris talked about.\nWe expect continued strong momentum for well-established funds with strong track records such our flagship funds. For newer fund initiatives, it's likely that fundraising could take a little bit longer to complete. This year may also further accentuate the trend of clients concentrating commitments with fewer counterparties. Firms with strong performance and track records like EQT will stand to benefit. And I'm confident that we will come out significantly stronger relative to the market from this year.\nSpecifically, we set the hard cap for EQT X at EUR 21.5 billion last week and fundraising for EQT X will likely be materially down during 2022. But as expected, fundraising will continue into 2023 before we have the final close. In the first quarter, we also set the target fund sizes for EQT Ventures III and Active Core Infra, EQT Exeter Industrial Value VI. And we're continuing some of the fundraisings initiated last year, including EQT Future, EQT Growth and Exeter's force U.S. industrial core fund. So it's a busy fundraising schedule overall.\nAnd as you know, Exeter has typically various fundraisings ongoing in parallel. And on that note, we previously mentioned that EQT Exeter is expected to raise at least EUR 5 billion this year, and that number is likely to be meaningfully exceeded based on the current fundraising pipeline. When it comes to Infra VI, we have progressed the preparations and further calibrated timing versus other ongoing and fundraisings. And we will like to start fundraising for Infra VI in Q4 this year. Depending on the exact timing, we may book some commitments this year, but the bulk of the fundraising of Infra VI will likely take place in 2023.\nNext slide, please. We're continuously investing in the EQT platform, and we're attracting talent at a good pace. We always invest in higher head in order to secure future scalable growth and, of course, future returns for our clients. This page illustrates how we invest in new strategies, which initially have lower margins as we set up the investment teams and build a track record. Over time, we expect our emerging strategies to scale, which results in a material margin uplift for such strategy. The emerging strategies include growth, future and active core as an example. Looking at Exeter, we're actively recruiting as we build the investment organization across regions and strategies. And with BPEA, we expect to build the team once the combination closes, in order to broaden the thematic focus, strengthen the sustainability expertise and add new strategies in APAC over time.\nAnd with that, I'm handing back to Olof.\n\nOlof Svensson\n\nHead of Shareholder Relations, EQT AB (publ)\n\nThank you. Next slide, please. Thank you. In Q1, investment and exit activity continued, albeit at a slower pace compared to recent quarters. In total, we announced investments of EUR 3 billion and exits of EUR 2 billion. In terms of our key funds, EQT IX is now 75% to 80% invested, which is in line with the investment level at year-end and EQT Infrastructure V is 70% to 75% invested, up from 60% to 65% at year-end. Exit volumes have been in line with what we have expected for Q1. For example, EQT VIII sold a large part of its stakes in IFS and WorkWave. And exits made in the quarter have seen strong valuation levels. As we look ahead, we continue to plan for further realizations. However, as Christian mentioned, the IPO market is largely closed at the moment, and the high-yield market has also been more challenging as of late, although the leverage loan market remains open and constructive. These factors combined make the outlook for exits somewhat more uncertain in the near term.\nTurning to investments. Notable deals in Q1 include InstaVolt and Stockland. When it comes to the different business lines, we have a very active investment pipeline in infrastructure, for example. We expect investments in areas such as energy transition, including related technology to increase from here, for example. We also see continued high investment activity in real estate where the higher interest rate environment is being reflected in our acquisition underwriting.\nTurning to Private Capital. We are evaluating a number of potential private equity investments at the moment. Sources include divestments from corporates, private equity owned companies and potentially public companies. Valuations for EQT's core target sectors such as health care, tech remain high.\nIn the growth segment, in particular, we see a bid-ask spread between buyers and sellers, given the multiple contraction seen in public markets. As a result, this market may see a continued slower pace in near-term activity as we stay disciplined to find the right opportunities.\nIn Ventures, we see continued high activity levels and a somewhat more buyer-friendly market. As always, new investments are underwritten based on long-term multiple assumptions. As a result, exit multiples are often assumed to be below multiple paid at investments. And overall, as Christian mentioned, we remain focused on thematic opportunities where we invest with the trend in companies, which we expect to be resilient and perform well also in times of uncertainty.\nNext slide, please. Q1 valuations were resilient across our key thoughts. On a high level, there are a few different factors impacting valuations in Q1 positively and negatively. On the positive side, we continue to see robust and high valuations for thematic assets, both within Private Capital and real assets. These are exactly the types of companies and assets that EQT owns and invests in. Underlying operating performance in terms of sales growth and profit growth has also been strong, largely offsetting any effects of lower reference multiples in public markets. As previously mentioned, our focus on market-leading companies with pricing powers means a high ability to pass on price increases.\nIn real estate, current contracts are largely inflation protected and fund valuations have been stable. Whilst not a major driver of fund performance, we've had a couple of examples of companies which have seen muted performance due to COVID, now performing stronger. Exits this past quarter had a positive effect on valuations as well in, for example, EQT VIII. Generally, our conservative valuation approach means we, at times, experience uplifts in fund valuations when we secure strong exits.\nOn the negative side, the listed companies in the portfolio have seen share price declines. Listed companies are typically valued at the current share price in our fund valuations. All these elements come together in our robust valuations. Also adding, there is no change to our performance expectations. As previously communicated, EQT VII, EQT VIII, Infra III are all expected to deliver returns above plan. The other key funds remain on plan. Remember, the expectations reflect our estimates where the eventual fund performance will come out.\nAnd with that, I now hand over to Kim. Next slide, please.\n\nKim Henriksson\n\nCFO, EQT AB (publ)\n\nThank you, Olof, and good morning, everyone. Let's continue by having a look at the development in assets under management. In the last 12 months, AUM increased by 31% with Exeter contributing EUR 9 billion and LSP contributing with EUR 2.4 billion of AUM as of respective closing. In Q1, AUM increased by some 5%, partly driven by the addition of LSP. Remember, BPEA's AUM will not be part of the group's, and until the combination closes, which, as mentioned, is expected to occur in Q4. For reference, the BPEA AUM was about EUR 18 billion as of year-end. And looking ahead, we do expect AUM to grow this year as the various ongoing fundraises continue. But remember that when we activate a new fund, the AUM base in the previous fund generation steps down to invested capital. As Caspar mentioned, we expect a large part of EQT X to be raised this year, whereas the vast majority of Infra VI is likely to be raised in 2023.\nNext slide, please. As Chris mentioned, we're now over 1,300 employees. This includes having added almost 60 people from LSP and Bear Logi in the first quarter. And in addition, we expect to have the BPEA team joining us towards the end of the year, and we may see further complementary acquisitions during the year. We're also doing very well when it comes to recruiting, developing people and attracting strong talent globally. So as a result, we expect to be a significantly larger EQT team by year-end. Keep in mind that we're always investing ahead for future scalable growth. Hiring the right people at the right pace is critical to future-proofing growth as well as future-proofing the returns for our clients.\nNext slide, please. We recently raised 2 sustainability-linked bonds of EUR 750 million each. In addition, we have agreed to upsize the revolving credit facility from EUR 1 billion to EUR 1.5 billion to create additional flexibility. The proceeds from the bonds will be used to finance the cash portion of the combination with BPEA. And our strong balance sheet will then help support our growth and provide continued flexibility to follow our fund commitments, to support new growth initiatives and to selectively make acquisitions. Notwithstanding the opportunities we have, we expect to maintain a conservative leverage ratio of less than 1x net debt to EBITDA, and we have very significant liquidity. With that, I hand over to Christian to wrap it up.\n\nChristian Sinding\n\nCEO & Managing Partner, EQT AB (publ)\n\nThanks, Kim. Thank you. So we're continuing to build a global leader in active ownership strategies. The platform we're building provides multiple levers to grow and opportunities to become even more relevant for our clients. Our fund valuations have been resilient in Q1 based on strong underlying performance across our thematic assets, and we do expect our funds to continue to deliver for our clients. We recently committed our portfolio companies to achieving net zero by 2040, 10 years faster than required by climate science, and we think that's quite important also from a value creation point of view and being a responsible investor.\nNow it's been a somewhat slower quarter when it comes to investment in exit activity, but we're seeing really interesting opportunities ahead. And if you think about it in times of uncertainty, our active ownership focus and our thematic investment approach becomes even more relevant and may open up some new sources for deals like the public markets. We're proactively investing in people and in EQT's platform to really continue to drive scalable growth. And we're attracting really great talent, which, of course, is the best way to continue to secure our future performance and building a very strong firm.\nSo with that, we will now open up for questions. Thank you."

In 2021, we had the newest investment strategies, strengthening EQT's ability to support companies from emerging to mature. We acquired Exeter and LSP, and we strengthened EQT's operating platform. Importantly, we delivered on EQT's mission to create strong returns for EQT's fund investors, paced by a record amount of realizations.\nAs a result, EQT doubled revenues and nearly tripled EBITDA. We Together with Christian, Caspar and Kim, we will reflect on the past year, our strategy and how we continuously invest to future-proof EQT. As always, there will be a Q&A after the presentation. And in order to ask questions, you will need to be dialed into the conference line. And with that, I hand over to Christian. Next slide, please.\n\nChristian Sinding\n\nCEO & Managing Partner, EQT AB (publ)\n\nThank you, Olof, and good morning, everyone. It's been another engaging year, and performance has been strong across the EQT funds. As we stood here in January last year, we announced the acquisition of Exeter, and a lot has happened since. It's been really great to have Ward and his team on board and actually always, Exeter has performed better than what we expected, and more on this shortly.\nWe also look forward to joining forces with LSP, a leading European life sciences venture capital firm. With LSP, we've strengthened our capabilities in early stage health care and accelerate our leadership throughout the life cycle of companies in our largest sector, which is health care. Thus, we're replicating the ability to invest in tech from ventures through growth and into bios in long-term also in health care.\nLast year, we closed fundraising of Infrastructure V, and we also have the final pieces of EQT IX, both closed at their hard caps, and we launched the growth and the future fund fundraisings. This year, we expect to be even more active. So we already kicked off January by setting target sizes for EQT X yesterday, Ventures III and for our new strategy, EQT Active Core Infrastructure. In the last year, we have grown our capital raising team from about 50 to almost 85 people. We've also built a team to tap into private wealth channel, and we've invested into our digital client interface to support all these fundraisings.\n2021 was a year of high deal activity. We had a strong year when it comes to realizations, announcing EUR 30.7 billion worth of exits. So we're returning considerable amounts of capital to our clients. And our ability to realize companies at these strong returns, we believe, is a testimony of our thematic investment strategy and the effectiveness of our value-creation toolbox.\nAnd of course, the focus on portfolio construction and driving exits in our funds. Value creation was strong throughout the year and across strategies. For example, EQT VII and EQT VIII were both upgraded to above plan, and Infra III continues to develop above plan.\nWe are now 1,160 EQTarians globally. We continue to attract talent to support our growth journey. Meaning, we could see EQT approaching 1,400 FTE pluses this year, possibly even a little bit more. And as we're growing, of course, during this time of continued pandemic and travel restrictions, we've been focusing a lot on nurturing our culture.\nOne of the fun things we did was to come together in December for a virtual party, where we had breakfast party in the U.S., breakfast lunch in Europe -- sorry, a party lunch in Europe and a party dinner in Asia. And as you can hear from my voice, it was a bit corny, but it was a lot of fun. And we are really working hard on making sure that we have as much interaction and engagement with our great teams as possible to keep our unique culture going strong.\nImportantly, we also upped our strategic focus on sustainability as part of our purpose journey. EQT is the first private markets from the world set science-based targets. And I'm going to have more on this in a few minutes. Our growth in AUM and the strong fund performance resulted in EQT doubling revenues in 2021. And Kim will, of course, come back to that later in the presentation.\nEQT is solely focused on active ownership strategies. And why is this so fundamental for us? Well, because it's the foundation of our ability to create strong returns for our clients. Through active ownership, we actually transform companies. We implement a clear governance framework. We accelerate digitalization, future-proofing. We invest in people. We really work hard to make the companies more sustainable for the long term and more resilient. And in short, all of these actions help the companies and the assets become more valuable for the long term.\nSo the returns we're realizing today are the results of investments and value creation actions taken over a number of years. And we do call it future-proofing companies, as you know. We were early in areas such as digitalization and artificial intelligence and sustainability. We were really early to adopt a thematic investment approach to find the best companies and assets in the industries that we want to be in that are driven by long-term secular trends.\nHowever, with our ambition to be a thought leader, we need to continuously develop ourselves to stay ahead of the curve. So over the past year, we've broadened our strategies to build thematic expertise and, for example, life sciences. And we strengthened our ability to support companies at different stages from emerging companies all the way to mature, long-term ownership.\nAnd we're working with Motherbrain, our artificial intelligence unit, more deeply within the investment organization. And ultimately, actually, our goal is for her to have a seat on the investment committee. Having a listed share and a balance sheet has helped us accelerate growth be it through acquisitions or by supporting our new strategies with capital from our balance sheet. And we're going to continue to drive growth in the business through both of these initiatives going forward.\nBy investing in companies from emerging to mature, we become better at refining our thematic approach, identifying investment opportunities, identifying new talents, evaluating risk and sharing knowledge and best practices across companies at different stages of their development.\nSo for example, by adding EQT Growth, we bridge the gap between ventures and the more mature companies in private equity. And this combination has already proven really powerful with Bolt being a great example. EQT Ventures first invested in Bolt in 2016 and have supported the company to become 1 of the largest European tech companies and exits, actually. With this and with that proven business model that Ventures helped create, EQT Growth also invested in Bolt to help accelerate their expansion until their combination with DoorDash.\nWe acquired LSP for similar reasons to be able to support health care companies from early stage to mature companies and also to really strengthen our scientific expertise. In real estate, EQT Exeter strategy is similar: developing single properties, which are aggregated into portfolios, which can be owned by a third party, but also managed by EQT Exeter for the very long term.\nIn private capital and infrastructure, we're expanding our ability to own and transfer companies over the longer term. The recently activated EQT future are impact-driven, longer hold fund with a EUR 4 billion target size. And we just set the target size at EUR 5 billion for our new strategy, EQT Active Core Infrastructure.\nMore broadly, I'm actually quite confident that we will continue to see this trend of companies remaining private for longer. The EQT and our peers are driving this trend by being active owners and supporting companies at every stage of the development and also with strong capital bases.\nLooking overall at private markets, we expect the market to continue to grow at about 10% annually until 2030. This means more than $10 trillion of capital coming into our industry. This trend is driven by investors increasing their allocations to private markets. And why is that? Well, private equity, private market has now proven that it has outperformed globally over time.\nThere's also an increasing amount of capital in the world that is seeking outperformance and strong yields, stronger returns. A major trend is retail and private wealth with a lot of capital now being channeled into private markets. And as we seek to continue to outperform public market benchmarks, which we have since our inception, we're really excited to partner with our clients on this journey to continue to deliver outsized returns.\nNext, let me share some more details on LSP, the leading European life sciences venture capital firm. The transaction is expected to close this quarter. And we very much look forward to becoming -- to welcoming the team of 34 based in Amsterdam, Munich and Boston to the EQT family. It's a team with strong scientific knowledge and experience from investing in about 200 life sciences companies and generating excellent returns.\nWith LSP, we see a really interesting opportunity to support life sciences companies, primarily first in Europe with funding and expertise. But we really do expect LSP to also strengthen our overall health care platform globally. We're going to become even better at identifying themes and evaluating scientific risk across the health care spectrum and thus broadening the scope of investment opportunities within health care.\nAnd I'm really happy to say that this -- the feedback from clients has been very positive so far. This combination has strong merits for both LSP and for EQT. And maybe most importantly, we have great cooperation with Rene and his team already.\nNow to Exeter. It's been a real joy to work with Exeter team for almost a year now. We closed the transaction in April. The collaboration has been super, and Exeter is actually outperforming on all metrics. Prior to teaming up with EQT, Exeter had grown AUM revenues and EBITDA by about 25% annually over the last 3 years.\nIn the last year, Exeter accelerated its growth journey. AUM grew by about 50%, while exit activity was strong. Revenues grew by about 45%, and EBITDA grew by 55%. So a great performance.\nEQT Exeter has delivered some quite impressive realizations over the last year, including a USD 6.8 billion industrial portfolio sale. This was really active ownership in future proofing at its best. We raised occupancy from 55% to 95%, and 22 million square feet of newly constructed properties were equipped with the newest renewable design features in the industry.\nPerformance remains tough, with Preqin, for example, recognizing EQT Exeter as being a consistent top performer across vintages over time. We have, of course, continued to add talent in order to grow EQT Exeter's footprint with 300 people now being part of that superb team. And as you know, being local and local at EQT and even more so at Exeter is a key advantage to finding the best investment opportunities.\nSo the EQT funds have performed strongly in 2021. We've returned a record amount of capital to our clients after realizations of EUR 30.7 billion. This is the result of having created future-proof companies, companies which are more valuable and which we realize and then pass on to new responsible owners.\nLooking more broadly, different sources of capital are looking to buy these kinds of thematic assets that we are owning. This means that there's great demand for the assets when we realize and make exits. But of course, it also means the competition for these companies and assets are as high, and that's been the case for a long time.\nSo to future-proof returns, we continuously develop our value-creation toolbox and our future proofing capabilities. trying to find companies and assets where we can add value to the business. and where the price today is not the determining factor for the future return. We have active ownership strategies, and that's how we create that return.\nOne great example is IVC Evidencia, where we've fivefolded revenues, we made over 600 acquisitions, and we've added 1,500 new clinics to the platform. And that is the kind of active ownership that we like to see, where we buy a great platform and then we build on to it the best we can with all of our talent at EQT, with the superb Boards and management teams.\nTalking about people, we, of course, are working to attract the best talent, so we can continue to add value in creative ways. And thus, we also invest in the EQT platform to support our deals and companies with everything that is needed behind the scenes, our teams can really focus on making investments and adding value. Let me therefore next share some perspectives on how we strive to stay ahead of the curve.\nRight now, the most integral pillars to future-proof ourselves and our portfolio of companies are digitalization, AI and sustainability. Let me first focus on sustainability.\nWe're convinced that sustainable companies attract the best talent, we'll have the best relationships with regulators, the most attractive customers and the best placed in the value chain over time. Sustainable companies are going to be more resilient and more relevant. And therefore, ultimately, we're convinced that we see now in our portfolio that are going to be the most valuable. This philosophy could call a stakeholder capitalism. It's simply good business.\nAnd like my predecessor Thomas said, we are in the business of good business. At EQT level, we took incremental steps last year to ensure we're working with all stakeholders. We were the first private equity firm in the world to issue a sustainability-linked bond at the EQT AB level. And we became the first private equity firm in the world to set science-based targets and demand that our companies in the portfolio also set science-based units.\nAnd I'm super pleased to have Bahar Agenus, EQT's Head of Sustainable Transformation, now being a part of EQT's Executive Committee, further strengthening EQT's strategic focus on this important area of sustainability and purpose. We also continue to integrate sustainability expertise into our investment organization. Sustainability is no longer a separate corporate function. It's really being truly integrated into the entire investment life cycle of all of our portfolio of companies, and lots of initiatives are underway.\nWe're, for example, strengthening EQT's data engine to drive transparency and accountability and measurement. And after setting the science-based targets, maybe more importantly, we're setting out our ambition levels for the next decade, and we'll come back to that later this year. These elements are all connected to driving long-term performance for our clients by transforming companies to make them more valuable for the long term.\nFor the EQT funds, there's a huge investment opportunity ahead. But as you know, society faces a number of long-term challenges, be it in terms of the aging population, an equality of opportunity or the climate emergency that we're in. But to solve the global challenges such as these, capital and new solutions will be required.\nBeing a purpose-driven investor and owner, we're confident that EQT has a strong foundation to just transform industries to tackle these problems, like you see across many of our investments across our funds. In clearly maybe but in particular, right now, infrastructure both in how we're transforming the student bus industry in the U.S. and how we're transforming the ferry industry in Scandinavia. In fact, I believe that private markets has the opportunity and the obligation to really make a difference. We have the governance model, the capital, the time to really be able to drive that positive change as needed in the world.\nAnd EQT's new strategy to the future is one way for you could accelerate that impact agenda and the same with EQT Active Infrastructure. Now all of EQT funds are invested based on our purpose, to future-proof companies and make a positive impact. And with EQT Future, again, we really set out to challenge ourselves and to raise the bar for all of our strategies and testing new concepts such as carry that's linked to ESG goals, all in order to secure again long-term returns for our clients.\nNow on the other hand, for several years or for many years now, we've invested in digital transformation to support our investment core. We've built an in-house team of digital natives to work alongside and together actually with investment professionals in due diligence and value creation and with the companies.\nSecond, to accelerate, improve accuracy of decision-making across all aspects of investing, we've developed this Motherbrain AI platform and have built -- when we built a team of super strong data scientists and data engineers that are also working in a really integrated way with the investment teams. And these early investments have been paying off since and strongly contribute to our current performance and resilience, but we'll do so even more in the future.\nToday, fully integrated, EQT Digital systematically engages across all of our investment strategies, although we can continue to do a lot more. So we're actually in a great place. But like I said, we continue to stay paranoid and work hard to stay ahead of the curve. But during 2021, we established a dedicated in-house cybersecurity center of excellence to reinforce our efforts and portfolio resilience.\nMotherbrain has also added emphasis on supporting portfolio of companies and identifying add-on acquisitions, for example, in Getec. And she has so far supported EQT Ventures in identifying 14 new investments, and Motherbrain is then being rolled out across the EQT platform with use cases depending on fund strategy and a common core to ensure that we really, over time, create one easily accessible EQT corporate memory and corporate intelligence.\nAlso, we're measuring how we take decisions in Motherbrain to help us sharpen the pencil on our own decision-making in our investment communities. Super exciting developments, I must say.\nSo with that, I'd like to hand over to my colleague, Caspar, who will talk more about future proofing regarding the EQT platform. Caspar?\n\nCaspar Callerström\n\nDeputy CEO & COO, EQT AB (publ)\n\nThank you, Chris. We have 3 strategic priorities for EQT's operating platform. First, we are investing in talent to support our growth drivers. Over the past year, we've added great people across capital raising, technology, sustainability and operations. And we're further strengthening the EQT Academy, our in-house training program, and we're also developing our platforms for talent management.\nThe objective is clear. We will continue to invest in our ability to attract, retain and develop the best talent. Second, we continuously invest to improve the client journey. We recently launched a new investor portal, and we're trying hard to make it easier for our clients to gain access to data and simplifying the fundraising process for our clients. This is particularly important in a year like this, when our clients will be busy with a very active fundraising pipeline across private markets.\nThird, we continue to build EQT's platform for scalable growth. As mentioned, this means adding talent, but also developing our organization structure and establishing even more efficient data management tools, for example. We now have about 730 clients globally, up from 150 a year ago.\nThe commitments that we have from North American clients represent now about 30% of commitments, partly driven by the addition of clients from Exeter. Our capital teams are expanding with stronger local presence across Europe, APAC and the U.S.\nOver the past year, our capital raising team increased from about 50 people to almost 85 people, a significant increase in investment. We're also strengthening EQT's focus on private wealth clients. Our products are now distributed through more private wealth platforms. And remember, EQT is not structuring investment solutions. That's not really our core. We instead work with private wealth managers and servicing their clients, offering them our products in partnership with us.\nAnd the private wealth landscape is evolving, and we are in active dialogue with various distribution platforms to explore new ways to broaden access to alternative investments in general. Next slide, please.\n2022 will be very active when it comes to fundraising. We continue to raise EQT Future, EQT Growth and EQT Exeter's fourth U.S. industrial core fund. We've just set the target fund size for EQT X at EUR 20 billion, and Ventures 3 at EUR 900 million. The target size for EQT's new infrastructure fund, Active Core Infrastructure, was set at EUR 5 billion.\nSimilar to EQT future, EQT Active Core Infrastructure will have a longer hold structure and initially charge fees based on invested capital rather than uncommitted. This means that management fees will ramp up as the fund deploys capital and not in fundraising. Fundraising of EQT X could follow a broadly similar time line as EQT IX did. Fundraising will likely be materially done during 2022. But certainly, it will certainly continue into 2023 before we have a final close.\nEquity Infrastructure V is now 60% to 65% invested, and we're making preparations for Infrastructure VI. As previously stated, we will not be fundraising the flagship funds in parallel in their active phases. It is more likely that we will follow a similar sequencing as we did when it came to the fundraising of EQT IX and Infra V, where Infra V was launched when the active part of the EQT IX fundraise was materially concluded.\nAs previously mentioned, we continue to strengthen our position in APAC, hiring leaders in both Japan and South Korea over the past months across Infra, PE and real estate. However, we have decided to prioritize other near-term fundraises.\nLooking ahead, we see opportunities to expand the investment strategies within health care, as Chris mentioned, to support, for example, growth stage companies in a similar way that we do with growth within tech. We also continue to selectively evaluate M&A opportunities to strengthen our products or geographical presence. The bar, as mentioned before, for any acquisition is high, and we stay focused on culture, performance and our vision on being the most reputable investor and owner.\nBefore handing over to Olof, let me briefly comment on the ongoing review by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority as of today with regards on how we handle the information in relation to the lockup revision and related sale of partner-owned shares back in September.\nWe continue to be of the view that we acted correctly. We have leading Swedish law firms advising us throughout the process, and we have subsequently obtained a second opinion from another leading Swedish law firm supporting that view as well. In addition, we've engaged 2 separate leading international experts on the EU market abuse regulation, the MAR. And they have both made their assessments, and their conclusions also support our view.\nRegardless, we are fully collaborating with the SFSA and will await their final decision. If and when we have anything further to communicate on this matter, we will provide an update. Active dialogue with distribution platforms to explore, yes.\nOkay. Thank you. And with that, I leave over to you, Olof.\n\nOlof Svensson\n\nHead of Shareholder Relations, EQT AB (publ)\n\nThank you, Caspar. Deployment continued at a good pace throughout 2021. We signed investments of just over EUR 20 billion, of which EUR 13 billion related to the second half of the year. Deployment over the year was evenly distributed between private capital and real assets at about EUR 10 billion per segment.\nIn terms of our key funds, EQT IX is now 75% to 80% invested, up from 65% to 70% in our Q3 update. Notable investments in the last quarter included surpass, CPC and 3 shape. Looking at Infra V, it's now 60% to 65% invested, as Caspar mentioned, and that's in line with the deployment level in our Q3 update.\nAfter a busy Q3, the main investment announced in Infra V during Q4 was the acquisition of Icon Group. In addition to the EUR 20 billion of investments announced in 2021, our clients deployed another about EUR 9 billion through co-investments with us over the past year. As Christian mentioned, we continue to make investments where sustainability is an important value driver. And to highlight a few examples, EQT Ventures is backing Iron Ride, specializing in electric and self-driving trucks. EQT IX acquired Think Project, providing software to help produce waste in the building sector.\nAnd in our Infrastructure segment, decarbonization and electrification was a key theme, as Chris mentioned, in recent investments such as First Student, Most Line and Torget. Over the past year, we realized assets of EUR 30.7 billion.\nIn private capital, EQT VI is now fully realized, and it will be removed from our key funds from Q1 and onwards. More than half of the current value of EQT VII has been realized, and we have selectively started to realize assets in EQT IX -- co VIII, sorry. This means our private capital team has ample capacity to continue to drive investments at a good pace in more recent funds and value creation in the existing portfolio companies.\nIn real assets, almost 90% of the current value of Infrastructure II has been realized. In Q4, Infrastructure III announced the sale of Getec and Phoenix Marine, and we expect Infra realizations to continue in 2022. Similarly, the drive for exits means that the smaller size of the portfolio enables us to continue to develop companies and make new investments at a reasonable pace. And as Christian already mentioned, EQT Exeter, of course, had some large recent portfolio sets.\nNext slide, please. Value creation across our key funds continued to develop well throughout 2021. As previously noted, EQT VII, EQT VIII and Infra III are all expected to deliver returns above plan. Notably, EQT VIII saw a valuation uplift from 1.4x gross mark to 2.6x over the past year. Companies across the portfolio have performed strongly this year, and the fund has had a few exits, including some IPOs.\nListed holdings are booked at market value in our quarterly fund valuations. EQT VIII being a 2018 fund will be active for a few years still. As such, we stay focused on developing companies rather than the short-term market moves we see in listed holders.\nThe valuation of Infrastructure III increased from 1.8x to 2.6x over the past year, and this was partly driven by strong realizations towards the end of the year with something in a meaningful value uplift. As EQT funds have actively been exiting assets. They have a relatively young portfolio of companies, which have all been sourced with a strict thematic focus. And with a healthy portfolio, investment teams can largely focus on sourcing new investments and driving value creation across portfolio companies.\nMarket values remain high, and we continue to be very focused on companies which are supported by strong secular growth trends. Our firms invest in companies with leading market positions and pricing power and in downside protected businesses with high cash conversion. We're also remaining disciplined when it comes to leverage levels, targeting what is best for the business and its value creation plan rather than maximizing total leverage.\nTo put this in context, when we analyze the value drivers for our past exits, about 3/4 of value creation was driven by sales growth and margin expansion in our private capital segment. In other words, it's how we develop the companies over time and over cycles which that matters the most not leverage. Portfolio construction is important, and we maintain well-diversified Fox with deal flow continuing to be strong across sectors and geographies we stay selective. And with that, I'll hand over to Kim.\n\nKim Henriksson\n\nCFO, EQT AB (publ)\n\nThank you, Olof, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to look back at a year of record performance in all areas. The full effect of EQT IX and the Infrastructure V, as well as the addition of Exeter, led to a strong uplift in management fees.\nIn addition, the strong performance resulted in significant carry recognition. So combined, this meant revenues doubling and EBITDA nearly tripling as the business scales. Let me first focus on AUM, which increased by 40% during 2021, mainly driven by EQT Exeter adding about 9 billion in AUM as the acquisition closed on April 1, and with another more than EUR 6 billion of gross inflows since closing. And with some sizable, successful realizations this year, Exeter is today at about EUR 12.5 billion of AUM.\nSecondly, on EQT Infrastructure V. The fund had its final close at EUR 15.7 billion in AUM with about half of the fund commitments being attributed to 2021. And EQT IX held its final close at EUR 15.6 billion in April, with about EUR 1.6 billion of that -- those commitments being closed out in 2021. As you know, the AUM base is reduced with the cost of investments as the fund exits holdings, so amounting to about EUR 8 billion last year. But remember that some of the recently announced exits have not yet closed and are therefore still included in our AUM numbers.\nAs we think about 2022, we expect a meaningful uplift in AUM based on the various fund raises, which have been initiated, as Caspar outlined earlier. There are a couple of technical aspects to keep in mind.\nFirst, in our H1 '22 numbers, only closed out commitments from the ongoing fundraises will be included in AUM and thus in the management fee number for H1. Secondly, when we activate a new fund generation, the previous fund generation generally reduces the AUM base to invested capital. And thirdly, all clients regardless of when they commit to a new fund, they pay fees from the fund starting date.\nNext slide, please. So revenues more than doubled in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributed to the management fees from Infrastructure V and EQT IX as well as the combination with Exeter and the carried interest from Equity VIII and VII. So 1/3 of revenues in 2021 were attributed to carried interest and investment income, of which investment income was some EUR 73 million.\nAs a reminder, investment income is a function of the changes in fund valuations. Currently, EQT's fund investments stand at just shy of EUR 0.5 billion. Our platform is scalable. And whilst we grew expenses meaningfully in 2021, our EBITDA margin widened to 68%. The retroactive fees, as we call them, late fees, did increase the margin somewhat approximately 2 percentage points for the year.\nNote that Exeter's financials were only included for during 9 months of 2021. Exeter contributed to revenue with EUR 134 million and EUR 86 million of EBITDA during the 9 months of our ownership. For Exeter's full year numbers in 2021, you can add another approximately EUR 30 million to revenues and EUR 50 million to EBITDA. Next slide, please.\nIn 2021, we added about 450 people, of which approximately 300 related to Exeter. We're growing across the board, including in areas such as client relations and capital raising, digital and fund operations. We also added colleagues across EQT's investment strategies, including our new strategies.\nThe '21 personnel expenses do not show the full effect of this FTE increase with many joiners only having been with us for part of the year. And we continue to actively hire to support our growth agenda. And as Christian mentioned, we could see EQT having towards 1,400 FTE plus at the end of the year or possibly more.\nFrom LSP, for example, we expect 34 people to join, and they will also be growing their organization during 2022. By adding people across the platform, we continuously invest ahead to support our AUM growth and to have the right resources to continue to drive investments and returns across our investment strategies. As we look ahead, we will likely continue to have about 2/3 of our cost base relating to personnel expenses, and about half of our personnel cost is generally variable. In a year like '21, where performance is very strong across the board, incentive compensation is higher as we look to reward our global teams. Next slide, please.\n2021 has been a very strong year, but we remain vigilant. Inflation has picked up, and interest rates may be on the rise. As Olof described earlier, our funds are well positioned with portfolio of companies backed by secular growth trends, and we have well-performing funds.\nOur business is to transform companies, and this is the primary driver of the returns, not leverage, for example. So whilst we think our portfolio would be resilient in a downturn, we would surely be affected if we were to see a sustained deterioration in the economy and markets. And let me recap what we would expect in such a scenario.\nWe'd expect the activity levels would go down, which in turn means we could revert to more normal fund cycles. Our management fees are stable and contractually recurring. But if realizations go down, it could take longer to realize carried interest. And if funds were to be marked at lower valuations, this would be reflected in our investment income. We do control a meaningful part of our costs, and thus, we would expect our cost base to grow at a slower pace in such a scenario. Next slide, please.\nLet's wrap up by looking at our financial targets. As stated at the IPO 2 years ago, we expected an EBITDA margin of between 55% and 65% over the medium term. And the targets should be viewed over a cycle. And we think the range is still a reasonable indication of where we expect margins to be over the mid- to long term.\nIn years with great performance and does carry recognition, we would expect to be at the upper end of such range or even above. Indicatively, we have also said that over time, the share of carried interest and investment income is expected to be between 25% to 30% of total revenues. Carry and investment income corresponded to 33% of total revenues in 2021. But as always, it's important to look at carry on a long-term basis over the lifetime of the funds. Remember that carry is 20% of all profits in a fund. So when a fund goes from 2x to 3x, that doubles the amount of carry generated.\nWe've stated that our ambition is to generate a steadily increasing dividend in absolute euro-denominated terms. And we continue to see opportunities for growth. And with a strong balance sheet, we retain the flexibility to support new initiatives with capital to follow our fund commitments and to make add-on acquisitions.\nThe Board of Directors has proposed a dividend per share of SEK 2.80 to be paid in 2 installments. And with that, I'll say thank you, and we will now open up for questions."

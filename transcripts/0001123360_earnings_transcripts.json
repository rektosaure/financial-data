[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference will be recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Nate Rozof. Please go ahead.\n\nNathan A. Rozof\n\nEVP, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Welcome to Global Payments Third Quarter 2025 Conference Call. My name is Nate Rozof, and I'm Head of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call is our CEO, Cameron Brady; our President and COO, Bob Cortopassi; and our CFO, Josh Whipple.\nOur earnings release and the slides that accompany this call can be found on the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpayments.com. I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made during today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements, including expected operating and financial results, among other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For additional information on these factors, please refer to our press release and filings with the SEC.\nWe caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update them. We will be referring to several non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance. For a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to the most comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC regulations, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and other supplemental material available on the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Cameron Bready. Cameron?\n\nCameron M. Bready\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nate, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to deliver third quarter adjusted results that accelerated sequentially across our key financial metrics. Our team continues to execute at a high level, driving growth and efficiency across the business as we advance our transformation program. Importantly, our year-to-date performance positions us well to deliver on our expectations for the full year, and we are building positive momentum as we prepare for the closing of the Worldpay acquisition. .\nTo that end, we recently received approval for our acquisition of Worldpay from the Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K., which is a critical regulatory milestone. Given the strong progress we have made with the regulatory approval process, we now expect to close our acquisition of Worldpay and divestiture of Issuer Solutions in the first quarter of 2026. Naturally, our teams are eager to complete the Worldpay transaction and begin unlocking the compelling opportunities it presents, including accelerating our strategy to transform Global Payments into a pure-play merchant solutions provider with sustainable growth, leading scale, focused investments and meaningful value creation.\nWe are also pleased to have closed the divestiture of our payroll business in September, further simplifying our business and allowing us to return an incremental $500 million of capital to shareholders during the third quarter through an accelerated share repurchase program. Lastly, before turning to the quarter, I am happy to announce that we partnered with Google to enable Agentic Commerce using the Agent Payments protocol. It will enable us to provide secure, reliable and interoperable agent commerce for our customers and partners.\nWe are helping our customers and partners to successfully enter this emerging commerce channel by building bridges between protocols to enable our merchants to access all agentic payment types. With this and other agent AI frameworks, we are also developing the authentication layer that is necessary to verify that AI agents are legitimate to maximize authorization rates and thus maximize revenue for our customers.\nFor the quarter, we reported 6% constant currency adjusted net revenue growth, excluding dispositions, 110 basis points of margin expansion and 11% constant currency adjusted EPS growth compared to the same period last year. We also produced adjusted free cash flow of $784 million in the quarter, allowing us to end the quarter at 2.9x adjusted net leverage below the 3x target we had committed to and earlier than the year-end date we had previously anticipated.\nOur merchant business exhibited ongoing momentum with adjusted net revenue growth accelerating to 6% constant currency, excluding dispositions as we continue to execute across the three pillars of our strategy. First, in POS and software, our strategic priority remains on the development and rollout of Genius. Consistent with our focus on front book opportunities, currently more than 90% of Genius sales are to new customers. In the markets where we have launched Genius, sales to new locations increased by more than 20% year-over-year during the third quarter, with new sales ramping nicely throughout the quarter. In fact, monthly recurring revenue from new sales increased 75% from June to September and the average deal size more than doubled. This rapid uplift in new sales demonstrates how well Genius is resonating in the market.\nGenius is an incredibly robust business software platform that is architected to be highly modular, configurable, scalable and extensible. As we talk about Genius today and in the future, you will hear us highlight our support across multiple form factors for mobile phone applications to specialized handheld devices, all the way up to our unique countertop, kiosks, digital menu board and kitchen management devices. We will also discuss vertically targeted configurations supporting retail, restaurants, campuses, field services, professional services, age restricted and more. We may also comment on go-to-market bundles of specific feature functionality to assist customers with diverse needs at multiple price points designed to allow us to specifically tailor our offerings to meet customers how and where they want to be met.\nWith all the impact we are driving across the world with Genius, it is important to understand that this is still one Genius platform. We are unlocking capabilities, geographies, configurations and pricing bundles. We are not launching new discrete products or platforms. To that end, having successfully introduced Genius for the restaurant and retail verticals during the second quarter, which are primarily targeted at SMBs, I'm happy to share that we expanded Genius' feature set to support enterprise businesses in September and higher education institutions in October. Genius' enterprise offering provide a unified modern and modular commerce enablement solution designed to meet the complex needs of multi-location, quick-serve and fast casual restaurants, sports and entertainment venues and food service management environment for enterprise customers.\nOn the heels of this launch, we were pleased to be selected by Harris Blitzer Sports and Entertainment to be the official payment technology provider for the Prudential Center and the New Jersey Devils. We will integrate Genius across all food and beverage locations for the Prudential Center, helping to optimize how fans place, pay for and receive their orders across the venue while optimizing back-end operations. While it's still very early for Genius in the enterprise space, we have also already been selected by franchisees of several leading QSR brands to deploy Genius across more than 400 locations.\nOur expansion of Genius functionality for higher education is ideally suited for a range of campus use cases, including on-campus merchants, dining halls, recreational facilities, departments and clubs, stadiums and more. Many universities do not have the necessary digital payments infrastructure to support their move away from cash and check. Genius fills that gap with easy-to-use commerce enablement solutions, including campus-wide payment acceptance capabilities and reconciliation. It drives commerce and simplifies back-end processes by centralizing transaction visibility while maximizing revenue streams, minimizing staff time and streamlining compliance.\nIn terms of new form factors, we recently launched our new handheld device for Genius. It features an advanced 6.5-inch high-definition touchscreen, seamless connectivity across WiFi, Bluetooth and 5G, and an upgraded processor that speeds performance. Demonstrating the power of Genius' highly modular and configurable platform, I'm pleased to share that the University of Illinois selected Genius, and we use our new mobile form factor across revenue centers campus-wide.\nAfter geographic expansion, in addition to offering Genius across North America and the U.S., Canada and Mexico, we recently launched in the U.K. and Austria. And our first enterprise win in the U.K. came within days of our launch with the restaurant chain in Glasgow that has ambitious expansion plans.\nBefore the end of the year, we still expect to introduce Genius in Germany. In early 2026, we will also bring it to Ireland and the Czech Republic, followed by Spain, Romania, Poland and Australia. Lastly, we are actively deploying Genius through all of our distribution channels to help drive penetration across the entirety of our front book.\nIn addition to our large direct sales force, we recently launched Genius in our dealer VAR financial institution and ISO channels. The feedback from our partners in these channels has been resoundingly positive. Our digital menu boards and new handheld devices, particularly resonated with our dealers, and our loyalty solution is highly regarded across our partner channels. It is encouraging to see the ramping of new sales and all of our distribution partners invigorated by Genius. In addition to our success with Genius, we have several notable wins across other software businesses, including Alterra Mountain Company, Oakwood University and Stillwater Public Schools.\nTurning to our Integrated and Embedded business. We had another outstanding quarter for partner signings with nearly 60 new partners added globally. To continue to drive partner wins, we are investing in our developer experience, including launching easy-to-use tools, modernized documentation and a unified API platform that makes it easier to integrate and deploy our services. In addition, we are excited to have expanded our long-standing partnership with PayPal, continuing to leverage our technology footprint across North America, Europe, the U.K. and Asia Pacific. This multiyear partnership also expands our relationship into the U.S. market and paves the way for global expansion into new verticals, creating significant opportunity for volume growth with PayPal.\nAs part of our transformation program and sales effectiveness initiatives, we are expanding our distribution for this channel, which has historically been solely served by an inside sales rep team by adding a dedicated outside sales force and enabling integrated referrals to all of our direct sales teams. With the addition of a field sales force targeted towards integrated opportunities, we expect to increase our win rate in complex verticals like automotive, health care, dental and veterinarian where clients continue to prefer to have face-to-face interaction. We also expect this to be a point of differentiation as we compete for new partners going forward.\nAs for our core payments business, we achieved several notable wins in high-growth geographies, including Max K convenience stores in Chile, Moovio Railways in Poland, Airlines in Greece, and La Meridian Kaula Lampur in Malaysia. In North America, we renewed Verizon Wireless and the State of Illinois extended our relationship for a new 10-year term. United Petroleum was a notable win in Canada, and we are expanding into nearly 200 Pizza Hut locations across Mexico.\nI'm also excited to share that we launched our new merchant dashboard that facilitates cross-selling and value-added services. We built and deployed a modular and open dashboard that allows for a common interface supporting multiple client personas to customize the experience of delivering critical data and KPIs, generative AI data discovery interface, access to our robust client experience, engagement and loyalty components, and the ability to purchase and interact with a rich suite of personalized commerce enablement services and embedded finance tools. These modern and robust points of interaction deliver the capabilities and experiences that our clients and partners desire and expect.\nTurning to Issuer Solutions. We again saw accelerating sequential trends with revenue growth increasing to 5% on a constant currency basis this quarter. This was largely driven by continued growth in accounts on file and stable underlying transaction volume trends as well as strong project-related revenue. We recently renewed our partnership with Avancia, a leading European digital bank and OLV, a leading bank in the German market. We also signed new agreement with Elanza Bankia in BrendisGard and continue to have a solid pipeline of new business that extends into 2027.\nFurther, we remain on track with our cloud modernization program and moved two more products into production this quarter. We are on schedule with our modernized efforts and expect to make all customer-facing applications commercially available by year-end.\nAs I noted in my opening comments, we continue to make great strides on our transformation journey as we streamline Global Payments into a single unified operating company worldwide. At the core of this effort is investment in our technology strategy to unify our capabilities and expose them ubiquitously to customers around the globe. To facilitate this, we have architected a single-end single-app customer and partner experience, leveraging modern API environment, complemented by AI systems to integrate and consume our services.\nWith the orchestration platform capabilities we have discussed in prior quarters, we're enabling the single-in, single-out experience across all of our platforms in all of our geographies on an omnichannel basis. This strategy and architecture allows us to deliver the modern customer experience at clients' demand and insulate them from the complexity of our processing environments, while providing us with the ability to simplify our infrastructure by technologies at a more measured pace without a material impact to our customers and partners.\nFor example, this approach has already facilitated our EVO integration by supporting all net new volume and enabling us to migrate clients away from EVO's 7 legacy gateways with minimal client impact. Notably, Worldpay is on a similar journey of using orchestration to enable technology and systems consolidation. Our strategy is to align our orchestration capabilities, which gives us confidence in our ability to integrate and consolidate our technology stacks, unlocking more value and growth more quickly than we could have in the past.\nIn addition to enabling cost savings and margin expansion through infrastructure consolidation, our modern orchestration layer also enables us to distribute products more easily across multiple geographies. This accelerates our pace of innovation, making us more nimble and improves our speed to market. With our API environment and the new dashboard I referenced earlier, this architecture works in harmony to deliver our holistic single-in and single-out vision.\nTo further accelerate product development, we have also aligned our teams around a new product operating model, a foundational shift in how product and technology come together to solve customer challenges at Global Payments. We are already seeing tangible benefits, faster execution, tighter alignment to our priorities and meaningful reductions in churn and waste as well as accelerated delivery of new capabilities. Our Genius rollout is a prime example of this.\nFurther, we're embracing artificial intelligence to improve the productivity of our engineering teams and the experiences of our customers. So far, our teams have used AI to generate nearly 1 million lines of code, saving tens of thousands of hours of manual coding time. AI assisted coding is also reducing defects, which is accelerating testing and integration cycles. Overall, the integration of AI is enhancing our end-to-end product development life cycle by enabling faster innovation and improved velocity across our technology portfolio. The power of AI is often dictated by the availability of data to train it. Once we combine with Worldpay, we will process nearly $4 trillion in annual volume across 100 billion transactions and serve millions of merchants and thousands of platforms and software partners. That scale of payments data will help us unlock AI-powered insights for our customers as their trusted partner. For example, we will be able to provide our customers with access to fraud tools, predictive inventory analysis, dynamic pricing models and churn risk analytics, all based on detailed transactional data and delivered in real time.\nIn addition to the investments we're making in our product and technology environments, we're also investing meaningfully to transform our sales force, which is obviously our primary point of contact with many of our customers. As we previously discussed, during the first half of the year, we transitioned our sellers from our 94 compensation plan, which was 100% commission-based structure to a new compensation program that incorporates base pay plus commissions. This change yields multiple benefits for us. First, it enables us to incentivize solution-based selling, which is critical when we are introducing new solutions like Genius, and 100% commission-based plan, sellers will often take a wait-and-see approach to new products, preferring to take the past of least resistance to closing a new sale. Under our new plan, we have targeted our strategic commerce enablement solutions in addition to overall sales quotas.\nThis model also makes it much easier for us to hire strong experienced sellers. As we continue to focus on selling more software and commerce enablement solutions, this structure is more consistent with the market for software sellers, allowing us to attract the right talent to sell our capabilities. With this new structure in place and the early proven results, we are expanding the size of our sales force to improve our engagement in the market. Today, we are actively recruiting for 500 additional field sellers in North America.\nWe have also deployed a consistent sales methodology across our sales force, which improves the portability of new leads across channels and the customer experience. This lead portability is facilitated by the last key pillar of our sales transformation, unifying the technology that enables it.\nWe have mentioned in the past that we are consolidating our CRM systems, which is a critical enabler to passing leads between sales channels and harmonizes how we get to market. Now sales professionals from different channels can see the lead in its entire history through the same CRM system. This also allows for a greater ability to manage the overall inventory leads we receive, recycle unsuccessful leads and ensure that no lead is left behind in our environment.\nWe are also deploying sales intelligence tools to automate pipeline management as well as AI agents to summarize our sales call in real time and document any need to follow up. While it's still early, our new sales methodology and compensation programs are increasing deal count and size. Overall, we are seeing double-digit increases in signed annual revenue per deal and mid-single-digit increases in deal count. We're also seeing speed to first deal increase with our earliest adopting channel improving by almost 40%. Lastly, we've seen attrition in new hires in the first 90 days improved meaningfully. For example, the first sales group to move to this new plan has seen more than a 50% reduction of new hire attrition since adoption.\nOur transformation will be catalyzed by the acquisition of Worldpay and simultaneous divestiture of our Issuer Solutions business, positioning Global Payments as a pure-play merchant solutions provider. With the transactions expected to close during the first quarter of 2026, integration planning for Worldpay is well underway with all critical milestones established. Our disciplined approach will ensure alignment with our operating model and drive value creation. Our integration strategy focuses on accelerating growth, enhancing competitiveness, realizing synergies and investing in innovation while unifying under a single brand and leveraging top talent from both organizations.\nThrough our integration, we are striving to be a better version of the companies we have been until now, not just the larger one, one that maximizes scales and prioritizes growth to ensure lasting results for our customers, our shareholders and our team members. And we will do this by leveraging our unmatched global scale, processing nearly $4 trillion annually across 100 billion transactions and a complementary set of capabilities that strengthen our value proposition. Together, we will expand distribution, enhance our product suite and scale innovation.\nOur North Star for integration is growth, growth in M&A from an unrelenting focus on the needs of our customers. This incremental growth will be driven by a number of actionable opportunities that leverage the strength of the combined business. For example, we will immediately begin selling Genius and other software solutions into Worldpay's SMB base, while using their channels to broaden reach. Further, Worldpay's Payrix platform and PayFac capabilities will deepen our support for software partners and platforms. Their enterprise and e-commerce strength will also enhance our omnichannel offerings and diversify our client mix while also providing capabilities we can cross-sell across the breadth of our combined merchant base. We will also extend Worldpay's digital capabilities to SMBs and pursue geographic expansion in the 40 markets where we already operate.\nAs previously noted, we also have a significant opportunity to drive synergies by leveraging a unified orchestration layer to consolidate platforms and reduce technical debt. Further, our ability to deploy approximately $1 billion in annual capital investments to support a cohesive merchant-centric product road map will serve as a powerful catalyst. This strategic alignment is expected to create a flywheel effect accelerating innovation, enhancing efficiency and further strengthening our offerings.\nIn support of our execution of all these opportunities, in September, we were pleased to announce the appointment of two new independent directors to our Board of Directors, who filled seats vacated by retiring Board members this past April. Our new directors, Patty Watson and Archie Deskus, bringing a wealth of leadership skills, experience and financial technology expertise to our boardroom. Their guidance will be helpful as we continue to execute on our strategic ambition to be the worldwide partner of choice for Commerce Solutions. The Board has also established a new ad hoc integration committee to oversee the integration of Worldpay following the close of the acquisition. This committee will represent a governance best practice for Global Payments going forward. While we currently provide the Board with detailed updates on acquisition integration, the formation of a dedicated committee will allow for deeper engagement and more focused oversight. Leveraging the Board's diverse expertise and experience in this area will be invaluable as we execute on this critical initiative.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Josh.\n\nJoshua J. Whipple\n\nSenior EVP and Chief Strategy & Enterprise Risk Officer, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Cameron, and good morning. We're pleased to have reported another solid quarter, highlighted by accelerating revenue growth, healthy margin expansion and strong adjusted free cash flow generation. Importantly, the performance delivered is exactly consistent with the expectations we outlined at the beginning of the year as we continue to execute against our strategy and transformation agenda. Specifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $2.43 billion for the third quarter, an increase of 6% from the prior year on a constant currency basis, excluding dispositions. Adjusted operating margins expanded 110 basis points to 45% or 80 basis points, excluding dispositions, resulting from strong execution and benefits from the transformation we began executing last year. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $3.26, an increase of 12% on a reported basis and 11% on a constant currency basis. Year-to-date, we've generated $2.1 billion in adjusted free cash flow, representing a 96% conversion rate from adjusted net income.\nTaking a closer look at performance by business. Merchant Solutions produced adjusted net revenue of $1.88 billion for the quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 6% on a constant currency basis, excluding dispositions. This represents a 50 basis point improvement sequentially, consistent with our outlook that we set at the beginning of the year, and the expectations outlined at our investor conference last year. Further, the macroeconomic backdrop remains consistent as we continue to see stable volumes supporting our view that the consumer spending remains resilient.\nOur POS and software business achieved high single-digit growth, excluding dispositions for the third quarter. We're encouraged by the acceleration in new Genius locations sold having seen a 37% monthly increase since launching in June. We continue to build on this momentum in Q4, we hosted our Genius Dealer and VAR Conference in late September. The conference was well attended with over 200 dealers and key highlights including introducing new Genius handheld along with displaying our enterprise-grade capabilities like digital menu boards to SMBs. We're excited about the progress we've made in rolling out Genius as our singular point-of-sale technology platform across our business. We'll have much more to share in the coming quarters as we build on these accomplishments.\nTurning to integrated embedded payments. This business also delivered high single-digit growth for the third quarter. We added nearly 60 new partners globally during the quarter, and notably, about half of these new ISV partners were outside North America, underscoring the distinct value we bring as a provider with unmatched global reach. And the compounding power of those one to many ISV relationships continues to propel our top line as they ramp. For example, year-to-date, we have seen a 68% year-over-year revenue growth from the cohort of partners that we signed in 2023, while the ramp from new partners signed last year is nearly 15x their contribution in 2024.\nIn core payments, we delivered mid-single-digit growth during the quarter. Our international markets demonstrated relative strength with high single-digit constant currency revenue growth across Central Europe and Asia Pacific as we continue to benefit from strong secular payment trends in these markets. This reinforces our commitment to expand our foothold to meet strong demand and provide our best-in-class suite of capabilities across geographies. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 51.1% in Merchant Solutions, an increase of 110 basis points over the prior year or 70 basis points, excluding dispositions, again highlighting the impact of our transformation.\nMoving to Issuer Solutions business, we generated adjusted net revenue of $562 million for the third quarter, reflecting growth of over 5% on a constant currency basis. This represents over 150 basis points of acceleration sequentially and also marks an improvement from our performance in the first half of the year as expected. Revenue growth was primarily driven by new implementations and growth with existing customers as our strategy of aligning with market share winners continues to drive benefits. We also benefited from the recognition of project and fees for service revenue that we had previously expected in Q4.\nWe added 16 million traditional accounts on file this quarter, bringing us to a record of 917 million traditional accounts in total. We completed 2 implementations in the quarter, and we continue to see sustained growth in transaction count. Insurer Solutions delivered an adjusted operating margin of 46.9%, which is a 150 basis point improvement from the prior year period. As I mentioned, reported adjusted operating margins expanded by more than 100 basis points in both merchant and issuer. This reflects not only continued cost discipline, but also incremental benefits we've realized from our transformation efforts. In addition to beginning to unlock top line growth, as Cameron described a moment ago, our transformation has yielded significant cost efficiencies as we streamline our businesses and functions.\nFrom a cash flow standpoint, we produced strong adjusted free cash flow for the quarter of approximately $784 million, representing a conversion rate of adjusted net income to adjusted free cash flow of approximately 100%. We invested approximately $170 million in capital expenditures during the quarter and expect capital expenditures to be roughly $700 million or approximately 8% of revenue for the full year, consistent with our previously stated target.\nWe continued our commitment to returning capital to shareholders this quarter, repurchasing $500 million through an accelerated share repurchase in connection with the sale of our payroll business, bringing our total share repurchases to approximately $1.2 billion year-to-date. We continue to see buying back our shares as a compelling opportunity given our confidence in our strategy and long-term growth profile.\nWe're pleased to report that we've reduced our leverage faster than anticipated. Our net leverage position was 2.9x at the end of the third quarter, down from 3.15x at the end of the second quarter and below our long-term target of 3x. Our continued strong free cash flow generation gives us confidence in our ability to delever back to 3x within 18 to 24 months of closing the Worldpay acquisition.\nOur balance sheet remains extremely healthy, and we ended the period with approximately $4.1 billion of available liquidity. Outstanding indebtedness is almost entirely fixed rate with an attractive weighted average cost of debt of 3.4%.\nMoving to our outlook for the full year 2025. We continue to expect constant currency adjusted net revenue growth of 5% to 6% over 2024, excluding dispositions. We anticipate dispositions will impact reported adjusted net revenue growth by approximately 400 basis points for the full year, which now reflects the sale of our payroll business in September. As we discussed the past 2 quarters, the foreign currency exchange rate environment has continued to evolve since we established our initial 2025 guidance. We now expect a modest tailwind of approximately 50 basis points from foreign currency exchange rates in Q4. And for the full 2025, we expect foreign currency exchange rates to be broadly neutral to reported revenue and EPS growth. And we expect full year adjusted operating margin to more than 50 basis points, excluding dispositions, which is consistent with the guidance that we provided last quarter. We expect Q4 performance to be generally in line with our year-to-date trends and similar to Q3.\nAt the segment level, we still anticipate our merchant business to deliver adjusted net revenue growth of roughly 6% on a constant currency basis, excluding dispositions for the full year, and we continue to expect adjusted operating margin expansion for merchants to be greater than 50 basis points, excluding dispositions for the full year.\nFor Issuer Solutions, we continue to expect adjusted net revenue growth of approximately 4% on a constant currency basis for the full year. This implies Q4 growth of roughly 4% due to the pull forward that I mentioned a moment ago. We expect adjusted operating margin expansion for the issuer business to be greater than 50 basis points for the full year. We continue to anticipate adjusted free cash flow conversion to be greater than 90% for the full year and we expect to end the year at or below our 3x net leverage target.\nAltogether, for the year, we remain confident in the trajectory of the business, and we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share growth to be at the high end of the 10% to 11% range on a constant currency basis. In sum, we delivered another quarter consistent with expectations and we remain on track to achieve our outlook for the full year for revenue, margins, EPS and free cash flow. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Cameron.\n\nCameron M. Bready\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThanks, Josh. I could not be more proud of our team and the positive impact we are seeing in our business from our transformation. The anticipated closing of the Worldpay acquisition and the concurrent divestiture of Issuer Solutions business early next year represent a pivotal moment in our company's evolution. Far from a departure from our strategy, these actions are a natural extension of it, providing unique opportunities to accelerate our transformation. Together, they will crystallize Global Payments position as a pure-play merchant solution provider and a leading provider of commerce enablement solutions with unmatched global scale in an industry where scale matters more than ever.\nWe remain intensely focused on driving sustainable growth through a combination of expanded and more effective distribution, a more comprehensive suite of products and solutions and our ability to invest in innovation at scale. With approximately $1 billion in annual capital investment dedicated exclusively to merchant and commerce enablement solutions, we are uniquely positioned to accelerate our product road map and deliver differentiated value to our customers. These transactions also reinforce our transformational objectives to enhance operational efficiency and maximize cash flow. Leveraging our increased scale and realizing meaningful synergies, we expect to generate significantly more levered free cash flow than what would have been achievable absent these strategic actions.\nAnd our commitment to disciplined capital allocation remains unchanged. In addition to the $1.2 billion we have already returned from the disposition of assets, we remain on track to return $7.5 billion to shareholders between '25 and '27 while simultaneously delevering to 3x within 18 to 24 months of closing the Worldpay transaction. By 2028, we expect to generate approximately $5 billion in annual levered free cash flow, which is 50% more than it otherwise would have been. This level of actual generation will provide us with significant flexibility to continue returning capital to shareholders on a sustained basis, while simultaneously investing in innovation to drive sustainable long-term revenue growth and operating leverage. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator to open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference will be recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Winnie Smith. Please go ahead.\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Global Payments second quarter 2025 conference call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call can be found on the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpayments.com.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today's conference call contain forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nFor additional information on these factors, please refer to our press release and filings with the SEC. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update them.\nWe will also be referring to several non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance.

Bready\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThanks, Winnie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm excited to have the opportunity to share with you the progress we have made across the business over the last few months. Not only did we deliver solid results that were modestly better than our expectations, but we did so in a quarter when we announced a significant step to reposition our business with the acquisition of Worldpay and divestiture of Issuer Solutions.\nTransactions that represent a unique opportunity to catalyze our transformation in a more significant way and streamline our business to accelerate longer-term growth and value creation.\nWe also continue to make substantial progress against our operational transformation program that is focused on streamlining and unifying our business globally, while creating meaningful benefits that provide us with incremental capacity for reinvestment to drive growth and run a better business.\nThis quarter, we successfully launched our Genius platform and completed the rollout of our revamped sales compensation plan across our U.S. sales teams as part of our sales force of the future initiative. Our transformation initiatives are enhancing the commercial effectiveness of the business and enabling us to unlock greater operating income benefits than originally forecasted.\nFurther, in our ongoing commitment to simplifying the business, we recently announced the sale of our payroll business for a total consideration of $1.1 billion, allowing for $500 million of additional shareholder returns through the accelerated share repurchase program we announced today.\nAnd lastly, we are already planning ahead for the close of the Worldpay transaction next year, and have initiated our integration planning and establish critical work streams that will support a successful integration and allow us to begin unlocking the tremendous value embedded in the transaction.\nTurning to our second quarter results. We are very pleased with our performance, particularly in light of the significant positive change we are currently driving in our organization through our transformation. And while the macro environment continues to be fluid and consumer sentiment remains somewhat muted, spending has been relatively resilient, with trends fairly stable through the period.\nFor the quarter, we reported 5% constant currency adjusted net revenue growth, excluding dispositions, 130 basis points of margin expansion and 11% constant currency adjusted EPS growth compared to the same period in 2024. These results highlight not only the resilience of our business model but also our team's ability to execute at scale and advance a significant number of key initiatives, while remaining focused on delivering business outcomes.\nIn our merchant business, we achieved a number of notable wins and delivered healthy and consistent growth across the 3 pillars of our strategy, in line with our expectations and outlook. Beginning with POS and software, we successfully launched Genius for restaurants and Genius for retail this quarter, delivering on the time line we committed to at the beginning of the year. The launch of Genius marks an important milestone in our journey to streamline our solutions, unifying all the global payments point-of-sale products into an intuitive and highly configurable new platform, while establishing a stronger and more recognizable brand in the market.\nOur Genius product family is more than simply a marketplace of point solutions. It's a fully integrated and seamless set of capabilities that can be deployed to clients of varying sizes through our modern, scalable cloud-based software. Our solutions are designed with a clean interface, fast checkouts and native workflows without the need and reliance on third-party systems.\nGenius meets the needs of small businesses, while also delivering enterprise-grade reliability for large chains and complex environments. And we couple our complete commerce enablement solutions with distinctive distribution and full local service and support that is unrivaled in the market.\nWhile early days, we are delighted with the initial momentum we are seeing with Genius. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive with customers highlight [indiscernible] design, convenience and enhanced customer experience. And sellers and dealers are excited about Genius' easy setup, speed, flexible and competitive pricing and increased functionality, allowing them to target a more diverse set of merchants to accelerate sales.\nOur Genius for restaurants platform launched in late May at the National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago. In the month of June, post the rollout, new restaurant growth accelerated in the mid-teens sequentially compared to April and May, with that momentum continuing in July. We've also seen early success in our wholesale channel, where monthly net new additions have already doubled since launch as we leverage the full power of our distribution platform to bring our best capabilities to market.\nOur Genius retail platform, which officially launched in June has seen strong early demand as well with record sales in our U.S. direct channel, which delivered 37% growth from the prior year period. This momentum from retail customers also continued through July.\nAdditionally, we have now integrated our market-leading soft cause solution with Genius to provide a holistic end-to-end offering under the Genius family., including Tap to Pay functionality. And we have launched this solution into 13 EU markets, including our most recent iOS launch in Spain, which makes us the first acquirer in the market to enable merchants to accept payments directly through their Apple devices.\nUnlike many of our competitors, we have a significant opportunity to continue expanding Genius in international geographies and to capitalize on the strong secular growth trends and POS demands in regions like Europe. Given our established local presence and significant distribution capabilities in these markets today. This is one of the most exciting aspects of the Genius growth story.\nLooking ahead, we will officially introduce the Genius [indiscernible] but in the interim, we continue to see momentum with both enterprise restaurant chains and sports and entertainment venues. This quarter, we successfully completed the rollout of our POS and kitchen management solutions to over 1,000 A&W restaurant locations in Canada, and achieved a new partnership with one of the fastest-growing coffee franchises in the U.S., which will also leverage our point-of-sale and kitchen management offerings in addition to payments across locations beginning this quarter.\nAnd we were recently selected as a payments technology provider for food and beverage as part of a multiyear partnership with the Minnesota Twins and Target Field, and extended our relationship for a multiyear period with the Dallas Cowboys and AT&T Stadium. During the period, we also achieved stadium and venue partnerships with the Tampa Bay Lightning, and 2 Premier League football clubs in the U.K.\nOur proven ability to deliver innovative solutions that enhance speed efficiency and the overall fan experience in large-scale high-traffic environments, have positioned us as the partner of choice for approximately 160 stadiums and venues around the world.\nMoving to our education business. We signed a number of key wins this quarter, including new partnerships in the U.S. with Methods University and the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma, and a new agreement with Technological University in Dublin. I would note that we have now signed 16 partnerships with universities across the U.K. and Ireland since expanding into this market a little over a year ago.\nOur education business, well, this fall, we are introducing a new AI tool in support of cafeteria programs for school customers. The solution builds and optimizes menus, factoring in complex requirements such as nutrition guidelines, labor availability, food costs and inventory. With this tool, our customers will be able to unlock significant efficiency benefits, while improving food quality and offerings.\nIn the real estate vertical, we signed a multiyear extension with our largest partner and are excited about the opportunity to expand our relationship to include additional products. In both our communities and real estate vertical market software solutions delivered impressive bookings for the second quarter, with expected annual revenue from new sales increasing 30% and 20%, respectively, compared to the prior year period.\nTurning to our integrated embedded business. I am pleased to highlight that software partner signings remain strong, in particular in our international markets around the world. In fact, international signings are up more than 30% over the last 6 months compared to the prior year period, and we continue to have a strong pipeline across the United Kingdom, Asia, Australia and Lat Am, as we benefit from rather aligning our activities and capabilities globally.\nAs for our core payments business, our focus on forming deeper relationships with commerce enablement and outstanding service is driving significant opportunities with both new and existing partners globally. I'm pleased to note that we recently renewed our strategic partnership with Banamex to bring leading software and payment solutions to the full spectrum of merchants in Mexico for a multiyear period.\nMexico has strong secular trends and Benemex is the right partner given its reach and scale. We look forward to continuing to deliver best-in-class commerce solutions together in Mexico.\nWe achieved a number of notable wins in several key fast growth geographies in Europe this quarter, including Carrefour, IKEA, Intermarche and Brio Comarch in Poland, as well as with appliance leader Experts Hillis and Bazaar Supermarkets in Greece. We also acquired 2 small product companies at the end of the quarter. These buy versus build opportunities allow us to quickly improve our offerings, bring innovative technology to market more rapidly, control the development road map, reduce costs and streamline our infrastructure, while also enhancing subject matter expertise and talent.\nThe first is a Hong Kong-based software partner that meaningfully enhances our QR code in digital wallet capabilities. This technology allows us to expand our current capabilities, providing for a more seamless integration with partners like Alipay, WeChat Pay, Octopus and PayMe and greater control over the client experience and development road map support a full spectrum of merchants, including enterprise clients in APAC and beyond.\nThe second is a small fraud technology partner that bolsters our existing capabilities across the dispute management life cycle. This acquisition allows us to provide a more complete end-to-end support to our customers during the chargeback process on a global basis, with a better interface and client experience while demising legacy technology supporting these solutions today.\nTurning to Issuer Solutions. We delivered solid financial performance consistent with our expectations for the quarter. This was largely driven by continued growth in accounts on file as well as stable underlying transaction volume trends. Year-to-date, we have successfully converted over 15 million accounts, allowing us to end the second quarter with traditional accounts on file of more than 900 million.\nWe continue to have a strong pipeline of new business that extends into 2027 and as well as 4 letters of intent with institutions worldwide. Further, we recently renewed several customer agreements, including our consumer partnership with [ President Joints ] Bank and commercial relationships with U.S. Bank, HSBC, and in another leading multinational financial institution based in Continental Europe.\nWe also continue to make steady progress on our modernization program with multiple pilots in validation and approaching completion. Importantly, we achieved general availability for our first fully modernized cloud application during the second quarter, and we remain on track for full commercial launch of all customer-facing applications by the end of the year.\nAs I noted, while producing these results, we are also making significant progress on our transformation agenda. We continue to expect a meaningful amount of our transformation work to be complete by the end of this year, and are actually accelerating roughly 10% of our initiatives initially planned for 2026 to better position us to quickly and efficiently integrate Worldpay at close.\nJosh will provide more detail, but as a result of the milestones we appeased today, we are raising the value of the operating income benefit we expect from our transformation initiatives in our merchant business and support functions by nearly [ 20%].\nAs part of our transformation journey, we are also continuing to focus on streamlining and simplifying the business. As I noted in late May, we announced a definitive agreement to divest our payroll business to Acrisure. This transaction further sharepens our strategic focus and allows us to accelerate capital returns to shareholders. We expect the sale to close in the third quarter. As part of the transaction, we have entered into a mutual referral agreement and commercial partnership with Acrisure, supporting our ability to continue delivering integrated human capital management and payroll offerings to our merchant customers. as part of our suite of commerce enablement solutions.\nWith the payroll divestiture, we have now announced transactions to divest over $550 million of revenue, which is consistent with what we outlined at the time of our investor conference. That said, the plans we communicated in September were established well before the opportunity to acquire Worldpay materialized. As a result, we are reevaluating portfolio composition decisions we made at that time in light of the Worldpay acquisition and our expected strategic focus and vertical exposure post closing. Consistent with these from any further divestitures will be returned to shareholders after ensuring leverage neutrality. We also continue our work stabilities and harmonize our go-to-market strategy across the globe.\nI already highlighted the successful launch of our Genius restaurant and retail solutions during the quarter in the U.S. and that we remain on track to launch our Genius enterprise restaurant solution next month. We have also begun rolling out Genius international markets, including Canada and Mexico and will launch in the U.K. this month. Before the end of the year, we also expect to introduce Genius in Germany and Austria. And in early 2026, we will bring Venus to Ireland, Spain, the Czech Republic, followed by Romania and Poland and Australia shortly thereafter.\nIn addition to the progress we have made consolidating our 16 POS systems to the Unified Genius platform, we are also executing on a number of other initiatives to improve every inaction we have with our customers. Starting with how we go to market, we are making strides in transforming our sales and marketing organizations with targeted initiatives focused on each component critical to building high-performance sales teams. We are upscaling our talent across all modern sales methodologies and technology. We have successfully rolled out our revamped sales incentive plan across all of our U.S. sales team. and we are seeing positive results, which includes increases in sales production and sales capacity, lower seller attrition rates and an improved ability to attract incremental high-quality sales talent.\nWe converted over 90% of core payment sellers to the new plan, while a significant portion of those that did not convert have transitioned to our agent model or wholesale program. Importantly, the sales professionals that have moved to the new structure have already increased their productivity, high single digits with improvements in every month. In the cohort of new sales professionals hired since January under this model have already been 10% more productive than those under the previous plan.\nWe are also enhancing the integrated digital technologies that support our sales and marketing operations to improve efficiency, effectiveness and customer engagement. As 1 example, we have invested in increased marketing automation technology to drive higher conversion rates. These investments are delivering strong returns with qualified leads up 13% quarter-over-quarter, driven by improved targeting and engagement. As an example, our real-time messaging platform is now the top-performing channel for sales qualified leads.\nAdditionally, we've made significant progress in consolidation of our over 20 CRM instances leveraging modern infrastructure and common data platform. We're also simplifying the way we onboard merchants by establishing a single provisioning and activating process versus leveraging multiple channels across our business and geographies as we had in the past.\nAs part of this program, we have more than doubled our automated approval rate as we now can support a wider range of customers and partner channels, while also effectively managing risk and fraud. We are also making investments to build a single entry point for our customers to access the full suite of capabilities through one marketplace, enhancing our ability to cross-sell our commerce enablement solutions, including loyalty, embedded finance, data analytics and guests.\n[indiscernible] real-time processing and orchestration platform we acquired last year to distribute products across channels and geographies seamlessly. To date, we have connected multiple products and are now successfully leveraging this platform across our European operations. And in our integrated and embedded business, we are transforming our integration experience into an AI-led developer first platform, consolidating all developer documentation, code samples and tools into a single global platform that spans geographies, verticals and partners. This provides developers with access to a unified suite of APIs and a powerful orchestration layer capable of shifting transactions between gateways and dynamically activating value-added services, all without rewriting code.\nThis means faster access to innovation for new and existing partners. We're helping developers to do more with less, which will unlock speed, scale and simplicity across global commerce. This builds on the work we are already doing to integrate AI across our organization to drive innovation, enhance efficiency and unlock new opportunities. This includes investments in AI applications in areas such as marketing optimization, contract intelligence, customer engagement and software development, each offering promising potential to accelerate product delivery, streamline operations and elevate the way we serve our customers.\nWe continue to see AI as a key enabler of long-term customer and shareholder value. I'm proud of what our team has accomplished across all of our transformation initiatives, which will position us to successfully integrate Worldpay in 2026. To that end, we are making solid progress on closing both the acquisition of Worldpay and divestiture of our Insurer Solutions business. This includes significant strides towards receiving the regulatory approvals required for the transactions.\nWe have initiated the approval process with regulators in all required jurisdictions. We are particularly pleased that the transaction cleared antitrust review in the U.S. upon expiry of the HSR waiting period in July. Overall, the regulatory approval process is proceeding as expected, and we remain on track to close in the first half of 2026.\nAdditionally, we are preparing to execute on the Worldpay integration and have identified and established all necessary work streams to ensure a seamless process. We have a proven track record of integrating large acquisitions, delivering on our time lines and exceeding our synergy goals. And we will approach the integration with Worldpay with an uncompromising plan for aligning our operating model and fully unifying our businesses for value creation.\nOur integration strategy will emphasize accelerating growth, enhancing our competitiveness, synergy realization and investing in innovation, while also unifying the combined company under a single brand and leveraging the best talent from both organizations to build the industry's strongest team.\nWe recently held our first integration planning kickoff, bringing together of our 100 leaders from both Global Payments and Worldpay to begin developing our integration road map. The team left energized about the future, and we are more excited today than we were at the time of the announcement about the opportunities to accelerate our transformation and long-term strategy.\nWe are positioning the business for a seamless close, and our work to date has further increased our confidence in revenue and expense synergy expectations we outlined in April. Worldpay positions our company with unmatched global scale processing nearly $4 trillion in annual volume across 100 billion transactions and serving millions of merchants and thousands of platform and software partners globally.\nImportantly, the acquisition combines complementary capabilities that will make our go-to-market business stronger, more scalable, more competitive and more valuable to our clients. We are highly focused on the opportunities to accelerate growth as a combined business through a combination of expanded distribution, a more complete suite of products and solutions to serve merchants and partners of all types and sizes globally and in an ability to invest in innovation at scale.\nFor example, we already discussed our ability to immediately sell Genius, other software and commerce enablement solutions into Worldpay's existing SMB merchant base and leverage Worldpay's existing distribution channels to bring these capabilities to market. We will also be able to further strengthen the commerce enablement solutions integrated into Genius to support the growth of our restaurants and retailers including enhancing our merchant embedded finance offerings through existing Worldpay solutions.\nWorldpay's pay [indiscernible] platform and full PayFac capabilities augment our ability to serve software partners, marketplaces and platforms across more regions and operating models. Many of the Worldpay solutions for platforms can enhance our offerings and the experience we deliver for our software partners. Worldpay also brings world-class enterprise and e-commerce capabilities that enhance our payment acceptance solutions and enable us to deliver a seamless and robust omnichannel experience across our combined footprint and a full spectrum of merchant customer.\nWe have identified opportunities to cross-sell existing Worldpay solutions, including fraud and prime routing as well as our Global Payments loyalty data and analytics and other commerce enablement solutions across our combined 5 million merchant customer base.\nIn addition to serving the digital needs of enterprise customers, including best-in-class authorization capabilities, a premier FX platform, prudential management solutions, fraud offerings and leading payout solutions supporting over 100 currencies, stable coins and a robust and rapidly growing list of alternative payment methods, we intend to bring Worldpay's e-com capabilities down market to further differentiate our offering for SMB clients.\nWe also see tremendous potential for geographic expansion as a combined company, targeting new secular growth markets. In particular, we could not be more excited to bring robust local distribution, functionality and service to complement Worldpay's leading digital offerings across the 40 markets where we have a physical presence today.\nWe are also focused on innovation in new businesses we can grow as a combined company. One such example is in B2B, where both companies possess a variety of assets and capabilities we feel we can better harness and invest in to accelerate our growth in a market where we've been historically underpenetrated. And we will enable all of this by accelerating investment more broadly across the business to further differentiate and compete putting more than $1 billion annually in high priority areas supporting our growth.\nTogether, we will be better positioned than ever to deliver the next generation of capabilities from point-of-sale and software and integrated and embedded payments to advanced commerce enablement and omnichannel solutions for merchants of all sizes globally. Lastly, we will ensure that collectively, we continue to meet the highest compliance and regulatory standards globally, which we believe will increasingly be a point of differentiation in the future.\nJosh?\n\nJoshua J. Whipple\n\nSenior EVP and Chief Strategy & Enterprise Risk Officer, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Cameron. [indiscernible] reported another solid quarter, highlighted by consistent revenue growth, healthy margin expansion and strong adjusted free cash flow generation. Specifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $2.36 billion, an increase of 5% on a constant currency basis, excluding dispositions.\nAdjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 130 basis points to 44.6%. This translates to 110 basis points of expansion, excluding dispositions. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $3.10, an increase of 11% on a reported and constant currency basis. Our adjusted net revenue performance was consistent with our expectations, while adjusted operating margin and EPS came in slightly ahead, driven by strong execution on our refocused strategy and transformation initiatives.\nTaking a closer look at performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.83 billion for the second quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 5.5% and excluding dispositions, which was in line with our expectations. Both our POS and software and our integrated embedded businesses grew in the high single digits range, excluding dispositions.\nWe saw a strong growth in new POS locations during the quarter and notably saw demand accelerate following the launch of our Genius restaurant and retail solutions in May and June, respectively.\nAdditionally, we added 85 new ISV partners during the second quarter with strength in international markets as we continue to extend our offerings to new regions. Our corporate at the high end of low single digits for the second quarter with several international businesses, notable bright spots.\nSpecifically, Central Europe, Lat Am and Asia Pacific all achieved high single digit or greater growth as we continue to benefit from the strong secular payment trends in these markets.\nWe delivered an adjusted operating margin of 50.1% in the Merchant segment, an increase of 130 basis points compared to the prior year or 90 basis points excluding dispositions. Our Issuer Solutions business produced adjusted net revenue of $547 million for the second quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 3.5% on a constant currency basis. This performance marks an improvement from where we exited the first quarter, largely driven by an increase in accounts on file and overall stable transaction volume trends.\nWe've added a total of 15 million traditional accounts on file year-to-date, driven by new implementations and growth with existing customers as our strategy of aligning with market share wins continues to drive benefits. We have 6 more implementations we expect to complete over the balance of the year, and our implementation pipeline and the completion of our renewal cycle with many of our large customers gives us confidence in our outlook for improved growth in this business in the second half.\nIssuer Solutions delivered an adjusted operating margin of 48.7%, which is a 190 basis point improvement from the prior year. From a cash flow standpoint, we produced strong adjusted free cash flow for the quarter of approximately $800 million, representing a conversion rate of adjusted net income to adjusted free cash flow of approximately 110%. This translates to a roughly 95% conversion rate year-to-date.\nWe invested approximately $150 million in capital expenditures during the quarter and expect capital expenditures to be roughly $750 million in 2025, or approximately 8% of revenue. We executed share repurchases of approximately $230 million in the quarter and more than $690 million during the first half of 2025.\nOur net leverage position was 3.15x at the end of the second quarter. Our balance sheet remains extremely healthy, and we ended the period with approximately $3 billion of available liquidity. Our total indebtedness is 95% fixed with a weighted average cost of debt of 3.5%.\nTurning to our outlook for the full year 2025. We continue to expect constant currency adjusted net revenue growth of 5% to 6% over 2024, excluding dispositions. We still anticipate dispositions will impact reported adjusted net revenue by over 300 basis points, which does not account for the sale of payroll as we've not yet closed that transaction. We'll provide an update on this impact at close.\nWe now expect a headwind from foreign currency exchange rates to be approximately 50 basis points for the full year compared to the 125 basis point impact we guided to previously, given the weakening of the U.S. dollar that we have seen in the first part of the year. That said, foreign currency exchange rates remain quite volatile, given trade uncertainties.\nWe now expect annual adjusted operating margin to expand slightly more than 50 basis points for 2025, excluding the effect of dispositions due to the progress we are making with our transformation agenda. At the segment level, we still expect our merchant business to deliver adjusted net revenue growth of roughly 6% on a constant currency basis, excluding dispositions for the full year.\nHowever, we now expect adjusted operating margin expansion for this business to be slightly above 50 basis points, excluding dispositions in 2025.\nMoving to Issuer Solutions. We continue to anticipate adjusted net revenue growth in roughly 4% range on a constant currency basis for the full year compared to 2024. And we now expect adjusted operating margin for the Issuer business to also expand by slightly more than 50 basis points in 2025.\nWe continue to anticipate adjusted free cash flow conversion will be greater than 90% for the full year, and we still expect to be approximately 3x net levered at the end of 2025. Putting it all together, we remain confident in the trajectory of the business for the remainder of the year and now expect adjusted earnings per share growth to be at the high end of the 10% to 11% range for the full year on a constant currency basis.\nRegarding capital allocation, Today, we are entering into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program in connection with the payroll divestiture, which we expect to close this quarter. Further, we expect tax provisions included within the recently passed one big beautiful bill act to modestly improve our cash flow generation going forward and allow us to increase our capital return to shareholders to a total of $7.5 billion between 2025 and 2027.\nWe exactly consistent with the capital allocation plan we outlined at our investor conference last September before the announcement of the Worldpay transaction. It is important to note that any repurchase activity related to divestitures including the ASR announced today is incremental to the $7.5 billion of capital returns we committed to over this 3-year period.\nFinally, given the significant progress we've made regarding our transformation, we are now pleased to be able to raise our annual run rate operating income benefit for the go-forward business to $650 million. This increase translates to $100 million more in benefits in our go-forward business compared to our prior estimate, and also reflects the elimination of run rate benefits related to Issuer Solutions, which represented roughly 10% of the overall transformation benefits previously outlined. We continue to made with our transformation efforts, which will allow us to accelerate the integration of Worldpay post close.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Cameron.\n\nCameron M. Bready\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. At our investor conference last September, we talked in great detail about our intention to become a more focused organization, recognizing that we can unlock substantially more value in our business through greater clarity of purpose. To accomplish this, we have reoriented our business under a single unified operating model and launched a significant operational transformation program, driving meaningful efficiencies and operating income benefits, which we now expect to total $650 million as an annual run rate operating income benefit for our merchant business and support functions once complete.\nWe also reviewed our portfolio and identified assets for potential divestiture or exit in order to better focus our energy and investments on the most attractive opportunities where we can differentiate in the market. As I highlighted earlier, we have now exited or announced transactions to divest over $550 million of revenue consistent with what we outlined at the time of our investor conference.\nIncluding the payroll divestiture, these portfolio efforts will have allowed us to opportunistically return $1.2 billion to shareholders in less than 12 months. And we are reevaluating the portfolio composition in light of the Worldpay acquisition and remain committed to using proceeds from any additional business exits to return capital to shareholders.\nAnd further, we now expect to return $7.5 billion in capital, excluding returns associated with dispositions to our shareholders over the 2025 to 2027 period, consistent with what we outlined at our investor conference last year.\nAnd as a result of Worldpay and Insurer transactions, by 2028, our annual run rate leverage free cash flow and total capital return expectations will be nearly 50% higher than they would have been previously, providing us with greater flexibility to invest in growth and return meaningfully more capital to shareholders.\nWe have even greater conviction today than we did when we announced the Worldpay acquisition, about the potential to enhance our competitive strengths, open new opportunities and accelerate our growth trajectory, while maximizing value expectations.\nAnd by diversifying our business across an SMB to enterprise customer base with millions of merchant customers and thousands of platform and software partners, extending our global reach and expanding our comprehensive capabilities spanning physical card-present environments to global e-commerce, we are building a more focused, stronger and more durable model for the long run.\nWinnie?\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Cameron. Before we begin our question-and-answer session, I'd like to ask everyone to limit their questions to 1 with 1 follow-up to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions."

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference will be recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Winnie Smith. Please go ahead.\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Global Payments First Quarter 2025 Conference Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call can be found on the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpayments.com.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today's conference call contain forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the impact of economic conditions on our future operations that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.\nCertain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K and subsequent filings. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update them.\nWe will also be referring to several non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance. For a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call to the most comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC regulations, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and our supplemental materials available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nJoining me on the call is our CEO, Cameron Bready; our President and COO, Bob Cortopassi; and our CFO, Josh Whipple. Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron.\n\nCameron M. Bready\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThank you, Winnie, and thanks, everyone, for joining us to discuss our first quarter results and the exciting start to our year. We had a solid first quarter, which is a testament to the resilience of our business model and our relentless focus on execution in what continues to be a fluid economic environment.\nSpecifically, we delivered over 5% constant currency adjusted net revenue growth, excluding dispositions, 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and an 11% constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth compared to the same period in 2024. Notably, both our Merchant and Issuer businesses saw growth consistent with where we exited 2024, and our overall performance was exactly in line with our expectations.\nWhile delivering this performance, we are also aggressively executing against our overarching transformation agenda, including advancing a significant number of key initiatives. Since launching the program last year, we have successfully simplified and streamlined our organizational structure and operating model, unified our Merchant business globally, advanced our technology harmonization program and increased our overall benefit target by 20% to $600 million.\nImportantly, as we progress our transformation over the next year, we are positioning ourselves with a strong foundation to quickly and fully integrate Worldpay post closing. Josh will cover more details on the quarter in a moment, but we plan to spend the majority of our time today discussing our recently announced transactions to divest our Issuer Solutions business and acquire Worldpay.\nSince announcing the transactions, many of you have asked about the timing and how it aligns with our refocused strategy and transformation agenda we outlined last September. You have also asked about recent trends in the Worldpay business and how they have progressed their own efforts to improve growth and better position themselves competitively.\nFurther, you asked about how bringing Global Payments and Worldpay together drives opportunities to accelerate growth over time. You also want to understand our plans to integrate this business when their previous integration was not successful. And lastly, you have asked for clarity as to how the transactions we announced align with our plans to prioritize capital returns to shareholders.\nWe plan to touch on all these items today. To start, I want to discuss our conviction that the transaction with Worldpay and divestiture of Issuer Solutions will accelerate our transformation and build an even more durable and differentiated platform for long-term success. Let's start with the strategic rationale for what we announced.\nWe know Worldpay well and have long recognized the complementary nature of our 2 merchant businesses. We also know firsthand that selling issuer processing solutions into large financial institutions is a very different go-to-market motion than bringing commerce solutions to merchants of all sizes globally. This is part of the reason we communicated at our investor conference, our intent to evaluate options for the Issuer business that serve to achieve our strategic objectives and accelerate value realization.\nSo when this unique opportunity to execute these 2 transactions simultaneously presented itself earlier this year, we've moved quickly and thoughtfully to structure a deal that would yield better outcomes in our stand-alone transformation journey. And we have high confidence that these transactions will do just that and accelerate our long-term strategy.\nOne of the core tenets of our transformation program is to simplify and streamline our business to ensure we have a strong platform for the next decade of growth. Underpinning this is our desire to become a more focused organization, recognizing that we can unlock substantially more value in our business through greater clarity of purpose. This transaction not only sharpens our focus, but also enhances our global scale and cements our position as a leading pure-play commerce solutions provider for merchants of all sizes around the world.\nIt also allows us to concentrate on a simplified business and orient investment exclusively towards merchant solutions, driving better growth outcomes and improving our ability to win share in the market. And through the combination with Worldpay, we are bringing together highly complementary capabilities and distribution networks. Global Payments brings strength in SMB solutions, leading point-of-sale technology and vertical-specific software that Worldpay does not have today. Worldpay contributes best-in-class e-commerce and enterprise capabilities, managed PayFac solutions and a presence in attractive geographies where we do not operate currently.\nSimply put, this combination creates a complete commerce solutions platform with complementary capabilities and extensive distribution across the merchant spectrum. Together, we will accelerate growth and innovation and deliver enhanced client experiences for merchants of all types and sizes. The combined company will also dramatically advance its innovation pipeline for future success.\nWith capital investment in excess of $1 billion annually, we will be better positioned than ever to deliver the next generation of capabilities from point-of-sale and software and integrated and embedded payments to advanced commerce enablement and global omnichannel solutions. And importantly, since all of our investments will be focused on Merchant Solutions, we will be able to better amplify their impacts across our organization and drive better returns on invested capital.\nWe are already actively engaged with our customers, and their feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Specifically, clients are excited about how complementary the businesses are and how the combined company will bring expanded capabilities, even better service and greater innovation to help power their businesses. This transaction also meaningfully enhances our financial profile.\nWe expect approximately $12.5 billion in pro forma adjusted net revenue and $6.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA post transaction close. We see clear opportunities to achieve at least $600 million in cost synergies from aligning our merchant business operations and go-to-market strategies, streamlining technology and infrastructure and eliminating duplicative corporate and operational support structures.\nThe path to achieve these savings is already identified, and they represent low-risk opportunities, well within our reach given our team's significant integration experience. And to be clear, these synergies are fully incremental to the $600 million in benefits we expect to deliver through our operational transformation.\nFurther, we are highly confident in our ability to achieve revenue synergies of at least $200 million by cross-selling our software and commerce enablement solutions, expanding omnichannel capabilities and deepening penetration in high-growth verticals, all while leveraging our combined 6.5 million merchants worldwide, including more than 500,000 enterprise clients.\nTogether, we have clear line of sight to accelerating both our revenue and earnings growth framework while also meaningfully expanding our long-term commitment to return capital to shareholders. With that background, I'd like to spend a moment on how this transaction aligns with what we outlined at our investor conference.\nIn September, we unveiled a strategy to transform Global Payments into the worldwide partner of choice for commerce solutions, focused on moving aggressively to position the company for the next phase of its growth journey. As part of this, we unified our merchant business across 3 product pillars: point-of-sale and software, integrated and embedded and core payments.\nOur strategy is squarely focused on the end customer. We have built our business around knowing what merchants need to succeed across more than 100 vertical markets. We know the intricacies of their business and their goals, and we support them with exceptional service from the sales process to onboarding to ongoing support when they need us. The transactions we announced accelerate the transformation we began last year while also creating a company with unmatched global scale in an industry where scale matters more than ever.\nImportantly, the acquisition of Worldpay directly supports each of our 3 merchant pillars, making them stronger, more scalable, more competitive and more valuable to our clients. Starting with POS and software, we will be able to immediately sell our Genius point-of-sale and other software and commerce enablement solutions into Worldpay's existing SMB merchant base.\nWe will also leverage their existing distribution channels to bring these capabilities to market and achieve better penetration and saturation. In integrated and embedded, Worldpay's Payrix platform enhances our ability to serve software partners, marketplaces and platforms across more regions and operating models. And in core payments, Worldpay brings world-class e-commerce capabilities that enhance our payment acceptance solutions and enables us to deliver a seamless omnichannel experience to merchants of all sizes across our combined footprint.\nAdditionally, Worldpay strengthens our international presence and distribution in existing geographies and expands our footprint to new attractive markets like Japan, France and the Nordics. We have made substantial progress on our transformation initiatives and the plans we are pursuing over the next year provide a strong foundation in which to integrate Worldpay.\nWe have already consolidated our merchant, technology and operations organizations. These newly defined organizations are focused on driving sales, delivering new products to market while ensuring differentiated service levels and availability.\nImportantly, we will approach this integration with a clearly defined operating model, scalable processes to support execution and an uncompromising strategy regarding how we plan to fully integrate the business and run the combined company. By the time we close the Worldpay transaction, we'll have completed the launch of our Genius retail and restaurant point-of-sale platforms globally, fully revamped the sales organization through our Salesforce of the Future initiative and will be a far more nimble and agile business with a customer-led and product-centric mindset focused on speed and quality of product development.\nLeveraging our new operating model, Global Payments and Worldpay will be better positioned competitively in the market with a durable business structure, increased investment capacity, significant runway for growth and an enhanced ability to deliver sustainable performance. As a combined company, we will have significant scale, processing nearly $4 trillion in annual volume across 100 billion transactions, significant merchant coverage serving millions of merchants and thousands of platform and software partners. Comprehensive capabilities scanning physical card-present environments to global e-commerce and extensive global reach across 175 countries with a sales force of over 4,000 professionals.\nWe will be capable of providing end-to-end service across the entire merchant journey from onboarding through transaction processing to settlement, reconciliation and business intelligence. And all of this is supported by our global distribution and service infrastructure. We will enhance our managed PayFac capabilities, which will broaden our leading integrated offerings, allowing us to support a wider array of operating models for software, marketplace and platform partners.\nTogether, Global Payments and Worldpay's singular merchant focus and significant scale will enable us to accelerate innovation to further differentiate and compete. Unlike new entrants who often build around narrow solutions, the combined company will offer the full spectrum of highly innovative products powered by best-in-class technology with scale processing economics while delivering enterprise-grade reliability, security and compliance that stands apart.\nNow I'll hand it over to Bob to discuss the Worldpay business, details regarding our revenue synergy opportunities and more specifics relating to our approach to integration. Bob?\n\nRobert M. Cortopassi\n\nPresident & COO\n\nThanks, Cameron. Worldpay has made significant progress and has improved its growth profile under GTCR's ownership. It's also continued to invest meaningfully in its leading capabilities and is delivering strong growth across a highly diversified set of verticals and geographies, spanning 175 countries.\nWorldpay manages its business across 3 channels today: e-commerce and enterprise, platforms and SMB. In e-commerce and enterprise, Worldpay has enhanced its technology and product depth across alternative payment methods, FX solutions, payouts, marketplaces, authorization optimization, analytics and fraud and risk management, better positioning the business in terms of breadth and depth in the industry.\nThey're also delivering differentiated capabilities to help enterprises manage payment orchestration in multi-acquirer scenarios, solving for a critical customer need while giving additional insight and opportunities to expand wallet share. Today, this business accounts for 50% of Worldpay's revenue and is delivering growth in the high single digits.\nTurning to their platforms business through Payrix, Worldpay brings a versatile integrated offering that meets the unique needs of software and platform partners with a modern and flexible service platform. With this offering, Worldpay is having great success attracting high-growth partners looking for additional flexibility, more control of the customer experience and faster onboarding and implementation relative to more traditional referral models.\nThey are competing well, including against newer entrants. This business generates over $300 million in revenue today and is growing north of 20%. In total, Worldpay has 1,400 omnichannel software partners across a diversified set of verticals, including health services, restaurants, automotive, personal and professional services, government, utilities and retail.\nFinally, Worldpay's SMB portfolio has improved through a focus on rebuilding sales capacity, including a relaunch of its direct and FI channels under GTCR. The business has historically lacked a robust product suite, which we complement nicely by bringing our Genius point-of-sale offering and leading commerce enablement solutions to the portfolio.\nTo that end, Worldpay provides us with a large installed base of nearly 1 million SMB customers for distribution to enhance growth. As we've discussed, our businesses are highly complementary, creating meaningful opportunities to drive revenue synergies and accelerate the growth profile of the combined entity. We've identified annual run rate revenue synergies of at least $200 million that we have high conviction in achieving within 3 years of closing.\nLet me walk through a few key areas of focus. First, we see a significant opportunity with the e-commerce and enterprise capabilities that Worldpay brings. We can extend these capabilities on an omnichannel basis to the nearly 40 markets where Global Payments has a strong physical presence and Worldpay is primarily virtual.\nWe bring robust local distribution, functionality and service to complement Worldpay's leading digital offerings. And we can extend Worldpay's rich e-commerce solutions and capabilities to the more than 5 million SMB merchant customers we serve in these markets today. The combined business will have leading capabilities to unlock new enterprise and digital native opportunities worldwide.\nSecond, we can bring Global Payments commerce enablement solutions, including our Genius point-of-sale technology to Worldpay's core SMB customer base. We will extend our reach with these solutions by leveraging Worldpay's distribution channels, including its FI partnerships with more than 6,000 branches.\nThird, there's a significant opportunity in integrated and embedded payments. Payrix, coupled with our existing integrated offerings allows us to serve any software and platform partner across any operating model with best-in-class tailored solutions that meet the evolving needs of integrated and embedded commerce.\nWe view Payrix as a highly complementary accelerator of our own integrated and embedded road map. We have a great deal of confidence in our revenue synergy framework. As mentioned, this is a business that we know well and have assessed multiple times over the years, allowing us to have a refined thesis and plan for realizing value.\nWe've conducted extensive diligence and have a clear view on the opportunities to enhance revenue as a combined business. Further, our combined scale and stature also positions us to have visibility into and address opportunities with partners, networks and clients at a greater level than either business could on a stand-alone basis.\nFinally, we recognize the competitive and innovative nature of the industry. Our simplified and dedicated merchant model and combined scale will enable us to accelerate investment in our business to further differentiate and compete, putting more than $1 billion annually in high-priority areas supporting our growth. Specifically, we'll focus our investments on expanding digital native and omnichannel solutions supporting enterprise, multinational and marketplace customers, continuing to enhance our Genius point-of-sale features, functionality and distribution, delivering a premier developer experience with modern embedded capabilities for any operating model, extending our commerce enablement capabilities, including embedded finance, loyalty, payroll and others and building on our best-in-class service offerings.\nWhile we have a proven track record of integrating large acquisitions, delivering on our time lines and exceeding our synergy goals, our transformation better prepares us to execute on a more fulsome integration approach in this transaction. We will not compromise on our unified operating model, allowing us to focus on fully integrating our 2 businesses with a single company culture and go-to-market approach beginning day 1.\nWe will align around a common brand and commercialization approach to drive value realization, emphasizing revenue growth opportunities while delivering on our expense synergy expectations. At Global Payments, we've already unified our worldwide technology teams and assets into a singular organization. And today, we're leveraging common technology platforms to enable commerce and better experiences for our clients and partners. This includes the orchestration layer we recently acquired, which allows us to extend and distribute products more easily across platforms and geographies seamlessly.\nWorldpay has been on its own technology modernization journey. The business is built around a single access API architecture, which will be able to meet all of our combined merchants and partners' needs with vertical specificity and global capabilities in addition to standardized reporting, settlements and data feeds.\nWe'll integrate our commerce enablement and broad product offerings with Worldpay's single-in, single-out architecture, providing for rapid and seamless delivery of innovative solutions to delight their existing customers and partners. At the same time, we'll also embed additional capabilities into our architecture coming from Worldpay's e-commerce, risk and fraud and payment facilitation platforms.\nIn sum, we have a clear view to integration execution, leadership resources identified and work streams ready to launch. We're fully prepared to hit the ground running immediately upon close to ensure strong execution. Now I'll hand it over to Josh.\n\nJoshua J. Whipple\n\nSenior EVP and Chief Strategy & Enterprise Risk Officer, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. At our investor conference in September, we outlined our medium-term outlook. Starting with 2025, we forecasted mid-single-digit adjusted net revenue growth, excluding dispositions and 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. We are pleased that year-to-date, we are tracking in line with this expectation. We also said that in 2025, we would be focused on executing on our strategy and operational transformation agenda that would in turn position us to drive accelerated growth in 2026 and 2027.\nSpecifically, over these 2 years, we indicated we had confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable mid- to high single-digit adjusted net revenue growth and consistent adjusted operating margin expansion between 50 basis points and 100 basis points per year. I would highlight that our outlook for the merchant business on a stand-alone basis was and remains consistent with these targets and the progress we have already made on our transformation initiatives reinforce our confidence in this trajectory today.\nTurning to Worldpay. You just heard from Bob about the strides that have and continue to be made under the ownership of GTCR. We currently expect the Worldpay business to deliver top line growth and margin expansion relatively consistent with the guidance we have provided for Global Payments in 2025 as well as in 2026 and 2027 as it executes against its own initiatives to accelerate growth.\nThis is also consistent with the recent trends they have experienced in their business. They are a solidly mid-single-digit grower today and on a trajectory to continue to improve that over the next several years. And by combining our 2 businesses, we expect to drive substantial synergy benefits.\nBob just covered the revenue potential we have together, including the meaningful cross-selling opportunities enabled by our highly complementary solutions and global scale, which we expect will drive at least $200 million of annual run rate revenue synergies over 3 years. And on the expense side, we have a clear line of sight to approximately $600 million of annual run rate cost synergies that we expect to achieve within 3 years of closing.\nRoughly 1/3 of the savings will be derived from consolidating our combined technology infrastructure into a singular focused organization and eliminating duplicative vendor and software spend. Another 1/3 of expense savings will come from aligning our business operations, including consolidated includes realizing economies of scale across corporate and administrative functions.\nThrough these synergies and the execution of our strategy, we expect to materially transform the long-term financial profile of this business while also enhancing our medium-term outlook. Specifically, we now have a clear line of sight to accelerate revenue growth in 2026 and high single-digit growth in 2027 with margin expansion of 100 to 200 basis points in both years, which is double our original target of 50 to 100 basis points.\nThis transaction is also accretive day 1 and supports an uplift of our adjusted EPS growth target to mid-teens over the medium term compared to our initial target of low teens growth. Importantly, we believe the strong earnings accretion framework is sustainable long term.\nTurning to capital allocation. The ability to invest in innovation will be significantly greater as we will maintain capital spending at 7% to 8% of adjusted net revenue. That translates to reinvesting more than $1 billion annually back into the business. And as Cameron mentioned, that is entirely focused on Merchant Solutions after the closing of the transaction. We also continue to expect to return roughly $7 billion in capital to shareholders from 2025 and to 2027, largely consistent with what we outlined at our investor conference last September.\nImportantly, by 2028, our annual and run rate levered free cash flow and total capital return expectations will be nearly 50% higher than they would have been if we had not executed these transactions. This will provide us greater flexibility to invest in growth and return meaningfully more capital to shareholders.\nAnd at the same time, we will be disciplined with regard to leverage and are committed to reducing our net leverage to 3x, which we expect to achieve within 18 to 24 months of closing. This leverage level supports our investment-grade credit ratings long term while still providing ample capacity to invest for the future and drive shareholder value.\nAs you can see, this transaction cements our growth profile, accelerate profitability and enhances our long-term capital allocation commitments. Ultimately, this is why we have such conviction that the transaction will unlock value for our shareholders. Now let me quickly provide the highlights of our financial performance for the first quarter. Overall, we continue to execute well, and our results were consistent with our expectations despite heightened macroeconomic uncertainty.\nWe delivered adjusted net revenue of $2.2 billion, reflecting constant currency growth of 5%, excluding dispositions. Specifically, the disposition of AdvancedMD and our exit of certain noncore markets in Asia Pacific had an approximately 3-point impact to overall growth, while unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates were over a point headwind for the quarter.\nTrends were fairly consistent throughout the quarter, and we saw a limited change in consumer spending patterns during the period and into April. With that said, we are closely monitoring the ongoing tariff negotiations and their potential impact on the global economy.\nHowever, I would highlight that we are a well-diversified business, both from geographic and vertical market perspectives and across a wide range of discretionary and nondiscretionary categories and are well positioned to navigate through the current environment.\nAdjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 70 basis points or 40 basis points, excluding dispositions. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.69, including share-based compensation, an increase of 11% on a constant currency basis. Excluding share-based compensation, adjusted earnings per share was $2.82.\nTaking a closer look at performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.69 billion for the first quarter, reflecting growth of 6% on a constant currency basis, excluding dispositions. The disposition of AdvancedMD and our exit of certain noncore markets in Asia Pacific had approximately 4-point impact on reported growth in the quarter.\nSimilar to the total company impact, currency was over 1 point headwind to Merchant Solutions growth. This performance was driven by our POS and software and integrated embedded businesses, both of which achieved high single-digit growth. Core payments grew mid-single digits during the quarter, which includes absorbing our exit of certain lines of business and wholesale relationships.\nAs a reminder, this results in lower GAAP revenues and lower residual adjustments to arrive at our adjusted net revenue. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 47.8% in the Merchant segment, an increase of 80 basis points compared to the prior year. Issuer Solutions adjusted revenues were $529 million, an increase of 3% on a constant currency basis.\nThis performance marks a slight improvement sequentially driven by consumer card volumes, while commercial card volumes remain consistent as corporates continue to take a more cautious approach to spending. Insurer Solutions delivered an adjusted operating margin of 46.3%. It is up 50 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by the softer commercial volumes and ongoing investments in modernization.\nWe added a total of 15 million traditional accounts on file this quarter, executing 2 large portfolio implementations for existing customers. We also executed 4 multiyear renewals during the period. From a cash flow standpoint, we produced solid adjusted free cash flow for the quarter of approximately $512 million, representing a roughly 77% conversion rate of adjusted net income to adjusted free cash flow.\nWe expect our adjusted free cash flow conversion for the year to follow a similar trajectory as 2024 as we benefit from seasonality, resulting in a higher conversion rate as the year progresses. As a reminder, this quarter, we changed the presentation of cash flows for settlement assets and obligations and certain funds held for customers, moving to changes in these items from operating to financing cash flows.\nWe invested $128 million in capital expenditures during the quarter, and we continue to target capital spending of $780 million for the year, which is 8% of adjusted net revenue. Our net leverage position was under 3.2x at the end of the first quarter. We executed share repurchases of approximately $450 million in the quarter.\nOur balance sheet remains extremely healthy, and we ended the period with approximately $3.8 billion of available liquidity. Our total indebtedness is 94% fixed with a weighted average cost of debt of 3.5%.\nTurning to the outlook for 2025. We are reaffirming our outlook for adjusted net revenue, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share. Specifically, we currently expect constant currency adjusted net revenue growth of 5% to 6% over 2024, excluding dispositions.\nWe continue to expect dispositions will impact reported adjusted net revenue by over 300 basis points. We now expect a headwind from foreign currency exchange rates to be just over 100 basis points for the year roughly 50 basis points lower than the 175 basis point impact we guided to previously, given the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar.\nWe expect the impact to be relatively consistent across our Merchant and Issuer businesses. We are forecasting annual adjusted operating margin to expand approximately 50 basis points for 2025, excluding the effect of dispositions. At the segment level, we continue to expect our Merchant business to deliver adjusted net revenue growth of roughly 6% on a constant currency basis, excluding dispositions for the full year.\nWe still expect roughly 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for this business, excluding dispositions in 2025. Moving to Issuer Solutions. We continue to anticipate adjusted net revenue growth in the roughly 4% range on a constant currency basis for the full year compared to 2024.\nWe expect adjusted operating margin for the Issuer business to expand by approximately 50 basis points in 2025. In terms of quarterly phasing, we still expect modestly higher growth in the second half relative to the first half of the year as our transformation initiatives ramp as we lap the renewal cycle with many of our large issuer customers and see increased benefits from conversion activity over the course of 2025.\nWe continue to anticipate adjusted free cash flow conversion will be greater than 90% for the full year. Regarding capital allocation. As we communicated when we announced the Worldpay and Issuer Solutions transaction, we are focused on being 3.5x net levered at close, but we'll remain opportunistic with regards to share repurchases over the balance of the year. And if we execute additional divestitures, the proceeds will continue to be used to enhance shareholder returns.\nAnd finally, we still expect to be approximately 3x net levered at the end of 2025. Putting it all together, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% for the full year on a constant currency basis. We expect adjusted EPS growth to be consistent with the quarterly phasing dynamics I highlighted.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Cameron.\n\nCameron M. Bready\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThanks, Josh. I hope you now have a clear appreciation for why we are so incredibly excited about the Worldpay acquisition and how the announced transactions will sharpen our strategic focus, accelerate our transformation and meaningfully enhance our financial profile and ability to deliver sustainable performance.\nImportantly, this aligns exactly with the approach we outlined for unlocking value at our investor conference last September. At the end of the day, the divestiture of Issuer Solutions and acquisition of Worldpay represents a unique opportunity to catalyze our transformation in a more significant way. while supporting our efforts to streamline amplify our business to accelerate longer-term growth and value creation. Worldpay could not be a better fit for our Merchant business and our strategy.\nIt is a highly complementary business that expands our global footprint, broadens our product base, enhances our go-to market, diversifies our business across an SMB and enterprise customer base and overall makes us a stronger and more durable commerce solutions provider built for the long run.\nAnd our transformation agenda provides the ideal foundation for the combined business going forward. Over the next year, while we are working to close the transaction, we will continue to progress the key transformation initiatives that serve to make us a more nimble and agile organization with a product-led customer-centric mindset, while also preparing to execute on the Worldpay integration.\nWe have high conviction in line of sight to the cost savings as well as the revenue synergies from the acquisition, particularly from enhancement opportunities fueled by our complementary solutions and scale. We will approach this integration differently than we have in the past with an uncompromising plan for aligning our operating model fully unifying our businesses and value realization.\nWe are exiting the quarter on a strong footing and have confidence in our 2025 and medium-term outlook. I want to thank our entire team for their hard work and dedication to our clients and business. We could not be more excited about the combination of Global Payments and Worldpay and look forward to bringing this transaction to close. This combination enhances our competitive strength, opens new opportunities and accelerates our growth trajectory while maximizing value creation and amplifying our capital return expectations.\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nBefore we begin our question-and-answer session, I'd like to ask everyone to limit their questions to 1 with 1 follow-up to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions."

Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron.\n\nCameron M. Bready\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThanks, Winnie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.\nWe are proud of all that we accomplished in 2024. It was a pivotal year for Global Payments as we saw our broad transformation agenda to set the future course for our business, while also delivered strong operational and financial performance. We started our transformation journey by reimagining our mission, vision and values, to provide the organization with a clear view of our priority and desired culture, setting the foundation for us to pursue our ambition to be the worldwide partner of choice for commerce solutions.\nWe then refreshed our strategy to focus our efforts and investments in the area of the business that will drive the most attractive opportunities for growth and where we are best positioned to compete and win. From there, we undertook a holistic review of our business to determine how to best position the organization to execute against a focused strategy and deliver sustainable performance.\nWe used the first principles approach to examining growth drivers, market positioning, go-to-market capabilities, product portfolios and the potential to optimize our assets. This review led to a realignment of our operating model and business structure, as well as the operational transformation program that we described at our investor conference in September.\nWe are continuing to execute against a significant number of initiatives that will create meaningful benefits and provide us with incremental capacity for reinvestment to drive growth and, quite simply, run the business.\nWhile executing on our transformation, we have continued to deliver strong financial performance. For the fourth quarter, we produced 6.5% constant currency growth, excluding dispositions, including over 7% in the Merchant business and 3% in our Issuer business, an acceleration sequentially from Q3 and consistent with the outlook we provided in October.\nAnd for the full year, we delivered 6% adjusted net revenue growth, record adjusted operating margins and double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, consistent with our initial outlook detailed at the beginning of 2024 despite the incremental FX headwinds absorbed. We also generated roughly $3 billion of adjusted free cash flow and returned $1.8 billion to shareholders, including proceeds from the recent divestiture of our AdvancedMD business.\nOur consistent performance throughout the year highlights the durability of our model and benefits of our sharpened focus as we execute on our strategic priorities.\nIn our Merchant segment, our POS and software business continues to deliver strong results. Our POS solutions are robust and are winning in the restaurant and retail verticals, as evidenced by the high teens new locations growth we achieved in 2024. Our POS growth benefited from the strong performance of our direct channel in North America, where notably we saw a roughly 25% increase in the annual recurring revenue opportunity with new customers. And we could not be more excited about the significant opportunity ahead as we consolidate our products and platforms under the Genius brand and extend them globally.\nNotably, we expanded our relationship with one of the largest multinational QSRs in the fourth quarter to include drive-through solutions in addition to our existing kitchen management partnership that spans several thousand locations in North America. We also expanded our long-standing partnership as the primary technology partner for Warner Burger, which now includes cloud POS, kiosks and menu boards.\nAdditionally, we continue to have success in the stadium and events vertical and are excited to have reached an agreement with Highcatch Sports Park, Hong Kong's new state-of-the-art multipurpose sports and entertainment venue. We also renewed and expanded our POS partnership with a multinational entertainment company to support its major events in the U.K. and Ireland over a multiyear period. Importantly, our relationship will now include our loyalty solutions, enabling reward offers and personalized experiences for event attendees.\nOther notable new stadium POS relationships achieved in 2024 include the Newcastle, Birmingham City, Nottingham Farms Football Clubs, as well as an expanded partnership with Black Pool, which now includes PayLink solutions, ticketing services, kiosk and QR code ordering in addition to POS and payments.\nOf course, we executed a new partnership with Diamond Baseball Holdings to serve as the official commerce technology partner for its Minor League Baseball franchises in the United States and Canada earlier in 2024. We remain on track to be fully rolled out with our solutions in an additional 19 ballparks across Diamond Club's portfolio for a total of 32 before the 2025 season opens in April.\nIn our education business, new sales with university customers increased more than 30% in 2024, including a number of new significant international wins across the U.K. and Ireland as well as in Canada. We also added 113 new K through 12 adult school districts this year, a roughly 20% increase from 2023. And with the addition of the Los Angeles Unified School District, we now have relationships with the 3 largest school districts in the United States.\nIn the real estate vertical, we signed more than 800 new property management customers during the year, while also expanding our partnerships with leading real estate software platform providers, like MRI Software, Rent Manager and AppFolio, which will allow us to cross-sell additional product services to their customers.\nTurning to Integrated embedded, new SB partner signings increased 34% across our integrated payments offerings in 2024 compared to the prior year. Notably, we also added 165 international ISV partnerships across the U.K., Asia, Australia and LatAm, as we seek to better align our activities and capabilities globally.\nWe also recently expanded our relationship with PayPal to simplify and accelerate the checkout experience by integrating its fast lane solution into our platform, furthering our efforts to deliver embedded solutions. This collaboration extends the payment choices we can offer across the U.S., allowing our customers to enhance their digital experiences for their consumers.\nMoving to core payments. Our focus on forming deeper relationships with commerce enablement and outstanding services, driving significant opportunities with both new and existing partners globally. We continue to make strong progress with Commerzbank in Germany and have already onboarded over 2,000 merchants since the inception of our joint venture midyear.\nAdditionally, we saw double-digit growth in other key geographies, including Central Europe, Poland and Greece in 2024, as well as in LatAm, where we benefit from strong secular payment trends in Mexico.\nShifting to Issuer Solutions, we were pleased with our operational execution throughout the year. We successfully completed 17 customer implementations in 2024 and ended the year with record traditional accounts on file of $885 million. We continue to have a strong conversion pipeline of more than 70 million accounts that extends well into 2026, as well as an additional 6 letters of intent with institutions worldwide.\nIn 2024, we completed 17 multiyear renewals and new customer partnerships. This includes contracts with KeyBank, Financial and Van City executed in the fourth quarter. In addition to significant agreements with Navy Federal Credit Union, Virgin Money, Citizens, NatWest and several other premier global clients that we announced earlier this year. And over the last few years, we've renewed 15 of our top 20 clients, reflecting the strength of our partnerships and providing us good visibility and stability going forward.\nWe also continue to make substantial progress with our technology modernization program. Development of our client-facing applications was completed in the fourth quarter, consistent with our plan, and we remain on track for full commercial launch in 2025. We have more than a dozen pilots in progress with existing customers, and are on track to have 33 client pilots in production this year.\nWe recently achieved certification of our cloud authorization platform with Visa and Mastercard. By the end of 2025, we'll be exclusively selling cloud capabilities, paving the way for widespread adoption of these modernized solutes.\nAcross the business, our ambitious transformation agenda will enable us to deliver our rich portfolio of capabilities and solutions through all of our channels in a more frictionless way. While still early days, we are already making great progress across 3 primary focus areas.\nFirst, as we discussed at our investor conference, we have identified meaningful opportunities to streamline and simplify the business. In December, we successfully closed on the sale of AdvancedMD we announced last quarter. Further, we're in the process of exiting several small markets in Asia Pacific this quarter, where we are subscale and see limited opportunity for expansion.\nWith these actions, we have exited a little more than $300 million of the $500 million to $600 million of adjusted net revenue we targeted through our portfolio review. We are pleased with how these initiatives position us to better focus on where we are differentiated and have the right to win, and are continuing to advance other targeted divestitures and exits that will further streamline our business.\nWe have also completed other initiatives designed to simplify our business structure. During the fourth quarter, we successfully acquired CaixaBank stake in our joint venture with Erste Group. This business has achieved exceptional growth over the past decade, and we are excited about the opportunity to capture more of the economics going forward, while simplifying our pan-European operations and governance.\nWe also recently reached an agreement to purchase HSBC stake in our joint venture in Mexico. This creates the opportunity to combine our 2 existing businesses in Mexico, allowing us to harmonize our go-to-market strategy, drive scale, amplify investments and increase efficiencies.\nSecond, we are working to fully unlock the growth potential of our best capabilities, while leveraging all of our distribution networks across the globe. To accomplish this, we have reoriented our business under a single unified operating model and have successfully consolidated our technology teams under common leadership, centralized our operating functions and have unified our Merchant Solutions business into a homogeneous worldwide organization.\nThis better positions us to harmonize our best products and capabilities globally, including aligning our point-of-sale solutions under a common brand, Genius. We now completed the full branding work on Genius and will launch our solutions for the restaurant and retail verticals in the U.S. beginning in the second quarter.\nNotably, we will go live with our Genius restaurant solutions for small- to medium-sized customers this May, in tandem with the National Restaurant Association Conference. Simultaneously, we will also launch our Genius retail solution for SMB businesses. In September, we will extend the retail offering to additional sub-verticals and introduced the Genius enterprise restaurant solution at the Foodservice Technology Conference, which is attended by more than 100 of the leading QSR and restaurant chains.\nWe will begin rolling out Genius international markets in the second half of the year, including in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic. In early 2026, we will bring Genius to additional markets, including Ireland and Spain, followed by Romania, Poland and Australia, shortly thereafter.\nWe're also making progress [indiscernible] our technology capabilities across our POS platform. And by the end of the year, solutions such as online ordering and delivery, accounting applications, marketing and loyalty, service vertical functionality and third-party integrations will be ubiquitously available from a common platform across our Genius offerings.\nAdditionally, we're already driving synergies by leveraging a number of common capabilities. This includes aligning our hardware platforms, streamlining invoicing, consolidating support functions and reducing SKUs.\nAs we converge our platforms over time, we have set the road map to migrate customers using legacy platforms to Genius. We defined upgrade paths that will provide for a seamless transition to a best-of-breed cloud solution that will delight merchants and their customers, while also providing us with significant cross-sell and upsell opportunities. We also intend to fully leverage our distribution channels to extend our Genius POS solutions globally.\nOur sales teams, dealers and FI and wholesale partners have already had extensive opportunities to preview Genius, and the reception has been overwhelmingly positive with significant excitement about the upcoming launch.\nAnother important initiative we are pursuing is our Sales Force of the Future program, which started with our direct sales teams in the U.S. and will extend to international regions later this year. This includes upscaling and retooling our sales organization, aligning incentives to accelerate cross-selling, reimagining our marketing and lead generation efforts, enhancing underwriting and onboarding process, and improving our approach to provisioning and activating new merchants.\nAs part of this, we have already rolled out a modernized and revamped competition plan in our FI partner channel and to our POS sales organization. We are extending this plan to additional U.S. sales teams over the course of the year.\nOur strategic focus on delivering a full suite of differentiated software and commerce enablement solutions across our business. As one example, in Issuer Solutions, we launched several key strategic partnerships in the fourth quarter, including with Engaged People, Blackhawk Network, and one of the largest global technology companies that will serve to advance our loyalty platform capabilities to enhance distribution an extended point accumulation and redemption options.\nAnd third, we will leverage our technology leadership to be a more nimble and agile business while increasing our efficiency and effectiveness. As I previously noted, we have consolidated all of our technology organizations and teams under a common leadership. Our technology development and operations were fragmented, resulting in duplication of effort and investments, a lack of standardized tools and practices and a somewhat inefficient operating environment. With this change, we're becoming a more nimble and agile organization with a customer and product-centric mindset focused on speed and quality of product development.\nTo support these efforts, we recently completed a small transaction to acquire a modern, real-time processing and orchestration platform. This technology allows us to leverage and distribute products more easily across multiple platforms and geographies seamlessly, increasing our speed to market and accelerating progress towards our target architectural model.\nIt also allows us to eliminate certain third-party providers and streamline our technology operating environments globally. We are already leveraging the platform in Central Europe and Germany and will extend this technology architecture across all of our European markets over the next 6 to 12 months.\nAcross the company, we are also focused on improving cycle times for new product development and enhancing productivity. This evolution includes modernizing developer tools, including GenAI-supported software development, as well as standardizing tooling and lending processes changes to better identify customer needs and accelerate product launches.\nEarly results have already shown double-digit productivity improvements in developers leveraging our GenAI Code Assist tool and a near 10% reduction in codeployment time utilizing our modernized tool sets. We anticipate beginning to realize the benefits of these efforts in the second half of the year. The majority of process and technology enhancements in place by year-end to support our identified priorities.\nFurther, we are continuing to invest in driving differentiation through service. We have multiple programs underway that leverage GenAI to enhance support offerings for customers. This includes an initiative to replace our global support center software solution to modernize call flows, expand omnichannel and digital engagements, increase agent routing and incorporate AI-powered knowledge management. This will allow our support center teams to improve response times and enhance customer experience by better leveraging automation.\nWe expect to have the new platform fully implemented by the fourth quarter of 2025.\nGiven the early milestones we've achieved and our ongoing progress, we are now expecting our operational transformation initiatives to unlock more than $600 million of annual run rate operating income benefit by the first half of 2027. This is an increase from our initial outlook of more than $500 million.\nI could not be more pleased with the performance of our team members whose passion, ingenuity and relentless pursuit of excellence enabled our success over the last 12 months. As we begin 2025, I remain confident we were doing all the right things to unify and streamline our business, invigorate our go-to-market equities, leverage our best products and capabilities, and amplify our investments to unlock value and position our business for sustainable growth and success. Josh?\n\nJoshua J. Whipple\n\nSenior EVP and Chief Strategy & Enterprise Risk Officer, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Cameron. We are pleased with our financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year, which were consistent with our expectations. I'm particularly proud that we delivered these results while simultaneously executing on our transformation agenda.\nStarting with the full year 2024. We delivered adjusted net revenue of $9.15 billion, an increase of 6% from the prior year, which includes slightly less than 1 point headwind from currency and the disposition of AdvancedMD. Adjusted operating margin for the full year improved 40 basis points to 45%. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $11.55, an increase of 11% compared to the full year 2023.\nFor the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $2.29 billion, an increase of 5%. On a constant currency basis, excluding dispositions, adjusted net revenue increased approximately 6.5%. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 40 basis points to 45.2%. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, an increase of 11% or 12% on a constant currency basis.\nTaking a closer look at performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.76 billion for the fourth quarter, reflecting growth of 6% or more than 7% on a constant currency basis, excluding dispositions. As Cameron noted, we closed our AdvancedMD disposition in December, which is roughly 1 point of impact in the quarter.\nThis performance represents an acceleration compared to the third quarter, consistent with our expectations, driven by our POS and software and integrated and embedded businesses, both of which achieved high single-digit growth during the period.\nStarting with POS and software, new cloud POS solution from SMB customers that launched midyear and our rebranding of Genius drove a roughly 35% increase and new POS rooftops in the fourth quarter over the prior year period. This strong demand is being driven by the new software bundles, countertop hardware choices and embedded commerce enablement solutions available through the platform, which includes a leading new feature functionality such as our virtual terminal offering, cash discounting surcharging solution, paid by tax elink capabilities, order ahead and invoicing solutions, to name a few.\nTurning to the integrated and embedded channel, our ISV business added 76 new ISV partners during the fourth quarter with 32 of these wins achieved in international regions. Several of the larger software partners we signed this quarter include [indiscernible] in the salon vertical, DRx in Pharmacy Management, and Chamber Nation, which provides member management, automation and digital media solutions.\nOur core payments business delivered mid-single-digit growth for the fourth quarter on a constant currency basis, with several international businesses notable bright spots. Specifically, Central Europe, Poland, Greece and LatAm achieved double-digit growth as we continue to benefit from the strong secular payment trends in these markets.\nWe delivered an adjusted operating margin of 48.3% in the Merchant segment, an increase of 60 basis points compared to the prior year. This performance reflects strong execution on a refocused strategy and ongoing synergy realization from the acquisition of Eagle Payments. We've now executed our targeted expense synergies from EVO and on track to achieve $135 million in annual run rate expense synergies as anticipated.\nOur Issuer Solutions business produced adjusted net revenue of $542 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting growth of 3% on a constant currency basis, largely driven by a 200 basis point sequential improvement in transaction volumes. This was led by strength in consumer card transactions, consistent with the trends highlighted by several of our large FI partners this quarter.\nCommercial card volumes remain largely consistent with the trends that we saw in the third quarter as corporates continue to take a more cautious approach to spending. Separately, we've seen more of a return to normalcy in terms of product and service investment by bank customers, and continue to have a healthy implementation pipeline in 2025.\nWe added a total of 26 million traditional accounts on file this quarter, largely driven by the growth with the existing customers. Our strategy of aligning with market share winners continues to drive benefits, and our near record implementation pipeline and the completion of our renewal cycle with many of our large customers gives us confidence in the growth outlook for the business going forward.\nMoving to our B2B portfolio. The core mid-market segment for our AP automation solutions continues to make solid bookings in the quarter, albeit at a slightly moderated pace earlier in the year due to macro trends. Additionally, in our pay card business, we continued to see softer hiring trends in the segments of the market we serve, which again negatively impacted growth this quarter by nearly a point.\nFinally, Issuer Solutions delivered an adjusted operating margin of 46.9%. This improved sequentially from our third quarter performance, largely driven by better volumes, but represented a modest decline compared to the prior year period, as we continue to lap strong margin expansion we realized in this business last year while also embedding in modernization.\nFrom a cash flow standpoint, we've reduced strong adjusted free cash flow for the quarter of approximately $814 million, representing roughly 110% conversion rate of adjusted net income to adjusted free cash flow. For the full year, adjusted free cash flow was $2.7 billion, representing a roughly 95% conversion rate of adjusted net income to adjusted free cash flow, consistent with our guidance.\nWe invested $184 million in capital expenditures during the quarter, $675 million for the full year, equating to roughly 7% of revenue, which was in line with our guidance. Our net leverage position decreased to 3.2x at the end of the fourth quarter and is now consistent with our long-term target as forecasted.\nIn connection with the closing of the AdvancedMD transaction in December, we repaid $500 million in senior notes that matured in the quarter and returned $650 million to shareholders through our accelerated share repurchase plan and additional market purchases. For the full year, we repurchased 12.7 million shares for $1.5 billion or roughly 5% of our shares outstanding.\nOur [indiscernible] remains extremely healthy, and we ended the period with $3.8 billion of available liquidity. Our total indebtedness is 100% fixed, with a weighted average cost of debt of 36%.\nTurning to the outlook for 2025. We are pleased with how our business is positioned as we execute against our refocused strategy and our expectations are consistent with the medium-term outlook we provided at our investor conference in September.\nSpecifically, we currently expect constant currency adjusted net revenue growth of 5% to 6% over 2024, excluding dispositions. We expect dispositions will impact reported adjusted net revenue by over 300 basis points. We are forecasting annual adjusted operating margin to expand approximately 50 basis points for 2025, excluding the effect of dispositions.\nTo provide color at the segment level, we expect our Merchant business to deliver adjusted net revenue growth of roughly 6% on a constant currency basis, excluding dispositions for the full year. We expect roughly 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expense for the business, excluding dispositions in 2025.\nMoving to Issuer Solutions. We're anticipating adjusted net revenue growth in roughly 4% range on a constant currency basis for the full year compared to 2024. We anticipate adjusted operating margin for the Issuer business to expand by approximately 50 basis points in 2025. In terms of quarterly phasing, we expect modestly higher growth in the second half relative to the first half of the year as our transformation initiatives ramp and as we lap the renewal cycle with many of our large issuer customers and see increased benefits from conversion activity over the course of 2025.\nMoving to a couple of nonoperating items. We currently expect net interest expense to be roughly $500 million this year, and for our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. We're also planning for our capital expenditures to be around $780 million in 2025 or approximately 8% of revenue, which is consistent with the outlook we provided at our investor conference. We anticipate adjusted free cash flow conversion to be greater than 90% for the full year, which again is in line with the expectations we outlined in September.\nRegarding capital allocation, we expect to return approximately $2 billion to shareholders during the year. To that end, we are entering into an accelerated share repurchase plan for $250 million. If we execute additional divestitures in 2025, the proceeds will be used to further enhance shareholder returns. We also plan to further reduce our indebtedness during the year.\nPutting it all together, we expect adjusted earnings per share growth for the full year to be in the range of 10% to 11% on a constant currency basis. We expect adjusted earnings per share growth to be consistent with the quarterly phasing dynamics I detailed in my earlier remarks.\nThis 2025 guidance is the same as the outlook we provided at our investor conference in September and reflects the strategic initiatives we are undertaking through our transformation in addition to a stable macro environment. With significant recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we now expect currency to be a headwind of roughly 175 basis points, both adjusted net revenue and adjusted earnings per share.\nFinally, as you may recall at our investor conference, we mentioned we have been evaluating our reporting structure, including how to treat items like stock-based compensation. Beginning in the first quarter, we will include share-based compensation expense and our adjusted results to better align our convention with our peers. We will update our reporting accordingly at that time, however, we do not expect any change to the growth outlook that we provided today.\nAdditionally, we also plan to change the presentation of cash flows for settlement assets and obligations and certain funds held for customers, moving the changes in items from operating to financing cash flows similar to the convention recently adopted by certain of our peers.\nIn summary, we are pleased with the progress we've made since beginning our transformation. Our focus remains simplifying our operations, strengthening our core businesses and returning capital to shareholders. And we are confident that we have good forward momentum as we execute against our refocused strategy.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Cameron.\n\nCameron M. Bready\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThanks, Josh. We accomplished a great deal over the past year and are very much on track with our ambitious transformation journey. In 2025, we will execute and complete much of our transformation agenda, positioning us to accelerate growth and deliver on the medium-term financial goals we established in September.\nWe are changing for the better, playing to our competitive strengths, leveraging what we already have and focusing our energy and investments on the most attractive opportunities where we can differentiate in the market. As we enter the next chapter of our growth journey, we strongly believe we are poised to capture and unlock significant value with our renewed strategic focus and clarity.\nWe have an enviable portfolio of assets delivering sustainable organic top line growth in a significant untapped TAM. Our transformation is unleashing an already successful business to deliver all of our solutions to all of our channels in a more frictionless way and drive higher return on invested capital. And we are committed to shareholder value creation, targeting returns of $7.5 billion over the next 3 years. We're exactly on track with where we want to be in our transformation, and remain as enthusiastic as ever about the future of the business. Winnie?\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Cameron. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Operator, we'll now go to questions."

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference will be recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Winnie Smith. Please go ahead.\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Global Payments Second Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call can be found on the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpayments.com.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today's conference call contain forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results. These statements are subject to risks uncertainties and other factors, including the impact of economic conditions on our future operations that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.

Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron.\n\nCameron M. Bready\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThanks, Winnie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with our performance for the second quarter, driven by consistent execution of our strategy focused on being the worldwide partner of choice for commerce solutions. Specifically, we achieved 6% adjusted net revenue growth or 7% excluding the impact of the divestiture of Netspend's consumer assets and delivered adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% in the quarter. We also expanded adjusted operating margins 40 basis points as we continue to drive efficiency in our business, leveraging the scale position we enjoy in our core markets and realized synergy benefit from the EVO acquisition.\nThere are a number of noteworthy highlights to cover this morning. Starting with Merchant Solutions, we delivered high single-digit organic growth, largely driven by our differentiated capabilities across our integrated software and point-of-sale businesses, as market demand for embedded payments and commerce enablement solutions continues to accelerate.\nOur integrated business saw double-digit growth in the quarter aided by continued strong booking trends and business development results, with new ISV partner signings up 30% year-to-date. Our ongoing success in identifying and signing new ISVs in this channel is partly attributable to our progressive payment facilitation solution, or ProFac, which we launched mid last year. Active merchants on this solution have increased 40% and average merchant volumes have improved 60% since the end of 2023.\nWe remain confident in our competitive positioning in this market and are investing in our capabilities to ensure we preserve our leadership position. We continue to focus on differentiating ourselves by; one, our ability to meet the specific needs of our partners by leveraging the breadth and depth of our solutions; and two, the expansive additional embedded commerce capabilities we can attach to the underlying payments relationship.\nWith both new and existing integrated partners, we are seeing an improvement in the average annual revenue opportunity with new merchants as we focus on cross-selling commerce enablement solutions. This includes human capital management and payroll, loyalty and marketing, analytics and customer engagement solutions as well as B2B software. Speaking of B2B, it is worth noting that we continue to see increased demand for our B2B acceptance solutions as we further leverage the PayFabric platform we acquired with EVO.\nOur proprietary integrations with some of the most widely used ERP environments in the market are critical to delivering the embedded frictionless automation necessary to improve process efficiencies for our customers. We saw more than a 50% increase in new ISV partnerships, leveraging our PayFabric capabilities in the second quarter as more B2B spend shifts to digital channels.\nIn our vertical markets businesses, we saw double-digit growth in software bookings this quarter with particular strength in education, real estate and health care. Notable wins include a new partnership with the Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest in the U.S., which will leverage our full suite of capabilities across point of sale, my school bucks, cafeteria management as well as our back-of-house solutions. With this addition, we now have partnerships with the 3 largest school districts in the United States.\nOur real estate business signed a new partnership with YES Communities, a leading provider of manufactured housing communities across the United States, and expanded existing relationships with community association solutions company, Associated Asset Management, and commercial and residential real estate service provider, Tobin Capital Group. Also this quarter, we launched a new residential payouts product to streamline and automate the return of secure deposits, which we are already successfully cross-selling to customers.\nWe also saw strong growth in our point-of-sale software business this quarter, adding roughly 3,500 new locations. Demand for our point-of-sale and embedded commerce solutions remained strong across the segments of the restaurant and retail verticals we target. Our solutions are designed to grow with the customers' business, leveraging a common technology stack that enables customers to easily add functionality as they expand. This allows us to serve the small end of the SMB market, and scale with merchants as they grow while also addressing the more complex needs of quick service restaurants in sports and entertainment venues.\nTo that end, we are excited to announce a new partnership with Diamond Baseball Holdings to serve as the official commerce technology partner for its Minor League Baseball franchises in the United States and Canada. We are currently installed in 13 of these stadiums, and we expect to fully roll out our solutions at additional ballparks across Diamond's club portfolio before the 2025 season opens.\nWe also signed new stadium partnerships with multiple U.K. football clubs, including Newcastle, Birmingham City and Nottingham Forest during the quarter. And we are proud to have supported a major professional football championship across multiple stadiums, a grand slam tennis tournament and a major golf tournament with our point-of-sale and payment solutions in Europe this summer.\nWe also went live this quarter with a leading Parks and Entertainment Company and are now providing the food and beverage and retail point-of-sale solutions at its theme park locations in Florida. And we continue to see great momentum in food service management, where we are the partner of choice to the 3 largest players in the space, which drove a 20% improvement in related bookings this quarter.\nIn the restaurant and retail verticals in North America, where our POS software is targeted towards SMB and mid-market customers, in addition to strong root top growth, we achieved a greater than 70% attach rate of our embedded commerce solutions with new customers. It's just one example, we are seeing significant demand for loyalty and marketing tools with locations leveraging our customer engagement software increasing over 100% this quarter compared to the prior year.\nAdditionally, we are pleased with the market reception of our recently released next-generation point-of-sale software, including the improved user interface, our intuitive experience across iOS and Android-based devices and the mobile-first design that drives best-in-class omnichannel experiences for our merchants and their consumers. While still early days, these new offerings are benefiting our performance, and we expect a more meaningful contribution to revenue in 2025 as we gain scale.\nWe also continue to see good momentum expanding our point-of-sale offerings into markets outside of the U.S. It's worth highlighting that we have begun piloting our point-of-sale offering in Germany and anticipate a full commercial launch next month. We also remain on track to bring our point-of-sale software to key additional international markets, including Mexico, Ireland, Poland, Austria and Romania over the next 12 to 15 months.\nIn Germany, our Commerzbank joint venture, Commerz Globalpay, went live this quarter, and we are off to a fantastic start. While we are just beginning to leverage Commerzbank's relationships with its roughly 26,000 corporate clients and almost 11 million private and small business customers, we are already seeing strong lead generation and substantial opportunities to further digitize the payment experience, while also allowing us to build a scale business in this attractive market.\nLastly, we are continuing to see strong demand for our pan-European solutions. Notably, we are realizing attractive growth in the EV charging sector and recently signed a partnership with a major European energy provider to support the expansion of public charging solutions throughout Central Europe. We also made 2 small tuck-in acquisitions in Europe this quarter to continue to improve our strategic positioning.\nThe first was the acquisition of Takepayments, a small provider of payment solutions to SMB merchants in the U.K. Takepayments serves to meaningfully diversify and expand our direct distribution capability and demand generation solutions as the U.K. market continues to evolve beyond traditional bank-based referral channels. It also provides attractive opportunities for us to cross-sell our commerce enablement solutions into its customer base. This investment allows us to reorient our distribution approach in the U.K. market with leading demand-gen capabilities and represents opportune timing as we are starting to see some signs of stability in the U.K. market more broadly.\nWe have a strong pipeline of new business here with the hospitality and unattended verticals notable bright spots, including our recent win of Virgin's hotel business in the U.K.\nThe second acquisition at the end of the quarter was of an early stage technology development company that we were previously partnering with in Europe to drive our terminal on mobile offerings. Given the strong demand we have seen for our terminal on mobile offerings and the expected long-term importance they will play to our point-of-sale plans, it was strategically important for us to bring this technology in-house to unify our offerings globally and to control the entire value stack enabling our solutions.\nMoving to Issuer Solutions. We continue to see strong execution across our business. We completed 2 large conversions this quarter, which, in combination with existing customer growth, drove a healthy increase in accounts on file sequentially. We also have a near-record implementation pipeline of more than 65 million accounts and 7 active LOIs. Further, we are having ongoing success in cross-selling our value-added service solutions and completed 30 product implementations for existing clients this quarter across our fraud, virtual card and communications platforms.\nFrom a macro perspective and similar to what you heard from our FI partners in the networks, we saw a modest deceleration in transaction volumes this quarter, which was largely driven by commercial card activity. We recently renewed our multi-decade issuer relationship with NatWest spanning both its consumer and commercial portfolios, cementing our position with one of the largest and most active clients in Europe.\nNatWest recently announced its acquisition of Sainsbury Bank further highlighting the importance of our strategy to align ourselves with market share winners. We look forward to opportunities to continue to expand our partnership with them in the future.\nAdditionally, we have now launched our partnership with Outpayce, a leading global travel technology company owned by Amadeus, providing issuer solutions technology for its platforms across Europe. Outpayce is our first fintech customer operating in our AWS cloud environment in Europe, with many other clients in the pipeline.\nMost importantly, we also continue to make progress on our issuer modernization program and remain on track to complete the development of our client-facing applications this year. We have already initiated customer pilots and continue to expect commercial launch next year. Through modernization, we meaningfully increased our addressable market by broadening our opportunity set to include mid-market and smaller banks in addition to new geographies. Our investments also drive greater enablement capabilities for our clients and allow our leading applications and solutions to be more easily consumable by fintechs who are developing new use cases around cards.\nShifting to B2B, we are seeing good trends in new bookings for our AP automation software in our core mid-market segment, while virtual card spend continues to ramp. Additionally, we signed several notable new customers for our employer solutions, including relationships with TERRA Staffing Group and Rainbow Pizza, which operates nearly 50 Domino's locations throughout Texas. We also renewed partnerships with AMC Theatres and Cracker Barrel.\nBefore I turn the call over to Josh, I would like to highlight the appointment of Bob Cortopassi as the President and Chief Operating Officer of Global Payments. Bob is a proven growth-oriented leader and operator as well as a trusted colleague with an exceptional track record of managing key businesses across our organization during his 12-year tenure with the company. Most recently, Bob served as our Senior Executive Vice President and President of International and Vertical Markets for our Merchant Solutions business and previously led our integrated business for nearly a decade. I look forward to partnering with Bob, and I'm confident in the role he will play in our company's continued future success.\nJosh?\n\nJoshua J. Whipple\n\nSenior EVP and Chief Strategy & Enterprise Risk Officer, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Cameron. Our solid finance performance for the second quarter was consistent with our expectations and reflects continued strong execution across our business despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. We delivered adjusted net revenue of $2.32 billion for the quarter, an increase of 6% from the prior year or 7% excluding the impact of the Netspend divestiture. Our reported adjusted net revenue includes a roughly 50 basis point headwind from adverse foreign currency exchange rates relative to the second quarter of 2023.\nAdjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points to 45.2% and we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.93, an increase of 12% compared to the same period in 2023.\nTaking a closer look at performance by segment, Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.8 billion for the second quarter, reflecting growth of 8%. This includes less than 1 point of contribution from the acquisition of Takepayments, which offset the roughly 50 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates during the period.\nOur U.S. business delivered high single-digit growth in the quarter as we continue to benefit from our software-centric strategy, with both our integrated payments and point-of-sale businesses delivering double-digit growth for the period. We also saw strength in our vertical markets portfolio with our real estate, higher education and health care solutions being notable bright spots. Outside of the U.S., we achieved mid-single-digit organic growth in Europe with notable strength across our faster-growth geographies, including Poland and Greece. We were also pleased to see trends start to stabilize in the United Kingdom.\nSeparately, our Lat Am business realized double-digit growth as we continue to benefit from the strong secular payment trends in Mexico. This performance was partially offset by ongoing weakness in the macroeconomic environment in Asia Pacific. We delivered adjusted operating margin of 48.8% in the Merchant segment, an increase of 30 basis points, reflecting ongoing sequential improvement since completing the acquisition of EVO Payments last year as expected.\nWe are executing against our synergy plans related to the EVO transaction and we remain on track to achieve $135 million in run rate expense synergies within 2 years, and integration expenses are continuing to trend lower as we have seen over the last several quarters.\nIssuer Solutions produced adjusted net revenue of $527 million, reflecting growth of over 4%. This includes a roughly 50 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates during the period. This quarter, we added 8 million traditional accounts on file sequentially or nearly 50 million accounts year-over-year, as we continue to benefit from ongoing execution of our conversion pipeline in addition to account growth with our existing FI customers.\nWe've had an especially busy year with new client implementations. Year-to-date, we have completed 9 implementations with over 8 million accounts. I'm especially proud of our team who has delivered these on time and with outstanding quality. We have 6 more implementations to complete for the remainder of the year.\nIssuer transactions increased mid-single digits compared to the second quarter of 2023, which was a modest deceleration from the prior quarter. This was largely driven by softer commercial volumes as businesses take a more cautious approach to spending given the overall level of macroeconomic uncertainty. We also saw a slight acceleration in consumer transaction growth sequentially, similar to what was reported by the networks and our FI partners.\nFocusing on our issuer B2B portfolio, our AP automation software continued to see healthy growth in the core mid-market segment on a normalized basis in the second quarter. And while our Paycard solution is seeing some headwinds from softer employment trends due to the macro environment, we are encouraged by the active new sales pipeline we have in the business.\nIssuer Solutions delivered adjusted operating margin of 46.8% and an increase of 10 basis points compared to the prior year as we continue to drive efficiencies in the business. This was achieved despite facing a difficult comparison. As you may recall, issuer margins expanded 300 basis points during the second quarter of 2023 as we pivoted the business to more technology enablement and away from lower-margin managed services offerings. We've now lapped those related margin benefits.\nFrom a cash flow standpoint, we produced strong adjusted free cash flow for the quarter of approximately $680 million, which is 25% higher than the prior year period. This also represents a roughly 91% conversion rate of adjusted net income to adjusted free cash flow, up from approximately 80% last year. It is worth noting that adjusted free cash flow this quarter included a relatively small positive adjustment related to settlement timing for the period as the second quarter began -- again, ended on a weekend, as it has for the prior 3 quarters. With the third quarter ending on a weekday, we expect the larger impact from the settlement prefunding we saw in the back half of last year to reverse.\nWe invested $179 million in capital expenditures during the quarter and continue to expect capital spending to be around $670 million or roughly 7% of revenue in 2024, and consistent with our long-term targets. Further, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for roughly $100 million in the quarter. Our leverage position was just under 3.5x at the end of the second quarter and we remain on track for our leverage level to be in the low 3s by year-end, consistent with our long-term targets. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we have approximately $3.6 billion of available liquidity. Our total indebtedness is approximately 97% fixed with a weighted average cost of debt of 3.37%.\nTurning to the outlook. We are pleased with how our business is positioned as we begin the second half of the year. We continue to expect reported adjusted net revenue to range from $9.17 billion to $9.30 billion, reflecting growth of 6% to 7% over 2023. This now includes an expectation for foreign currency exchange rates to be a headwind of up to 75 basis points in the second half of the year.\nWe still expect annual adjusted operating margin to expand up to 50 basis points for 2024, driven by the benefits to our business mix from our ongoing shift towards technology enablement, partially offset by the lower margin profile of EVO prior to full synergy realization.\nTo provide color at the segment level, we continue to expect our merchant business to report adjusted net revenue growth of 9-plus percent for the full year. This remains consistent with our prior outlook despite our expectation that unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates will now be a headwind in the back half of the year. We expect these headwinds to be offset by the inclusion of the acquisition of Takepayments that Cameron discussed, which we expect to contribute roughly a point of growth for the second half of the year.\nWe also continue to expect up to 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the merchant business in 2024, with expansion improving in the back half compared to the first half performance as EVO synergy realization ramps.\nMoving to Issuer Solutions. We continue to anticipate adjusted net revenue growth in the 5% to 6% range for the full year compared to 2023. However, given the headwind we now expect from foreign currency exchange rates and the modest deceleration we're seeing in commercial card transactions, we now expect to be at the low end of this range. We still anticipate adjusted operating margin for the issuer business to expand by up to 50 basis points.\nMoving to a couple of nonoperating items. We expect net interest expense to be $500 million this year and for our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 19%, which is consistent with our prior outlook. Putting it all together, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $11.54 to $11.70, reflecting growth of 11% to 12% over 2023. And finally, our outlook continues to reflect the potential for a slightly more tempered economic environment in the second half of 2024.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Cameron.\n\nCameron M. Bready\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThank you, Josh. Moving forward, we remain committed to sharpening our strategic focus and simplifying our business to position Global Payments as the partner of choice for Commerce Solutions in the markets that we believe have the highest potential. We are finalizing the review of our business and began earlier this year. That work has involved a thoughtful and methodical assessment of our assets, which has helped us to identify meaningful opportunities to better align our organization to drive sustainable growth.\nOver the last 2 decades, we have built one of the leading global payments technology companies. As we move into the next phase of growth, we are simplifying our portfolio and streamlining our operations to deliver product-led customer-centric solutions, while continuing to emphasize service is a key differentiator for our business. Ultimately, we expect executing on these initiatives will allow us to gain share, free up capital to invest in innovation and deliver sustainable performance through the cycle. We look forward to providing you with more details on the changes we are making at our investor conference to be held on Tuesday, September 24 in New York City.\nWinnie?\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Cameron. Before we begin our question-and-answer session, I'd like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one with one follow-up to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you.\nOperator, we'll now go to questions."

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Winnie Smith. Please go ahead.\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Global Payments' First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call can be found on the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpayments.com.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today's conference call contain forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the impact of economic conditions on our future operations that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K and subsequent filings. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.\nForward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update them. We will also be referring to several non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance. For a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call to the most comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC regulations, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and our supplemental material available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nJoining me on the call are Cameron Bready, President and CEO; and Josh Whipple, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO. Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron.\n\nCameron M. Bready\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThanks, Winnie, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our first quarter results which were ahead of our expectations as we saw strong execution across our businesses and resilient consumer trends despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment. Specifically, we achieved 7% adjusted net revenue growth and delivered adjusted earnings per share growth of $8, or mid-teens adjusted earnings per share growth, excluding the impact of the divestiture of Netspend's consumer assets. We also expanded margins 40 basis points.\nOur Merchant Solutions business again delivered solid organic growth, driven by our differentiated capabilities across our partnered ISV, vertical markets and point-of-sale businesses as market demand for embedded payment solutions continues to accelerate. Starting with our [indiscernible] channel. We continue to see strong booking trends in business development results, including doubling the number of new strategic integrated partners we signed this quarter compared to the prior year. We have added [ 2 dozen ] new progressive payment facilitation or ProFac partners since we launched this model mid last year, and now have several thousand merchants boarded to our hybrid integrated solution.\nWe are also seeing strong demand for commerce enablement and value-added solutions as we are cross-selling into our partners' merchant base, including human capital management and payroll, loyalty and marketing, analytics and customer engagement solutions, amongst others. Our ability to meet the specific needs of our partners with unrivaled distribution, tailored operating models, a comprehensive suite of products and capabilities and best-in-class service and support, differentiates us in the marketplace and gives us confidence in our ability to sustain growth and expand margins in this business going forward.\nOur unique value proposition for partners has also led us to maintain relatively stable revenue shares over time, while retention rates remain strong. And in the current cost of capital environment, competitors who have historically led with profit in this channel are increasingly focused on striking a balance between growth and profitability, which is to our benefit.\nTurning to point-of-sale software solutions. We again achieved 20% growth in the first quarter, adding 3,000 new locations across our POS platforms. And our focus on delivering additional commerce-enablement solutions to our point-of-sale customers continues to gain momentum. As one example, we saw a nearly 50% increase in the number of new Heartland POS customers leveraging our customer engagement and loyalty solutions this quarter compared to the prior year period. And while in early days, we are encouraged by the initial feedback on the launch of our next-generation Heartland restaurant and retail point-of-sale software, which has been overwhelmingly positive.\nAs a reminder, these next-gen solutions delivered an improved user interface and more intuitive experiences across our iOS and Android based offerings. They are also designed to be mobile first, allowing for a best-in-class omnichannel experience. And we couple our complete commerce-enablement solutions with distinctive distribution and full local service and support that is unrivaled in the market. We expect these new offerings will begin to contribute to our performance later this year and more meaningfully in 2025.\nAdditionally, GP POS, our general purpose cloud-based point-of-sale software, is also contributing to the growth we are seeing. We have now launched this solution in a number of international markets, including Canada, the U.K., Spain and the Czech Republic. We are encouraged by the success we're having in bundling POS and other value-added solutions for our merchant customers in these geographies. We also remain on track to bring GP POS to additional markets outside of the U.S., including Germany, Ireland, Mexico, Poland, Austria and Romania over the next 18 months.\nMoving to our vertical market software business. Today, we own enterprise software solutions across 7 vertical markets, which collectively generate more than $1 billion of adjusted net revenue, growing roughly 10-plus percent annually. These include education, both K-12 and higher ed; communities and events; property management; health care; quick service restaurants and food service management; and sports and entertainment venues. In these verticals, owning the entirety of the technology stack is advantageous as it better allows us to develop highly integrated, vertically fluent software payment and other commerce solutions necessary to meet the needs of the market.\nWe focus on these vertical markets, first and foremost, because of the size of the underlying TAMs. For our own software business, we specifically target large addressable spend markets that represent a meaningful component of overall economic activity globally. Second, and core to our thesis of owning software, we target vertical markets with a strong nexus between software and payments, providing us the ability to further enhance software solutions by embedding payments to drive incremental growth and differentiation. Today, all of our software adds are delivering significant transaction volumes that did not exist prior to our acquisition.\nThird, we like highly fragmented and ideally underpenetrated markets from a software perspective, where we can acquire a flare with leading technology and a significant runway to gain share. Lastly, we generally prefer vertical market software where there is international applicability, allowing us the opportunity to export our solutions to markets outside of the U.S. over time. Our ability to deliver more integrated payments offerings in faster growth geographies where embedded payments are in much earlier stages of development and we have local sales and support, further differentiates Global Payments relative to competition.\nCritical to the success of our own software portfolio is maintaining our focus on building and delivering great software so that we can compete on the basis of product functionality and innovation. Global Payment supports this priority with extensive experience in onshore and offshore development, and we provide efficient sources of capital to invest in growth. Further, we are able to leverage our global scale to deliver technology and administrative services to our software businesses, allowing them to focus their efforts on differentiation in their business, while enhancing their overall scale. And by combining the innovation of our software portfolio with the global reach, efficiency and extensibility of our payments infrastructure, we were able to deliver a unique proposition for our customers.\nWe saw consistent strong execution in our vertical markets businesses in the first quarter, including delivering double-digit bookings growth across the portfolio. Zego, our property management focused software business and newest addition, continued to see strong demand for its solutions in the quarter from new customers, while also successfully cross-selling additional products and solutions to several large existing partners, including Endeavor MHC Residential Communities, My Homepage Property management platform and Apartment Management Consultants.\nIn the communities and event vertical, Active signed nearly 300 customers this quarter. This includes a City of Waterloo, Bogas Basin Ski Resort in Idaho, [indiscernible] Australia and Milestone Events Group.\nTurning to our QSR business. Xenial went live with CosMc's in 3 additional locations in Texas following our initial launch with the McDonald's new concept in Boeing Brook, Illinois in December. We look forward to continuing to future-proof the CosMc's pilot locations with cloud-based technology ecosystem as they opened this year. We also continue to have success cross-selling Xenial technology into the stadium and event venue environment, and we are pleased to have extended our relationship with the Braves by completing the rollout of our technology in 24 retail locations at Truist Park here in Atlanta.\nAdditionally, our higher education business, TouchNet, achieved several notable new international partnerships in the first quarter, including the King University in Canada and Middletech University and Cardiff Metropolitan University in the U.K. And in April, TouchNet recent agreement with Sussex University in Brighton, which marks the fifth new university partnership in the U.K. achieved in the last 6 months. The U.K. serves as a great example of our ability to bring our software solutions to geographies outside of the United States. We have had a strong payment proposition in the U.K. for decades, which we are now successfully leveraging to sell our software solutions as demand for embedded payments and technology is growing in higher education in the region.\nWe also continue to see good momentum in our international markets with stronger secular growth trends in the quarter. Specifically, we achieved double-digit growth in Spain and Central Europe, as well as in Poland and Greece. And our LatAm business continues to be a bright spot as we benefit from the strong secular payment trends in Mexico and Chile. Specifically, we signed a number of large new customers in Mexico during the quarter, including leading insurance company, Qualitas; home goods retailer, Recubre; and video game retailer, Game Planet, as we leverage our omnichannel capabilities and partnership with Citibanamex.\nAnd in Asia Pacific, we were pleased to have expanded our partnership with Marriott International to offer seamless omnichannel solutions to additional locations and geographies. In January, we announced a new partnership with Commerzbank in Germany. We are pleased to have recently received EU regulatory approval and are launching a new joint venture, Commerz Globalpay this month. We are already laying the groundwork to deliver a comprehensive suite of innovative omnichannel payments and software offerings, including our GP POS software solutions and our GP TAM technology at scale, providing merchants the capabilities they need to run and grow their businesses more efficiently in the large economy in Europe.\nShifting to Issuer Solutions, we are delighted to have executed 2 new contracts during the quarter. This includes a new agreement with a large existing FI customer in Europe that significantly expands our debit processing relationship. We also reached a contract agreement with a leading global travel technology company who selected us as its issuer solutions partner for its platform across the U.K. and EU after an extensive RFP process. Once live, this will be our first fintech customer operating in our AWS cloud environment in Europe.\nAdditionally, we successfully executed 8 customer renewals during the quarter. This includes extending our long-standing relationship with Virgin Money in support of its credit card portfolios for a multiyear period. We also successfully renewed our multi-decade relationship with Citizens that spans both its consumer and commercial portfolios and includes a wide range of value-added services, including fraud, royalty and digital engagement amongst other solutions.\nFurther, we executed a multiyear renewal with Scotiabank, one of our premier clients globally. In the first quarter, our issuer team also completed 4 conversions, and we currently have over 60 million accounts on file in the implementation pipeline in addition to 5 active LOIs. Further, we made additional progress on our interim modernization this quarter and now expect to have 4 North American clients piloting multiple modernized cloud services in support of both consumer and commercial portfolios over the next several months.\nWe remain on track to execute dozens of unique cloud issuer platform pilots across the digital services, products and geographies in 2024 and expect to complete the development of our client-facing applications as we prepare for commercial launch next year.\nMoving to B2B. We continue to drive strong growth as we leverage our capabilities across 3 focus areas within the overarching B2B market: software-driven workflow automation, money in and money out funds flows and employer solutions. Our MineralTree business achieved a 30% increase in new bookings during the first quarter, which includes a nearly 60% improvement in new virtual card bookings as adoption continues to accelerate. Additionally, our B2B bookings and merchants increased 100% this quarter compared to the prior year as we are beginning to benefit from the integration of Evo's pay fabric platform and more of this spend shifts towards digital channels.\nOur employer solutions are seeing favorable trends in the restaurant vertical, including signing a new EWA relationship with the White Restaurant Group, which operates over 200 [ waves ] and Taco Bell restaurants within 8,000 employees. We also achieved a tip pay card partnership with Sunshine Restaurant Partners the largest IHOP franchisee with over 140 locations in the Southeast. We are delighted with the progress we are making to accelerate B2B growth as we continue to unify our offerings and refine our strategy in this space.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Josh.\n\nJoshua J. Whipple\n\nSenior EVP and Chief Strategy & Enterprise Risk Officer, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Cameron. We are pleased with the financial performance we achieved in the first quarter, delivering adjusted net revenue of $2.18 billion, an increase of 7% from the same period in the prior year. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 40 basis points to 43.5%. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of EVO payments and dispositions, adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points, highlighting ongoing consistent execution across our businesses. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.59, an increase of 8% compared to the same period in 2023; or mid-teens growth, excluding the impact of dispositions.\nTaking a closer look at performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.68 billion for the first quarter, reflecting growth of 16% and or approximately 8%, excluding the impact of EVO and dispositions. Our performance was ahead of our expectations driven by our U.S. business, which delivered high single-digit growth in the quarter normalized for the contribution of EVO as we continue to benefit from our software-led strategy. 20% plus growth, Cameron highlighted in our POS software business, we also saw strength in our vertical markets portfolio with Zego, TouchNet and AdvancedMD being the notable bright spots.\nWe are also seeing strong bookings in our partner ISV business as we continue our long history of differentiation in the marketplace. Outside of the U.S., we achieved double-digit growth in Spain and Central Europe, as well as in Poland and Greece. Our LATAM business also performed well in the quarter as we benefit from the strong secular payment trends in Mexico and Chile. This performance was partially offset by ongoing weakness in the macroeconomic environment in the United Kingdom and parts of Asia Pacific.\nWe delivered an adjusted operating margin of 47% in the Merchant segment, a decline of 30 basis points due to the acquisition of EVO. This was consistent with our expectations, and we are pleased with the continued sequential improvement we are delivering on our margin performance as we continue to execute against our synergy targets from the EVO transaction.\nRegarding the EVO integration, we've made substantial progress and remain enthusiastic about the synergy opportunities available. Specifically, after realizing 25% of our targeted cost synergies last year, we expect to achieve an additional 50% in 2024. This puts us well on our way to realizing the $135 million in annual run rate expense synergies we expect to achieve within 2 years. As always, we remain focused on sizing expense synergy expectations with an eye towards ensuring that we maintain momentum in the combined business.\nAnd we remain more excited today than when we announced the transaction about the opportunities we have to cross-sell our solutions and capabilities into EVO's existing customer base. In fact, while revenue synergies generally take longer to materialize, we are already having early success in bringing our products to EVO's markets in Europe, notably, e-commerce, GP POS and commerce enablement, as well as certain micro services, including tokenization and fraud solutions. And we also look forward to bringing these products and solutions to LatAm as well. We are continuing to invest in these opportunities across EVO's markets in 2024 and expect them to scale more fully in 2025.\nOur Issuer Solutions business produced adjusted net revenue of $516 million, reflecting growth of 5%. The core issuer business also grew mid-single digits this quarter, driven by ongoing strength in volume-based revenue. This was partially offset by slower growth in Managed and Output Services as we continue to focus our issuer business on more technology enablement. We added nearly 20 million of traditional accounts on file sequentially or 49 million year-over-year, as we continue to benefit from ongoing execution of our conversion pipeline in addition to healthy consumer and commercial account growth with our large existing FI customers.\nDuring the quarter, we completed 4 conversions and achieved 8 renewals. Issuer transactions grew over 6% compared to the first quarter of 2023, led by commercial card transactions, which increased to low double digits, highlighting ongoing strength in cross-border corporate travel. Focusing on our Issuer B2B portfolio, MineralTree achieved record bookings this quarter in its targeted mid-market segment, while PayCard continues to see improving trends as the business laps more difficult employment comparisons. Finally, Issuer Solutions delivered an adjusted operating margin of 46.8%, an increase of 290 basis points compared to the prior year period, fueled by volume-based revenue growth and our focus on driving efficiencies in the business.\nFrom a cash flow standpoint, we produced strong adjusted free cash flow for the quarter of approximately $509 million. This represents a roughly 80% conversion rate of adjusted net income to adjusted free cash flow, consistent with the first quarter of 2023. We continue to target converting roughly 100% of adjusted earnings for the full year, excluding the roughly 5-point impact of the timing change related to the recognition of research and development tax credits. We expect our adjusted free cash flow conversion for the year to follow a similar trajectory as 2023 as we benefit from the seasonality and the higher conversion rate as the year progresses.\nWe invested $145 million in capital expenditures during the quarter and continue to expect capital spending to be around $670 million or roughly 7% of revenue in 2024, consistent with our long-term targets. Further, we are pleased to have repurchased 6 million shares of roughly $800 million in the first quarter. In February, we opportunistically took advantage of market dynamics and issued $2 billion in convertible notes with the majority of the proceeds used to repay our commercial paper facility. This was essentially leverage-neutral and lowered our overall cost of capital.\nSpecifically, we replaced a portion of our variable rate debt at an interest rate of over 6% and with a fixed rate convertible with a coupon of 150 basis points. We also entered into a call spread transaction increasing the effective strike price to $230 per share, providing significant dilution protection. Our leverage position was 3.5x at the end of the first quarter. We remain on track to return to a leverage level consistent with our long-term targets in the low 3s by year-end. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we have approximately $3.4 billion of available liquidity. Our total indebtedness is approximately 98% fixed, with a weighted average cost of debt of 3.37%.\nTurning to the outlook. We remain confident in how our business is positioned this year. We continue to expect reported adjusted net revenue to range from $9.17 billion to $9.30 billion, reflecting growth of 6% to 7% over 2023. It's worth noting, relative to our prior outlook, the dollar has strengthened against the foreign currencies to which we have exposure. Although currencies remain quite volatile, we currently anticipate a roughly $20 million foreign currency headwind in the second quarter versus our prior expectation of roughly neutral. We will continue to monitor any potential impact on the back half of the year.\nWe still expect annual adjusted operating margin to expand up to 50 basis points for 2024, driven by the benefits to our business mix from our ongoing shift towards technology enablement, partially offset by the lower margin profile of EVO [indiscernible] synergy realization. To provide color at the segment level, we continue to expect our merchant business to report adjusted net revenue growth of 9-plus percent for the full year. This outlook includes growth in the 7% to 8% range, excluding the impact of the acquisition of EVO and the disposition of our Gaming Solutions business.\nWe also still expect up to 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the merchant business in 2024, with a slower extension in the first half relative to the second half as EVOsynergy realization ramps as the year progresses, which is consistent with our prior outlook.\nMoving to Issuer Solutions. We continue to anticipate adjusted net revenue growth in the 5% to 6% range for the full year compared to 2023. We also still anticipate adjusted operating margin for the issuer business to expand by up to 50 basis points as we drive efficiencies in the business, which will be offset somewhat by the faster growth in our lower-margin B2B businesses.\nMoving to a couple of nonoperating items. We expect net interest expense to be about $500 million this year and for our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 19%, which is consistent with our prior outlook. We expect the full year to be in the range of $11.54 to $11.70, reflecting growth of 11% to 12% over 2023. This translates to adjusted earnings per share growth of 14-plus percent for 2024, excluding dispositions, consistent with our prior guidance.\nAs we commented at the outset of the year, our outlook continues to reflect a relatively stable macroeconomic environment, albeit somewhat tempered given the continued uncertainty. Cameron?\n\nCameron M. Bready\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThanks, Josh. I am proud of the results our team delivered in the first quarter. While we are closely monitoring what continues to be an uncertain macroeconomic environment, we were pleased to continue to see stable trends in April. Importantly, we have also now lapped all 3 of the transformational transactions we completed in 2023. And we are continuing to make progress on sharpening our strategic focus and simplifying our business to support sustainable long-term growth and success.\nAs we move forward, we remain committed to the key priorities I highlighted since I stepped into the CEO role last year. This includes continuing to advance our software-centric strategy, making it as easy as possible for our customers to do business with us, maintaining our focus on operational excellence and ensuring we have the right culture to achieve our vision.\nEarlier this year, we began a holistic review of our operating model, organizational structure and internal processes to ensure they are optimized for the company that we are today. While we are early in the process, we are encouraged by the opportunities we have already identified to better align our go-to-market activities against our strategy and drive greater efficiencies and effectiveness in our business. This includes the potential to increase commercial productivity, accelerate product development delivery times, enhance our partnerships with our customers and simplify the organization, while streamlining business activities. Ultimately, we expect executing on these initiatives will provide us with additional capital to invest for growth.\nWe anticipate completing our review and developing specific execution plans over the next few months. Further, as we realign our go-to-market activities and operating model, we will also harmonize our KPIs and metrics against this structure, allowing us to provide a clear articulation of performance and execution against our strategy going forward.\nWe have successfully grown this company for over the last decade, and the work we are doing to create the right operating environment will position us for the next decade of growth. We look forward to providing you with an update on our strategy and progress against these key initiatives our investor conference this fall. Winnie?\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Cameron. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions."

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference will be recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Winnie Smith. Please go ahead.\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning. Welcome to Global Payments Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Conference Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call can be found on the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpayments.com.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today's conference call contain forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the impact of economic conditions on our future operations that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K and subsequent filings. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update them.\nWe will be also referring to several non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance. For a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call to the most comparable GAAP measure, in accordance with SEC regulations, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and our supplemental materials available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nJoining me on the call are Cameron Bready, President and CEO; and Josh Whipple, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO. Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron.\n\nCameron M. Bready\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThanks, Winnie, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, which exceeded our initial expectations outlined last February. I am extremely proud of our teams around the world for an outstanding execution. Together, we accomplished a great deal in 2023.\nStarting with our financial performance. For the full year, we achieved high single-digit adjusted net revenue growth and increased adjusted earnings per share, 12%. This includes a more than 400 basis point headwind from the divestiture of our Netspend Consumer business, which we completed early in the second quarter. We also expanded adjusted operating margins 90 basis points, including the impact of EVO Payments, which had a lower margin profile than Global Payments at the time of the acquisition.\nImportantly, we delivered this performance consistently throughout the year despite ongoing headwinds, including macroeconomic uncertainty, persistent inflation, FX volatility and geopolitical unrest, highlighting the durability of our model.\nStrategically, we also made significant progress during the year executing on a number of key initiatives. First, we successfully closed the acquisition of EVO Payments in March, which complements our strategy by providing further penetration into integrated payments, enhancing our B2B capabilities and expanding our exposure to stronger secular growth markets globally. Our integration has progressed quite well, and we remain on track to deliver on our revised target of $135 million in annual run rate expense synergies within 2 years.\nAnd while revenue synergies generally take longer to materialize, we are more excited today than when we announced the transaction about opportunities we have to cross-sell our products and capabilities into EVO's existing customer base. We are continuing to invest in these opportunities in 2024 and expect them to scale more fully in 2025.\nFurther, we completed the divestitures of our Netspend Consumer assets and our Gaming Solutions business in April. These three transactions represent important milestones as we seek to advance our strategy and operate a simpler business model centered on our core corporate and financial institution customer base.\nIn our merchant business, that strategy is spearheaded by a software-centric approach, leveraging our strengths across our vertical markets, integrated and point-of-sale businesses. And we seek to drive distinction in our offerings by providing omnichannel capabilities and value-added commerce enablement solutions across our markets, including those that benefit from strong payment digitization and secular growth trends. We continue to see good momentum in our Merchant Solutions as we execute against these strategies.\nStarting with our vertical markets businesses, we had a number of notable achievements in 2023 across the portfolio. These include -- new partnerships to be the official commerce technology provider for both the Atlanta Braves and Atlanta Ox as we look to further expand our market presence in the stadium and event venue vertical.\nIn the United Kingdom, we renewed our relationship with Principality Stadium, home of Wealth Rugby and Football and expanded our services with Wembley Stadium in London. We were also selected by leading food service management company Sodexo to be its preferred point of sale in kiosk partner and are now the partner of choice for the three largest players in the food service management space.\nOur education solutions business delivered many new marquee customer additions across our K-12 and our university businesses and continue to expand to international markets with School Solutions launching [ My School Box ] in Australia, and [ Touchnet ] achieved new wins in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom.\nAnd our active network business had a record bookings year, signing 839 new logos including its largest ever win in the community vertical with the City of Toronto.\nMoving to partner and software solutions. We achieved record bookings in 2023 with new partners increasing 23% from the prior year. This was in part driven by the strong momentum we've seen with our new progressive payment facilitation or ProFac model that we launched midyear. This hybrid option provides many of the benefits of being a payment facilitator while minimizing the heavy burden that comes with it.\nProFac is unique to Global Payments, and we are delighted to have signed 16 ProFac partners team who already have thousands of merchant customers using our payment solutions. Some notable new partners in our integrated business include 402 Ventures, a leading provider of auction software in the heavy equipment and machinery vertical; AutoSoft, which provides a software management platform for auto dealerships; Black Knight, a leading provider of mortgages and loan origination software; and Inovalon, a leading data analytics ISP in the health care vertical.\nThese trends -- the momentum we are seeing with ProFac underscore our confidence in our ability to maintain consistent growth going forward as our differentiated capabilities continue to resonate with the ISV market.\nAs for the early leg of our software strategy, our point-of-sale software business delivered strong growth for the full year, as we continue to see solid demand for our solutions and benefit from the releases of new product enhancements. Notably, our average revenue per unit continues to expand, up 9% year-over-year as more merchants are using payments and our add-on capabilities in our evolving POS platform. And of course, this is prior to the full launch of our complete next-generation restaurant and retail point-of-sale software platforms, which we continue to expect this quarter.\nLastly, our exposure to some of the most attractive secular markets globally remains a core element of our strategy, both in terms of contributing to our overall rates of growth and providing us the global footprint we need to support complex multinational corporations. We continue to see good trends across our businesses in Spain and Central Europe, each of which delivered high teens growth. In key new European markets entered with EVO, including Poland and Greece, also achieved double-digit growth.\nFurther, we have seen favorable secular trends in Lat Am, where we meaningfully increased our footprint with EVO. This includes new implementations in Mexico with large customers like eLocal, DHL and Petro 7 as we leverage our partnership with Citi Banamex.\nTurning to Issuer Solutions, where we have long-standing relationships with some of the most complex and sophisticated institutions globally. We are proud to have completed 11 customer conversions in 2023. In total, we added over 50 million accounts to our business and ended the year with record traditional accounts on file of more than 800 million. We continue to have a strong pipeline of new business that extends into 2025 as well as eight letters of intent with institutions worldwide.\nIn 2023, we achieved 13 multiyear renewals in new customer agreements. This includes a new contract with a leading U.S. bank that is a long-standing Global Payments merchant partner, a relationship that provided the foundation for the growth of our partnership to include issuer technology solutions. We also continue to expand into new and faster growth markets, including in Lat Am through our partnership with [ Pat ], a credit card joint venture between Scotiabank and Chile's largest retailer, [ Cencosud ].\nThe confidence that many of the largest and most sophisticated, complex financial institutions have with us is enhanced by our issuer platform modernization efforts, which positions us to provide our clients market-leading, cloud native, real-time solutions at scale in more markets than we ever had previously.\nWe've made substantial progress with our modernization with two clients now in production, leveraging products by our cloud solution. Further, we expect to complete the development of our client-facing applications this year and are planning to execute dozens of unique cloud issuer platform pilots spanning multiple services products and geographies as we prepare for the commercial launch of additional cloud native capabilities.\nMoving to B2B. We continue to see solid demand for our leading capabilities across our three focus areas: Software-driven workflow automation, money in, money out funds flow and employer solutions. We have successfully integrated EVO's pay fabric software into our merchant business allowing us to go to market in B2B acceptance with a software-led approach. Further, our Mineral Tree business nearly doubled subscription bookings in its core mid-market, positioning the business well heading into 2024.\nAs one of the largest virtual card issuers in the world, we are benefiting from accelerated adoption of virtual card globally, which contributed to strong growth in commercial transactions this year. Additionally, our B2B bookings in Merchant Solutions increased over 20% in 2023 as more the spend shifts towards digital channels.\nOur employer solutions are also seeing favorable trends, including our payroll business, delivering mid-teens growth for the full year and our PayCard and EWA solutions, achieving nearly 2,000 new [ partnerships ] last year.\nAfter an eventful and successful 2023, I'm pleased to report that we are carrying this momentum into the early part of 2024. In January, our merchant business announced a new joint venture with Commerzbank in Germany. This new entity, Commerce Global Pay is expected to launch in the first half of 2024 and will deliver a comprehensive suite of innovative omni-inpayments and software offerings including our GB point-of-sale software solutions and our GP touch-on-mobile technology at scale, providing merchants the capabilities needed to run and grow their businesses more efficiently in the largest economy in Europe.\nWe are delighted to be partnering with Commerzbank, a premier financial institution with unmatched relationships with small and medium-sized merchants to significantly enhance distribution in Germany, where there are substantial opportunities to further digitize the payment experience. This partnership was achieved -- the Global Payments leadership in payments technology and commerce solutions and extensive JV experience across European markets. While our acquisition of EVO helped provide a foundation with this existing physical presence in merchant portfolio in Germany.\nIn North America, we remain on track to launch our next-generation Heartland restaurant and Heartland retail offerings this quarter. It will provide best-in-class omnichannel experiences and further catalyze our success in point-of-sale software. Early feedback on our next-generation restaurant point-of-sale solution has been overwhelmingly positive, including our new updated and enhanced features like online ordering, loyalty, mobile point-of-sale and a simplified user interface on commercial grade hardware.\nAnd our new retail POS solution will allow us to extend into additional retail verticals, which is the cornerstone of a broader strategy of subvertical expansion allowing us to increase wallet share while also meeting the demands of a modern retail environment to bring supply chain, e-commerce, customer engagement and complex ERP functionality into a simplified and single ecosystem. This expansion not only aligns with our growth objectives, but also ensures we stay at the forefront of retail technology, providing our clients with the tools they need to thrive in a rapidly evolving market.\nOur POS momentum also continues in the enterprise QSR space. We were delighted to be selected to power Cosmic's, a new concept from the McDonald's universe. Xenial's cloud point-of-sale drive-through digital menu boards, envision speed-of-service solutions are enabling an innovative new drive-through traffic management system that supports Cosmic's multiple drive-through lanes and pickup windows optimizing restaurant operations in a dynamic and flexible way. Cosmic's is also using Xenial's back-office suite to provide realtime reporting and management of inventory, sales, labor, projections and scheduling.\nWe are excited to have already launched with Cosmic's at the initial Bolingbrook, Illinois restaurant concept in December and look forward to helping future-proof all new pilot locations with our cloud-based technology ecosystem as they open an additional markets in 2024.\nOur issuer business has also started the year well, having executed multiyear renewal agreements with two of our flagship clients, Capital One and Navy Federal Credit Union, both long-standing relationships spanning decades. Our renewal with Capital One includes both its consumer -- credit portfolios in North America. And for Navy Federal, a not-for-profit credit union serving the military veterans and their families, our relationship supports its consumer portfolio as well as an array of value-added services, including loyalty, fraud and digital engagement solutions. The extension of these partnerships further validates our strategy of aligning our business with clear market winners.\nLooking ahead, we remain encouraged by the resiliency we have seen in consumer spending and expect fairly similar trends in 2024. However, we recognize there remain a number of risks to the global economy and consumer and are appropriately reflecting this in our expectations. Our outlook does incorporate a slightly more tempered expectation for the macro environment relative to what we experienced in 2023, but is roughly aligned with what we saw exiting the year.\nJanuary trends were fairly consistent with what you heard from the networks and broadly in line with our expectations. We are confident we have built a better and more durable business model, which positions us well to manage through any environment if the current backdrop changes.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Josh.\n\nJoshua J. Whipple\n\nSenior EVP and Chief Strategy & Enterprise Risk Officer, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Cameron. We are pleased with our financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year, which reflects continued outstanding execution and the resiliency of our business model. I'm particularly proud that we delivered these results while simultaneously completing multiple transactions, which serve to accelerate our strategy.\nStarting with the full year 2023, we -- adjusted net revenue of $8.67 billion, an increase of 7% from the prior year. Excluding the impact of dispositions, adjusted net revenue increased 15% compared to 2022. Adjusted operating margin for the full year improved 90 basis points to 44.6%. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $10.42, an increase of 12% compared to the full year 2022, which equates to over 16% growth, excluding the impact of dispositions.\nFor the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $2.19 billion, an increase of 8% from the same period in the prior year. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 30 basis points to 44.8%. This equates to 100 basis points of margin expansion, excluding EVO Payments and dispositions. And that result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.65, an increase of 10% compared to the same period in 2023.\nTaking a closer look at performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.67 billion for the fourth quarter, reflecting growth of 19% or approximately 8%, excluding the impact of EVO and dispositions. Our performance was led by our software center businesses, which again delivered double-digit growth in the quarter.\nSpecifically, we saw strength in Zego, School Solutions and Advanced MD, which delivered strong double-digit growth for the fourth quarter, and our point-of-sale businesses again grew roughly 20%.\nFocusing on faster growth geographies, we achieved double-digit growth in Spain and Central Europe as well as in Poland and Greece. Our Lat Am business was another bright spot for the quarter as we benefit from the strong secular payments trends in Mexico and Chile. This performance was partially offset by ongoing -- in the macro environment in the U.K. and Canada.\nWe delivered an adjusted operating margin of 47.7% in the merchant segment, a decline of 60 basis points due to the acquisition of EVO. Excluding EVO and dispositions, operating margins grew 40 basis points year-on-year.\nFor the full year, we realized approximately 25% of our targeted expense synergies from EVO. And as Cameron mentioned, we expect to deliver on our raised expectation of $135 million in annual run rate expense synergies within 2 years.\nOur Issuer Solutions business produced adjusted net revenue of $531 million, reflecting growth of 6% or 5% constant currency growth. The core issuer business also grew mid-single digits this quarter, driven by ongoing strength in volume-based revenue. This was partially offset by slower growth in managed and output services as we continue to focus our issuer business on more technology enablement.\nWe added approximately 13 million traditional accounts on file sequentially. This equates to an increase of more than 50 million accounts year-over-year as we continue to benefit from the ongoing execution of our conversion -- in addition to healthy consumer and commercial account growth with our large existing FI customers.\nIssuer transactions grew high single digits compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, led by commercial card transactions, which increased low double digits, highlighting ongoing strength in cross-border corporate travel.\nFocusing in on our issuer B2B portfolio, Mineral Tree delivered high teens growth and achieved record bookings this quarter in its targeted mid-market segment while PayCards saw improving trends as the business lap a more difficult employment comparisons from the last year.\nFinally, Issuer Solutions delivered an adjusted operating margin of 47.3%. As expected, this was relatively consistent with our third quarter performance, but represented a decline compared to the prior year due to a difficult comparison resulting from vendor benefits reflected in that period. For the full year, our issuer margins expanded 100 basis points, which exceeded our initial guidance for 60 basis points of margin improvement compared to 2022.\nFrom a cash flow standpoint, we produced strong adjusted free cash flow for the quarter of $784 million and $2.5 billion for the year. This represents an approximately 100% conversion rate of adjusted net income to adjusted free cash flow for the full year, consistent with our expectations, excluding the impact of the requirement to capitalize research and development costs for income tax report purposes.\nCapital investment was approximately $157 million in the fourth quarter and roughly $660 million for the full year. Since closing EVO in March, we have reduced outstanding debt by more than $1.4 billion, and our leverage position was 3.4x at the end of the fourth quarter.\nOur balance sheet remains healthy and we have approximately $3.5 billion of available liquidity. Further, our total indebtedness is approximately 91% fixed with a weighted average cost of debt of 3.78%. While debt repayment was our top priority for capital allocation in 2023, we are pleased to have also repurchased 4 million shares or roughly $410 million prior to closing EVO.\n[indiscernible] to the outlook. We are pleased with how our business is positioned as we enter 2024. We currently expect reported adjusted net revenue to range from $9.17 billion to $9.30 billion, reflecting growth of 6% to 7% over 2023 or approximately 7-plus percent, excluding EVO and dispositions. We are forecasting annual adjusted operating margin to expand up to 50 basis points for 2024, driven by benefits to our business mix from our ongoing shift towards technology enablement, partially offset by the lower margin profile of EVO prior to full synergy realization.\nIf I -- at the segment level, we expect our merchant business to report adjusted net revenue growth of 9-plus percent for the full year. This includes growth in the 7% to 8% range, excluding the impact of the acquisition of EVO and the disposition of Gaming Solutions. We fully annualize these transactions by the end of the first quarter of 2024. We expect up to 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the merchant business in 2024 with a slower expansion in the first half relative to the second half as EVO synergy realization ramps as the year progresses.\nMoving to Issuer Solutions. We are anticipating adjusted net revenue growth in the 5% to 6% range for the full year compared to 2023 as we benefit from our strong conversion pipeline and continued account growth with our large existing FI partners. We expect core issuer to grow in the mid-single-digit range. And for Mineral Tree and Netspend's B2B businesses to grow low double digits. We anticipate adjusted operating margin for the issuer business to expand by up to 50 basis points as we continue to drive efficiencies in the business, which will be offset somewhat by faster growth in our lower-margin B2B businesses.\nIn terms of quarterly phasing, as I mentioned, we will anniversary the acquisition of EVO and the disposition of gaming by the end of the first quarter. We will also anniversary the impact of the divestiture of Netspend's consumer assets at the end of April. As a result, we will continue to have some impacts from these transactions in the first half of the year.\nMoving to a couple of nonoperating items. We currently expect net interest expense to be slightly above $500 million this year and for our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. We also are planning for our capital expenditures to be around $670 million in 2024, which remains roughly 7% of revenue. We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to again be in a comparable range of 100%, excluding the roughly 5-point impact from the timing change to recognizing research and development tax credits.\nRegarding capital allocation, we plan to return to a more balanced capital allocation approach for 2024, and I'm delighted that our Board of Directors has approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $2 billion as share buyback remains one of our priorities. We also plan to further reduce our indebtedness until we return to roughly 3x leverage on a net debt basis during the year.\nPutting it all together, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $11.54 to $11.70, reflecting growth of 11% to 12% over 2023. Excluding dispositions, adjusted earnings per share growth is expected to be 14-plus for 2024.\nOur outlook for the year reflects the ongoing positive momentum in our business. while accommodating for a more tempered economic environment given the continued uncertainty. We remain confident in the resiliency of our model and our ability to adapt to potential shifts in the economic environment. Cameron?\n\nCameron M. Bready\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThanks, Josh. As I said when I was named CEO in May, it's an exciting time for Global Payments, and I cannot be more proud of what we accomplished last year. As we begin 2024, I remain enthusiastic about the opportunities in front of us. We have a compelling technology-enabled strategy, a world-class team, great partners and clients and a global presence with diverse distribution capabilities.\nThis year, I remain highly focused on the priorities for our business and customers I outlined at the time I stepped into this role. First, we will continue to execute against our strategies, which positions us well for growth and success across our markets. We will, however, sharpen our focus on the most attractive opportunities we see in these areas while seeking to further simplify our business and amplify the impact of our investments.\nSpecifically, we are focusing on the most impactful of these initiatives and where we can drive further differentiation in our business, including with our software-centric channels across our own partnered MPLS solutions. Additionally, we will continue to harmonize areas of the business that are less differentiated with an eye towards further improving scale and enhancing margin characteristics.\nFurther, in markets and businesses we are subscale with limited potential to build scale, we may choose to exit certain lines of business and activities in order to better focus our investments, resources and manage attention on opportunity with better long-term growth prospects that can more meaningfully impact our business.\nSecond, I'm focused on making it as easy as possible to do business with Global Payments, while providing more solutions that deepen our relationships with our customers. We will continue to prioritize meeting our clients and customers how and where they want to be met with innovative and distinctive capabilities that integrate seamlessly. This includes our issuer modernization program and cloud investments, which will provide our clients with greater enablement capabilities and allow them to consume the services they need with greater speed to market and flexibility while providing best-in-class experiences for their cardholders.\nThird, we will maintain our relentless focus on execution, which has been one of the hallmarks of Global Payments and a key component of our ability to produce consistent results through market cycles. We are, however, undertaking an initiative to further simplify our technology and operating environments across the globe to become more efficient and effective, placing greater focus on aligned with business outcomes. We are committed to redefining success with a continuous improvement mindset and increasing the speed of delivery and nimbleness of our business.\nFourth, we remain committed to harnessing the power of generative AI to both innovate new products and solutions that deliver value and improve experiences to our customers and increase the productivity and efficiency of our operating environments and workforce around the globe. We have already made meaningful progress in our journey to embed generative AI into our business to leverage its power in the richness of data in our ecosystem.\nWe have established a center of excellence to coordinate our adoption of generative AI technologies and provide a governance framework, implemented foundational tools and models that are being utilized throughout our organization, evaluated numerous use cases and deploy generative AI technology in a number of areas of our business.\nFor example, in our Issuer Solutions business, our Foresight solution, in partnership with Featurespace, provides a market-leading fraud solution that uses generative AI to detect fraud strategies in real time, utilizing our proprietary data. Clients using this solution have realized a nearly 50% reduction in fraud loss. And we are evaluating a number of development opportunities that use generative AI across our issuing and acquiring businesses as a key component of our next-generation applications to further combat fraud and identity risks across our portfolios.\nFinally, I'm focused on ensuring Global Payments' culture is second to none. Our culture dictates how we accomplish our goals and achieve results as an organization. Having a world-class culture will further differentiate us in the marketplace while driving value creation and benefits for all of our constituents. Winnie?\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Cameron. Before we begin our question-and-answer session, I'd like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one with one follow-up to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions."

These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the impact of economic conditions on our future operations that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.

Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron.\n\nCameron M. Bready\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThanks, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We delivered strong third quarter results that were ahead of our expectation despite what continues to be an uncertain macroeconomic environment, and a much stronger dollar than forecasted when we provided our outlook back in August. I'm very proud of this performance and our teams globally for their ongoing consistency of execution.\nOn a consolidated basis, we reported 9% adjusted net revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% for the quarter. This includes a roughly 700 basis point headwind to adjusted earnings per share growth from the divestiture of Netspend's consumer assets, which we completed last quarter. We also expanded adjusted operating margins by 50 basis points.\nFocusing first on our Merchant Solutions segment. We again delivered strong organic growth in the third quarter, consistent with our second quarter performance, driven by ongoing momentum in our technology-enabled offerings, which collectively represent roughly 65% of our total merchant adjusted net revenues. Our software-centric businesses across our partnered-owned and POS strategies continue to drive a meaningful share of growth in the business.\nSo with our Integrated business, we achieved strong growth and record new bookings again this quarter, signing 16 new integrated partners, a 33% increase from the prior year. These booking trends underscore confidence in our ability to maintain consistent growth in this business going forward as our differentiated capabilities continue to resonate with the ISV market.\nOur new progressive payment facilitation, or ProFac model, is a prime example of our leadership in this channel. We signed 6 new ProFac partners in the third quarter and have more than 20 additional opportunities in the pipeline, reflecting strong demand for this new offering. We also saw strong double-digit performance in booking trends this quarter across our own vertical market software businesses. Zego, our newest addition to this business continues to see solid demand for its solutions with bookings growth of 15% in the quarter.\nNotably, Zego also expanded the scope of existing partnerships to include additional payment solutions with global real estate management firm, Harbor Group; and multifamily management company, Respond, while furthering its expansion in the student housing vertical by signing an additional partner, Domus Student Living.\nIn Active Network had one of its best booking quarters since the pandemic, including new partnerships with YMCA Vancouver, Alterra Mountain Company, the New York Triathlon and the Sydney Half Marathon. Additionally, our university business, TouchNet, signed a new partnership with Langara College in Vancouver and extended the relationship with the Texas State University System.\nAs for our POS software business, we again delivered 20-plus percent growth in this channel as we continue to see strong demand for our solutions and benefit from releases of new product enhancements. Collectively, adjusted net revenue for our POS business is approaching $400 million annually and is one of the fastest-growing channels of our business. Today, we offer complete cloud-based POS software and commerce-enabled platforms targeting 3 distinct segments of the market, with solutions that are purpose-built for key verticals, primarily restaurant and retail.\nWe focus on these verticals for several reasons. One, they are large, addressable markets; two, they are international in scope; and three, because more and more payments decisions are being made and connect with the point of sale in these markets. Our POS solutions are used by over 80,000 merchant locations globally, enabling businesses of all sizes from SMBs to enterprise customers to run and grow more effectively. Our products easily scale from simpler solutions for a single location to complex environments for large merchants with multiunit and multinational requirements.\nAcross our BOS platforms, we seamlessly combine software, hardware and payments for in-person, mobile and online environments, providing for great customer experiences. And we deliver all this in customized configurations that specifically address the unique software and payment requirements of our customers.\nOur solutions are designed to grow with a customers' business. We leverage a common technology stack that enable customers to easily add functionality as they expand. This allows us to serve the small end of the SMB market and scale with merchants, increasing software venue along the way. Importantly, this differentiates us from many of our competitors who attempt to address small and large and general and vertically specific use cases with the same single offering.\nAnd we couple our complete commerce enablement solutions with distinctive distribution and full local service and support that is unrivaled in the market. Our entry-level product or general purpose, cloud-based, point-of-sale solution is branded GP POS. This offering provides a highly competitive starter solution for SMB customers who want a simple and intuitive system with a robust feature set. GP POS delivers an expansive set of mobile capabilities and commerce enablement tools. These features can be tailored to the specific requirements of the merchant business on the vertical market and the geographies they serve.\nImportantly, GP POS is essentially self-service from beginning to end. From onboarding to full conferation of the functionality, a merchant can easily enable our software and begin accepting payments in less than 24 hours. We offer GP POS globally through a variety of regional and wholesale distribution channels. In the last year, we successfully launched our GP POS technology in numerous international markets, including Canada, the U.K., Spain and Central Europe, and expect to further expand to Poland, Germany and Ireland over the next 12 to 24 months.\nWe couple our innovative GP POS solution with local presence and support capabilities, as well as our long-standing FI partnerships in these markets, a powerful combination our competitors simply cannot replicate. In North America, we have a distinct vertically specific to retail-focused cloud-based POS solutions, Heartland Restaurant and Heartland Retail. We leverage our Heartland direct channel to target SMB and mid-market customers with these solutions, typically those serving 2 to 20 locations, but can scale to customers with significantly more locations.\nThe vertically fluent capabilities we offer customers include mobile POS and pin on glass solutions, guest and table management, ordering kitchen management, pricing matrices, discounting functionality, cash discount programs, predictive analytics, AI-driven marketing and loyalty programs, and human capital management and payroll solutions. And we deliver this seamlessly as a cohesive commerce enablement platform, all from the point of sale.\nOur solutions also offer open architecture and have integrations with dozens of software partners, which allows our customers to enable various delivery services, accounting applications, inventory management software and other disruptive technologies. Again, all accessible at the point of sale. We have 2 primary distribution channels for these solutions in North America.\nThe first is our local dealer network representing nearly every major metro market in the U.S. and Canada, where we have over 300 partners who provide sales support and service. This second is our local sales professionals across the U.S. and Canada who are solution-oriented domain experts and serve as relationship partners to our customers.\nWe have seen strong growth in our Heartland POS software solutions and expect the momentum to continue on the heels of the launch of our next-generation offerings in early 2024. And which will deliver an improved user interface and more intuitive experiences across our iOS and Android based solutions. Our next-gen POS is also designed to be mobile-first, allowing for a best-in-class omnichannel experience.\nCompleting our suite of POS capabilities, we have solutions for specific vertical enterprise customers, which have the most complex requirements in operation and technical environments. At this end of the market, we offer our Xenial cloud POS enterprise solution, offering scalable, secure and real-time services for the world's largest quick service restaurants, foodservice management companies and sports and entertainment venues.\nThe Xenial POS ecosystem provides an API-first approach to in-house and partner integrations for the most sophisticated enterprise customers, whether supporting a multilane drive-through, QSR or a large sports arena, Xenial provides the complete technology stack required to run these operations all fully integrated at the point of sale. This includes dynamic digital menu boards, kiosks and mobile ordering solutions, kitchen management solutions, AI-based drive-through solutions and customer engagement to name a few.\nAnd we are proud that Xenial is also leading the way in delivering the drive-thru of the future technology for its enterprise QSR customers. We are proud to serve 26 of the top 50 QSR brands with our technology on a global basis. With respect to entertainment venues, Xenial operates the food and beverage, suite and retail environments for some of the most complex stadiums in the world. In these environments, foodservice management providers rely on our technology to deliver best-in-class customer and fan experiences. We currently serve almost 100 stadium and event venues with our solutions globally.\nWe win in the market by selling complexity for our customers, whether that is multiunit requirements or multinational expansion or the convergence of physical and virtual environments. From delivering poor feature functionality required by small merchants via a mobile solution to providing greater levels of functionality in a simple register, to a full-featured software platform, we provide our customers with the ideal point-of-sale technology tailored to their specific needs.\nAnd we couple our best-in-class commerce enablement capabilities with more distinctive and diversified distribution streams and service at scale worldwide that our competitors really can't match. As a result, we remain very enthusiastic about the growth prospects for our POS business globally moving forward.\nSpeaking of our global REIT, it is worth noting that we achieved strong double-digit growth in Spain and throughout Central Europe in the quarter, while Poland, Greece and Ireland, which we entered by our acquisition of Vivo, were also bright spots in Europe. We are also excited to announce a new agreement with International Parking Group to support payments for its smart parking solutions on an omnichannel basis across the U.K. and Ireland as well as the U.S. and Canada.\nIn Asia Pacific, we are thrilled to recently sign a new partnership with Marriott International, and will begin offering seamless omnichannel solutions this quarter in select hotel locations across the region.\nTurning to Issuer, we achieved mid-single-digit growth consistent with our expectations and longer-term targets once again this quarter. Transaction growth remained strong throughout the quarter led by our commercial business, highlighting ongoing improvements in cross-border corporate travel. Traditional accounts on file increased by approximately 11 million sequentially as we continue to benefit from strong growth with our existing large financial institution clients and the ongoing execution of our conversion pipeline.\nThis quarter, we successfully completed conversion of 2 new portfolios acquired by large existing FI partners through M&A, further supporting our strategy of aligning with market share winners. Further, we recently completed the migration of the first wave of accounts for a leading U.S. retailer for one of our largest partners as part of a co-branded relationship. And early this month, we migrated CAD, the credit card joint venture between Scotiabank and Chile's largest retailer, Cencosud, representing our first issuer customer in the market.\nWe are also pleased to have reached a new issuer processing agreement with a leading U.S. bank during the third quarter. This FI is a long-standing Global Payments merchant partner, and the strength of our relationship provided the foundation for expansion of our partnership to include our leading Issuer Technology Solutions. Notably, this partner will also leverage our next-gen analytics platform via the AWS Cloud, as we continue to see great progress with clients enabling our modernized services.\nWe also signed a multiyear extension with 2 large-standing FI partners during the third quarter. Shifting to B2B, we continue to drive strong growth with both corporates and financial institutions as we leverage our capabilities across software-driven workflow automation solutions, money in and money out funds flow capabilities, and our broad suite of employer solutions.\nStarting with Workflow Automation, MineralTree subscription bookings for its AP automation software increased an impressive 86% year-over-year this quarter. We are also pleased to have successfully integrated EVO's PayFabric software into our merchant business, which provides our new and existing U.S. customer greater AR automation capabilities. Regarding B2B funds flows, as we discussed last quarter, virtual option continues to expand, contributing to the strong growth in commercial transactions.\nWe're also seeing an acceleration in virtual cards being tokenized and provisioned in mobile wallets, which is further catalyzing growth. Additionally, our B2B bookings in Merchant Solutions doubled in the third quarter relative to the prior year. while new merchant B2B payments volume increased by more than 50% from last year as we continue to progress the EVO integration and harmonize our go-to-market strategy.\nMoving to Employer Solutions, our PayCard has signed a new partnership with hospitality staffing firm, Exclusive Services, and renewed its existing relationship with Flynn Restaurant Group, the largest restaurant group in the U.S. We also achieved a new EWA partnership with KFC franchisee JRC restaurants. Lastly, our software-driven human capital management and payroll solutions business delivered growth of more than 20% in the third quarter.\nB2B offers an attractive growth opportunity for our business and represents a core element of our strategy going forward. As we continue to unify our offerings in this space and refine our strategy, we expect to continue to capture share and accelerate growth in B2B over the long term.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Josh.\n\nJoshua J. Whipple\n\nSenior EVP and Chief Strategy & Enterprise Risk Officer, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Cameron. We are pleased with the continued strong financial performance we delivered in the third quarter and for the year-to-date period, which exceeded our expectations despite absorbing a roughly $10 million adjusted net revenue headwind from foreign currency exchange rates relative to our expectations when we guided in early August.\nSpecifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $2.23 billion, an increase of 9% and from the same period in the prior year. Excluding the impact of dispositions, adjusted net revenue increased 17%. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 50 basis points to 45.7%. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of EVO payments and dispositions, adjusted operating margin increased 90 basis points, highlighting ongoing consistent execution across our businesses.\nThe net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.75, an increase of 11% compared to the same period in 2022; or 18%, excluding the impact of dispositions. This includes a roughly 1 point headwind from adverse foreign currency exchange rates relative to when we updated guidance on our second quarter earnings conference call.\nTaking a closer look at performance by segment. Merchant Solutions reported adjusted net revenue of $1.73 billion for the third quarter, a 19% improvement from the prior year; or 9% growth, excluding the impact of EVO and dispositions. As Cameron highlighted, distance was led by the ongoing strength of our technology-enabled businesses. while we also benefited from double-digit growth in factor growth markets, including Spain and Central Europe.\nThis was partially offset by ongoing macro softness in limited geographies, including the U.K., where the economic environment remains challenging; and in Canada, where GDP growth is hovering around 0. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 49.1% in the segment. consistent with our expectations. This represented a decline of 90 basis points due to the acquisition of EVO. However, excluding the impact of EVO and dispositions, adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points.\nOur Issuer Solutions produced adjusted net revenue of $520 million, reflecting 6% growth. The core issuer business also grew mid-single digits this quarter, driven by ongoing strength in volume-based revenue. As Cameron highlighted, we added approximately 11 million traditional accounts on file sequentially. This equates to an increase of more than 60 million accounts year-over-year as we continue to see healthy account growth with our large FI customers and benefit from the ongoing execution of our conversion pipeline.\nTransactions grew high single digits compared to the third quarter of 2022, led by commercial card transactions, which increased to mid-teens. This was partially offset by slower growth in managed and output services as we continue to focus our Issuer business on more technology enablement.\nOur Issuer team executed 4 conversions since the beginning of the third quarter and have successfully completed 11 conversions since the beginning of the year. We have also signed 2 new contracts and completed 10 renewals year-to-date, and currently have 7 active LOIs in addition to nearly 20 mid- to late-stage opportunities in the pipeline.\nShifting to our issuer B2B portfolio. These businesses delivered double-digit growth this quarter, led by MineralTree, which achieved 20% growth in its targeted mid-market segment, while PayCard accelerated nicely as the business is beginning to lap more difficult employment comparisons that were a drag on year-over-year performance during the first half of 2023. Finally, Issuer Solutions delivered adjusted operating margin of 47.5% and an increase of 110 basis points from the prior year, fueled by solid top line growth and are continuing to focus on driving efficiencies in the business.\nFrom a cash flow standpoint, we produced adjusted free cash flow for the quarter of $733 million, representing 102% conversion rate of adjusted net income to adjusted free cash flow despite a modest increase in capital spending this quarter. We continue to target converting roughly 100% of adjusted earnings to adjusted free cash flow for the full year, excluding roughly 5-point impact of the timing change to recognizing research and development tax credits.\nWe also continue to expect capital investment to be approximately $600 million and [ $30 million ] in 2023, consistent with our prior outlook. Year-to-date, we have reduced outstanding debt by more than $1.1 billion, and our leverage position was 3.5x at the end of the quarter, consistent with our expectations. We remain on track to return to a leverage level consistent with our long-term targets in the low 3s by year-end. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we have [ $2 billion dollars ] of available liquidity. Further, our total indebtedness is approximately 88% fixed with a weighted average cost of debt of 3.85%.\nWe are pleased with how our business is positioned following our performance for the first 9 months of 2023. We continue to forecast adjusted net revenue for the full year to range from $8.660 billion to $8.735 billion reflecting growth of 7% to 8% over 2022. Given the roughly $40 million headwind to adjusted net revenue we have seen from adverse foreign currency exchange rates relative to our prior guidance, we now expect to be in the lower half of this range, absent an improvement in rates.\nMoving to margins. We continue to forecast annual adjusted operating margin to expand by up to 120 basis points for 2023. We remain on track to realize approximately $35 million in cost synergies from the EVO acquisition this year. To provide color at the segment level, we continue to anticipate our Merchant segment to report adjusted net revenue growth of approximately 6% for the full year, consistent with our prior forecast despite absorbing the aforementioned FX headwinds. We continue to expect a nominal decline in reported adjusted operating margin for the Merchant business for the full year due to the EVO acquisition.\nMoving to Issuer Solutions. We continue to expect issuer to grow in the 5% to 6% range on a constant currency basis. However, if the recent U.S. dollar strengthening persists, we would expect to be closer to the low end of that range on a reported basis. We anticipate adjusted operating margin for the issuer business to expand by more than 60 basis points for the year. as we benefit from natural operating leverage in the business.\nTurning to a couple of nonoperating items. We expect net interest expense to be roughly $540 million and for our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. For modeling purposes, we continue to assume excess cash is used to pay down indebtedness during the fourth quarter.\nPutting it all together, we now expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $10.39 to $10.45, reflecting growth of approximately 11% and to 12% over 2022. Excluding dispositions, adjusted earnings per share growth is expected to be roughly 17% for 2023. This guidance includes almost 1 point of headwind to adjusted earnings per share given the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar not reflected in our prior outlook.\nSimilar to what you've heard from others, October trends were consistent with what we saw in the third quarter. While our base case outlook today presumes spending trends and macroeconomic backdrop relatively consistent with what we are seeing currently, our guidance accommodates for a range of scenarios, including a more tempered economic environment given continued uncertainty.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Cameron.\n\nCameron M. Bready\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThanks, Josh. We continue to see strong momentum in our business and consumer spending has remained resilient over the course of the year. Although labor trends remain quite strong, we are monitoring the impact of rising rates resulting from monetary policy decisions globally, elevated inflation and a force geopolitical risk from the ongoing situation in Europe and recent events in the Middle East. We are confident we have built a better and more durable business model, which positions us well to manage the new environment if the current backdrop changes.\nI am pleased with all that we have accomplished this quarter and for the first 9 months of 2023, as we continue to advance our strategy and maintain strong execution throughout the business. We have the very best team members providing the very best experiences for our customers, with the very best technologies in the most attractive markets globally. Together, we are positioned to deliver strong operating and financial performance while remaining at the forefront of innovation.\nWinnie?\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Cameron. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions."

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference will be recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Winnie Smith. Please go ahead.\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Global Payments Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call can be found on the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpayments.com.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today's conference call contain forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the impact of economic conditions on our future operations that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.\nCertain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K and subsequent filings. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update them.\nWe will also be referring to several non-GAAP financial measures which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance. For a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call to the most comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC regulations, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and our supplemental materials available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nJoining me on the call are Cameron Bready, President and CEO; and Josh Whipple, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO. Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron.\n\nCameron M. Bready\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThanks, Winnie, and good morning, everyone. It is a privilege to be addressing you today for the first time as Global Payments' CEO. I've been in this role for roughly 2 months, and I'm delighted with how my tenure has begun. The transition has been seamless as expected. Our organization and team members continue to execute at a very high level as evidenced by the outstanding second quarter results we reported this morning.\nOur performance for the quarter was ahead of our expectations despite what has been an uncertain macroeconomic environment globally, driven by the effectiveness of our strategy and ongoing relentless focus on execution. On a consolidated basis, we reported 7% adjusted net revenue growth, while expanding adjusted operating margins 100 basis points and delivering adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% for the quarter. This includes a roughly 400 basis point headwind to adjusted earnings per share growth from the divestiture of Netspend's consumer assets.\nFocusing on our Merchant Solutions business, we again delivered strong organic growth in the second quarter led by ongoing momentum in our technology-enabled businesses. Our software-centric strategy with an overlay of leading e-comm omni capabilities in value-added commerce enablement solutions continues to drive our performance. And our ability to deliver these solutions across a diverse and attractive set of geographic markets worldwide further differentiates our business.\nSoftware sits at the heart of our Merchant Solutions business and is supported by a 3-legged go-to-market integrated payment strategy, expanding our partner ISV, vertical market software and point-of-sale software businesses. Collectively, these businesses comprise approximately 40% of our Merchant Solutions adjusted net revenue and are contributing a meaningful share of the growth in the business.\nIn our partner ISV channel or integrated business as we often refer to it, we continue to deliver consistent teens growth and again achieved record sales this quarter, surpassing last quarter's strong performance. We signed 33% more integrated merchants this period than in the second quarter of 2022.\nWe have a long history of success in our partnered ISV business and continue to gain share despite this becoming a more crowded market over the last several years. Against that backdrop, it is important to highlight why we continue to grow and win in this space. First, we have developed a more streamlined and simplified offering for partners with the options they desire, allowing us to meet both them and their merchants where and how they want to be met.\nThe ISV landscape has changed significantly in the last 5 years. Software providers desire to bring payments closer to their business and require options on the depth of integration, a clear understanding of the responsibility of those deaths carry with them and the benefits of a feature-rich solution. Our simple SDKs and APIs allow us to deliver on these expectations for our ISV partners.\nSecond, we offer 3 distinctive integrated payments models to our partners, allowing us to meet the unique demands of an ISV customized for its specific vertical market and merchant base. This includes a more traditional direct integrated model where we provide the most comprehensive suite of products, services and support for both the ISV and its customers.\nWe also offer a full payment facilitation or PayFac model where the partners have access to our leading payments technologies, although much of the operating complexity including compliance and regulatory requirements reside with the ISV. Additionally, we recently launched our new progressive payment facilitation, or ProFac model, and hybrid often, which provides many of the benefits of payment facilitation while minimizing the heavy burden that comes as a PayFac.\nOur ProFac model is unique to Global Payments, serving as another example of our leadership in integrated payments. We have seen great interest in this proposition and have a strong pipeline of partners seeking to board in the coming quarters. Our full spectrum of integrated solutions allows us to customize our offerings and provide different levels of support based on the specific needs of our partners.\nThird, across all these models, we operate a higher level of service than our peers, including for our PayFac and ProFac customers. And we also provide our partners with a breadth of commerce enablement and value-added solutions to sell into their merchant base, which meaningfully increases the revenue opportunity and accelerates growth.\nThis includes human capital management software, payroll, loyalty, tailored marketing solutions, BNPL and call center support amongst others, again, all customized to meet the unique needs of each partner. Overall, our technology leadership, unrivaled distribution, tailored operating models, comprehensive suite of products and capabilities and best-in-class service and support is why we win.\nWe meet the specific needs of our partners, which differentiates us in the marketplace and is allowing us to achieve sustainable high rates of growth at attractive margins.\nTurning to our vertical markets business. Our approach is largely consistent with how we think about the ISV partner channel with the exception being that we control the entirety of the technology stack and monetize it accordingly. This business again delivered double-digit growth this quarter, led by strength in our Zego, Xenial and School Solutions businesses.\nZego has seen great momentum in the student housing vertical and recently expanded its relationships with Sion as well as another large player in this space. Zego is also partnering with our higher education business, TouchNet to help us capture a greater portion of the student payments value chain through our campus management and One Card solutions.\nFocusing on Xenial, we announced our partnership with the Alanta Hawks earlier this year and are now officially live with our Xenial cloud point-of-sale solutions at State Farm Arena. Xenial also recently signed an agreement with Sodexo, one of the leading food service management companies globally to be its preferred point-of-sale and kiosk partner. With this win, Xenial is now the partner of choice for the 3 largest players in the food service management space.\nOur School Solutions business had a strong quarter, achieving a new school district partnership with Oklahoma City expanding its partnership with Baltimore County and extending a large existing relationship with Chicago Public Schools for several more years. Additionally, ACTIVE recently signed the city of Toronto it's its largest ever win in the community vertical and 1 of 14 new partnerships achieved in this space during the quarter.\nIn vertical markets where the primary mode of competition is at the point of sale, we go to market through 1 ecosystem of owned POS software solutions with 2 distinct operating platforms, 1 for restaurants and 1 for retail. These cloud-based software solutions operate on a single hardware environment custom designed, build and branded with a modern look and feel.\nOur POS business grew 20-plus percent again this quarter as we continue to see strong demand for our solutions and benefit from releases of product enhancements, including e-mail marketing, customer engagement and our latest mobile-first online ordering platform. And we expect this momentum to continue on the heels of the launch of our next-generation POS platform later this year.\nOur latest solution provides best-in-class offerings coupled with the full local support and service capabilities to delight our merchant customers in these verticals. Importantly, our software platforms are vertically fluid, which unlike more horizontal solutions in the market, offers future risk capabilities geared towards a specific requirements of businesses we serve with capabilities that integrate seamlessly. More to come on this.\nOur technology-enabled strategy is further enhanced by our differentiated e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities, which we overlay across all of our businesses, channels, verticals and geographies. Today, roughly 30% of the volume in our business is e-commerce, well above the overall percentage of retail sales tied to e-commerce.\nWe again saw mid-teens growth in e-commerce-related adjusted net revenues globally in the second quarter. We continue to benefit from our ability to seamlessly blend physical and virtual worlds in more markets than our peers, supporting the strong growth trends we have seen in e-commerce across our businesses.\nTo that end, we are pleased to have recently signed a new partnership with Easy Park Group, a global provider of digital parking services across the U.S., Canada and the U.K.\nOur exposure to some of the most attractive secular growth markets globally remains an important part of our strategy, both in terms of contributing to our overall rates of growth and providing us the global footprint and scale we need to support complex multinational corporations like Easy Park. Our faster growth markets again contributed to our strong performance in the quarter as we saw double-digit growth in Spain, Central Europe and Asia Pacific.\nIn APAC, specifically, we signed new merchant relationships with several large retailers across multiple geographies, including A.S. Watson Group, Footlocker and [indiscernible]. EVO aligns well with our overarching strategy and its performance was consistent with our expectations for the quarter. We remain excited about the synergy opportunities we see as a combined company, both revenue and expense and remain very much on track to deliver at least $125 million of run rate synergies from the transaction.\nTurning to issuer. We achieved mid-single-digit growth in the quarter, consistent with our expectations and longer-term targets. Transaction growth remained strong throughout the quarter led by our commercial business, highlighting ongoing recovery trends in cross-border corporate travel. Traditional accounts on file increased by approximately $10 million sequentially as we benefit from the strong growth within our existing large financial institution clients and the ongoing execution of our conversion pipeline.\nAnd yet another example of our successful strategy of aligning with market share winners, Deutsche Bank, our largest client in the dock region recently announced new issuing partnership with Blue Panda for its Miles and More Mastercard, one of the leading credit card portfolios in Germany and Europe. We are also delighted to assign multiyear extensions with 118118 Money in the U.K. and another large long-standing financial institution partner here in the U.S. this quarter.\nWe currently have 8 LOIs with institutions worldwide, nearly all of which were achieved through a competitive RFP process and several will go direct to cloud by our collaboration with AWS, our preferred issuer technology solutions partner. Our relationship with many of the most complex and sophisticated institutions globally speaks to our competitiveness well into the remainder of this decade and beyond.\nAnd our issuer conversion pipeline remains at near record post-merger levels, providing further confidence in our growth trajectory well into the future. In the future for our business remains very bright as we execute on our multiyear strategy to modernize our technology platforms in cloud native environments. Positioning us to provide market-leading technologies at scale through more distinctive and defensible distribution channels in more markets than we ever had previously.\nOur unique collaboration with AWS is tracking well. We now have our first line in production with our cloud-native next-gen analytics solution and have a number of additional customers preparing to join our cloud journey by leveraging capabilities we are launching together with AWS throughout the year.\nMoving to B2B. We continue to drive strong growth with both corporates and financial institutions as we leverage our capabilities across 3 focus segments within the overarching B2B market. software-driven workflow automation, money in and money out funds flows and employer solutions.\nStarting with software, our AP and AR workflow automation solutions that include integrations with the leading ERP environments continue to see great momentum. Mineral Tree achieved its best bookings quarter since the acquisition, underpinning the strong growth we are seeing in our primary mid-market segment as businesses focus their attention on automating their AP processes.\nWe also remain excited about the opportunity we now have to combined Mineral Tree and Evo software to create a single APAR solution with rich data and analytics that will provide a unique value proposition to mid-market customers. As for B2B funds flows, as one of the largest virtual card issuers in the world, we have significant scale in all of the payment rails and capabilities necessary to support customers in making money out payments in their businesses.\nVirtual card use continues to expand, contributing to the nearly 20% growth achieved in our commercial business. Over the last 12 months, we issued nearly 80 million virtual cards, enabling roughly $47 billion in spend. Additionally we are seeing strong growth on the money inside with our B2B payment acceptance solutions as more and more of this spend shifts towards digital channels.\nOur B2B bookings and Merchant Solutions have more than doubled since the fourth quarter of 2022 and and we expect this momentum to continue as we further align EVO with our existing capabilities and pursue our B2B software-centric go-to-market strategy. Finally, we provide employer solutions, including our pay card earned way to access and expense management offerings and issuer solutions and our human capital management and payroll solutions in our merchant business.\nThis quarter, our Payrock card business signed new partnerships with creative mobile technologies, a large taxi company with a significant presence in the top metropolitan cities in the U.S. and with our care solutions, a staffing solutions provider in the senior living vertical. Our EWA business achieved a new partnerships with Bravo Foods, a large QSR franchisee in the United States.\nOur software-driven human capital management and payroll solutions business delivered high teens adjusted net revenue growth and mid-teens new sales growth for the second quarter. We are pursuing a very similar strategy in B2B as we have in merchant solutions over the past several years. We lead with software to differentiate our capabilities and provide the vertical fluency clients demand.\nWe integrate our payment solutions into our software to monetize payment flows, and we deliver value-added services that enrich our relationships with our clients, driving further efficiencies in their businesses while increasing our average revenue per customer. With the breadth of capabilities we have and a focused technology-enabled strategy, we could not be better positioned to capture share and accelerate growth in B2B over the long term. With that, I will turn the call over to Josh.\n\nJoshua J. Whipple\n\nSenior EVP and Chief Strategy & Enterprise Risk Officer, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Cameron. We are pleased with our outstanding financial performance in the second quarter, which exceeded our expectations despite what continues to be an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Specifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 7% from the same period in the prior year. Excluding the impact of dispositions, adjusted net revenue increased 15%.\nAdjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 100 basis points to 44.8%. The highlighting strong and consistent execution across our businesses. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.62, an increase of 11% compared to the same period in 2022 or 15%, excluding the impact of dispositions.\nTaking a closer look at performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.68 billion for the second quarter. a 17% improvement from the prior year or over 9% growth, excluding the impact of EVO and dispositions. As Cameron highlighted, this performance was led by the ongoing strength of our technology-enabled businesses. which grew double digits this quarter, while we also benefited from consistent low double-digit growth in our faster growth markets, including Spain, Central Europe and Asia Pacific.\nThis was partially offset by macro softness in limited geographies, including the U.K., where rising interest rates and the high inflation levels are negatively impacting consumer spending. And in Canada, where GDP growth has slowed and is expected to have turned negative in the month of June. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 48.5% in the segment, which was ahead of our expectations.\nThis represented a decline of 170 basis points due to the acquisition of EVO. However, excluding the impact of Vevo and dispositions, adjusted operating margin increased 50 basis points. Our Issuer Solutions business produced adjusted net revenue of $505 million, reflecting 5% constant currency growth, consistent with our long-term targets. The core issuer business also grew mid-single digits on a constant currency basis this quarter, driven by strength in volume-based revenue.\nAs Cameron highlighted, traditional accounts on file increased by approximately $10 million sequentially as we continue to see healthy account growth with our larger consumer portfolio customers and benefit from the ongoing execution of our conversion pipeline. Transactions again grew double digits compared to the second quarter of 2022, led by commercial card transactions, which increased 17%. This was partially offset, as expected, by slower growth in Managed Services as we continue to pivot our issuer business to more technology enablement and less lower-margin outsourced call center business.\nFinally, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 46.7%, an increase of 300 basis points from the prior year, fueled by our top line growth and our continuing focus on driving efficiencies in the business. From a cash flow standpoint, we produced adjusted free cash flow for the quarter of $543 million, which is an approximately 80% conversion rate of adjusted net income to free cash flow.\nWe continue to target converting roughly 100% of adjusted earnings to adjusted free cash flow for the full year excluding roughly a 5-point impact of the timing change to recognizing research and development tax credits. For the year, we expect our free cash flow to follow a similar trajectory to 2022 and as we benefit from seasonality and a higher conversion rate in the second half of the year.\nWe invested $169 million in capital expenditures during the quarter, and continue to expect capital investment to be approximately $630 million in 2023, consistent with our prior outlook. This quarter, we also repurchased approximately 2 million of our shares for roughly $200 million.\nDuring the quarter, we reduced outstanding debt by approximately $650 million. Our balance sheet remains healthy. We have over $2.5 billion of available liquidity, and our leverage position is roughly 3.7x currently, a reduction from the peak levels we realized upon closing of the EVO transaction. We remain on track to return to a leverage level consistent with our longer-term targets in the low 3s by the end of 2023 and while maintaining existing investment-grade ratings.\nAs we highlighted last quarter, in January, we established a $2 billion commercial paper program, which is supported by our revolving credit agreement and allows us to further optimize our capital structure and reduce our overall cost of borrowing.\nAt the end of the second quarter, we had $1.8 billion of commercial paper outstanding, up from $1 billion at the end of March, highlighting the attractiveness and credit quality of Global Payments. Our total indebtedness is approximately 85% fixed with a weighted average cost of debt of 3.9%.\nWe are pleased with how our business is positioned following our first half performance and we are raising our financial outlook for the year. We now expect reported adjusted net revenue to range from $8.60 billion to $8.735 billion, reflecting growth of 7% to 8% over 2022. This represents an increase of $25 million at the low end of the range. We continue to expect foreign currency rates to be roughly neutral for the full year.\nMoving to margins. We continue to forecast annual adjusted operating margin to expand by up to 120 basis points for 2023. As a reminder, this is above our cycle guidance for margin expansion of 50 to 75 basis points annually, driven by benefits to our business mix from our ongoing shift towards technology enablement, and the divestiture of NetSpend, partially offset by the lower margin profile of EVO prior to full synergy realization.\nTo provide color at the segment level, we now anticipate our Merchant segment to report adjusted net revenue growth of approximately 16% for the full year. This is an increase from our prior outlook of 15% to 16%. We expect a modest decline in reported adjusted operating margin for the merchant business this year driven by the absorption of EVO Payments with its lower margin profile consistent with our prior guidance.\nSpecifically, we are forecasting margin contraction in the third quarter that will be followed by slight margin expansion in the fourth quarter as synergies ramp. Regarding the EVO integration, we've made substantial progress, including the successful completion of our first 100-day plan and remain enthusiastic about the synergy opportunities available.\nSpecifically, we are on track to realize the approximately $35 million in cost synergies this year that we outlined previously, driven primarily by the elimination of public company costs, facility rationalization and the harmonization of duplicative vendor contracts.\nFurther, I am pleased to report that we have also executable plans to achieve the run rate expense synergy target of at least $125 million within 2 years that we committed to at the time of the announcement. As always, we remain focused on sizing expense synergy expectations with an eye towards ensuring that we maintain momentum in the combined business and that is well positioned to continue to grow and expand in the future.\nAdditionally, as we discussed last quarter, although revenue synergies have a longer tail we continue to believe we can add at least a point or 2 of growth on top of Zego's existing run rate revenue base or approximately $10 million to $15 million of revenue synergies from the business.\nMoving to Issuer Solutions. We continue to expect to deliver adjusted net revenue growth in the 5% to 6% range for the full year compared to 2022. This outlook reflects core issuer growth of roughly 5%, while we expect Mineral Cree and Netspend's B2B businesses to grow low double digits.\nWe anticipate adjusted operating margin for the issuer business to expand by up to 60 basis points, consistent with our prior outlook as we benefit from the natural operating leverage in the business.\nTurning to a couple of nonoperating items. We expect net interest expense to be roughly $550 million and for our adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 19.5%, and consistent with our prior guidance. For modeling purposes, we continue to assume excess cash is used to pay down indebtedness in the second half of 2023. Putting it all together, we now expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $10.35 to $10.44, reflecting growth of 11% to 12% and over 2022.\nExcluding dispositions, adjusted earnings per share growth is expected to be 16% to 17% for 2023. Our second quarter results represent roughly a $0.03 adjusted earnings per share beat relative to our internal forecast. Our raised guidance for calendar 2023, and essentially rolls the beat at the low end of the guidance range for the year given the ongoing uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment globally.\nSimilar to what you've heard from others, in July, we saw a stability in our performance compared to our second quarter results. While our base case outlook today resumes spending trends and the macroeconomic backdrop relatively consistent with the current environment. Our guidance range accommodates the potential for a moderation in spending and overall macroeconomic environment over the remainder of the year. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Cameron.\n\nCameron M. Bready\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. I've been at Global Payments for nearly a decade, and I am more enthusiastic now than I ever have been about the opportunities in front of us. We have a compelling technology-enabled strategy, a world-class team, great partners and clients and a global presence with diverse distribution capabilities.\nAs I step into the CEO role, I'm highly focused on several priorities for our business and customers. First is continuing to pursue the key pillars of the strategy we set forth in detail at our investor conference in September 2021. While sharpening our focus on the most attractive opportunities we see in these areas, and amplifying our investment on the most impactful of these initiatives.\nThis is the right strategy for our business and one that positions us well for continued growth and value creation. Second is continuing to make it at the easiest pool to do business with Global Payments, while providing more commerce enablement solutions that deepen our relationships with our customers.\nThis starts with our ongoing focus on meeting our clients and customers how and where they want to be met with innovative and distinctive solutions that integrate seamlessly. And of course, we need to continue to couple this with exceptional service to ensure that we delight our customers with every interaction, leveraging our scale that many competitors simply cannot match.\nThird is to maintain our relentless focus on execution, which has been one of the hallmarks of Global Payments and a key component of our ability to produce consistent results through market cycles. We have good competitors in our markets, and I strongly believe the consistency of execution separates one from another. Global Payments will set the standard for execution in our space.\nLast and certainly not least, I am focused on ensuring Global Payments' culture is second to none. Our culture dictates how we accomplish our goals and achieve results as an organization. It is the connective tissue that makes the organization operate effectively. Having a world-class culture will further differentiate us from our competitors drive value creation and benefit all of our constituents.\nI'm delighted to be taking over global payments now that we have simplified our business and clarified our strategy going forward. With a sharpened focus, relentless execution and disciplined investment, I am confident our exceptional team will drive sustainable growth and performance. We look forward to sharing more as we continue on our journey. The future is indeed very bright to Global Payments. Winnie?\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Cameron. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions."

Welcome to Global Payments First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Winnie Smith. Please go ahead, Winnie.\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Global Payments First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call can be found on the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpayments.com.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today's conference call contain forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results. These statements are subject to risks uncertainties and other factors, including the impact of economic conditions on our future operations that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K and subsequent filings. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update them.\nWe will also be referring to several non-GAAP financial measures which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance. For a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call to the most comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC regulations, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and our supplemental materials available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nJoining me on the call are Jeff Sloan, CEO; Cameron Bready, President and COO; and Josh Whipple, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey S. Sloan\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThanks, Winnie. We are pleased to have delivered our best first quarter in 4 years, exceeding our expectations to start 2023 despite continuing macro uncertainties. Our ongoing businesses produced adjusted net revenue growth, adjusted operating margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share growth, consistent with our cycle guidance once again. This performance reflects the wisdom of our strategies and our consistent focus on execution.\nWe accomplished these results while also turning the page on our strategic initiatives. First, we are delighted to have closed our acquisition of EVO Payments in late March, and we are already off to a strong start. Cameron will provide more details on our integration efforts now underway, so let me preface his comments by saying that we remain as excited about the many opportunities we have together as we were at the time we announced the transaction 9 months ago. I am delighted to officially welcome EVO's valued team members to the Global Payments family.\nWe are pleased to have also recently completed the divestitures of Netspend consumer assets and our Gaming Solutions business. With the successful execution of these transactions, we are focused on managing our go-forward business composition, with Merchant Solutions representing approximately 75% of our adjusted net revenue and Issuer Solutions, including B2B, comprising roughly 25%. This platform provides us the ideal set core capabilities from which to grow for many years to come. Both issuer and merchant posted exceptional results for the first quarter.\nStarting with Issuer Solutions, our core business again generated substantial sequential financial and operating improvement, achieving high single-digit growth and marking its best quarterly performance in more than 5 years. It is worth highlighting that our core customer base consists of money center and systemically important financial institutions globally. We believe that we've been the beneficiary of incremental depositary flows for larger institutions, combined with several significant implementations during the quarter, which we expect to provide tailwinds for some time to come. Year-over-year, consumer transaction volumes grew into the double digits.\nOur commercial part business also continued to perform, with transactions growing nearly 25% in the first quarter as cross-border and domestic corporate travel continued its recovery trajectory. Traditional accounts on file increased by roughly 20 million sequentially and double digits from the prior year to a new record due to strong conversion execution of new accounts and growth with existing customers. Our decade-long strategy of aligning with market share winners continues to bear fruit. And I think it's clear at this point that the legacy versus fintech hypothesis from 2021 has now been thoroughly debunked and turned on its head.\nWe're delighted that we successfully converted a significant portion of one of the top 10 commercial banks in the United States in early March. This win was a double competitive takeaway early after the announcement of our merger. We also completed the conversion of the Postbank portfolio in April. And in collaboration with AWS, we successfully deployed our cloud-based data and analytics platform for a leading financial institution partner in the United States. Finally, we are pleased to have signed multiyear extensions with M&T Bank as well as another long-standing U.S.-based FI partner during the quarter. We currently have 9 letters of intent with institutions worldwide, nearly all of which were achieved through a competitive RFP process.\nTurning to B2B. We continue to drive strong growth with both corporates and financial institutions as we leverage our virtual card, MineralTree AP automation and employer solution capabilities. This quarter, we achieved record supplier enrollments as middle market companies further digitize their payments. It's worth noting that MineralTree delivered normalized growth of roughly 20% for the period, and we continue to expect near 30% growth for this business in calendar 2023.\nWe are proud of the resiliency of our merchant business, which delivered double-digit growth, excluding dispositions and the 1-week contribution from EVO. This performance was achieved despite incremental macro uncertainties driven by the banking crisis that developed in the latter part of the quarter. Standouts for the period again include our worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel businesses with growth accelerating to the high teens. Speaking of UCP, we are making great progress in our partnership with Spring by Citi that now spans North America, the U.K. and Continental Europe. We are currently live across 14 countries and run rating at more than 100 million transactions and over $3 billion in volume annually. And based on our pipeline with many of Citi's largest treasury and trade solutions customers, we are on track to more than double our volume together by the end of 2023.\nWe also continue to see strong trends in our integrated business in the U.S. which grew at a mid-teens rate with sustained rates of accelerated growth. We also produced a record quarter for new sales in this channel, demonstrating ongoing strong demand for our solutions.\nAdditionally, vertical markets achieved double-digit growth led by School Solutions, [ Egon ] Real Estate and Xenial in quick service restaurants and stadiums. After announcing our partnership with the [ Brave ] last quarter, we were excited to have gone live with our Xenial cloud point-of-sale solutions on April 6, opening day for [ Truis Park ].\nAnd we are pleased to have reached agreement with a leading parks and entertainment company to provide both our Xenial food and beverage solutions as well as our retail solutions at all of its theme park locations across the United States.\nOur pipeline remains full across our fixed service restaurant and sports and entertainment businesses. Stay tuned.\nOutside the United States, our Asia-Pacific business produced its best first quarter since 2018 as COVID-related restrictions were lifted at the end of 2022, including in Greater China.\nWe continue to see strong trends in other factor growth geographies, such as Spain and Central Europe, and we are excited to enhance our scale with EVO in these markets. We also had several successful product launches during the quarter in Europe, including our point-of-sale solution in Central Europe and our [ tap-on-phone ]solution in the U.K. These all bode well for the cross-sell opportunities with EVO.\nBefore I turn over to Cameron, I'd like to address the announcement of my departure as CEO of Global Payments effective June 1 and the appointment of Cameron Bready is our next CEO. I've known Cameron personally for 9 years, and he has held the most senior and trusted positions in our company during that time, first, as our CFO and today as our President and COO. Cameron is an outstanding leader and the right person to succeed me. I have every confidence in his and our company's [ continuing for ] future success and will do everything I can to ensure a smooth transition to Cameron over the coming weeks.\nNow is the right time for us to execute on our succession plans. We recently closed on all 3 of our strategic transactions, and we [indiscernible] our best first quarter in 4 years with our first [indiscernible] raise in 18 months. Our businesses are exceptionally healthy. We delivered on a heightened cycle guidance in 2022 and are poised to do the same in 2023, excluding, of course, dispositions.\nWhile challenges undoubtedly remain, we are on a path to return to normalcy, as I suggested and hoped for on our February call.\nWhen we arrived at Global Payments 13 years ago, we had many strengths, but we lacked direct distribution, scale and e-commerce, a B2B strategy, and we have much legacy technology debt to repay. Now roughly 10 years after I became CEO, we have distinctive software assets owned and partnered, a market-leading e-comm and omnichannel presence, enhanced exposure to faster-growth markets and sizable B2B assets. We couple distinctive distribution with a solid technology footprint and unique multiyear collaborations with both AWS and Google.\nFinally and importantly, over the last 9.5 years since we've been running the company, GPN stock has compounded at nearly 16.5% annually, 650 basis points in excess of the S&P 500 Index and 300 basis points in excess of our peers despite all the turmoil over the last 3 years. Simply put, we've accomplished our goals.\nI'll now turn the call to Cameron.\n\nCameron M. Bready\n\nSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning. Let me start by acknowledging what an honor and privilege it is for me to be named the next CEO of Global Payments. I'm grateful for the Board's confidence in me leading the company going forward, and I look forward to working with all of you in this capacity, continuing what has been a long history of outstanding leadership at Global Payments.\nOn behalf of the 27,000 team members of Global Payments, I also want to thank Jeff for his leadership as CEO over the past decade. The transformation under the business under his stewardship has been remarkable, and it shaped the company into the payments technology powerhouse it is today.\nFurther, on a more personal note, I want to express my sincere appreciation for his mentorship and friendship during my time here at Global Payments. Jeff and I have worked side-by-side over my 9 years at the company and importantly have been completely aligned on the 4-pillar strategy we articulated at our investor conference roughly 18 months ago. We remain committed to this strategy as we endeavor to build the leading technology-enabled, software-driven payments business worldwide.\nHaving now closed the acquisition of EVO and the divestitures of our Netspend consumer and Gaming Solutions businesses, we have completed our strategic pivot. I'm delighted to be taking over at a time when our business now reflects the simpler model more geared towards our corporate customers we've been foreshadowing since August of last year.\nOver the next month, Jeff and I will work closely to ensure a smooth and orderly transition. I look forward to continuing the company's rich history of investing strategically to drive differentiated growth and value for our shareholders, customers and team members while fostering a culture that is second to none and enhancing our corporate citizen shift in the communities in which we live and work around the globe.\nWith that, I would like to echo Jeff's remarks welcoming EVO team members to Global Payments. While we are still in the early days, we have made substantial progress on our integration and remain enthusiastic about the synergy opportunities available. Since announcing the transaction in August, we have an ample time to formulate integration plans and prepare for day 1, allowing us to truly hit the ground running. We have established a robust leadership and governance structure, as we do with all of our acquisitions, which has resulted in a smooth transition and enabled us to implement early actions that align with our targets.\nI'm pleased to report that we currently have executable plans to achieve the run rate EBITDA synergy target of at least $125 million within 2 years that we committed to at the time of the announcement. The substantial expense synergy opportunities are expected to come primarily from aligning our business operations and go-to-market strategies, streamlining technology infrastructure, eliminating duplicative corporate and operational support structures and realizing scale efficiencies. As always, we remain focused on sizing expense synergy expectations with an eye towards ensuring that we maintain momentum in the combined business and that it is well positioned to continue to grow and expand in the future.\nAnd regarding the potential revenue enhancements, I will start by reiterating that as one company, we are uniquely positioned to deliver an unmatched suite of distinctive software and payment solutions to our combined customer base globally. More specifically, I would highlight 3 broad categories that we believe provide us with ample run rate to drive revenue synergies from the acquisition.\nFirst, we see significant opportunity to bring further value to EVO's relationships by leveraging our extensive distribution platforms and product portfolio as well as our unique partner integration capabilities. This includes our point-of-sale technologies, commerce-enablement solutions and vertical market software offerings. As one example, we are bringing our point-of-sale software to key international markets where we overlap with EVO, including the U.K., Spain and Central Europe. We plan to cross sell our point-of-sale software into EVO's customer base in these geographies as well as bring these capabilities to EVO markets where we do not overlap today, including Mexico, Ireland, Poland and Greece.\nSecond, we expect to capitalize on our ability to provide EVO's multinational customers e-commerce and omnichannel solutions across markets and geographies, seamlessly blending their physical and virtual requirements. With our combined physical presence in over 40 countries globally and the ability to transact in over 170 virtually, we can significantly expand EVO's value proposition to its existing customers. We have already initiated a discussion with some of EVO's largest MNC clients to explore opportunities to support them in additional markets around the world.\nThird, EVO's accounts receivable automation software and B2B payment solutions augment our existing accounts payable automation and other capabilities, rounding out our full suite of B2B offerings. Together with EVO, we are well positioned to further grow and scale our B2B portfolio, particularly on the acceptance side, which includes leveraging EVO's extensive proprietary integrations to some of the most widely used ERP environments in the marketplace through its PayFabric platform.\nWe could not be more excited about the many opportunities we have together with EVO given its alignment with our overarching strategy, further reinforcing our position as the preeminent payments technology company with extensive scale and unmatched global reach. Josh?\n\nJoshua J. Whipple\n\nSenior EVP and Chief Strategy & Enterprise Risk Officer, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Cameron. We are pleased with our strong financial performance in the first quarter, which exceeded our expectations despite ongoing macro concerns, highlighting the strength and durability of our business. Specifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $2.05 billion, an increase of 6.5% from the same period in the prior year on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of dispositions and roughly 1 week of contribution from EVO, adjusted net revenue increased 9% on a constant currency basis.\nAdjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 200 basis points to 43.1%. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.40, an increase of 18% on a constant currency basis compared to the same period in 2022.\nTaking a closer look at performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.46 billion for the first quarter with constant currency growth of 10%, excluding dispositions and the contribution from EVO. This performance was led by the ongoing strength of our technology-enabled businesses while we benefited from a recovery in Asia Pacific as COVID restrictions eased across greater China markets. We also saw consistent double-digit growth from our vertical market, POS and payroll businesses. This strength was partially offset by ongoing headwinds from adverse foreign currency exchange rates along with macro softness in limited geographies, including the U.K.\nWe delivered an adjusted operating margin of 47.3% in the segment, consistent with last year. Excluding the impact of EVO's close in March, adjusted operating margin expanded 25 basis points and was in line with our expectations.\nWe are pleased with the fundamental performance of our Issuer Solutions business in the first quarter, which produced adjusted net revenue of $490 million, reflecting growth of 7.2% on a constant currency basis. Notably, Core Issuer grew high single digits this quarter, excluding the impact of FX, which was over 300-basis point acceleration sequentially.\nAs Jeff highlighted, traditional accounts on file increased by approximately 20 million sequentially, driven by strong account growth from our major consumer portfolio customers as well as several portfolio conversions we successfully completed during the period. Transactions also grew double digits compared to the first quarter of 2022 with strong contributions coming from both commercial and consumer card transactions.\nFinally, we delivered adjusted operating margins of 43.9% and an increase of 80 basis points from the prior year fueled by our accelerated growth.\nAs for adjusted free cash flow, consistent with the prior period, we converted approximately 80% of adjusted earnings into adjusted free cash flow. We continue to target converting roughly 100% of adjusted earnings for the full year, excluding the impact of the timing change related to recognition of research and development tax credits. We expect our adjusted free cash flow conversion for the year to follow a similar trajectory as 2022.\nWe invested $162 million in capital expenditures during the quarter and continue to expect capital spending to be around $630 million in 2023, consistent with our long-term targets.\nThis quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million of our shares for roughly $200 million, which was executed prior to the closing of our acquisition of EVO Payments on March 24.\nTo help fund the EVO transaction, in early March we successfully priced an EUR 800 million inaugural European debt offering at a fixed rate coupon of 4.875% due in 2031. With this transaction, we continue to evolve our capital structure to align with our global operations and gain access to a broader investor base and new sources of capital.\nSeparately, in January, we established a $2 billion commercial paper program. The CP program is supported by our revolving credit agreement. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1 billion of commercial paper outstanding. We currently have in excess of $3 billion of available liquidity. Following the aforementioned capital markets transactions and drawing on the revolver to close EVO, our total indebtedness is approximately 90% fixed with a weighted average cost of debt of 3.8%.\nWe are also delighted to have closed both the divestiture of Netspend's consumer assets and the sale of the Gaming Solutions business in April. Following all of these transactions, our balance sheet remains healthy and our leverage position is roughly 3.8x currently. We continue to expect to return to a similar leverage level to where we ended 2022 by year-end 2023 while maintaining existing investment-grade ratings.\nWe are pleased with how our business is positioned following our first quarter performance, and we are raising our financial outlook for the year. We now expect reported adjusted net revenue to range from $8.635 billion to $8.735 billion, reflecting growth of 7% to 8% over 2022, an increase from 6% to 7% previously.\nWe continue to forecast annual adjusted operating margin to expand by up to 120 basis points for 2023. As a reminder, this is above our cycle guidance for margin expansion of 50 to 75 basis points annually driven by benefits to our business mix from our ongoing shift towards technology enablement and the divestiture of Netspend, partially offset by the lower margin profile of EVO prior to full synergy realization.\nTo provide color at the segment level, we continue to anticipate our merchant segment to report adjusted net revenue growth of roughly 15% to 16% for the full year but now expect to be toward the higher end of that range.\nWe continue to expect more than 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion from the existing Global Payments merchant business excluding dispositions in 2023, which again is ahead of our cycle guide. We expect this expansion will be more than offset beginning in the second quarter with the absorption of the lower margin profile of EVO Payments. We anticipate this impact to be mitigated by synergy realization as the year progresses.\nAs a result, we are forecasting margin contraction in the second and third quarters and then margin expansion in Q4 as synergies ramp for our merchant business. The net result will be a modest decline in our total merchant business reported adjusted operating margin for the year consistent with our prior guidance.\nMoving to Issuer Solutions. We now expect to deliver adjusted net revenue growth in the 5% to 6% range, up from 4.5% to 5.5% previously for the full year compared to 2022. This outlook reflects our better-than-expected performance in the first quarter and the benefit we anticipate from our conversion pipeline.\nSpecifically, we now expect Core Issuer to grow about 5% and continue to expect MineralTree and Netspend's B2B businesses to grow low double digits. We anticipate adjusted operating margin for the issuer business to expand by up to 60 basis points, consistent with our prior outlook, as we benefit from the natural operating leverage in the business.\nIn terms of quarterly phasing, there are 2 continuing items to note. First, while we expect foreign exchange rates to be roughly neutral for the full year, we still anticipate a currency headwind to adjusted net revenue of up to 100 basis points in the second quarter.\nSecond, we expect the successful closing of the sale of Netspend for the end of April to add roughly $25 million of incremental revenue to the second quarter versus our prior expectation with no change to our expected earnings per share dilution impact for the year.\nMoving to a couple of nonoperating items. We expect net interest expense to be roughly $550 million, a modest $10 million increase from our prior guide in light of yield curve movements and for our adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 19.5%, consistent with our prior guidance.\nFor modeling purposes, we continue to assume excess cash is used to pay down indebtedness in 2023 until we return to our targeted leverage levels toward the end of the year with minimal share repurchases until then.\nPutting it all together, we now expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $10.32 to $10.44, reflecting growth of 11% to 12% over 2022, up from 10% to 11% previously. Excluding dispositions, adjusted earnings per share growth is expected to be 16% to 17% for 2023. This is consistent with our updated 2021 cycle guidance [ by incremental adverse ] changes in the macro environment since then.\nOur first quarter results represent roughly a $0.05 adjusted earnings per share beat relative to our internal forecast. Our raised guidance for calendar 2023 essentially rolls the beat plus a couple of cents for the year in light of the uncertainties of the current environment.\nSimilar to what you've heard from others, we saw strength across our markets in January and February which moderated somewhat in a number of our businesses in March. Our issuer business did not experience any discernible moderation as our large money center bank customers benefited from the regional banking crisis that developed in March. Trends in this business continue to remain resilient through April and similar to March levels of activity. Our updated outlook today presumes a worldwide macroeconomic backdrop that is consistent with the current environment throughout the remainder of calendar year 2023.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey S. Sloan\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Global Payments, Inc.\n\nThanks, Josh. I couldn't be more proud of what we've achieved as a management team together over the last near decade with more than 27,000 team members across 40-plus countries. I'm also very pleased with our long history of [indiscernible] depth and succession planning. Cameron is only the third CEO of Global Payments in nearly a quarter century. He has my complete confidence, and I look forward to working with him closely to effect a smooth transition over the coming weeks. I personally thank all our team members for what they do for us every day as well as our millions of customers and thousands of partners and shareholders for the trust you put in us and in me over the last 13 years. The future is bright at Global Payments.\nWinnie?\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Jeff. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions."

Please go ahead.\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSVP of IR, Global Payments Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Global Payments Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Conference Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call can be found on the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpayments.com.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today's conference call contain forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and the proposed transaction between Global Payments and EVO Payments. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the impact of economic conditions on our future operations that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.\nCertain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K and subsequent filings. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update them.\nWe will also be referring to several non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance. For a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call to the most comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC regulations, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and our supplemental materials available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nJoining me on the call are Jeff Sloan, CEO; Cameron Bready, President and COO; and Josh Whipple, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey S. Sloan\n\nCEO & Director, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Winnie. We delivered strong results for the fourth quarter and calendar 2022 in what was an unprecedented year by nearly any measure with heightened worldwide macroeconomic uncertainties caused by persistent inflation, dramatically rising interest rates, significant foreign exchange volatility, a war in Europe, and lingering impacts from the pandemic early in the period. Yet the consumer remained resilient throughout the year, and we enabled a record over 64 billion transactions, culminating in a successful holiday season with multiple all-time high peak days. We delivered record results for 2022.\nWhile it's certainly in the new year, internal metrics indicate more of the same. Where we have seen any discernible change, it is in some macro weakness in limited geographies like the United Kingdom and parts of Asia Pacific. Having said that, those items already are reflected in our fourth quarter results, and our guidance assumes no meaningful change in operating environments for 2023. We are pleased with our preliminary January results.\nFor the fourth quarter, our Merchant business delivered 9% adjusted net revenue growth excluding dispositions. And our Issuer segment achieved 5% adjusted net revenue growth, each on a foreign exchange neutral basis. Importantly, our core Issuer business again generated sequential financial and operating improvement, consistent with our expectations and the best performance since our merger with TSYS in 2019.\nFor the full year, our performance was consistent with our September 2021 cycle guidance despite multiple black swan disruptions that emerged in 2022. Our Merchant business delivered 13% adjusted net revenue growth, excluding dispositions, and our Issuer business generated 5% growth, each on a constant currency basis. For calendar 2022, we produced 10% total adjusted net revenue growth, again, excluding dispositions, expanded margins by 200 basis points and generated 17% adjusted earnings per share growth on an FX-neutral basis, all right lined with our raised cycle guidance from 18 months ago, despite all the incremental challenges of the macroeconomic environment.\nAt our investor conference, we outlined our 4-pillar strategy and focus on a simpler model more geared toward our corporate customers with enhanced growth and margin prospects. We detailed our capital allocation priorities that balance building the leading technology-enabled, software-driven payments business worldwide with efficient return of capital. And we highlighted our commitment to advancing our strategic partnerships with leading global technology companies, investors and share gaining financial institutions to further expand our competitive moat.\nWe anticipate closing the acquisition of EVO Payments no later than the end of this quarter. With EVO, we reinforced our position as a preeminent payments technology company with extensive scale and unmatched global reach. EVO enhances our target addressable markets, increases our leadership in integrated payments, expands our presence in new and provides further scale in existing geographies and augments our B2B software and payments solutions. We look forward to welcoming EVO's valued team members to the Global Payments family.\nWe also remain on track to close the divestiture of Netspend's consumer portfolio by the end of the current quarter, a key element of our strategic pivot. We believe that this transaction will best position Netspend's consumer business for future success, and we wish its team members the best of luck in the future.\nAdditionally, we have reached an agreement to sell our Gaming Solutions business to Parthenon Capital Partners for $415 million. This transaction, much like the sale of Netspend B2C is consistent with our efforts to refine our portfolio toward our core corporate customers in a way from consumer-centric businesses. These 3 transactions further our strategic objectives, simplify our businesses and provide us with enhanced confidence in our growth and margin targets. We expect each of them to close by the end of March, providing us with core businesses from which to grow for many years to come.\nOur unique ability to provide differentiated vertical market software, payments and other technology solutions continues to resonate with customers. Our vertical market segment again delivered low double-digit growth in the fourth quarter with our QSR and School Solutions businesses, notable standouts. We are delighted to announce today that both the Atlanta Hawks and the Atlanta Braves have chosen Global Payments to serve as their official commerce technology provider for State Farm Arena and Truist Park. The Hawks and the Braves ranked comprehensive RFPs to select their partner for the future. And they chose Global Payments because of our ability to deliver distinctive cloud-based software and payment solutions to create enhanced frictionless experiences that increase fan engagement, drive loyalty, provide cloud-based data and improve operational efficiency. We are proud to be the commerce technology partner for all of Georgia's major professional sports and entertainment venues. And our pipeline in this channel remains robust.\nIn addition to the Hawks and the Braves takeaways, Xenial produced record revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. Recent wins also include A&W Restaurants, Jack in the Box and Panda Express. What do these new customers all have in common such that they chose us in recent competitive takeaways? In short, consumer expectations for the sports and entertainment and QSR channels are high, and the pace of technological change in those markets plays uniquely to our competitive strengths. Our technologies are winning every day in the marketplace with more than 51,000 restaurants in over 65 countries choosing our purpose-built ecosystems to deliver positive experiences back to their customers.\nOther standouts in our Merchant business for the fourth quarter include our integrated and worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel businesses, which both again delivered mid-teens growth in the period. We are excited to combine the best of these businesses with EVO as our integration activities commence in the near term. In addition, we're now live with our acquiring relationship with Google across North America on the heels of the success of our initial launch in Asia Pacific in 2021.\nTurning to our Issuer business. We produced the best performance we have experienced since the TSYS merger in 2019 in the fourth quarter of 2022. We ended last year with a record 816 million traditional accounts on file, an increase of 15 million AOF sequentially, driven by double-digit account growth with industry-leading customers as our strategy of aligning with market share winners shows gains.\nOur commercial card business continued to perform well, with transactions growing 20% in the fourth quarter as cross-border and domestic corporate travel continued its recovery trajectory. We lead in the issuer market with cutting-edge technologies, worldwide scale, terrific customer service and a partnership mentality. While the issuing business has always been, and we expect will always remain highly competitive, those partners seeking to compete digitally know where they need to invest to be competitive in the marketplace.\nMuch like in the Merchant business, Issuing businesses in growth-challenged markets without the wherewithal to make cloud-centric technology investments for the digital future will be increasingly challenged to compete. Thankfully, that's not our target market. We are very pleased to announce that TSYS signed a multiyear extension with Bank of America, one of our largest customers and relationship that spans consumer and commercial card portfolios in North America and the United Kingdom. We also extended our successful partnership with Deutsche Bank, our largest client in the DACH region into the next decade as TSYS remains their partner of choice for scheme-branded card portfolios across international brands, including Deutsche Bank and Postbank, also good timing in light of our pending entry into the acquiring business in Germany through EVO. Other recent multiyear extensions with long-standing customers include P&C for its commercial business.\nOur durable relationships with some of the most complex and sophisticated institutions globally speak to our competitiveness well into the remainder of this decade. We currently have 9 letters of intent with institutions worldwide, nearly all of which were achieved through a competitive RFP process. This includes a recent LOI for new business with TSYS in Mexico, well timed in relation to EVO and a competitive takeaway conducted via RFP. Another 12 of our recent LOIs, including 5 competitive takeaways, have gone to contract since the beginning of 2022, providing further future growth opportunities.\nWe recently entered the Swedish market through a contract we executed with Entercard during the quarter spanning both its consumer and commercial portfolios. And we've got a contract with Scotia Chile portfolio, which is being added to our agreement with Scotiabank, a partnership that spans multiple markets across the Americas. This marks our second win in Chile, following the long-term agreement we reached with market-leading retailer, Cencosud, signed earlier this year.\nOur issuer conversion pipeline stands at a record post-merger of over 75 million accounts, providing further confidence of our growth trajectory well into the future. We are pleased to report that we have now reached business agreement on a head of terms with CaixaBank, one of the largest issuing institutions across Europe. Post implementation, we expect to become one of the largest debit technology providers in Europe.\nWe are the beneficiaries of technological innovation, continued share shift and market share gains is just one example while we've been providing market-leading technologies for buy now, pay later initiatives for decades. We continue to innovate and deliver installment products as BNPL demand grows. This includes launching a successful BNPL program with one of our long-standing partners, NatWest, to aid customers with longer-term purchases and special events. This product was designed to enable payments to be easily tracked and incorporates the robust fraud protections provided by FCA-regulated purchases.\nOther issuer highlights include a new partnership with Mastercard, leveraging Ethoca Consumer Clarity to improve the dispute resolution process and digital experiences for more than 25 million cardholders in the U.S. and the U.K. We also are collaborating with fintech Software-as-a-Service platform, Mambu, to provide next-generation capabilities for financial services customers across a number of strategic use cases, including credit cards, BNPL, prepaid cards, and a range of deposits and lending solutions.\nFinally, we've now combined the TSYS commercial card business, MineralTree, and Netspend's B2B assets into a single unified B2B organization within the Issuer Solutions business as we focus on driving cross-selling opportunities. Across MineralTree and our core TSYS virtual card capabilities, total spend grew more than 50% in 2022 over the prior year as we remain focused on bringing the industry's best virtual card capabilities to our FIs, enabling B2B transactions, mobile wallet provisioning and online travel capabilities. MineralTree had a terrific fourth quarter of 2022 with growth in excess of 30%, and it is well positioned for gains heading into 2023.\nJosh?\n\nJoshua J. Whipple\n\nCFO, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff. We are pleased with our strong financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year, which highlights the durability of our business model. Starting with the results for the full year 2022. We delivered adjusted net revenue of $8.09 billion, an increase of 7% from the prior year on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of dispositions, adjusted net revenue increased 10% on a constant currency basis.\nAdjusted operating margin for the full year improved 190 basis points to 43.7%. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $9.32, an increase of 17% on a constant currency basis compared to the full year 2021, which includes the impact of the exit of our Russia business during the second quarter. These results were consistent with our guidance expectations and with our September 2021 cycle guidance from our investor conference despite all the challenges Jeff highlighted earlier.\nMoving to the fourth quarter results. We delivered adjusted net revenue of $2.02 billion, an increase of 4.4% from the same period in the prior year on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of dispositions, adjusted net revenue increased 7% on a constant currency basis.\nAdjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 240 basis points to 44.4%. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.42, an increase of 17% on a constant currency basis compared to the same period in 2021.\nTaking a closer look at performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.41 billion for the fourth quarter, reflecting constant currency growth of 9% excluding dispositions. This performance was led by the ongoing strength of our U.S. and technology-enabled businesses. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 48.4% in the segment, an increase of 20 basis points year-on-year as we continue to benefit from the underlying strength of our business mix.\nWe saw double-digit growth across a number of our U.S. businesses in the quarter, including our integrated channel, vertical markets portfolio, POS solutions, and HCM and payroll businesses, while our worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel businesses also delivered growth in the mid-teens on a constant currency basis this quarter. This strength was partially offset by ongoing headwinds from adverse foreign currency exchange rates along with macro softness in limited geographies like the U.K. and continued COVID-related restrictions in parts of Asia Pacific.\nWe are pleased with the fundamental performance of our Issuer Solutions business in the fourth quarter. Notably, core Issuer grew 5% this quarter, excluding the impact of FX, which was an 80 basis point acceleration sequentially and positions us well heading into 2023. As Jeff highlighted, traditional accounts on file increased by 15 million sequentially, driven primarily by strong account growth from our major consumer portfolio customers. Transactions also grew high single digits compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 with strong contributions coming from commercial card transactions, which were up roughly 20% for the quarter.\nOur total Issuer business including B2B delivered $501 million in adjusted net revenue, also a 5% improvement on a constant currency basis for the same period in 2021. Excluding the impact of our PayCard business, which faced headwinds from both employment trends due to the macro environment, and the lapping of pandemic subsidies, Issuer Solutions grew 5.3% on a constant currency basis. Finally, we delivered adjusted operating margins of 48.3%, an increase of 560 basis points from the prior year, fueled by our accelerated growth and focus on driving efficiencies in the business.\nFrom a cash flow standpoint, we produced strong adjusted free cash flow for the quarter of $723 million and $2.3 billion for the year, consistent with our target to convert roughly 100% of adjusted earnings into available cash, excluding the impact of the expired federal research and development tax credit. We invested $152 million in capital expenditures during the quarter and $616 million for the year, in line with our expectations.\nFurther, this quarter, we repurchased approximately 7.3 million of our shares for approximately $790 million. And for the full year, we repurchased 23.3 million shares for $2.9 billion or approximately 8% of our shares outstanding. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and our leverage position was 3.2x on a net debt basis at quarter end.\nWe made further progress on our strategic priorities during the fourth quarter and remain on track to close our acquisition of EVO Payments and the divestiture of Netspend's consumer assets by the end of the quarter. As Jeff mentioned, we also reached an agreement to sell our gaming business to Parthenon Capital Partners. We are pleased to have received HSR approval for this transaction and have submitted all other required regulatory filings. We also expect to close the Gaming Solutions divestiture by the end of this quarter. As a result, our business mix as of April 1 of this year will reflect our future state composition for 3 quarters of 2023 and beyond.\nWe have ample financial flexibility, including our $5.75 billion revolving credit facility, which is currently undrawn. And following the completion of all of these transactions, we expect our net leverage to be approximately 3.75x, below our prior estimates. We continue to expect to return to current leverage levels by year-end 2023, while maintaining existing investment-grade ratings.\nWe are pleased with how our business is positioned as we enter 2023 and the resulting financial outlook for the year. We currently expect reported adjusted net revenue to range from $8.575 billion to $8.675 billion, reflecting growth of 6% to 7% over 2022. We are forecasting annual adjusted operating margin to expand by up to 120 basis points for 2023. This is above our cycle guidance for margin expansion of 50 to 75 basis points annually, driven by benefits to our business mix from our ongoing shift towards technology enablement and the divestiture of Netspend, partially offset by the lower margin profile of EVO prior to full synergy realization.\nTo provide color at the segment level, we expect our Merchant segment to report adjusted net revenue growth of roughly 15% to 16% for the full year. This includes growth of approximately 9% to 10%, excluding the impact of the acquisition of EVO Payments and dispositions. We expect the EVO Payments acquisition to contribute approximately $475 million of adjusted net revenue in calendar 2023, which assumes the transaction closes at the end of the current quarter.\nWe expect more than 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion from the existing Global Payments Merchant business, excluding dispositions in 2023, ahead of our cycle guide. This expansion will be more than offset beginning in the second quarter with the absorption of the lower margin profile of EVO Payments. We expect this impact will be mitigated by synergy realization as the year progresses. As a result, we are forecasting margin expansion in Q1, contraction in the middle of the year and then margin expansion in Q4 as synergies ramp for our Merchant business. The net result will be a modest decline in our total Merchant business reported adjusted operating margin for the year.\nMoving to Issuer Solutions. We expect to deliver adjusted net revenue growth in the 5% range, including Netspend's B2B assets for the full year compared to 2022 as we benefit from our strongest conversion pipeline since the TSYS merger. Specifically, we expect core Issuer to grow roughly 5% and for MineralTree and Netspend's B2B businesses to grow low double digits. We anticipate adjusted operating margin for the Issuer business to expand up to 60 basis points as we continue to benefit from operating leverage in the business as growth continues to accelerate, offset somewhat by faster growth in our lower-margin B2B businesses.\nFinally, while the disposition of our Consumer Solutions business is naturally expected to be a headwind for the full year, this transaction enhances the overall growth and adjusted operating margin profile of the business going forward. In terms of quarterly phasing, there are several items to note. First, while we expect foreign exchange rates to be roughly neutral for the full year, we anticipate the currency headwind to adjusted net revenue of up to 200 basis points in the first quarter and a headwind of up to 100 basis points in the second quarter.\nSecond, we expect the timing of our EVO Payments acquisition and the dispositions of Netspend Consumer and Gaming to naturally impact quarterly growth rates during the year. We anticipate the impact of the disposition of the Netspend consumer business to be offset for the most part by the addition of EVO, which we expect to close at the end of the first quarter. Given the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures as well as foreign exchange rates, on our expectations for 2023, we have provided greater detail regarding our adjusted net revenue, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share assumptions for the year and by quarter in our slides posted today on our website.\nMoving to a couple of nonoperating items. We currently expect net interest expense to be roughly $540 million and for adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 19.5% for the full year. We also expect our capital expenditures to be around $630 million in 2023, consistent with our long-term targets. We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to again be in a comparable range of 100% of adjusted earnings per share in 2023. For modeling purposes, we have assumed excess cash is used to pay down indebtedness in 2023 until we return to our current leverage levels towards the end of the year with minimal share repurchases until then.\nPutting it all together, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $10.25 to $10.37, reflecting growth of 10% to 11% over 2022. Excluding dispositions, adjusted earnings per share growth would have been 15% to 16% for 2023. Finally, we anticipate and assume a stable worldwide macro backdrop throughout the calendar year in 2023, reflecting the current environment.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey S. Sloan\n\nCEO & Director, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Josh. I could not be more proud of all that we accomplished in 2022 despite the incremental challenges we faced throughout the year. These achievements have given us increased confidence in the accelerated growth trajectory we outlined at our investor conference. Simply put, we built a better, a more durable business model.\nOur expectations for 2023 are for a return to normalcy with businesses across our markets delivering a typical financial and operating levels. The consumer remains resilient with anticipated spending patterns reflected in our recent results and our guidance. The imminent closing of the acquisition of EVO and the sales of Netspend B2C and Gaming mean that 3 quarters of calendar 2023 will reflect results of the businesses that we intend to manage well into the future. We've completed the strategic pivot set forth in September 2021, and we are very much the better for it.\nWinnie?\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSVP of IR, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff. (Operator Instructions). Operator, we will now go to questions."

Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call can be found on the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpayments.com.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today's conference call contain forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and statements about the proposed transaction between Global Payments and EVO Payments. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the impact of COVID-19 and economic conditions on our future operations that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.

Sloan\n\nCEO & Director, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Winnie. We delivered record results in the third quarter, consistent with the higher end of our September 2021 cycle guidance on a constant currency basis and excluding dispositions, highlighting the resiliency of our business model and our consistency of execution across market cycles. Importantly, our merchant business again delivered double-digit revenue growth, and our core issuer business continued to produce sequential improvement, consistent with our expectations, each on a foreign exchange-neutral basis.\nInternal metrics thus far into October suggests continuing solid performance for the fourth quarter, much as September did versus August and August versus July. It's certainly possible that things could change for the worse, given ongoing macroeconomic concerns, but that would require an adverse change that we do not broadly see in the current environment. Notably, we are achieving these results while making substantial progress on our strategic and financing initiatives.\nWe received Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance in the United States for our acquisition of EVO Payments and divestiture of NetSpend's consumer business. And we have now made regulatory filings in all jurisdictions, foreign and domestic, contemplated by the transactions. We took steps to finance the EVO transaction with a successful $2.5 billion fixed-income offering in early August at attractive rates, and we undertook a concurrent long-term extension and enhancement of our revolving credit facility. We also completed our $1.5 billion strategic investment with Silver Lake and associated transactions.\nWe are proud of the company that we keep, and we welcome senior partner, Joe Osnoss from Silver Lake, to our Board of Directors.\nOur issuer business remains on track for continued core growth acceleration into year-end following an acceleration into the third quarter after a robust Q2. Our relationships with many of the most complex and sophisticated institutions globally speak to our competitiveness well into the remainder of this decade. Our issuer conversion pipeline now stands at a record post-merger of 75 million accounts, providing further confidence of our growth trajectory well into the future.\nWhat better example than our recent go-live with one of the top 10 commercial banks in the United States, which was a competitive takeaway early after the announcement of our merger. We are delighted that earlier this month, we began onboarding and servicing the bank's new consumer and small business commercial accounts on TS2. We expect this partner to be prepared for the conversion of its existing consumer and commercial accounts early next year.\nThis quarter, we also converted the consumer and commercial portfolios for another large U.S.-based bank as a new customer as well as a large retail portfolio acquired by an existing financial institution partner, both of which were competitive takeaways. And we continue to make great progress with AWS, our preferred issuer technology solutions partner, for unique distribution and cutting-edge technologies. We are pleased to announce that we have reached an LOI with a leading global travel technology company who chose TSYS as an issuer solutions partner for its platform across the U.K. and EU after an extensive RFP process. Once live, this will be our first fintech customer on PRIME in the AWS cloud in Europe.\nWe currently have 7 letters of intent with institutions worldwide, nearly all of which were achieved through a competitive RFP process and a competitive takeaway. Another 7 of our recent LOIs, including 5 competitive takeaways, have gone to contract since the beginning of 2022, providing further future growth opportunities.\nTraditional accounts on file increased by 14 million sequentially this quarter, driven by account growth with existing customers as our strategy of aligning with market share winners continues to pay dividends. And transaction volumes grew double digits in Q3, led by commercial card transactions which increased 25%, highlighting ongoing recovery trends in cross-border corporate travel and the strength of our long-lasting partnerships.\nAt our investor conference last September, we announced B2B as the fourth and newest pillar of our strategy, meaningfully expanding our target addressable markets. As of this quarter, we are now managing Netspend's B2B assets as a part of our issuer business after successfully aligning MineralTree's capabilities with this segment earlier this year. We are delighted with the momentum we are seeing across our B2B portfolio, which includes technology centered on virtual card solutions, a vast commercial card footprint, massive distribution partnerships with the world's leading financial institutions, data and analytics, market-leading payroll technologies and access globally to nonbank card rails.\nRecent B2B highlights include providing virtual commercial account services to banks and fintechs in partnership with Xtend, reaching a letter of intent with specialty fintech, [Evenvault], to enable commercial expense management and integrated payable solutions and signing a multiyear commercial card agreement with Santander in the United States as a competitive takeaway. We are also pleased to have signed new virtual card services and AP services in wins with 2 leading U.S. financial institutions.\nAdditionally, MineralTree achieved a number of milestones, including signing a marquee deal with Grupo Bimbo in the U.S. and Canada, one of our largest B2B bookings to date; generating record-breaking virtual card spend in the month of September; and executing a referral agreement with fintech, Ramp, to cross-sell expense management and card-on-file capabilities. We're also pleased to have recently enhanced our relationship with Visa to support their branded cards in the payables space.\nAnd this is all, of course, before augmenting our B2B capabilities with EVO's leading accounts receivable automation software solutions, including its extensive proprietary integrations to some of the most widely used ERP environments in the market through its PayFabric platform, including SAP, Microsoft, Oracle, Acumatica and Sage.\nMoving to Merchant Solutions. We are pleased to announce in partnership with Google that we have partnered with Genuine Parts Company to deliver innovative cloud-based payment solutions for the extensive NAPA Auto Parts domestic distribution network. Leveraging the combined power of Global Payments and Google Cloud, NAPA will streamline commerce operations for its B2B transactions across the United States.\nWe continue to expand our acquiring relationship with Google in North America following the success of our initial launch in Asia Pacific late last year. Volumes are now building in the U.S. market with Google as a customer, and we expect the ramp to continue throughout this quarter. We also anticipate bringing our partnership with Google to Europe next year. Additionally, we remain on track to launch phase 2 of Google Run and Grow My Business to help our merchants grow faster by connecting additional Google services to our digital platform this quarter.\nWe yet again delivered solid growth in our e-comm and omnichannel business for the third quarter, well ahead of the markets as we have done all year. We continue to benefit from our unique ability to seamlessly blend the physical and virtual worlds in more markets than our peers. And of course, the pending acquisition of EVO and entry into new geographies like Poland and Germany will enhance our target addressable markets.\nWe are excited to have recently reached an agreement to expand our e-commerce partnership with Gucci, a division of French multinational corporate, Kering, for acceptance services beyond Europe and into Asia Pacific, where we will deliver a uniform solution and seamless experience virtually for one of the most sophisticated luxury retail brands. Our partnership with Citi via UCP recently went live in Spain, France and Italy, and we continue to expect to go live in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden prior to year-end.\nTogether, we are currently targeting Citi's largest treasury and trade solutions customers, and are excited to announce Citi recently signed one of the world's top social media platforms and one of the world's top e-commerce markets platforms.\nIn our vertical markets portfolio, we saw a significant return of growth in School Solutions as expected, and this business delivered substantial improvement in the quarter with the lapsing of pandemic-era subsidies on school lunches.\nAlso, our Xenial business continues to post solid wins in the sports and entertainment areas, with new signings with the Carolina Panthers and the Winnipeg Jets. And our pipeline in this channel remains robust.\nLastly, we continue to see strong double-digit growth in our real estate vertical market business, Zego, with our new flexible payments product driving significant demand for our digital solutions.\nLastly, I'm delighted to announce that we have launched our merchant referral relationship with Virgin Money in the United Kingdom this quarter and are already realizing strong lead flow and new signings from this partnership. We also remain on track to launch Virgin Money's new pay proposition early next year.\nWe did exactly what we said we would do in the third quarter of 2022. Our core businesses continued their track record of extraordinary growth and are well positioned heading into year-end. Our strategic investments are tracking the plan and our new partnerships are right in line with our expectations. We are very fortunate to be in the position that we are in heading into the final quarter of the year.\nJosh?\n\nJoshua J. Whipple\n\nCFO, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff. We are pleased with our strong financial performance in the third quarter, which was consistent with our expectations despite ongoing macro concerns. Specifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $2.06 billion. an increase of 6% from the prior year on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of our exit from Russia and the NetSpend consumer assets which are classified as held for sale, adjusted net revenue was $1.93 billion, an increase of 9% on a constant currency basis.\nAdjusted operating margin for the quarter improved 240 basis points to a record 45.2%. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.48, an increase of 18% from the prior year on a constant currency basis, which includes absorbing the impact of the exit of our Russia business during Q2. This performance highlights outstanding execution of our differentiated technology-enabled strategy.\nTaking a closer look at our performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.45 billion for the third quarter, a 10% improvement on a constant currency basis and approximately 11%, excluding the impact of Russia. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 50% in this segment, an increase of 80 basis points year-on-year on a foreign exchange-neutral basis.\nOur combined U.S. payments and payroll business delivered another strong quarter led by our integrated channel, which again reported mid-teens growth. And we continue to see strong momentum in our POS software solutions, which grew nearly 30% this quarter, on top of over 70% growth in Q3 of 2021 as well as our HCM and payroll business, which grew mid-teens in the quarter.\nOur worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel businesses also delivered growth in the teens on a constant currency basis this quarter as we continue to see strong demand for our omnichannel solutions across our business. And our vertical market solutions again achieved double-digit growth compared to the prior year, led by strength in our School Solutions business and Zego, while bookings trends remain solid across the portfolio.\nOutside the U.S., despite ongoing headwinds from adverse foreign currency exchange rates and continued COVID-related restrictions in parts of Asia Pacific, the overall macro backdrop remains relatively stable, and we continue to gain share.\nSpecifically, we continue to see strong revenue improvement in key faster-growth geographies, including Spain, Central Europe and Southeast Asia, as we're seeing significant demand for our differentiated capabilities outside the U.S. that are well aligned with shifting customer needs coming out of the pandemic.\nTurning to Issuer Solutions. This business delivered $489 million in adjusted net revenue, which is a 6% improvement on a constant currency basis from the third quarter of 2021, including Netspend's B2B assets in both periods. Excluding the impact of B2B, Issuer Solutions' core growth accelerated 20 basis points from the second quarter and was consistent with our long-term targets as we anticipated. Our transaction and account on file revenue grew high single digits and was consistent with the second quarter performance. As Jeff mentioned, our commercial card transactions increased 25%, with growth improving throughout the period.\nIssuer adjusted operating margin of 46.4% increased 310 basis points from the prior year, fueled by accelerating growth and also by our focus on driving efficiencies in the business. We are pleased that our issuer team signed 2 new partners and 1 contract extension during the quarter. Additionally, as Jeff mentioned, our pipeline remains at record levels as we continue to see good sales activity in all markets for new clients and cross-sell opportunities. This includes the growing list of opportunities we have in collaboration with AWS.\nOverall, the outstanding results we delivered across our merchant and issuer businesses this quarter serves as a proof point of the wisdom of our strategy and resiliency of our model while we also continue to maintain significant financial flexibility.\nFrom a cash flow standpoint, we delivered $640 million of adjusted free cash flow for the quarter after investing $139 million in capital expenditures. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be roughly $600 million for the full year. On the capital allocation front, we repurchased 6.9 million of our shares for approximately $890 million during the period. Our balance sheet remains extremely healthy, and we ended September with roughly $3.5 billion of liquidity and leverage of 3.1x on a net debt basis.\nWe made substantial progress on our strategic priorities this quarter, including the related financing initiatives. In August, we successfully completed a $2.5 billion senior unsecured notes offering with a blended yield of 5.5% and an average duration of 14.5 years. It's worth noting that the rates achieved in this offering are well below current market rates. We also completed the $1.5 billion strategic investment in the form of privately placed convertible senior notes with Silver Lake with a 1% coupon.\nAs is customary with convertible instruments, we executed a capped call transaction that significantly raised the effective conversion premium to approximately $230 per share. We are delighted to have Silver Lake as a new partner. Our capital structure consists of 100% fixed rates currently.\nWe used the proceeds from these offerings to pay down our existing term loan and the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility, and we simultaneously closed a new $5.75 billion revolving credit facility that provides us with ample financial flexibility.\nFollowing the completion of the EVO and NetSpend consumer transactions, which we continue to anticipate closing by the end of the first quarter, we expect our net leverage to be approximately 3.9x. We expect to return to current leverage levels by year-end calendar 2023 while maintaining our current investment-grade ratings.\nTurning to the outlook for the remainder of 2022. Given the underlying trends we are seeing, our expectations for the core business remain unchanged from our August call. We continue to expect full year constant currency adjusted net revenue growth of 10% to 11% over 2021, excluding the impact of dispositions. On a reported basis, we now expect foreign currency to be roughly a 300 basis point headwind to adjusted net revenue growth for 2022 or an incremental 100 basis points relative to the outlook we provided in August.\nIncluding these incremental FX headwinds, the reclassification of NetSpend's consumer assets to held for sale and the exit of our Russia business, we expect to report adjusted net revenue in a range of $7.8 billion to $7.9 billion for 2022. We are increasing our expectations for adjusted operating margin expansion to up to 170 basis points for the full year as compared to our prior outlook of up to 150 basis points.\nLastly, consistent with our prior outlook, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis to be in a range of $9.53 to $9.75, reflecting growth of 17% to 20% over 2021. We now expect FX headwinds to impact adjusted earnings per share by roughly $0.30 for the full year, an increase of an additional approximately $0.13 from our Q2 call in early August. As a result, we now expect to report adjusted earnings per share in a range of $9.32 to $9.55, albeit at the low end of the range given our exit from Russia and the sheer magnitude of the foreign currency impacts we are absorbing.\nIn summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance. Our merchant segment led by our technology-enabled strategy continues to excel, and underlying trends in the business remain strong. Together with the record pipeline, successes of our modernization efforts and enhanced B2B focus in our issuer segment, we are well positioned for the future.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey S. Sloan\n\nCEO & Director, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Josh. We delivered record performance again in the third quarter as we have throughout 2022. Underlying fundamentals across our businesses remain broadly healthy. While macroeconomic concerns abound, we do not see significant broad-based evidence of softness in the trends that we have experienced to date or in the bookings and implementation pipelines that we have the good fortune to enjoy currently. And with the dissipation of the pandemic, we are now back to typical financial and operating levels.\nDespite the background noise, we continue to make significant progress on our strategic and financial initiatives in the third quarter. The acquisition of EVO and the disposition of Netspend's consumer assets remain squarely on track with our expectations. Our debt capital raise in early August was well timed and executed, our balance sheet remains strong and our new partnership with Silver Lake is off to a terrific start. These transformative transactions will serve to accelerate our strategy and provide us with enhanced confidence in our increased growth and margin targets over the cycle.\nUpon the expected closing of these deals in early 2023, Merchant Solutions will represent approximately 75% of our adjusted net revenue, with Issuer Solutions, including B2B, comprising roughly 25%. We have multiple levers in each segment to continue to gain share over the cycle with a simpler model more geared toward our corporate customers with enhanced growth and margin prospects.\nHappy Halloween, everyone. Winnie?\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSVP of IR, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's conference will be recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Winnie Smith. Please go ahead.\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSVP of IR, Global Payments Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Global Payments' Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call can be found on the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpayments.com.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today's conference call contain forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and statements about the proposed transaction between Global Payments and EVO Payments. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the impact of COVID-19 and economic conditions on our future operations that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K and subsequent filings. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update them.\nWe will be also referring to several non-GAAP financial measures which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance. For a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call to the most comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC regulations, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and our supplemental materials available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nJoining me on the call are Jeff Sloan, CEO; Cameron Bready, President and COO; and Josh Whipple, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey S. Sloan\n\nCEO & Director, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Winnie. We welcome Josh Whipple, our new CFO, to the call today. Josh has been a senior leader in our company for 7.5 years, guiding us through some of the most significant milestones in our history. He's a trusted partner who has played a key role in building the leading technology-enabled, software-driven payments business worldwide that Global Payments is today.\nWe also thank Paul Todd for his terrific partnership and the critical role he has played in the successful merger of TSYS and Global Payments over the past 3 years, and his 27 years at TSYS. We wish Paul all the best in retirement.\nWe delivered second quarter adjusted results that were the best in our history across our key financial metrics despite the self-evident incremental headwinds. Both our merchant and issuer segments exceeded our expectations on a currency-neutral basis post the divestiture of our Russian business. Importantly, our issuer business generated 400 basis points of sequential revenue improvement on a comparable basis, exactly as we said it would, and our pipeline remains at record levels. And we achieved these results while executing multiple transactions to better align our businesses with our strategy, adding a key new partnership, extending our lead and deepening our competitive moat.\nFirst, we're delighted to announce that we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire EVO Payments, significantly increasing our target addressable markets, enhancing our leadership in integrated payments worldwide; expanding our presence in new geographies; further scaling in existing faster-growth markets; and augmenting our business-to-business, B2B, software and payment solutions. Specifically, EVO provides us with a new presence in attractive geographies such as Poland, Germany, Chile and Greece; and enhances our scale in existing markets, including Mexico, Spain and the U.K., and of course, the U.S. and Canada.\nFor B2B, EVO brings us key technology partners and integrations, including with many of the largest enterprise ERP solutions. And it adds leading accounts receivable software capabilities to complement our B2B and accounts payable offerings, which we significantly augmented with our successful acquisition of MineralTree last fall.\nAt our investor conference last September, we announced B2B as the fourth and newest pillar of our strategy, meaningfully expanding our target addressable markets to include a segment that remains substantially underpenetrated, providing tremendous opportunities for future growth. As we said then, we have the technology and distribution assets we need to compete effectively in B2B post our TSYS merger and already positioned as one of the largest B2B companies globally at scale. This includes technology centered on virtual card solutions, a vast commercial card footprint, massive distribution partnerships with the world's leading financial institutions, data and analytics, market-leading payroll technologies and access globally to noncard-based rails.\nOur acquisition of MineralTree, last October provided us with a leading cloud SaaS accounts payable business which grew 30% in the second quarter and is now operating at EBITDA breakeven ahead of plan. We've been on the lookout for an accounts receivable business corollary to complete our B2B go-to-market offerings. We believe that EVO now provides that missing link.\nCameron will provide more details on the tremendous value creation opportunity in combining EVO with Global Payments, but let me start by expressing how delighted I am to welcome EVO team members to Global Payments. The transaction is expected to close no later than the first quarter of 2023, subject to regulatory and of course EVO shareholder approvals.\nSecond, we are thrilled to announce Silver Lake, the global leader in technology investing, has committed a $1.5 billion strategic investment in Global Payments in the form of convertible unsecured senior notes. As an expression of their confidence in our long-term leadership role in digital payments and sustainability of our growth, this amount is by far the largest commitment in Silver Lake's long, distinguished history.\nSilver Lake has an outstanding track record of successful investments in technology-driven companies, and we are humbled by their confidence in us as the winner in the digital payments ecosystem over the cycle. This new partnership serves as further proof of the distinctiveness of our model, wisdom of our strategy and position as a leading driver and beneficiary of innovation and payments. A senior partner from Silver Lake will join the Global Payments Board of Directors. We are very proud of the company that we keep.\nThird, we reached a definitive agreement to sell Netspend's consumer portfolio to Searchlight Capital and Rev Worldwide from $1 billion to further align our businesses with our strategy while simultaneously enhancing our organic growth and margin characteristics. As we said at the time we announced the strategic review in February, Netspend's direct-to-consumer portfolio is an attractive set of solutions with a favorable profile, but there is limited overlap between its customer base and our traditional corporate clients.\nAs expected, we will retain Netspend's B2B assets which delivered strong mid-teens normalized growth in the second quarter and will be included in our Issuer Solutions segment beginning with our third quarter. We're very proud of all that our valued team members in Netspend have accomplished as part of Global Payments, and we have every confidence this business is well positioned for the future under new ownership. We expect this transaction to close by the end of the first quarter of 2023, subject to regulatory approvals.\nThe completion of these important transactions provides us with heightened confidence in the raised cycle guidance for revenue, margin and earnings that we provided at our investor conference last September. Post the acquisition of EVO and Netspend sale, Merchant Solutions will then represent approximately 75% of our adjusted net revenue; with Issuer Solutions, including Netspend's B2B assets, comprising roughly 25%. The future is indeed bright.\nCameron?\n\nCameron M. Bready\n\nPresident & COO, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Our acquisition of EVO aligns perfectly with our overarching strategy, reinforcing our position as the preeminent payments technology company with extensive scale and unmatched global reach. EVO furthers our technology-enabled distribution strategy in integrated payments while significantly enhancing our B2B software and payment solutions. The transaction also expands our exposure to additional faster-growth geographies overseas and provides greater scale in North America and markets in Europe in which we already operate. As a combined company, we are uniquely positioned to deliver an unmatched suite of distinctive software and payment solutions to our combined customer base of more than 4.5 million merchant locations and over 1,500 financial institutions globally.\nToday, EVO has over 1,500 technology partners and integrations globally that complement our over 6,000 ISV partners across 70-plus vertical markets. We see significant opportunity to bring further value to EVO's relationships by leveraging our extensive distribution platforms and product portfolio as well as our unique partner integration capabilities.\nEVO also provides additional avenues for us to distribute our commerce enablement solutions and vertical market software offerings, including our leading point-of-sale software targeted at the restaurant and retail vertical markets. For example, we are already bringing our Vital POS solutions to key international markets where we overlap with EVO, including the U.K., Spain and Central Europe, later this year.\nAdditionally, we will be able to capitalize on the distinctive capabilities of our unified commerce platform to provide EVO's enterprise customers with multinational e-commerce and omnichannel solutions, seamlessly blending their physical and virtual requirements across markets and geographies. With our physical presence in over 40 countries globally and ability to transact in over 170 virtually, we are uniquely positioned to significantly expand EVO's value proposition to its existing multinational customers. EVO's accounts receivable automation software and B2B payment solutions augment our existing accounts payable automation and other B2B capabilities, further rounding out our full suite of B2B offerings.\nImportantly, EVO brings us extensive proprietary integrations to some of the most widely used ERP environments in the market through its PayFabric platform, including SAP, Microsoft, Oracle, Acumatica and Sage. These integrations are critical to delivering the frictionless automation necessary to improve process efficiency and costs for buyers and suppliers.\nTogether with EVO, we have an unparalleled array of products and solutions that address the business spend management needs of buyers, suppliers and employers, better positioning us to gain share in the B2B market with a vast TAM in excess of $125 trillion annually.\nFinally, EVO expands our presence in new and attractive geographies with strong secular growth trends, including Poland, Greece and Chile; and increases our scale in a number of our existing markets, including the U.S., Mexico, the U.K., Ireland, Spain and the Czech Republic, many of which also have strong underlying growth fundamentals.\nIn total, EVO has a presence in 12 countries globally and leverages distribution relationships with 15 financial institutions, creating additional opportunities for us to cross-sell our leading cloud-based Issuer Solutions which can be delivered around the world through our collaboration with AWS.\nSince our merger with TSYS, we have demonstrated that there are significant opportunities to deliver differentiated solutions and drive transaction optimization by marrying issuing and acquiring capabilities, particularly in Europe, EVO's largest region. The partnerships we have achieved with Caixa Bank and Virgin Money are marquee examples.\nPutting it all together, the acquisition of EVO is highly complementary to our strategy and significantly increases scale in our business globally. As I've discussed already, we see meaningful opportunities to enhance revenue through this partnership, further catalyzing the growth prospects in our Merchant Solutions business worldwide.\nFurther, we also expect substantial cost synergies primarily from aligning our business operations and go-to-market strategies, streamlining technology infrastructure, eliminating duplicative corporate and operational support structures and realizing scale efficiencies. Combined, we expect to generate run rate EBITDA synergies of at least $125 million within 2 years post closing of the transaction.\nAs Jeff noted, the acquisition of EVO presents a significant value creation opportunity while further advancing our strategy to deliver differentiated technology and payment solutions to customers across the most attractive markets worldwide. We look forward to welcoming EVO and its team members to Global Payments.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Josh.\n\nJoshua J. Whipple\n\nCFO, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Cameron. We are pleased with our strong financial performance in the second quarter, which exceeded our expectations despite ongoing macro concerns, the exit of our Russian business and incremental headwinds from adverse foreign currency exchange rates. Specifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $2.06 billion, an increase of 6% from the prior year and 8% growth on a constant currency basis.\nExcluding the Netspend consumer assets, which will now be held as available for sale, adjusted net revenue grew 11% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating income increased 14% on a constant currency basis and 17% excluding Netspend consumer assets.\nAdjusted operating margin for the quarter was 43.8%, a 200 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2021 or approximately 250 basis points excluding the impact of acquisitions. Excluding the Netspend consumer assets, adjusted operating margin was 45.3%. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.36, an increase of 16% from the prior year or 19% on a constant currency basis.\nTaking a closer look at our performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.43 billion for the second quarter, an 11% improvement from the prior year or 14% on a constant currency basis, ahead of our expectations despite our exit from our Russian business in the quarter. Notably, we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 50.2% in this segment, an increase of 170 basis points year-on-year.\nOur combined U.S. payments and payroll and integrated business delivered another strong quarter, led by our integrated channel, which again reported mid-teens growth. We also continue to see strong momentum in our POS software solutions, which grew roughly 40% this quarter; and our HCM and payroll business, which grew 20%.\nOur worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel business delivered constant currency growth in the mid-teens this quarter, well ahead of the trends reported by the networks, as our unified commerce platform continues to resonate with customers. To that end, we are excited that we have now expanded our acquiring relationship with Google across UCP to North America following the success of our launch in Asia Pacific late last year. This quarter, we also signed new omnichannel partnerships with multinational retailer, ALDO; and global hospitality company, Delaware North.\nAs for our vertical market solution, we were pleased that the overall portfolio delivered 20% revenue growth compared to the prior year and bookings trends remained strong across the portfolio. We continue to see strong performance in AdvancedMD and TouchNet, the latter of which produced record new sales for the first half of 2022. Further, Xenial continued to realize strong bookings momentum, including increased demand for our kiosk and mobile offerings from food service management customers and new wins with the Winnipeg Jets Canadian Life Center and Ole Miss University in the events and stadium vertical.\nWe also saw local currency growth accelerate across our international businesses this quarter with particularly strong results in the U.K., Spain and Central Europe. I'm excited to announce that we recently signed our merchant referral relationship with Virgin Money, achieving a significant milestone in our strategic alliance combining issuing and acquiring capabilities.\nOur Issuer Solutions business delivered $459 million in adjusted net revenue, a 6% improvement on a constant currency basis from the second quarter of 2021, consistent with our expectations and long-term growth target for this segment. Issuer adjusted operating margin of 43.5% increased 60 basis points, excluding the impact of MineralTree. On a reported basis, it was down 40 basis points from the prior year.\nOur transaction and account on file revenue growth grew low double digits, accelerating from the mid-single-digit growth achieved in the first quarter. Notably, commercial card volumes increased nearly 35% with growth improving throughout the period. We also converted the gap portfolio of approximately 13 million accounts, which was purchased by our long-standing partner, Barclays, late last year.\nDuring the quarter, we signed long-term contract extensions with multiple clients, including Carrefour in Brazil following its acquisition of the Grupo BIG portfolio in the region. And more recently, we signed a long-term agreement with another market-leading retailer in South America, [Syncosit], to enter the Chilean market. This will provide further opportunities for our business with today's announcement of our acquisition of EVO.\nFrom a cash flow standpoint, we delivered $432 million of adjusted free cash flow for the quarter, and we continue to target converting roughly 100% of adjusted earnings to adjusted free cash flow for the full year. We invested $168 million in capital expenditures during the quarter and expect roughly $600 million in capital expenditures for 2022, consistent with our prior outlook. On the capital allocation front, we repurchased just over 4.5 million of our shares this quarter for approximately $600 million. Our balance sheet remains extremely healthy, and we ended the period with roughly $2.5 billion of liquidity and leverage of 2.9x on a net debt basis.\nAs Jeff and Cameron discussed in detail, we have entered a definitive agreement to acquire EVO Payments for $34 per share in cash, representing an enterprise value of approximately $4 billion. Silver Lake will invest $1.5 billion in Global Payments in the form of privately placed convertible senior notes, which will serve as a source of funding together with our committed bridge facility from our banks. The convertible note will have a cash coupon of 1%, a 7-year term and a conversion price of $140.66. In addition, as is customary with convertible instruments, we expect to execute a call spread overlay to significantly raise the effective conversion premium. We are very excited to have Silver Lake as a new partner, and their investment underscores their long-term commitment and their strong belief in the opportunity ahead for Global Payments.\nAdditionally, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Netspend's consumer assets to Searchlight Capital and Rev Worldwide for $1 billion. We also expect the Netspend transaction to close by the end of the first quarter of 2023.\nFollowing both of these transactions, we expect our net leverage to be approximately 3.9x at close. We expect our leverage by the end of calendar year 2023 to be back to current levels, highlighting the substantial free cash flow generation we discussed at our investor conference last September. We expect to maintain our current investment-grade ratings.\nTurning to the outlook of 2022. We remain encouraged by the underlying trends we are seeing in the business, and our outlook for the year remains unchanged, excluding impacts from FX and M&A.\nOn a constant currency basis, we expect full year adjusted net revenue before dispositions to be in a range of $8.48 billion to $8.55 billion, reflecting growth of 10% to 11% over 2021. This is consistent with our prior outlook from our May call. Adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis are expected to be in a range of $9.53 to $9.75, reflecting growth of 17% to 20% over 2021. This is also consistent with our prior outlook. Also, we are raising our expectations for adjusted operating margin expansion to up to 150 basis points, an increase from the prior outlook of up to 125 basis points.\nOn a reported basis, we now expect foreign currency to be in excess of an incremental 100 basis point headwind for the remainder of 2022, bringing the total impact to 200 to 250 basis points for the year.\nAdditionally, we are now reclassifying Netspend's consumer assets as held for sale in light of our decision to sell the business, and therefore removing it from our outlook for the remainder of the year. Also, effective July 1, we have moved Netspend's core B2B assets to our issuer segment as we look to continue to bolster our leading B2B businesses.\nIn combination with incremental adverse FX headwinds, the reclassification of Netspend's consumer assets to held for sale and the exit of our Russian business, we now expect to report adjusted net revenue in a range of $7.9 billion to $8 billion for calendar 2022. We continue to expect to report adjusted EPS in the range of $9.45 to $9.67 for 2022, which includes an anticipated roughly $0.11 impact from incremental adverse foreign currency exchange rates since May.\nWe are maintaining the same guidance range relative to our original 2022 outlook as we are absorbing additional currency headwinds and the exit from Russia, albeit, we expect to be toward the lower end for those reasons. This adjusted EPS outlook assumes ongoing pandemic recovery and a stable macroeconomy throughout the remainder of the year.\nAs our slide presentation today indicates, we expect the acquisition of EVO and the sale of Netspend's consumer assets to help deliver on the goals that we set forth at our September 2021 Investor Conference. We raised our cycle guidance then to double-digit top line growth and high teens to 20% adjusted earnings per share growth.\nUpon the closing of these 2 transactions, our merchant business will represent 75% of our company; and Issuer Solutions, inclusive of the Netspend B2B assets, will represent 25%. This intentional mix shift will provide us with enhanced confidence in achieving our raised financial targets over the cycle.\nAt full run rate synergies from the EVO acquisition, we expect the combined result of the purchase of EVO and the disposition of Netspend's consumer assets to be roughly neutral to adjusted earnings per share. In effect, we have swapped Netspend's consumer assets for EVO, which is consistent with our strategy and core customer focus. And we've done so while concurrently bolstering the growth prospects of our issuer business by retaining Netspend's attractive B2B businesses.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey S. Sloan\n\nCEO & Director, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Josh. We effectively previewed the new Global Payments at our investor conference this past September. In those 3-plus hours and 70-plus pages, the 4 key pillars of our go-forward strategy were set forth in detail: Software, owned and partnered; omnichannel dominance; exposure to faster growth markets; and B2B at scale. I think it's clear now with today's announcements why we were keen then to raise our cycle guidance.\nWe will have 2 primary businesses going forward, each of which is growing at attractive rates with enhanced margin characteristics. Organic and of course inorganic opportunities in each abound with further runway for ample growth. Upon the closings of these transactions, we expect to derive 3/4 of our adjusted net revenue from merchant and 1/4 from issuer and B2B. We have multiple levers in each segment to continue to gain share over the cycle, a simpler model, more geared toward our corporate customers with enhanced growth, and margin prospects.\nIn what better way to evidence that confidence in our strategy and the durability of our growth prospects than to have the honor Silver Lake as part of these plans? As we highlighted repeatedly last September, Global Payments is well positioned to maintain and enhance its disruptive path as a partner of choice across our markets. SLP, the most respected global technology investor agrees.\nWinnie?\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSVP of IR, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions."

We are pleased to have delivered yet another quarter of strong results that exceeded our expectations heading into 2022 despite incremental macro headwinds throughout the period. Specifically, we achieved record first quarter revenue, margin and earnings per share with solid free cash flow, and our performance again highlights our business resilience and track record of execution. We are especially delighted with our Merchant Solutions performance, which exhibited ongoing momentum as our strategies for differentiated growth are winning in the marketplace.\nWe continue to see favorable new sales trends across our businesses, providing further evidence that we are gaining share, and our results today reflect those gains. The strong bookings we've been reporting in Global Payments Integrated and U.S. payments and payroll drove attractive %growth for both businesses during the quarter. And early this year, we combined these 2 businesses to unlock additional market opportunities and accelerate growth by creating a more streamlined go-to-market strategy and capitalizing on the best of these 2 high-performing cultures.\nWe are in the early stages of leveraging our Heartland sales professionals to increase our penetration with GPI partner customers as well as harmonizing the cross-selling of our commerce enablement solutions across these channels.\nWe're also excited we have recently launched the co-selling facet of our Google partnership, and we expect our joint go-to-market efforts will drive significant referral and new customer acquisition opportunities for businesses of all sizes. We also expanded our acquiring relationship with Google, which utilizes our unified commerce platform, or UCP, to North America, following the success of our initial launch in Asia Pacific late last year. Further, we remain on track to launch the next phase of Google Run and Grow My Business to help our merchants grow faster by connecting additional Google services to our digital platform later this year.\nSpeaking of our leading omnichannel platform, Global Payments is excited to announce a new partnership with Brooks Sports to modernize its payment acceptance capabilities in the U.K. and across Europe. In addition, we are pleased to be expanding our partnerships in Asia Pacific, including with Hilton, to incorporate new payment features and functionality as well as with the Swatch group across multiple brands and regions. We're also increasing the scope of our agreement with ChargePoint, the world's largest network of EV charging stations in North America and Europe, beyond our existing card present relationship to now include e-commerce.\nOur partnership with Citi via UCP that spans North America, the U.K. and Continental Europe continues to gain traction. And we are currently targeting approximately 300 of Citi's largest Treasury and Trade Solutions customers. We also continue to add new geographies through our partnership, including recently launching in Italy, Spain, Ireland, The Netherlands and Germany. And we expect to be live together in a dozen European countries by year-end and will launch 7 additional countries in Europe by early 2023.\nAcross our merchant businesses, we are unique in our ability to combine software, hardware and payments across in-person, mobile and online channels. As one example, our POS software solutions generated revenue growth of nearly 50% in the first quarter as we continue to see great traction with our verticalized solutions, particularly in restaurant and retail as well as across the Vital platform, which we plan to bring to key International markets, including the U.K., Spain and Central Europe, later this year.\nOur vertical markets portfolio delivered strong double-digit growth with a 36% increase in bookings, and we expect these businesses will remain a tailwind for our merchant growth going forward. In our stadium and events vertical, we have now gone live with our Xenial cloud point-of-sale solutions in Mercedes-Benz Stadium as part of our partnership to enable its multichannel commerce ecosystem. In enterprise QSR, we successfully completed the rollout of our POS solution with Dutch Bros and will soon be expanding our relationship to include additional software offerings to support the brand's robust growth. We also remain on track to complete the rollout of our Xenial cloud POS solution to all Denny's and Long John Silver's restaurants prior to the end of calendar year 2022.\nFurther, it's worth highlighting that we signed a new agreement with Focus Brands to deploy Xenial's digital menu board solution across its Auntie Ann's, Carvel, Cinnabon, Jamba Juice, McAlister's Deli, Moe's Southwest Grill and Schlotzsky's Deli franchises.\nOur AMD business delivered another quarter of strong bookings growth of nearly 35% and eclipsed a significant milestone with the number of active physicians and providers utilizing the platform surpassing 50,000 for the first time. And TouchNet delivered the best new sales quarter in its history, which includes the signing of the University of British Columbia, its largest single international deal ever. Early success in our newest vertical market, real estate, also continued in the first quarter, with Zego delivering record new bookings for the period.\nAs we discussed at our September investor conference, we continue to benefit from ongoing innovation in our ecosystem, including Buy Now Pay Later, or BNPL, technologies. We launched our BNPL as a service marketplace in the first quarter to augment our 140-plus alternative payment methods portfolio exactly as we said we would.\nOur marketplace allows merchants to provide solutions across multiple BNPL providers in their target markets through a single integration point, expanding our alternative payments offerings on a regulated, compliant and responsible basis while supporting merchant enablement and consumer choice. In combination with our BNPL initiatives through our market-leading issuing business that target financial institutions and retailers, we expect to drive significant growth beyond the 2 billion transactions that we already enable through BNPL annually.\nLate last year, we announced that we have reached an agreement to extend and expand the scope of our longstanding relationship with PayPal, which leverages our unparalleled e-commerce technology footprint across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific for a multiyear period. And I'm happy to report that we expect to be live with PayPal this quarter in new geographies and additional verticals and will support the cryptocurrencies for the first time, expanding our target addressable markets.\nAdditionally, we are pleased to announce a strategic alliance with Bakkt, a trusted digital asset platform that enables consumers to buy, sell and hold a range of digital assets. We will be supporting a range of use cases, starting with enabling cryptocurrency redemption in customer loyalty programs offered by our bank card clients; expanding our Banking as a Service offerings to include cryptocurrency; and ultimately leveraging issuing technologies for linking virtual, debit, credit and prepaid solutions. We're also excited to announce a broad collaboration with Bakkt in multinational payment acceptance.\nMoving to Issuer Solutions. We are thrilled to announce that CaixaBank has recently signed a letter of intent to memorialize the selection of Global Payments as its technology partner for its card issuing businesses. This is the largest potential new customer signing for our issuer business since 2013 and would double our implementation pipeline to its highest level in our history, providing opportunities for accelerated growth over the next several years.\nIn conjunction with our announced partnership with Virgin Money and other recent wins, our relationship with CaixaBank complements our debit strategy and positions Global Payments as a leading debit technology provider across Europe. Virgin Money is a significant competitive takeaway, and we successfully completed the migration of the Virgin Money credit portfolio to our platform in February, and it is our first use case, combining issuing and acquiring capabilities to offer transaction stream optimization solutions, which we expect to go live in the next 12 months.\nWe're also proud to have successfully achieved significant multiyear renewal agreements with U.K.-based Metro Bank as well as with Ireland-based permanent tsb, which are 2 other long-standing TSYS issuer customers where our partnership spans both debit and credit portfolios.\nFurther, we continue to benefit from our strategy of aligning with market share winners. We expect to add another significant portfolio to our record conversion pipeline upon the closing of a sizable acquisition by one of our largest North American-based clients that is expanding in the United States.\nSimply put, we are winning in our Issuer Solutions business because we are selling more market-leading technologies to scale leaders, through more distinctive and defensible distribution channels, in more markets, than we ever have previously.\nOur unique collaboration with AWS is tracking as planned with 10 modernized services now built and available in the cloud. We've already successfully executed over 100 client migrations to our modernized issuer platform and recently announced a partnership with Mastercard to include authorizations, clearing and settlement in the cloud. And we anticipate CaixaBank to be among the first large financial institutions to go directly to the cloud with us by the end of 2023.\nTogether with AWS, our preferred cloud provider for our issuer business, we now have 39 active prospects in the pipeline, 11 of which are neobanks, fintechs and startups. We also currently have 8 letters of intent with institutions worldwide, 4 of which are competitive takeaways. We are currently participating in several active 100% cloud RFPs with large institutions and retailers globally. Our fully functional modern issuing payment stack operating globally at scale differentiates us in the market. Simply put, the public cloud sells.\nAs we look to further capitalize on our ability to combine accounts payable SaaS technologies with our best-in-class capabilities into market-leading B2B solutions, we're now managing MineralTree as a part of our Issuer Solutions business. As we discussed at our Investor Conference last September, we believe that we already possess one of the largest B2B businesses at scale globally and that our commercial card and virtual card efforts within our issuer segment are the linchpins of our overall B2B strategies. When viewed in that light, MineralTree's capabilities are a perfect fit for that business.\nWe're delighted that MineralTree's momentum continued this quarter, including 60% growth in virtual card spend for the period and achieving the highest virtual card spend month in its history in March. Bookings grew in excess of 20% this quarter, and MineralTree successfully extended key financial institution relationships with Bank of the West and Fifth Third Bank and went live with Finance of America Companies, a large enterprise customer signed late last year.\nIt's worth highlighting that our MineralTree products have now been entered into the AWS co-selling program, which will allow us to accelerate growth with our accounts payable solutions into both the middle market as well as larger enterprises.\nOur focus on growing our B2B solutions business continues to be successful. We have expanded our agreement with Cracker Barrel to include an EWA partnership across its more than 660 stores in the United States. This adds to our existing Paycard solution relationship and increases our opportunity set with their eligible employees by more than 200%. Also, we recently renewed Paycard partnerships with Big Lots, Love's Travel Stops & Country Stores and Cumberland Farms, collectively spanning over 2,500 locations in more than 47 states.\nWe could not be more pleased with the investments we've made in our strategy that have enabled our resilience during the pandemic and driven the outsized growth we've achieved over the last 8 years since we began running the company. At the same time, we seek to continue to refine our portfolio by simplifying the composition of our businesses and focusing on our core corporate customers, including merchants, software partners, technology leaders, corporates and financial institutions.\nAs part of that initiative, last quarter, we announced a strategic review of our Netspend consumer business to sharpen our focus on our B2B assets. I am pleased to report that we have made progress and that there is significant interest in Netspend's set of direct-to-consumer solutions. We look forward to providing additional details on our plans for these assets in the future as events unfold.\nBefore I turn the call over to Paul, I express my deepest concerns regarding the devastating situation in Ukraine. We recently closed on the sale of our United card service business in Russia, and we take some solace that we've done what we can to responsibly support our team members and that we have been providing financial and humanitarian support to those impacted. We do not have any operating businesses in Ukraine. This has been a difficult time for all of our team members, customers and partners across the region. Ultimately, our values and culture provided the road map for our decision-making.\nPaul?\n\nPaul Michael Todd\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, Total System Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff. We are pleased with our strong financial performance in the first quarter, which exceeded our expectations despite the pandemic, the anniversary-ing of multi-years of stimulus benefits, incremental headwinds from the war in Europe and more recent adverse foreign currency exchange rates.\nSpecifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $1.95 billion, an increase of 8% from the prior year and 9% growth on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 41.1%, a 50 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2021 or approximately 100 basis points excluding the impact of acquisitions. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.07, an increase of 14% from the prior year or 15% on a constant currency basis. This performance was ahead of the low double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth we indicated we were expecting for the first quarter on our February call.\nTaking a closer look at our performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.34 billion for the first quarter, a 16.3% improvement from the prior year or over 17.3% on a constant currency basis. Notably, we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 47.3% in this segment, an increase of 100 basis points year-on-year and roughly 150 basis points excluding the impact of M&A. These results were driven by consistent execution of our technology-enabled strategy.\nTo that end, our integrated business produced another strong quarter, generating organic growth in the mid-teens compared to 2021, compounding at the longer-term growth rate we target for the business. Notably, in addition to the strength of our POS software solutions business that Jeff highlighted, our HCM and payroll business grew nearly 30%.\nAs for our vertical market solutions, we were pleased that the overall portfolio delivered growth in the high 20% range compared to the prior year. As Jeff also highlighted, we are benefiting from the positive bookings trends we are seeing across our vertical markets portfolio, and we continue to expect our own software businesses will be a tailwind for us this year as the recovery progresses.\nMoving to Issuer Solutions. We delivered $443 million in adjusted net revenue, a 1.4% improvement on a constant currency basis from the first quarter of 2021 and consistent with our expectations for this segment. Similar to last quarter, we had mid-single-digit revenue growth in our transaction and account on file revenue.\nWe had 2 offsetting headwinds in this segment, as anticipated. Consistent with last quarter, we had continuing headwinds related to our managed services repositioning and some nonrecurring revenue. This impact was partially offset by the inclusion of MineralTree within our Issuer Solutions segment beginning this quarter. Normalizing for these items, our adjusted net revenue growth was in the mid-single digits, consistent with our long-term target.\nAlso ex nonrecurring items, commercial cards saw sequential monthly growth throughout the first quarter, which we expect to continue. Issuer adjusted operating margin of 42.6% increased 50 basis points, excluding the impact of MineralTree. On a reported basis, it was down 60 basis points from the prior year.\nFinally, in our Business and Consumer Solutions segment, adjusted net revenue declined in the high teens, consistent with our expectations as the segment lapped 2 years of benefits from stimulus and higher levels of unemployment assistance. Our focused efforts on our B2B products in this segment delivered double-digit revenue growth for the period.\nAdjusted operating margin for Business and Consumer Solutions expanded 270 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter excluding the impact of MineralTree. Reported adjusted operating margin of 26.1% declined year-on-year, again, due to the lapping of 2 consecutive years of federal stimulus spending and higher levels of unemployment benefits.\nFrom a cash flow standpoint, we delivered $471 million of adjusted free cash flow for the quarter, and we continue to target converting roughly 100% of adjusted earnings to adjusted free cash flow for the full year. We invested $156 million in capital expenditures during the quarter and continue to expect roughly $600 million in capital expenditures for 2022.\nOn the share repurchase front, we repurchased just over 4.5 million of our shares this quarter for approximately $650 million. At quarter end, we had roughly $1.7 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization, and this remains a key capital allocation priority.\nOur balance sheet remains extremely healthy, and we ended the period with roughly $2.5 billion of liquidity after repurchase activity. Our leverage position was 2.9x on a net debt basis at quarter end.\nTurning to the outlook for 2022. We remain encouraged by the underlying trends we are seeing in the business, and we could not be more pleased with our financial and operating performance despite the environment. It is worth noting a couple of incremental impacts we now expect that were not reflected in the initial guidance we provided in February. First, we have exited our operating business in Russia, which we estimate will reduce our revenue in excess of $20 million for the rest of the year relative to our prior forecast. Second, we are also anticipating that adverse foreign currency exchange rates will be a more significant headwind to our performance for the full year than we had anticipated previously.\nDespite these incremental adverse impacts, we continue to expect adjusted net revenue to range from $8.42 billion to $8.5 billion, reflecting growth of 9% to 10% over 2021, or 10% to 11% on a constant currency basis, albeit at the lower end of this range given the aforementioned items. This outlook remains consistent with our long-term cycle target for double-digit top line growth. It also reflects the benefit we expect from a continued pandemic recovery and a stable macro economy throughout the year.\nTo provide some color on revenue growth at the segment level, we continue to expect adjusted net revenue growth for our Merchant Solutions segment to be in the low double-digits range. With the inclusion of MineralTree in Issuer Solutions, we now anticipate our adjusted net revenue growth to be at the high end of the mid-single-digit range. We will of course provide updates on the strategic review process for our Netspend Consumer business as the process progresses.\nOn the margin front, we are raising our expectations for the year from the previous anticipated expansion of up to 100 basis points to up to 125 basis points, or up to 175 basis points excluding impacts from our recent acquisitions. This is above our cycle guidance for margin expansion of 50 to 75 basis points annually.\nMoving to a couple of nonoperating items. We expect net interest expense to be roughly $385 million and for our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20% for the full year.\nPutting it all together, we are maintaining our expectation for adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $9.45 to $9.67, reflecting growth of 16% to 19% over 2021. On a constant currency basis, this reflects annual growth of roughly 17% to 20%. So in effect, we have absorbed the expected incremental revenue impact from Russia and recent adverse foreign currency exchange rates through actions we have taken to enhance margin and preserve earnings. Lastly, I would highlight that from a quarterly phasing perspective, we continue to expect a progressive growth picture as we move through 2022, building on our outperformance in the first quarter.\nIn summary, we are pleased with the performance in the first quarter despite a challenging macro environment. Our merchant segment continues to excel. And the strong underlying performance, record pipeline, early successes of our modernization efforts and enhanced B2B focus in our issuer segment position us well for the future.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey S. Sloan\n\nCEO & Director, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Paul. I am pleased with our performance during the quarter which has us on track to deliver record results for 2022. We raised our cycle guidance in September 2021, and our expectations for the rest of the year remain despite the unprecedented incremental headwinds we've absorbed in the last couple of months.\nWe enter 2022 with substantial momentum, and our first quarter results and guidance provide further support for sustained share gains. Our targets for this year highlight the wisdom of our strategies while deepening our competitive moat regardless of the environment. Looking ahead, we are focused on maintaining our momentum by continuing to capitalize on the trends of digitization, commerce enablement, software differentiation and omnichannel prevalence, which we discussed in depth at our Investor Conference in September.\nWinnie?\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSVP of IR, Global Payments Inc.\n\n(Operator Instructions) Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.\nLater, we will open the lines for questions and answers. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, today's conference will be recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Winnie Smith, please go ahead.\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSVP of IR, Global Payments Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Global Payments Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Conference Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call can be found on the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpayments.com.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today's conference call contain forward-looking statements about expected operating and financial results. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including the impact of COVID-19 and economic conditions on our future operations that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K and subsequent filings. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.\nForward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update them. We will also be referring to several non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance. For a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call to the most comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC regulations, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and our supplemental materials.\nJoining me on the call are Jeff Sloan, CEO; Cameron Bready, President and COO; and Paul Todd, Senior Executive Vice President, and CFO. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey S. Sloan\n\nCEO & Director, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Winnie. We delivered record fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results that exceeded our expectations, highlighting the resilience of our business model. We achieved record transactions across the business in the fourth quarter, including a new peak during the holidays despite the incremental impact of COVID-19 variants. And we expect another record year in 2022 based on today's guidance with strong revenue growth, margin enhancement, earnings to free cash flow conversion, and leverage capacity.\nWe accomplished a great deal over the course of 2021 as we continue to advance our differentiated strategies for growth. This includes our partnership with Google to deliver innovative and seamless digital services to all manner of merchants worldwide; the expansion of our collaboration with AWS, our preferred issuer technology solutions partner for a unique distribution and cutting-edge technologies; our successful acquisitions of Zego and MineralTree to advance our software leadership position with unmatched worldwide payments expertise; a strategic alliance with Virgin Money and our first use case post-merger combining issuing and acquiring capabilities; and our partnership with Mercedes-Benz Stadium to enable its multichannel commerce ecosystem.\nAnd we're carrying that momentum into 2022 as we successfully executed our goal to redefine the future of digital commerce, extending our lead, continuing to gain share, and deepening our competitive moat. Specifically, we are delighted to announce that we've been chosen by CaixaBank as the finalist company in their selection process for a technology partner for its European card issuing business comprising nearly 30 million cards. We expect to finalize contract negotiations over the coming weeks.\nCaixa is the largest domestic bank in Spain, serving tens of millions of households and a full range of business clients across multiple countries in Europe. This latest achievement is yet another example of the enhanced revenue opportunities derived from our merger with TSYS just over 2 years ago.\nWhen this goes live, as anticipated in the back half of next year, we expect this initiative to be among the first legacy direct-to-cloud transformations in card issuing technologies among major financial institutions, and it will be the first entry of TSYS into the highly attractive Iberian marketplace. Together with our recently announced partnership with Virgin Money, we believe Global Payments will then become a leading debit technology provider across Europe.\nWe're also excited to announce that we're embarking on a multi-year partnership with Mastercard to modernize and accelerate card payments in the cloud across authorization, clearing, and settlement. We're on this journey to drive ecosystem change and to help our clients bring differentiated value to the market. This is yet another example of how we're progressing the payment landscape with leading technology partners and bringing the next generation of modernized AWS cloud-enabled payments to customers.\nOur durable relationships with some of the most complex and sophisticated institutions globally speak to our competitiveness well into the remainder of this decade. It's worth highlighting that our issuer business signed multiyear contract extensions with several of our largest customers over the last 12 months, including Citi, CIBC, Barclays, and Banco Carrefour. And our strategy of aligning with market share winners was also successful in 2021. Recent examples include Barclays' purchase of the Gap card portfolio as well as Capital One's purchase at BJ's Wholesale Club card base.\nWe have 34 active prospects in the pipeline with AWS, 11 of which are fintechs, neobanks, and startups. And we're pleased to announce that we are live with our first joint takeaway together with AWS, a leading global financial institution in a single large market in Asia, and we expect to expand this prime instance to several additional markets over time.\nWe also reached an agreement for our first legacy Global Payments issuer customer, KB Bank in the Czech Republic to move to our TSYS PRIME platform in the fourth quarter, another revenue synergy from our merger.\nFinally, of the 9 LOIs we have in our Issuer Solutions business today, 5 are competitive takeaways. In addition, we recently had another new customer win move from LOI into production that was also a competitive takeaway. We've been successful in expanding our target addressable markets in 2021 beyond AWS as we diversify and broaden our distribution.\nWe announced new strategic partnerships last year with PwC and 10x banking. 10x Banking is a next-generation cloud-native platform designed to bring forward a new way of banking with faster product development and a lower cost to serve. We are proud to announce a new collaboration with ecolytiq\nto bring sustainability as a service to fintech start-ups, neobanks, and traditional institutions. This partnership provides consumers with a personalized view of their impact on the environment, driven by their payment transaction activities. This technology enables corporate clients to align their digital banking strategies with consumers and experiences.\nFurther, we are delighted to announce a partnership with Xtend through our new distribution channels. We will provide B2B virtual commercial account services to banks and fintechs with Xtend, serving our infant virtual card issuance product. Through relationships like ecolytiq and Xtend, we are able to support a full spectrum of solutions across emerging use cases.\nAnd while we've been providing market-leading technologies for buy now, pay later, or BNPL, initiatives for decades, we continue to innovate and deliver installment payments products as BNPL demand grows. This includes expanding our combined installment solutions with Visa and signing a global referral agreement with Mastercard. And through our partnership with leading technology companies, private label branded retailers and many of the world's largest issuers, we will be able to provide our customers with a complete ecosystem of BNPL capabilities on a regulated compliant, and responsible basis. It's worth highlighting that in 2021 alone, TSYS enabled over 2 billion BNPL transactions and issued 55 million virtual cards with more than $31 billion in volume.\nTurning to our merchant business. We are pleased to report the release of the first phase of our Google, Run, and Grow My Business product that integrates Google's solutions with our innovative capabilities in our digital portal environment during the fourth quarter as planned. We continue to expect to launch the next phase to help our merchants grow faster by connecting additional Google services, including online ordering, retail inventory, and reservations to our digital platform later this year.\nGoogle is also now a live merchant customer in the Asia Pacific, and we expect to launch Google as a merchant customer in North America by the end of this quarter. We continue to deliver a full suite of vertically fluent solutions across dozens of markets worldwide.\nFor example, our enterprise QSR business delivered bookings growth for its cloud POS services in excess of 50% in 2021 and went live with new marquee customers like Denny's, Long John Silver's, and A&W restaurants. We also continue to expand with existing brands, including Bojangles, Whataburger, and CKE, which today leverage a combination of our innovative end-to-end solutions. We delivered more than 300 million omnichannel restaurant experiences in 2021, up 50% versus 2020 and indicative of a share shift due to the pandemic and market share gains.\nBy way of comparison, we enabled 19 million omnichannel orders in 2019 prior to COVID-19. Our AMD business generated revenue growth of over 30% in 2021 and in excess of 35% for the fourth quarter compared to 2019. And that momentum is poised to continue with bookings growth of 40% in the fourth quarter and 26% and for the full year over 2020.\nI am particularly proud that AMD's telemedicine solution enabled 2.5 million provider visits over the last year, marking an 85% increase from 2020. And to put it in perspective, that is up from the roughly 100,000 telemedicine visits facilitated annually prior to the pandemic. We're also delighted to have hit the ground running in one of the largest and most attractive verticals in 2021 in real estate.\nZego delivered near 20% bookings growth for the full year, enabled by its continued success with existing enterprise customers like ACC and Thalhimer and by expanding with new partners like ManageAmerica and Equity LifeStyle, one of its largest new customers to date. Zego's payments penetration into its base also reached an all-time high last year under our stewardship.\nAs we discussed at our 2021 Investor Conference, we are the beneficiaries of technological innovation, continued share shift, and market share gains, including QR codes, digital wallets, safe for commerce, and of course, BNPL. Speaking of BNPL, in addition to the agreements we already have in place with leading solutions providers, including Affirm and Tua in the United States and Atome in the Asia Pacific, we are launching our BNPL as a service marketplace this quarter to augment our 140-plus alternate payment methods portfolio.\nFurther, our new partnership with Virgin Money highlights our ability to deliver nonbank card account-to-account transfers through our digital solutions, capitalizing on our market-leading merchant ecosystem, which already provides one of the largest NFC acceptance networks globally. In September, we highlighted that we win by leading with technology and innovative solutions across our merchant portfolio. And the fourth quarter provides further evidence of our differentiated strategies.\nWe delivered record bookings in the fourth quarter of '21 for Global Payments Integrated and U.S. payments and payroll businesses, each of which grew 20% year-over-year. Our e-commerce and omnichannel business grew on an accelerated basis in 2021. Our ability to seamlessly provide the full spectrum of payment solutions drove new wins this quarter with large multinational Mary Kay across 6 countries in Europe and Asia; and with ESW, or eShopWorld, a leader in direct-to-consumer global commerce in the United States with further global expansion on the horizon.\nAnd over the course of 2021, we also reached new partnerships with Google, Uber Eats and Uber Rides, Foot Locker, Hunter Douglas, and The Swatch Group, while extending and expanding the scope of our long-standing relationship with PayPal.\nFinally, we added B2B as the newest pillar of our strategy in 2021. We are already making significant strides with MineralTree since the closing in mid-October. This includes doubling virtual card spend in the fourth quarter and completing 9 new deals in the health care vertical, including with know-how dental and biometrics. This quarter, MineralTree also renewed its agreement with NI or National Instruments, successfully executed an implementation with Mexico-based food services company, Grupo Bimbo, and launched its Supplier Central portal which allows for seamless payments acceptance for suppliers to support greater digital adoption.\nWe are pleased to have successfully invested $2.5 billion in M&A since early 2020, consistent with our 4 strategic pillars. We also have returned $3.7 billion of capital to shareholders since that time. And our record cash flow generation and solid balance sheet position us with ample firepower to continue to execute on our priorities.\nAt the same time, we seek to refine our portfolio by simplifying the composition of our businesses and focusing on our core corporate customers, including merchants, financial institutions, software partners, and technology leaders. As part of that initiative, we have commenced a strategic review of our Netspend consumer business to sharpen our focus on our B2B assets.\nWhile Netspend's direct-to-consumer business is an attractive set of solutions with a favorable profile, there is limited overlap between that customer base and our traditional clients. Having largely completed our integration with TSYS corporately made the pivot towards B2B and incorporated Netspend's B2B assets into our thinking. We believe now is the appropriate time to commence this review of Netspend's consumer business.\nAs we said at our investor conference in September, we have a full suite of B2B assets, including a market-leading commercial card offering, virtual card issuance at scale, payroll, pay card, earn wage access, and now accounts payable cloud SaaS with MineralTree. We complement these offerings with a unique collaboration with AWS.\nWe are very proud of all that Netspend and our valued team members have accomplished under TSYS' ownership over the last 8-plus years. We believe that we have created significant value since the close of our merger by expanding internationally, accelerating digitization, and driving significant operational efficiencies. We also provided much-needed faster payments to millions of consumers during some of the most challenging periods of the pandemic. Revenue, margin, and contribution were all records at Netspend in 2021. Simply put, we have achieved our goals. Paul?\n\nPaul Michael Todd\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, Total System Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff. Our financial performance for the full year 2021 exceeded our expectations despite incremental headwinds from COVID-19, including both the Delta and Omicron variants. Specifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $7.74 billion, an increase of 15% from the prior year and solidly ahead of our initial guidance for adjusted net revenue to be in a range of $7.5 billion to $7.6 billion.\nImportantly, our adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points to 41.8%, as we benefited from the natural operating leverage in the business and the continued realization of cost synergies related to the merger, which was partially offset by the return of certain costs that were temporarily reduced at the onset of the pandemic and the impact of our acquisitions during the year. This performance is also consistent with our guidance for adjusted operating margin expansion of around 200 basis points for the year, including the impact of acquisitions we closed during 2021.\nThe net result was adjusted earnings per share of $8.16, an increase of 28% from the prior year and 31% over 2019. We believe we would have been at the high end of our recent guide rather than above the midpoint, but for the emergence of Omicron and incremental adverse foreign exchange rates during the fourth quarter.\nMoving to the fourth quarter. We delivered adjusted net revenue of $1.98 billion, representing 13.3% growth compared to the prior year and 10% growth compared to 2019. Adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter was 42%, a 50 basis point improvement from the prior year or a 110 basis point improvement, excluding the impact of acquisitions.\nCompared to 2019, adjusted operating margins increased 370 basis points. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.13, an increase of 18.3% compared to the prior year and an increase of 32% compared to 2019.\nTaking a closer look at our performance by segment, Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.34 billion for the fourth quarter, a 21% improvement from the prior year and a 15.4% improvement compared to 2019. This performance was led by continued strength in the U.S., while we also benefited from improving trends in international markets, including Spain, Central Europe, and Greater China.\nNotably, we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 48.2% in this segment, an increase of 70 basis points year-on-year and 130 basis points, excluding the impact of M&A. Adjusted operating margins improved 320 basis points over 2019, as we continue to benefit from the underlying strength of our business mix.\nFocusing on our technology-enabled portfolio, our integrated business produced another strong quarter, generating adjusted net revenue growth in the high 20% range compared to 2020. It is also worth highlighting that over the last 2 years, notwithstanding the pandemic, adjusted net revenue growth for this business has compounded at the mid-teens rate we target for GPI longer term, and our worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel businesses saw growth of roughly 20% year-on-year as our value proposition, including our unified commerce platform, or UCP, continues to resonate with customers. Our ability to serve customers across nearly 40 markets physically and over 170 virtually is core to our omnichannel strategy and supports our growth outlook for these businesses.\nTurning to own software. Our POS software solutions delivered adjusted net revenue growth in excess of 50% in the fourth quarter, and our HCM and payroll businesses Solutions grew 32%. As for our vertical market solutions, we were pleased that the overall portfolio delivered growth of roughly 20% compared to the prior year in the fourth quarter and low double-digit growth for the full year, consistent with our target despite several of these businesses having not yet fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels.\nI would reiterate Jeff's comments regarding the positive bookings trends we are seeing across our vertical markets portfolio and we continue to expect our own software businesses will become a tailwind for us in 2022 as the recovery progresses.\nIssuer Solutions delivered $463 million in adjusted net revenue, a 1.3% improvement from the fourth quarter of 2020. This performance was impacted by 2 items this quarter. First, our Managed Services adjusted net revenues decreased as we continue to pivot our issuer business to more tech enablement and less lower-margin and outsourced call center business. We also had a grow-over of nonrecurring revenue that occurred last year.\nNormalizing for these 2 items, our adjusted net revenue growth was in the mid-single digits, consistent with our longer-term target. Issuer adjusted operating margins of 43.4% declined 130 basis points from the prior year but expanded 320 basis points over 2019 and in line with our expectation for the business.\nAs you may recall, Issuer Solutions delivered an adjusted operating margin expansion of 450 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2020 over 2019, fueled by our focus on driving efficiencies in the business, as well as benefits from temporary cost reductions.\nFinally, our Business and Consumer Solutions segment delivered adjusted net revenue growth of 2% for the fourth quarter and 7% on a full-year basis, consistent with our guidance for this segment to grow in the mid-to-high single-digit range in 2021.\nAs Jeff discussed, we intend to focus our efforts going forward on enhancing our B2B businesses which includes elements of net spend. To that end, we are pleased that MineralTree's bookings grew 19% this year, positioning the business well heading into 2022.\nAdjusted operating margin for Business and Consumer Solutions of 21.7% declined 240 basis points in the quarter from the prior year, largely due to lapping the benefits of stimulus volumes in Q4 for 2020.\nQuarterly margins expanded relative to Q4 of 2019. From a cash flow standpoint, we had roughly $609 million of adjusted free cash flow for the quarter and a record $2.5 billion for the year, consistent with our target to convert roughly 100% of adjusted earnings to adjusted free cash flow annually.\nWe invested $142 million in capital expenditures during the quarter and $493 million for the year, in line with our expectations. Further, this quarter, we repurchased approximately $5.5 million of our shares for approximately $700 million. And for the full year, we are pleased to have repurchased 15.2 million shares for roughly $2.5 billion or approximately 5% of our shares outstanding.\nAlso, our Board of Directors has again approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $2 billion as share repurchase remains a key capital allocation priority. Our balance sheet is extremely healthy, and we ended the period with roughly $2.4 billion of liquidity after repurchase activity and acquisition funding. In mid-November, we successfully issued $2 billion in senior unsecured notes at a blended interest rate of 2.27%.\nThe transaction was credit neutral with the full proceeds used to pay down our outstanding revolver. Our leverage position was roughly 3x on a net debt basis at quarter-end.\nLooking ahead to 2022, we remain encouraged by the trends we are seeing in the business and currently expect adjusted net revenue to range from $8.42 billion to $8.5 billion, reflecting growth of 9% to 10% over 2021 or roughly 10% to 11% on a constant currency basis with upwards of 1% of currency headwind expected throughout the year. This outlook is consistent with our long-term target for double-digit top-line growth and reflects the benefit we expect from a continued recovery throughout the year.\nWe expect adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 100 basis points compared to 2021 levels or up to 150 basis points of expansion, excluding impacts from our recent acquisitions. This is above our cycle guidance for margin expansion of 50 to 75 basis points annually, driven by the benefits we expect from the ongoing recovery, continued mix shift toward technology enablement across the business and additional synergies we anticipate related to the TSYS merger.\nTo provide some color at the segment level, we expect adjusted net revenue growth for our Merchant Solutions segment to be in the low double-digit range, which assumes the recovery continues worldwide. We expect Issuer Solutions to deliver adjusted net revenue growth in the mid-single-digit growth range for the full year, consistent with our longer-term targets.\nLastly, in our Business and Consumer segment, we are expecting adjusted net revenue growth to be in the low single digits for this segment in 2022, given the lapping of the benefits from the stimulus in both 2021 and 2020.\nLastly, I would highlight that from a quarterly phasing perspective, we expect the recovery from the pandemic will continue throughout the year, allowing for a progressive growth picture as we move through 2021.\nMoving to a couple of nonoperating items, we currently expect net interest expense to be roughly $375 million and for our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20% for the full year. We also expect our capital expenditures to be around $600 million in 2022.\nPutting it all together, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $9.45 to $9.67, reflecting growth of 16% to 19% over 2021. On a constant currency basis, this reflects annual growth of roughly 17% to 20% and is consistent with the raised September cycle guidance for adjusted earnings per share growth in the high teens to 20% range longer term.\nI would highlight that the discontinuance of stimulus and unemployment benefits and our Business and Consumer segment provides for a tough comparison in the first quarter. As a result, we expect adjusted earnings per share growth to be in the low double digits range in Q1.\nFinally, we will provide updates on the strategic review process for our Netspend consumer business as the year progresses.\nIn summary, the outstanding performance we delivered across our businesses in 2021 serves as a further proof point that we continue to gain share and that our technology-enabled strategy positions us well to capitalize on the accelerating digital trends coming out of the pandemic. We anticipate and assume an improving macroeconomic environment and waning pandemic impact as the year progresses. We could not be more pleased with our outlook entering 2022. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey S. Sloan\n\nCEO & Director, Global Payments Inc.\n\nThanks, Paul. I could not be more proud of all that we've accomplished in 2021 despite the incremental challenges we faced throughout the year, and our outlook is for an even brighter 2022.\nAs we highlighted in September, we are today a top quartile SaaS company, the leading issuer technology provider and program manager multi-nationally with unique partnerships, the largest e-com acquirer with an unmatched virtual and physical presence, and we deliver all these things with tremendous breadth across developed and attractive emerging markets.\nOur record results in 2021 and our expectations for 2022 reaffirm the wisdom of these strategies, the trends of digitization, commerce enablement, software differentiation and omnichannel prevalence driving our performance will start to catalyze our growth throughout 2022 and in the years ahead. Winnie?\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nSVP of IR, Global Payments Inc.\n\nBefore we begin our question-and-answer session, I'd like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one with one follow-up to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMartin J. McKenna\n\nFirst VP of Investor & Public Relations, Equity Residential\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's Third Quarter 2025 Results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bret McLeod, our CFO; Bob Garechana, our Chief Investment Officer, is here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com.\nPlease be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\n\nMark J. Parrell\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Trustee, Equity Residential\n\nThank you, Marty. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. I will lead us off with some broader commentary, then Michael Manelis will provide color on our third quarter revenue performance as well as what are you seeing in the markets today. Followed by Bret McLeod, our new Chief Financial Officer, who will address expenses and our NFFO guidance, and then we'll go ahead and take your questions.\nOur third quarter results reflect the resilience of our business despite what is generally a mixed macroeconomic picture, we continue to see good demand and excellent resident retention across most of our markets with results strongest in San Francisco and New York, where continuing high demand has met modest supply. We see our existing residents as having a generally stable employment situation and good wage growth. When last reported, the unemployment rate for the college educated, our key renter demographic was 2.7%, considerably below the national average. This is consistent with the experience at our properties as we see continued improvements in delinquency and no other signs of customer financial stress. We have also seen incomes rise for our new residents by 6.2% year-over-year, a healthy rate of growth. Finally, we continue to see residents react to the uncertainty in the economy and the quality of our properties and people by renewing with us at record rates.\nIn fact, we reported the highest third quarter resident retention in our company's history, allowing us to maintain high occupancy rates in the mid-96% range. In sum, our existing customer is financially healthy and happy to stay with us. On the new customer acquisition side, we began to see weakness in traffic during the back half of September. This was most pronounced in Washington, D.C., but did manifest itself in other markets as well. The best way to think about this is for us to say that our normal pattern of a seasonal decline in traffic began 1 month earlier than usual. In fact, everything this year feels like it was pulled forward. The leasing season started earlier than usual and peaked earlier than usual just as the normal seasonal pattern of traffic decline began earlier than usual. This acceleration of seasonal patterns, weakness in Washington, D.C. and some minor delays in the rollout of an other income initiative that Bret will discuss in a moment, led us to adjust down the midpoint of our annual same-store revenue guidance by 15 basis points to 2.75%.\nIn terms of market commentary, Michael will speak in a moment on specifics in D.C. and elsewhere. But I did want to make a general comment on San Francisco, where we have 15% of our net operating income. After a prolonged recovery, we are excited by what we are seeing in San Francisco, particularly the urban core, where we have more exposure than our competitors. As we talked about at our Investor Day earlier this year, we thought San Francisco had the opportunity to be a strong performer in 2025, and that is exactly what is happening in this the epicenter of the AI technology revolution. As a result, we expect San Francisco to be our best-performing market this year.\nAt our Investor Day, we also spoke positively about the Seattle recovery story. We do see improvement there, but due to higher supply levels in Seattle than San Francisco, this improvement is occurring at a slower pace. Conversely, but as we generally expected, we are seeing very different conditions in our higher supplied markets, specifically Denver, Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta, where we have about 11% of our NOI. In these markets, where the slowing job picture is meeting continued high levels of supply, we see a significant lack of pricing power. And to be clear, the supply pressure includes both recent new apartment deliveries, which are pretty well tracked by all the data providers and the continuing pressure from slow lease-ups of already completed properties as well as the first round of lease renewals at properties that were delivered a year ago, where landlords are struggling to remove lease-up concessions when going through the renewal process and places with many choices for consumers.\nThis not yet fully stabilized supply is less well tracked by data providers and is not as well understood by investors but is certainly impactful. Over time, all of this supply will clear the market and we remain comfortable with the cost basis at which we acquired the assets we own in these markets. We also are positive on longer-term return prospects in these markets, complementing our portfolio diversification goals. But as we've said on prior earnings calls, we do expect to see an elongated recovery in these markets.\nSwitching over to capital allocation. As you saw in the release, we have been active in buying our shares with the company repurchasing approximately $100 million of its stock during the third quarter and subsequent to quarter end. We see our company with its high-quality asset base and sophisticated operating platform and forward growth prospects as greatly undervalued versus asset prices in the private market. Also, we closed on 1 acquisition in the quarter, a 375-unit property in Arlington, Texas, that has been in process for some time. This property was just completed in 2023 and is a nice complement to our Dallas area portfolio. We sold 2 deals in the quarter, 1 in suburban Boston and 1 in suburban D.C. These were older assets averaging nearly 30 years in age. These transactions all traded right around a 5% cap rate.\nAs you also saw in our release, we have lowered our acquisitions and dispositions guidance for the full year to $750 million of each from $1 billion of each, with the vast majority of these transactions already completed. As I just discussed, with private market assets often trading at sub-5% cap rates and at or above replacement cost, our stock presents a compelling value at current levels, making us selective and limited in our acquisition activity for the time being. Dispositions of properties to fund the buyback will occur over the next several quarters, and we'll focus on properties with lower forward growth potential or where we are overconcentrated.\nBefore I turn the call over to Michael, I want to reiterate how excited we are about the forward prospects for our business. Our internal tracking shows deliveries of competitive new supply in our markets, declining 35% or by about 40,000 units in 2026 versus 2025 levels. The results we are seeing in San Francisco and New York demonstrate the earnings growth power of our business, when we are operating in markets with sustained demand and low levels of competitive new housing supply. We believe more markets we operate in will trend in that direction in 2026, assuming the job situation is reasonably constructive.\nFor example, our internal tracking shows 2026 new apartment supply in the Washington, D.C. market that is competitive with our properties will be declining by over 8,000 units or down 65% to below 5,000 units, a level we have not seen since at least the great financial crisis. With portfolio-wide occupancy of more than 96%, and occupancy nearly 97% in some of our key markets, we think this sets us up well for another year of solid performance in 2026. And if job growth reignites, we could see some very good results. In sum, we continue to see the current and future drivers of our business is healthy and the forward momentum is solid.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis.\n\nMichael L. Manelis\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Mark, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our third quarter results reflect solid demand with outside performance in San Francisco and New York. Currently, general macroeconomic uncertainty remains as a result of tariffs, lower job growth and more recently, the government shutdown. These factors make forecasting demand a little bit more challenging today than it was 90 days ago, but what has not changed is the excellent setup we have going into next year due to the dramatic reductions to competitive new supply.\nBreaking down our third quarter operating results. Our renewal rate achieved for the quarter remained strong and was up 4.5% with nearly 59% of our leases renewing, and both of these were in line with what we thought would happen through the quarter. Our centralized renewal process and intense focus on customer satisfaction has helped deliver the lowest reported third quarter turnover in our history. Across our portfolio, the average length of stay has increased by nearly 20% from 2019 and retention is at record levels. As secular trends and our focus on enhanced customer experiences have driven increased retention, the positive impact on same-store revenue growth from renewals has become more significant. Our unique value proposition and customized renewal experience reduces costs associated with vacancy and new customer acquisition like marketing and concessions while enhancing customer satisfaction and removing the friction costs on our residents who choose to remain with us.\nThis strategy optimizes overall revenue and improved customer satisfaction despite potential short-term variability in new lease change which is an output that is greatly impacted by who moved in or out. With that said, new lease rates at negative 1% came in lower than we expected and resulted in a 2.2% blended rate increase for the quarter which was at the low end of our range. As Mark described, pricing trends peaked in July this year at a level that was both lower and earlier than normal. Prices stayed relatively flat through August, started the seasonal descent in September, which is typical but we did observe some late quarter pricing softness, mostly in Washington, D.C., which I will describe in a minute, which impacted our new lease change.\nFor the entire portfolio, physical occupancy remained high at 96.3% for the quarter, driven by solid demand and strong retention in our coastal markets, excluding D.C., which gave up some occupancy at the end of the quarter. Let me take a minute and highlight a few of the markets that are driving performance. The recovery in San Francisco, particularly downtown, is real. As the epicenter of all things tech workers have returned to the market and drove high occupancy and very good rate growth on both new lease and renewal rates. This strength was supported by the positive trends we observed in our migration data with just over 4% more move-ins coming to us from outside both the MSA and the State of California. In addition, we have a very favorable new supply setup in the market in 2026 with only about 1,000 units of competitive new supply being delivered.\nSan Francisco will be our best-performing market in 2025 and most likely again in 2026 as we are just now approaching 2019 rent levels in our downtown portfolio while median incomes in the market are up 22% since 2019. Similarly, New York continues to be a strong performer. Job sentiment in the market has been good and competitive new supply has been and will continue to be very low, which should position us to deliver above-average revenue growth again next year. I would note that our combined exposure to urban San Francisco and New York and the positive demand and supply outlook in 2026 is particularly unique to EQR and should be a relative strength for us versus peers next year. While DC will end up having a strong 2025, the year has certainly been a tale of 2 markets. The strength we saw early in the year carried through most of the third quarter, but as I mentioned, in late September, we definitely started to see some softness in demand and pricing power.\nA combination of federal job cuts and the National Guard deployment followed by the government shutdown has created a lot of uncertainty in the local market. Most of the pressure is being felt in the district and in pockets of Northern Virginia, and these areas, our current operational focus is preserving occupancy. And while we aren't experiencing residents turning in keys due to job loss, our overall turnover in the D.C. market did increase slightly in the quarter and the volume of leasing activity has slowed as the overall market still needs to absorb the nearly 13,000 units delivered this year. The good news is that in 2026, competitive supply in D.C. will drop 65% and remain low for the foreseeable future, which is a marked change from the past decade. Add to that, our sense that in the long term, the federal government will continue to be a job engine regardless of the near-term headwinds of temporary cuts or shutdowns. Overall, we feel very good about D.C. as a market in the long term.\nShifting to Los Angeles. The city continues to face challenges and remains a wildcard as we head into 2026. We continue to see overall market weakness driven primarily by slowdowns in the entertainment industry and although the quality of life issues are improving, they are still not where we would like them to be. We have demand but less pricing power, particularly in the urban portfolio, where we continue to feel the impact of new supply in our Downtown, Koreatown and Mid-Wilshire portfolios. Our suburban submarkets of Santa Clarita, Inland Empire and Ventura County are performing well. As in many of our coastal markets, supply will be lower in 2026 but we will need to see a catalyst for demand in order for us to have pricing power return. Our hope is that with the upcoming World Cup in 2026 and the Olympics in 2028 that there will be long-term incentives for the quality of life to improve in L.A., albeit from a low base.\nIn our expansion markets, which currently represents only 6% of our same-store NOI and 11% of our total NOI, high levels of new supply continue to impact operating results in Atlanta, Dallas, Denver and Austin. Atlanta is faring the best of the 4 and Denver, the worst. Our same-store portfolios in both Atlanta and Dallas should see improved results and performed better than the broader market next year as we add our recently acquired more suburban assets to the same-store portfolios next year.\nBefore I turn it over to Bret, let me take a minute to highlight our current activities around innovation. In the third quarter, we deployed our AI-driven application processing tool which has already delivered a 50% reduction in the overall application time. We currently have about half of all applications being completed within 1 day, and this process includes a more robust comprehensive ID verification process that should help reduce fraudulent activity going forward. Overall, I am really excited about the opportunities in 2026 as we continue to implement AI in other key areas of the resident experience. Next month, we will begin testing a new service application module that is designed to improve service request intake, provide self-service tips, optimize team schedules and ensure qualified team members, address task efficiently in a single visit. This is a great example of how we are focused on increasing the utilization of our workforce, while at the same time, creating a more seamless and responsive experience for our residents.\nI want to give a shout out to our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to our residents while embracing change to further enhance our operating platform. Our portfolio will end 2025 well occupied with a strong platform that combines automation, centralization, along with a local team that knows how to keep our customers satisfied while getting a larger share of the demand pool whatever that level may be in the markets.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Bret.\n\nBret D.S. McLeod\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Michael. Before I walk through our updated guidance, I first wanted to say how excited I am to be here at Equity Residential working alongside Mark, Michael, Bob and the rest of our talented corporate team. It's been nearly 100 days since I joined the company, and I'm even more impressed with the organization than when I started. I'm comfortable stating that because one of the first things I did here was hit the road and visit many of our communities and hardworking associates across the country. My early travels included some of our top-performing markets, such as San Francisco and New York, where I saw the quality and location of our assets firsthand as well as the innovative operating platform Michael and the team have established.\nI visited Seattle, where we are set up well for 2026, benefiting from local return to office mandates and continued AI investment growth. I also traveled to Dallas, one of our larger expansion markets and witnessed constant examples of the outsized demand growth dynamics that are driving our positive long-term thesis on that metro area. I'm grateful to all my new colleagues for helping me get up to speed so quickly.\nWith that said, let me provide some color on the guidance adjustments we made this quarter, which continued to reflect a stable and resilient business outlook, albeit amid some macroeconomic and employment uncertainty, as Mark and Michael described. We've adjusted the top end of our full year same-store revenue outlook down as a result of third quarter same-store blended rate coming in at the lower end of our prior range and what we have seen in early fourth quarter trends. In addition, a portion of other income growth related to bulk WiFi that we expected to realize in the second half of 2025 has rolled out slightly slower than planned and will now be pushed into 2026. That said, we still saw strong quarter-over-quarter growth in other income of 9%, demonstrating our ability to continue to pull multiple levers to drive overall revenue.\nThe combination of these 2 factors resulted in a revised 2025 same-store revenue range of 2.5% to 3%, with a midpoint of 2.75%, which matches the midpoint of the range we guided to at the beginning of this year. We held same-store expenses steady at 3.5% to 4% for the full year and continue to see sub-inflationary trends on payroll, insurance and real estate taxes, partially offset by higher utility expenses, particularly in California. I would remind you that our 2025 same-store expenses are approximately 40 basis points higher this year due to the continued rollout of bulk WiFi, which sits in repairs and maintenance, but is positively contributing to outsized other income growth for the remainder of the year and will continue to do so as we move into 2026.\nThe net result of these same-store revenue and expense adjustments is a revised annual same-store NOI range of 2.1% to 2.6% at a midpoint of 2.35%, 15 basis points higher than our original 2025 guidance, but 15 basis points lower than the midpoint we provided in the second quarter. For normalized FFO, we've tightened our range of both the top and bottom end and are estimating full year 2025 and FFO per share of $3.98 to $4.02, leaving the midpoint unchanged from Q2 at $4 per share. Slightly reduced same-store NOI should be offset by expected continued improvements in lease-up NOI and lower property management expense.\nWith that, I will turn it over to the operator and open it up for questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.\n\nMartin J. McKenna\n\nFirst VP of Investor & Public Relations, Equity Residential\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's second quarter 2025 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer. Alec Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, is here with us as well for the Q&A.\nOur earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\n\nMark J. Parrell\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Trustee, Equity Residential\n\nThank you, Marty. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. I will lead us off with some top-of-the-house commentary, then Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide color on our second quarter performance as well as what he is seeing in the markets today and an update on some of the initiatives we have going on. He will then turn the call over to Bob Garshana in his last call as our CFO before he takes over as our Chief Investment Officer. And Bob will provide some color on our guidance changes, and then we'll go ahead and take your questions. Alec Brackenridge, our soon to retire CIO, is here with us for the Q&A.\nOur second quarter results and guidance continue to reflect the sustained demand and excellent resident retention that we are seeing across our markets. We see this demand is being supported by nearly full employment in the country as a whole, with the overall unemployment rate being only 4.2%, though the pace of job growth is certainly slowing. The unemployment rate for our key demographic, the college educated, remains even lower at 2.7%. We're also seeing continued high retention rates as more residents choose to renew with us. Fewer and fewer residents are moving out to buy homes. And as we and other operators often prioritize occupancy and renewal rate management over new lease growth in a world that is more uncertain than usual for residents and landlords.\nAlso, we continue to see the forward setup for our business is outstanding and see above-trend revenue growth in future years as likely given the large apartment supply decline, the expensive and unavailable single-family-owned housing market and societal trends favoring rentership. As we talked about at our Investor Day earlier this year, our shareholders benefit from our unique and diversified portfolio. We have a differentiated exposure from our competitors that includes a collection of assets across the urban centers of many coastal markets that gives us a distinct opportunity to outperform as improving conditions, particularly continuing declines in new supply and improvements in quality of life in these urban centers drive faster cash flow growth.\nTo illustrate that further, we are already seeing strong revenue results in places like New York City and downtown San Francisco, where supply has already abated and with more supply declines on the way, we are optimistic our results can continue to be above trend in these areas. Across our markets, we look for a balance of both urban and suburban assets that capture the changing needs of our primary renter demographic. Putting this portfolio on top of the most efficient overall operating platform in the space when you take into account overhead, capital expenditures and operating expenses, and you have a vehicle that should outperform in the near term and over the long term because of its focus on higher earning renters across a broad array of markets.\nFinally, while good job growth is important to all apartment markets, it is especially important to drive absorption in oversupplied markets. So we expect our portfolio with its tilt towards lower supply markets in some markets and relatively modest amount of development properties and lease-up to exhibit more resilience if job growth continues to wane.\nOn the transactions front, in the quarter, we continued to build out our presence in Atlanta, with the acquisition of an 8-property portfolio in suburban submarkets. This is a market we have been favoring in our recent acquisition activity as we expect supply here to decline more quickly than in other Sunbelt markets. We now have 22 properties spread through our targeted submarkets within the Atlanta metro area. These 8 new store properties plus 7 assets that were acquired last year, complement and round out our current 6 property same-store portfolio that is focused more midtown and in closer in submarkets.\nWe have also gained powerful economies of scale in Atlanta where we can efficiently share personnel across a broad portfolio and take advantage of our new scale and contracting for local services like landscaping as we do in other markets where we have a large number of properties. While we continue to look for opportunities to add to our portfolios in our expansion markets and certain suburban submarkets of our established markets, the transaction market is not as active as we had hoped it would be at the beginning of the year. As a result, pricing has become very competitive with cap rates for desirable assets we wish to acquire, often in the high 4% range, significantly lower than the cost of debt even for us with our highly rated balance sheet.\nAs you saw in our release, we have lowered our acquisition expectations for the full year to $1 billion from $1.5 billion and expect to match sales and acquisitions this year. Nonetheless, we certainly have the ability to accelerate our acquisitions should attractively priced opportunities arrive. Before I turn it over to Michael, I want to thank Alec Brackenridge for his leadership, for his friendship for all his hard work over the years, creating value for our shareholders. Alec will work with us assisting in the transition as we finish out the year. We're also excited for Bob and know he will thrive in his new Chief Investment Officer role. And finally, I want to welcome Brett McCloud to Equity Residential. Brett will take over as our CFO in a few days, and we are very excited to add his deep financial experience and new perspectives to our team. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis.\n\nMichael L. Manelis\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Mark, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our second quarter results exceeded our expectations from the beginning of the year, and we're about in line with our expectations going into the leasing season. The financial health of our residents remains strong. The average household income of our residents who moved in with us in the second quarter is up 8.5% from the same quarter last year and rent as a percent of income remains low at 20%. In addition, as Mark mentioned, we are not losing residents to home purchase. And in fact, that number sat at 7.2% in the quarter which is among the lowest levels we have seen.\nOur blended rate growth of 3% was about where we thought it would be driven by strong renewal rate of 5.2% and with 60% of the residents renewing in the quarter. Our intense focus on customer satisfaction and stronger-than-expected results from our centralized renewal process have driven this performance. Our physical occupancy was very good at 96.6%. New lease rate was slightly negative in the quarter, which reflects that while there is good demand. It is a bit price sensitive and concession use continues in a number of our markets, particularly those with heavy supply. As we look to the markets, New York continues to benefit from high occupancy actually the highest in our portfolio and very little competitive new supply, leading to some of the best blended rate growth in our portfolio.\nWith demand being driven by a steady job market, we continue to expect this market where we have a predominantly urban portfolio to be one of our best-performing markets in 2025. Boston has had steady demand leading to good occupancy and a strong renewal rate. The market is feeling some of the pressure and uncertainty from actual and potential cuts to the education and research sector. As a result, the job market seems a little softer here and foreign inbound demand was slightly below historical norms. Our urban assets continue to outperform our suburban ones as the new supply is more focused in the suburbs. Our bias here will continue to be occupancy focused, and the second quarter was already up 90 basis points sequentially.\nWashington, D.C. has been an excellent performer throughout the first half of the year with high occupancy and good retention and really strong rent growth. Not surprisingly, we have recently seen a slowing in the market likely due to the uncertainty around jobs given the cuts by the administration. While the government is not the only employer in the market, it clearly has an influence on the overall feel and confidence levels. Currently, our pressure is being felt in the district in areas of Northern Virginia. Velocity slowed a bit in July, but demand recovered quickly as we backed off on rate, which is allowing us to maintain strong occupancy. Despite the recent softening, the Washington, D.C. market remains on track to be one of our strongest revenue growth market in 2025 with a very significant drop off in supply expected in '20.\nMoving out West. The real standout market for this year is San Francisco. We talked about the potential for recovery in this market at our Investor Day and are very pleased that this recovery is coming to fruition at a pace even beyond what we expected. Our blended rate growth of 5.8% here is the best in our portfolio driven by strong new lease and renewal increases with sequential gains in occupancy. This is a great example of where we saw a recovery in full force and drove very robust seasonal price acceleration, including the pullback on concessions. Tech jobs are steady with a lot of continued AI focus in the market. During the second quarter, we observed very favorable migration patterns with 8% more move-ins coming to us from outside the MSA and 5% more move-ins coming to us from other states.\nWe are optimistic that these migration patterns continue, especially in the downtown submarket as the city is really starting to feel the positive impact from the focus on quality of life issues. Competitive supply in the market at less than 1% of inventory is very manageable, and we believe this will be our best performing market this year. In Seattle, the improvements continue with the market working past the quality of life issues that have been a challenge. Seattle is seeing a slow and steady job growth from the tech firms leading to modest growth in office using jobs, which is also being positively impacted by the return to office policies of big employers like Amazon and Starbucks.\nAs expected, supply pressure was felt in the city of Seattle and Redmond submarket which impacted some of our new lease pricing power. But the good news is that most of the concentrated deliveries are behind us, and this is likely to be a temporary condition. Concessions are still in wide use as the market seems to have become accustomed to them over the past few years. Overall, solid employment and an easier comp for us in the second half of the year at Seattle continuing to be one of the top performing markets for us this year with a great setup in 2026. Los Angeles continues to face challenges and underperform our pretty modest beginning of the year expectations.\nLackluster job growth, driven by a pretty weak entertainment sector, along with the quality of life issues are keeping pressure on demand. Our West L.A. and suburban portfolios are doing better than our assets located in Korea and Mid-Wilshire submarkets. On the hopeful side, a very large tax incentive should spur local employment by driving the return of filming and production to the market. We have good occupancy overall, but it appears that our rents peaked in early June. This is a good example of a market where our focus is on retention and capturing good renewal rates while maintaining occupancy as overall pricing power was softer than seasonal norms. Orange County and San Diego are performing in line with our expectations for the year.\nNew supply and modest job growth are keeping pressure on rents after a number of years of strong performance. And finally, in our expansion markets, Denver continues to feel the impact from modest job growth and high levels of new supply, particularly in the downtown market. Concession use is heavy in the overall market. We have a good pace on our leasing volume, but a fair bit of price sensitivity and deal shopping is impacting new lease growth and making us prioritize retention and renewal rates. Our Atlanta portfolio is performing in line with our expectations for the year.\nAs a reminder, our same-store portfolio here is just 7 assets and is primarily located in more urban locations like Midtown unlike our newer suburban acquisitions. The urban areas are experiencing a lot of new supply and concession use, but it appears that this submarket found the bottom as we have had a few months of stability with early signs of potential improving conditions. Our non-same-store properties, which I mentioned are more suburban focused will join the same-store set next year and are performing at or slightly better than our underwritten expectations and clearly better than our urban Atlanta properties. We feel good about Dallas.\nDemand is strong due to better-than-average job growth in the market, but concessions are plentiful as the market absorbs supply, particularly in select submarkets. Similar to Atlanta, our newer acquisitions, which are in less supply concentrated submarkets, will join the 2026 same-store set and tend to face less direct supply pressure and are performing better with fewer concessions and stronger occupancies. Switching to innovation and automation updates, the opportunity to apply artificial intelligence in our business is really exciting. Our AI leasing application pilots have reduced overall application completion time by over 50%, while significantly improving fraud detection, resident underwriting and user satisfaction.\nGiven this success, we are accelerating the rollout aiming for full deployment by end of year, which is about a quarter earlier in the original time frame. Additionally, our new delinquency management AI will be fully deployed by the end of this month, and so far, we can see that consistent engagement with customers improves overall payment behaviors. All of these automation and conversational AI initiatives are set up to dramatically improve both our customer experience and operational efficiency. As we think about the third quarter, we expect blended rates to begin to moderate as usual with strong retention and occupancy continuing against a backdrop of slightly lower achieved renewal and new lease rates. Which combined, will result in an expected blended rate growth range of 2.2% to 2.8% for the quarter.\nWith our occupancy holding study and resident turnover continuing to track at record low levels, we are well positioned for a solid back half of the year, especially as supply headwinds continues to subside. As I think about our setup for 2026, we expect to have normal embedded growth continued strong renewal performance and occupancy against a backdrop of much less competitive new supply pressure. At this time, I will turn the call over to Bob to walk us through the financial results and guidance changes.\n\nRobert A. Garechana\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Michael. As Michael mentioned, I'll walk through our guidance changes before opening it up for Q&A. Starting with same-store revenue. The 15 basis point increase in the midpoint of our same-store revenue guidance is driven primarily by better-than-anticipated retention and improved occupancy growth, which Michael already discussed. As we discussed at the beginning of the year, other income growth and bad debt improvement remain back half loaded and thus far are right on track with our original guidance expectations. We continue to expect improvements in those areas of 70 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively.\nTurning to same-store expenses. We've revised the midpoint of our expense guidance range down by 25 basis points. This improvement is driven by better-than-anticipated real estate tax, insurance and payroll growth, offset in part by higher utilities expenses. As we noted in the release, utilities this year are suffering from both a difficult comparable period and higher commodity prices along with elevated water and sewer charges. [indiscernible] side of those categories, most of the other categories remain on plan. As a reminder, before we move on from expenses, about 50 basis points of our total expense in 2025 is related to our bulk WiFi rollout and is included in repairs and maintenance. This program is accretive to NOI growth given its other income contribution but is an outsized driver this year to expense growth.\nWith these revenue and expense improvements, we are increasing our same-store NOI growth midpoint by 30 basis points, which is in the top half of the prior range. Same-store revenue growth in the last 2 quarters of the year. This is driven by the compounding effect of positive blended rates and leasing activity from the first half of the year, strong continued physical occupancy and back half loaded improvement from both bad debt and other income, like I just discussed.\nFinally, we're increasing the midpoint of our FFO range by $0.05 to the top end of our prior range. Page 2 of the release provides a detailed reconciliation of that change, but let me provide a little more color here. $0.02 of the improvement is coming from the same-store adjustments I just described. $0.01 is coming from better performance in our lease-up portfolio which is largely due to outsized performance in our suburban San Francisco lease up and our suburban New York lease up, while other communities are largely in line with expectations. $0.02 of lower transaction activity NOI is reflected as well from our changes in our transaction activity guidance from $1.5 billion in acquisitions down to $1 billion.\nPerformance from communities acquired thus far is in line with our underwriting and our original guidance. We also have $0.03 of lower interest expense due in part to that change in transaction volume, as I described, and also slightly better refinancing rates. And finally, we have one set of improvement from other items, including overhead. One final note before I turn it over to the operator. In the second quarter, we attractively refinanced our 2025 maturity. With the change in transaction activity guidance, we are not including any further debt issuance in our guidance given that we currently expect to match fund our $1 billion in acquisition activity with $1 billion in dispositions. Our next meaningful debt maturity is not until November of 2026. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator."

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMartin J. McKenna\n\nFirst VP of Investor & Public Relations, Equity Residential\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's Fourth Quarter 2024 Results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer. Alec Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, is here with us as well for the Q&A.\nOur earnings release and management presentation are posted in the Investors section of equity Apartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.\nNow I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\n\nMark J. Parrell\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Trustee, Equity Residential\n\nThank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results and outlook for 2025. I will start us off then Michael Manelis, our COO, will speak to our 2024 operating performance and 2025 revenue guidance; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, will cover our 2025 expense and NFFO guidance, then we'll go ahead and take your questions. We also posted a management presentation on our website last night with some additional detail.\nAnd before I get to the meat of my remarks, I want to spend a minute thanking my colleagues in the Los Angeles market. For all they've done to support our residents and each other during this very difficult time. We are fortunate to have not had any property seriously impacted by the fires, but our teams and everyone else in L.A. has been through a lot. A special shout out to all of the firefighters, first responders and everyone else, who worked tirelessly to battle the blazes. Now turning to 2024. We finished the year with solid same-store revenue results that were a good bit better than the midpoint of what we had expected at the beginning of the year, but with slowing bad debt improvement in the fourth quarter, leaving us at the lower end of our previously upwardly revised guidance expectations.\nDemand remains very good across our portfolio, with levels of supply, the main determinant of market performance. Before putting 2024 in the rearview mirror, I want to thank my colleagues across our 300-plus properties and at corporate, who once again did a great job managing expense growth while providing outstanding customer service. We are very proud of delivering same-store expense growth in 2024 of 2.9% and delivering an average of only 3.2% same-store expense growth over the past 5 years. Well done team.\nAnd now moving on to 2025, while we are expecting similar annual same-store revenue growth as last year. The pace of our historic quarter-over-quarter revenue growth should show acceleration throughout the year with the back half of 2025 considerably better than the first half. In contrast, the deceleration in quarterly growth we saw in 2024. In both our earnings release and in the management presentation, we provided guidance for our 2025 operations. Michael and Bob are going to provide some color on that guidance in just a minute, but I want to take a moment to talk about the economic outlook that supports these guidance expectations.\nBased on the third-party economic projections, we use, we expect office-using job growth, which we see as a key driver of our business to be higher in 2025 than in 2024, especially on the West Coast. The improvement we are seeing in our downtown Seattle operations and beginning to see in the San Francisco market, both downtown and on the Peninsula are consistent with that theme. Unemployment of college graduates, the bulk of our residents is currently very low at 2.4%, and we expect it to stay in that range in 2025. With the supply of housing already tight in most of our markets, we see this setup as very positive for our business. I also note that our current earnings guidance is given by -- is driven by the positive signs we are seeing looking at our operating dashboards as well as our deep knowledge of supply and demand dynamics in our markets rather than by looking at the headlines.\nBut we certainly acknowledge that there is a higher level of uncertainty in the forward path of the economy than usual, given various recent governmental actions relating to tariffs and other matters, the impact of these actions on the larger economy and our business is hard to estimate currently, will evolve over time and is not included in our guidance expectations. That said, being a strong cash flow business without foreign operations and with the fortress balance sheet in times of heightened uncertainty is a definitive positive. So looking at supply in our coastal established markets where we have 90% of our net operating income, we expect completions of competitive units to be similar in 2025 to 2024. But at a considerably lower level as a percentage of existing apartment inventory than in the Sunbelt markets.\nThe localized exceptions that Michael will discuss, we expect this coastal supply to be absorbed well in these housing starved markets. So while 2025 will be similar to 2024 in terms of established market units delivered that are competitive with our properties, overall supply levels continue to be manageable. While there continues to be a lot of conversation about declines in Sunbelt starts, we think it is at least is notable that 2024 competitive starts in our coastal footprint were about half of normal levels with 2025 starts likely to be similarly restrained. In fact, as a percentage of existing inventory, total starts in our established markets in 2024, we're at rock bottom levels last seen just after the great financial crisis. As a result, we see 2026 total deliveries in our coastal markets, around 30% lower than the pre-pandemic average.\nIn sum, the supply versus demand setup is good in our coastal markets now and will likely trend even better later this year and into 2026. Turning to our expansion markets of Atlanta, Austin, Dallas and Denver, where we have about 10% of our net NOI. We expect 2025 deliveries to be lower than in 2024, but still at an elevated level. We also expect that in 2025, these markets will still be working off the supply delivered in 2024.\nOverall, demand remains good in our expansion markets and these high job growth markets will eventually absorb the current and incoming supply, but it will take some time to do so in progress, we think will be uneven. In a moment, Michael will go over what we are currently seeing in these markets. When we apply all this to our capital allocation strategy, it confirms to us again the wisdom of having a strategically diversified portfolio. Our goal is to own an apartment portfolio that has the highest long-term total return in the sector with a focus on cash flow growth, taking into account risk and minimizing volatility. We are achieving this goal by catering to well-earning renters in the 12 or so metro areas that we think have the most desirable lifestyles for this demographic. And present the best balance of long-term demand, supply, regulatory and resiliency opportunities and risks and where we can efficiently operate our properties with our industry-leading people and systems. We made substantial progress towards our goal of having 20% of our NOI in our expansion markets by investing almost $2 billion in acquisitions and delivered development projects in these markets during 2024, while disposing of about $1 billion of older assets located entirely in our coastal markets.\nOur portfolios in the expansion markets feature newer, well-located properties with a healthy balance between suburban and urban. We have given guidance for $1.5 billion of acquisitions and $1 billion of dispositions in 2025. As you can see, we expect from the bulk of our acquisition activity using proceeds from dispos. We are also assuming in our guidance that we will be a net acquirer and that we will fund that acquisition activity using debt. You should expect material net acquisition activity only if, like in 2024, where we acquired using debt, the numbers support that activity. Currently, transaction activity is very light. Assuming market volatility abates, we would hope that activity would pick up. Alec Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, is here in the Q&A period to add color.\nFinally, I wish to thank Barry Altshuler, our regulatory affairs guru and others across the rental housing industry for doing an outstanding job advocating for pro housing solution like less regulation and better public private partnerships to encourage more supply and against anti-housing ideas like rent control. We had great success in California and across the country last quarter. Equity Residential will continue to be a leader with its industry partners and advancing pro housing policies. While political risk remains in our markets, we have definitively seen the tie turn towards more thoughtful housing policies. And a focus on quality of life and public safety in our central cities.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis.\n\nMichael L. Manelis\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review our fourth quarter 2024 operating performance and our operating outlook for 2025. In addition to our earnings release published last night, we've also published a detailed management presentation that provides additional color on the drivers of our guidance that I will refer to. We ended the year with continued healthy fundamentals and solid demand from a well-employed renter population, which drove strong occupancy of 96.1% and a blended rate growth of 1% both of which met our forecast for the quarter. I'd also like to highlight that our fourth quarter turnover was just 9%, bringing our full year turnover to 42.5%, which is the lowest we have reported in our 30-year history as a public company.\nThis clearly demonstrates our success in creating remarkable resident experiences and reflects the favorable supply [ gain ] dynamics in our portfolio. On the expense side, for the full year, we have kept growth in same-store operating expenses below 3% with a special call out to the relatively flat payroll growth and 2% growth in repairs and maintenance including a 5.5% reduction in turnover expense. This again highlights our ability to share resources across properties and minimize reliance on outsourced labor. We are pleased to report that 2/3 of our properties have a shared resource model in place, and we're excited about the additional opportunities that further automation and centralization provide.\nMoving to 2025. Our same-store revenue growth guidance range is 2.25% to 3.25%, with an expense rate growth range of 3.5% to 4.5%. Bob will provide color on the expense guidance in a moment, but let me focus your attention on the building blocks for revenue growth as detailed on Page 6 of the management presentation. Our revenue midpoint assumes the following: we start with embedded growth of 80 basis points in 2025, this is 40 basis points lower than our starting point in 2024 and at the lower end of the historical averages, but the gap is largely expected to be made up through stronger leasing activity during 2025. That strong leasing activity will be driven by continued strength in overall demand from better job growth forecasted in our markets and very manageable levels of competitive new supply particularly in our established markets, which are 90% of the total portfolio.\nThis is expected to yield blended rate growth between 2% and 3% for the full year which is about 60 basis points better than what we delivered for the full year [ 2024 ], with a good portion of that improvement coming from the recovery of some of our West Coast markets that I will discuss later. We also expect continued strong resident retention as a result of both the benefits of a centralized renewal process, our enhanced data and analytics insights and the high cost and low availability of owned housing in our markets. As I said earlier, turnover in the portfolio remains the lowest that we have seen in the history of our company, and we expect that trend to continue in 2025. This leads to approximately 3% residential same-store revenue growth, which is identical to 2024, which is then partially offset by declines in nonresidential same-store revenue to get to the 2.75% midpoint of our guidance range, as described on Page 6 of the management presentation.\nOccupancy should hold at levels similar to last year, which at that strength will allow us to capture rate. Operating results will also benefit from our continued execution on innovation initiatives with the majority of it running through the other income line. This year, we will be focusing on our analytical efforts with data-driven pricing and retention strategies, expanding automation to drive additional operating efficiencies and all the while endeavoring to ensure that we provide a great customer experience. In 2025, we expect about 70 basis points or nearly $20 million in other income growth with a large majority of it coming from initiatives that we have discussed in the past and the further rollout of our Internet connectivity and technology programs. Bob will walk through the associated expenses with that, but net-net, these will be additive to earnings overall. In terms of the overall market performance, Seattle and DC should lead the pack with same-store revenue growth of approximately 4% and New York and San Francisco will follow very closely behind.\nWhile we did include some further recovery in downtown Seattle and San Francisco in our guidance, both markets have the potential to outperform if we get more robust pricing power early in the year. And our expansion markets, which reflect only 10% of the total company NOI, we expect to produce negative same-store revenue growth given the impact of elevated, albeit declining levels of supply that need to work through the system. As we look at the individual markets, let's start with Los Angeles, where I would like to echo Mark's comments with tremendous gratitude to our amazing team in this market. Our guidance does not assume potential operational impacts in either revenues or in terms of cleanup expenses from the fires that I will discuss in a moment. Here's what we have included. So first, the market will see more supply than it did in 2024, but we expect the impact on our portfolio to be manageable and consistent with last year, with the Mid-Wilshire, Koreatown submarket fueling the most competitive pressure followed by the San Fernando Valley, which will see an increase, but without significant impact to us.\nOur guidance assumes that the market will continue to work through delinquency and bad debt issues, which will contribute to additional revenue growth. As I'll discuss in a moment, depending on the regulatory actions taken in L.A., this improvement may happen more slowly than what is now assumed in our guidance. Physical occupancy and pricing trends started improving late last year, and we modeled a continued pace of improvement, which results in our full year same-store market revenue projection for L.A. to be around 3%, but again, this may be impacted by any regulatory limits put in place in response to the fires, which brings us to the potential impact from the virus. While there has been a lot of speculation, we believe it is still too early to understand the full impact on operations.\nThere will likely be more demand in the market as fire impacted residents seek new accommodations, especially in the 2- and 3-bedroom units which comprise about 45% of our L.A. portfolio, which we have already seen in certain submarkets. There will also likely be cleanup expenses the company incurs from the fires and various governmental actions that could negatively impact our operations. There are also likely to be twist and turns in the recovery process and governmental response. For now, we feel like the base case we outlined is our best assumption. We'll keep you posted on what happens here and anticipate that we'll have a better color on our first quarter call in April. Staying on the West Coast, San Diego and Orange County were some of the better performers last year. In 2025, we expect that these markets will continue to see good demand.\nJob growth in both markets is expected to exceed 2024 levels, and there is a general lack of housing. High homeownership costs make renting in these markets the most attractive option. Both markets are expected to see slightly more competitive new supply in 2025. But overall, we would expect good performance here. In San Francisco, we are optimistic about the [ new oral ] administration and its commitment to improving the quality of life in the city. Job growth expectations continue to improve, and demand in the downtown and Peninsula submarkets are strong which should lead to additional pricing power in 2025. As I mentioned a moment ago, we have modeled some improvement in the operating conditions for the overall market of San Francisco with growth primarily coming from both the Peninsula and downtown submarkets. A more robust recovery is certainly possible as demand and pricing improved early enough in the year. Currently, concession use remains elevated in the San Francisco market, especially in the downtown submarket but overall improved significantly in 2024. We expect with improving occupancy, we will begin to see net effective pricing improvements in the market as rents and occupancy are increasing, which will most likely lead to a further pullback in concessions if these occupancy gains hold.\nNew supply forecast for 2025 in San Francisco is very similar to 2024 quantities with almost no supply in downtown San Francisco and most of it concentrated in the South Bay, where absorption has been strong. We also are feeling really good about Seattle in 2025. Despite heightened pockets of supply, particularly in the Urban Core and Redmond, some margin, we finished '24 in a strong position and look to have increasing pricing power resulting from continued demand as employers like Amazon bring their teams back to the office and supply begins to abate in the second half of this year. Quality of life issues in the city continue to improve, and the city has a bounce in its step after a pretty good stretch in the doldrums. Competitive deliveries with our portfolio peaked in the fourth quarter of 2024, and our pricing power held up during a period of time when it normally declines. We expect Seattle to be one of our strongest revenue growth markets in 2025.\nMoving to the East Coast starting in Boston. With high occupancy and limited new competitive supply, this market should perform low in 2025. The market is supported by a strong employment base in finance, tech, life sciences, health and education. Overall, new deliveries will be about the same in 2025 as last year, but the majority of the deliveries will be in the suburbs, which bodes well for us, given 70% of our assets are located in the Urban Core Boston. Our urban assets outperformed suburban ones in '24, and we expect that spread will be even greater in 2025. New York was a top performer in '24, and we expect that to continue in 2025. The employment base is strong, market occupancy is high, and there's almost no new competitive supply being delivered in Manhattan, where we have the majority of our portfolio. Washington, D.C. was our top performer last year, and our expectations remain high for 2025.\nThe absorption here has been very impressive, considering that the market has been delivering more than 10,000 units a year and will do so again in 2025. We're almost 97% occupied in the market, which is a good start to the year. And the wild color here is what impact the new administration and its focus on both cost cutting and a return to office policy for federal employees will have on the local job market. In the expansion markets, our long-term outlook remains positive as we expect to continue to see higher-than-average job growth in those metro areas. But our near-term operating environment is challenging. We have seen stability in new lease rates and occupancy in Atlanta and Dallas the last 2 months. And while volatility is possible, we currently expect that new lease rates will improve as they usually do in the busy -- spring leasing season in these markets. In Denver, conditions today are challenging as we have some new deals in close proximity to our assets that could push the improvement later in the year.\nEven with these hope for improvements in operating conditions, we expect same-store revenue in our expansion markets to be lower in 2025 than it was in 2024. Looking at the overall company level as we sit here today, we really like our position. We're looking forward to capturing the opportunities the spring leasing season brings, which will help frame pricing power for the full year. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to our residents and focus on delivering these results.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Bob to walk through the rest of our guidance expectations for 2025.\n\nRobert A. Garechana\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Michael. With Michael having just walked through 2025 same-store revenue expectations, let me finish with same-store expenses, normalized FFO and provide some color on anticipated capital markets activity for 2025. Turning to expenses. Expense management remains a core strength of EQR as demonstrated over the years and during 2024. Our 2025 guidance of 3.5% to 4.5% implies somewhat higher growth in 2025 than 2024, as outlined on Page 6 of the management presentation, but still reflects that strength. As you can see, the incremental growth in expenses are stemming from a couple of items. First, connectivity expenses are adding approximately $5 million to expense growth as we deploy bulk WiFi in the portfolio.\nAs Michael mentioned, they are also adding revenue, so we will be accretive to NOI for the full year. Second, we have another Europe 421-a tax abatement step-ups in the New York portfolio. We're down to only a handful of properties and step-up with most nearing the end of the period. As we have mentioned in the past, once fully taxed, there is an incremental income opportunity as affordable units convert to market rate in the future. Beyond those 2 items, same-store expense growth will look relatively similar to 2024, but with a little incremental growth from utilities and payroll given the low growth in 2024, setting up a tough comparable period. Moving to NFFO. Page 8 provides some narrative around NFFO contributors outside of same store, along with a bridge to the midpoint of our guidance range. This bridge can also be found in the earnings release. Beyond residential same-store NOI, let me provide some color around a couple of the larger categories.\nFirst, transaction NOI. The majority of this contribution is coming from 2024 transaction activity and our buys themselves last year. There is some impact from our assumptions in 2025. But as Mark mentioned, this will be contingent upon what market conditions look like, so that could change. Second, interest expense. The majority of the increase in interest expense is coming from increases in anticipated balances from investment activity, mostly acquisitions, with about $0.01 of the increase also coming from refinancing of our 2025 maturity and what we expect to be a higher rate. More about that in a second.\nAnd finally, lease-up NOI. The $0.01 contribution from lease-up NOI is coming from our few consolidated lease-ups. The majority of our lease-ups are from unconsolidated ventures in our expansion markets that are encumbered with project-level debt and the net income from those projects runs through the income from investments in unconsolidated entities line. 4 of these unconsolidated JV development deals were completed late in 2024 and will be leasing up throughout the year. Given current leasing velocity and the cessation of capitalized interest on loans, we do not expect these joint venture assets to contribute to NFFO growth in 2025. We've added specific guidance on this income to the guidance page of the earnings release.\nFinally, let me briefly mention our anticipated capital markets activity for 2025. We have won significant maturity, which is a $450 million, 3.375% note due in June of this year. We would expect to refinance this note at or near the maturity, most likely with unsecured debt. We have ample liquidity and capacity under our recently expanded commercial paper program to float this pay off and be opportunistic about when exactly we refinance the maturity. All other financing activities will be dependent upon transaction activity and conditions, as Mark mentioned. Our guidance assumes $500 million to $1 billion of debt issuance because we modeled being a net acquirer of $500 million in our guidance. Expected that issuance, however, will adjust as that adjusts.\nWith that, let me turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A."

    "content": "Q2 2024 Equity Residential Earnings Call\n\nQ2 2024 Equity Residential Earnings Call\n\nEQRNYSEJUL 30, 11:00 AM\n\nOperator\n\nGood day, and welcome to the Equity Residential Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.\n\nMartin J. McKenna\n\nFirst VP of Investor & Public Relations, Equity Residential\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's Second Quarter 2024 Results.

Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\n\nMark J. Parrell\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Trustee, Equity Residential\n\nThank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I will start us off, and then Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, will discuss our second quarter 2024 revenue results and outlook as well as give some recent highlights from what we call our property operations innovation machine. And then Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our expense results and updated normalized funds from operations guidance, and then we'll take your questions.\nLooking at our quarterly results. Same-store revenues increased 2.9%, and same-store expenses rose only 2.7%, which led to same-store NOI growth of 3% and an increase in our NFFO per share of 3.2%. So far this year, our revenue performance has exceeded expectations as steady demand across all of our markets has met limited supply in our coastal established markets. As a reminder, approximately 94% of our NOI comes from our coastal established markets. Michael will get into the details shortly, but the Northeastern markets of Boston, New York and Washington, D.C. as well as Seattle are standouts relative to our expectations back in January. Our expansion markets of Atlanta, Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth and Denver, which together constitutes 6% of our NOI, continue to have good demand but remain under pressure from continuing high levels of supply, with our Atlanta and Austin portfolios most impacted. Putting all of this in a blender, this led us to increase our same-store revenue guidance by 70 basis points at the midpoint to 3.2%.\nUnderlying these positive results and outlook are several trends that continue to support rental housing performance, including high homeownership costs, limited for-sale inventory and a steady though moderating employment picture. We continue to see high levels of retention among our residents due to elevated homeownership costs, with homeownership [ processing ] record levels last month, making rental housing a good value alternative. We also see a [ deployment ] picture in our target higher-earning renter demographic leading to sustained good levels of demand. In the second quarter, we saw a continuation of total employment growth across nearly all of our markets.\nDrilling down the office using employment, we saw a return to positive growth in Q2 for the first time in several quarters, with strong numbers posted by Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Atlanta. And of course, lifestyle factors like delayed marriage and childbearing, which we've talked about on prior calls, continue to be a positive factor. The expense side of the equation is similarly positive news as we continue to utilize our sector-leading innovation machine to drive improvements in both our cost structure and our resident service experience. Lowered the same-store expense midpoint of our annual guidance by a full percentage point to 3%, leading to a new same-store NOI guidance midpoint of 3.5% for the year, which is 145 basis points better than our prior midpoint.\nMy appreciation to all my outstanding on-site and corporate colleagues, their hard work and dedication to our customers and to supporting each other. Switching to capital allocation. We're seeing more transaction activity as the interest rate climate stabilizes and sellers and buyers cap rate expectations coalesce around 5%. Transaction volumes in our markets in the second quarter of 2024 was almost triple what it was in the first quarter and double what it was in the second quarter of 2023. As you saw in our release, during the second quarter, we acquired 1 property in suburban Boston. And subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired a property in Atlanta and 1 in Dallas. Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, is here to answer your specific questions in a moment. But generally speaking, we are buying recently built properties in our expansion markets at a basis that compares well to replacement cost and underwriting a 5% forward cap rate with our pro forma assuming further degradation of rents, but also assuming the benefits in year 1 of our more focused delinquency and vacancy management processes. In year 2 as we get the acquired properties fully integrated into our superior operating platform, we are assuming that we can [ pod ] the acquired properties with our other nearby properties as we obtain scale in these markets and efficiently ship employees across properties as we do in our coastal established markets.\nWhile we acknowledge that current rent levels are weak in these expansion markets and likely to remain so in the near term, in the longer term, we see relief on the way that starts in these oversupplied markets have collapsed, and deliveries in 2026 and in 2027 are likely to be much lower than both current levels and historical levels. These expected lower supply levels underpin our property acquisition underwriting in outer years where we expect a significant rental rate recovery. We are excited to acquire these properties at a basis that we see as highly favorable and add properties with strong cash flow growth prospects once supply levels normalize in a few years. The entire Equity team also looks forward to demonstrating our core competencies of smartly acquiring and efficiently integrating new acquisitions. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis.\n\nMichael L. Manelis\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review our second quarter 2024 operating performance as well as provide some highlights of our increased same-store operating guidance. As you saw in our release, our overall operating fundamentals remain healthy, driven by good demand across our portfolio and a strong renewal process that resulted in low resident turnover and strong occupancy of 96.4% for the quarter. As Mark mentioned, we are benefiting from what we see as a solid job picture across the country keeping our residents well employed with growing wages as well as very little competitive new supply in our established markets.\nThe rent-to-income ratio on new move-ins during the quarter remained stable at around 20%. Not surprisingly, we are also benefiting from a very low percent of our residents moving out to buy homes. About 7.5% of our move-outs gave bought home as the reason. This is the lowest number we have seen in any given quarter. That, along with the benefits of our centralized renewal process, has made our year-to-date results on renewals, both in terms of the volume of residents renewing and the achieved renewal rate increases, a key driver to our outperformance.\nAs has been the case for a while now, our East Coast markets are the best performers with occupancies around 97%. On the West Coast, Seattle is performing particularly well, and San Francisco is showing improvement but not quite at the pace of Seattle. Our Southern California markets have good demand but are feeling some pressure on pricing. In our expansion markets, we continue to feel the impact of new supply as expected, but have been able to maintain occupancy at or above 95% given the strong demand in those markets. Overall, we continue to see improvements in the eviction process times as the court systems work through their backlogs and the number of long-standing delinquent residents continue to decline. This trend continues to support our view that we will see overall improvement in bad debt net contribute 30 basis points to our same-store revenue for the full year.\nGiven all of these trends, we have revised our full year same-store revenue guidance midpoint to 3.2%, which includes an assumption of seasonal moderation in both new lease and renewals and a normal decline in occupancy later in the year. Now a little more color on the individual [indiscernible] our expectations, which assumed that it would be 1 of our best markets in 2024. Occupancy is holding strong amidst the highly seasonal summer leasing months as compared to past years when we often saw a declining occupancy as residents churned in and out more frequently. Overall, strong retention in the second quarter, along with continued new lease growth, has positioned us well as we finish the primary leasing season.\nWe are seeing good performance in both our urban and suburban portfolios here, but the urban portfolio produced stronger results in the quarter. The market has a stable employment picture and little new competitive supply being delivered in 2024. New York continues to perform very well. We think this market probably has the best supply-demand dynamics in the country for the next couple of years. We're over 97% occupied, with both new leases and renewals coming in better than expected. Overall, the economy in New York feels healthy with a solid and increasingly diversified employment base. In fact, the private sector employment in New York is at an all-time high. All indications are that this market will continue to show strength through the remainder of the leasing season.\nWashington, D.C. continues to be a real standout performer for us in 2024. The market is over 97% occupied and showing great rental rate growth. Demand feels good across all of our submarkets, and we expect this to continue, but we will be keeping an eye on new supply deliveries in the back half of the year as we have felt isolated periods of pressure in the central D.C. submarket. In Los Angeles, a generally stable employment picture is leading to good demand in the market. Traffic and applications are up, and our second quarter occupancy, while slightly below where we wanted it to be, is up 70 basis points from the second quarter of 2023. During the quarter, our new lease change was negatively impacted by some concentrated new supply in Hollywood [ Mid-Wilshire ] as well as some shadow supply coming into the market in downtown and West L.A. submarkets from evictions. Our suburban deals in Ventura and Santa Clarita, which did not experience this, are leading the pack. We are already seeing marked improvement to the new lease change in the third quarter, but we expect this stat to continue to be volatile as the market works through filling these units, which remains a catalyst to our revenue growth.\nRounding out the rest of Southern California, San Diego and Orange County are continuing to see good demand, but we are seeing some price sensitivity with residents willing to move further out in these markets for affordability reasons. Now for the markets that may be of most interest, San Francisco, Seattle and our expansion markets of Dallas-Fort Worth, Denver, Atlanta and Austin. San Francisco and Seattle continued to perform better than expected, with Seattle outperforming the most. Remember that we entered the year with relatively modest expectations and the potential for upside in both of these markets.\nIn San Francisco, demand feels good right now, and we are seeing some of the best weeks in terms of traffic and application volume. We continue to see really positive signs in the downtown submarket in regards to the quality of life issues. Property crime is down, and the city's nightlife scene is thriving. Recent reports that Salesforce is pushing harder on return to office should have a positive impact on the city. Looking forward, there is little new supply coming to the market. Overall starts are way down, and there have been no new starts of competitive products for the last 3 quarters, which supports improving conditions for the next couple of years.\nAs I mentioned earlier, Seattle is really showing signs of recovery. Occupancy is 96.2%. Our renewal performance remained strong. We're feeling good about both the quality of life issues in the market as well as tractions in places like South Lake Union from the return to office at companies like Amazon. The tech employment here looks solid as we see more postings for positions in both the city of Seattle and the Bellevue, Redmond area. And looking at our migration patterns, we are also seeing more people come to us from the farther out suburbs, which is an additional demand driver to our assets. Also, we expect our large concentration of properties in Central Seattle to benefit from a newly completed $800 million infrastructure project that better connects Downtown to the waterfront and created a spectacular new park for our residents to enjoy. We are excited to join in the effort to enhance Downtown Seattle with our newly completed $8 million improvement of the [ Staircase Plaza ] at our 761-unit Harbor Steps Apartments. Our steps and the associated new retail there are another way to connect the city down to the newly activated waterfront park. At this point, the Seattle market is positioned to do well, but there is supply coming later this year, and we need to see if the demand and pricing holds through the third quarter.\nSwitching to the expansion markets. There's really no surprises here. We continue to see demand, but it's a challenging operating environment for both new leases and retention given the amount of new supply. Right now, the pressure on new leases makes renewing residents the #1 priority in these markets. Overall, the expansion markets are performing in line with our expectations, with Dallas and Denver leading the way. Looking forward, we're excited to grow our portfolio and create operating scale in these markets that continue to demonstrate long-term demand from our target affluent renter demographic.\nAnd finally, on the innovation front. This past quarter, we began testing a new AI resident assistant that we anticipate could handle 75% of general resident inquiries, including the ability to help residents triage basic service requests and then automatically submit those that require a visit from our service members. In addition, we continue to see promising results with a self-guided tour experience app that increases tour availability to meet the needs of our prospects. We are very excited about these initiatives as they will continue to create future operating efficiencies while providing a more seamless customer experience. I want to give a shout out to our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to innovation, enhancing customer service and their exceptional disciplined approach to expense management. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert A. Garechana\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Michael. Mark and Michael went over the drivers of our 70 basis point improvement in same-store revenue at the midpoint. So I'll focus on our revisions to same-store expense and NOI guidance, along with normalized FFO.\nTurning to same-store expenses. Expense management continues to be a core competency for the team. Our revision reflects this with a 100 basis point reduction at the midpoint, which is now below the low end of our prior range. This reduction reflects really solid year-to-date performance driven by 3 major categories: repairs and maintenance, payroll and utilities. These categories make up about half of our same-store expenses, and all 3 have growth that is either flat or negative year-to-date. While we expect growth to accelerate in the second half of this year given more challenging 2023 comparisons, we still anticipate delivering very low growth of around 3% for the full year. This is yet again a reflection of the value in our platform from harnessing innovation, technology and efficiency to deliver outstanding results and attribute to our capable team.\nWith these revenue and expense improvements, we are increasing our same-store NOI growth outlook and now expect same-store operating margin expansion for the full year, something of a rarity in the apartment sector today. This NOI growth is the main driver of our $0.04 or 100 basis point improvement to NFFO growth reflected at the midpoint of our guidance. Page 2 of the release provides a detailed reconciliation of our revised NFFO guidance for your reference.\nOne final note before I turn it over to the operator. This quarter, we enhanced our capital expenditure disclosure with the intent of providing stakeholders better insight into the value-enhancing CapEx activities we undertake. In 2024, these activities primarily consist of unit renovations, technology spend and sustainability initiatives that are discretionary and provide positive return on investments through enhanced revenue growth, additional income or reduced expenses. These projects are often some of the best risk-adjusted returns we can make. With this new disclosure, we also believe that we are presenting our CapEx spend more in line with our industry peers. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator."

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.\n\nMartin J. McKenna\n\nFirst VP of Investor & Public Relations, Equity Residential\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's first quarter 2024 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer. Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, are here with us as well for the Q&A.\nOur earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com.\nPlease be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.\nNow I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\n\nMark J. Parrell\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Trustee, Equity Residential\n\nThank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2024 results and outlook for the year. I will start us off, then Michael Manelis, our COO, will speak to our operating performance and how we see 2024 operations playing out. And then we will take your questions.\nWe are pleased with our first quarter performance, which was ahead of January expectations and reflects the strong demand for the lifestyle [indiscernible] provide as well as little new competitive supply across most of our established markets. Our same-store revenues increased 4.1% in the quarter, and our same-store expenses rose only 1.3%, which led to same-store NOI growth of 5.5% and an increase in our NFFO per share of 6.9%. So overall, a very solid start to the year across all categories, with the company well positioned to capture increasing seasonal demand as we head into our prime leasing season.\nAs is our practice, we have not revised our operating or FFO guidance, and we'll make adjustments as we get deeper into our primary leasing season.\nDigging under the hood a bit, the durability of the employment picture for our target affluent renter demographic is a continuing bright spot in our business, as is the cost of owned housing. Unemployment for the college educated, a very sizable percentage of our residents, remains at around 2%, considerably lower than the overall average, supporting demand. This demographic, which is well employed in the growth engines of our economy, including technology, financial services and other professional and business services, continues to grow in both our established and expansion markets.\nWe also see a little competition from owned housing as the high cost of homes, combined with elevated financing costs and rapidly rising insurance, real estate tax and maintenance costs combine to make rental housing a very attractive option for many people. Social factors that we've discussed on prior calls like smaller households and delayed marriage and childbearing add to the attractiveness of rental housing.\nIn the quarter just ended, the percentage of our residents leaving us to buy homes was 7.8%, a continuation of all-time lows. Strong demand and high single-family housing costs are consistent conditions across both our coastal established markets that represent 95% of our company's NOI and our new expansion markets of Dallas-Fort Worth, Atlanta, Denver and Austin, that collectively represent 5% of our NOI.\nBut on the apartment supply side, we see 2 very different pictures playing out in our established coastal markets versus our expansion markets. With the exception of Seattle and Central D.C. in our established coastal markets, we see the terrific demand I just mentioned being met with generally little new supply, leading to solid rent growth. Across our 4 expansion markets, we see robust demand as well, but it is being met by an overwhelming wave of new supply, leading to declining rent levels, high concessions and occupancy pressure. We expect this pressure to accelerate as units continue to deliver in these oversupplied markets, especially once the prime leasing season concludes and demand seasonally declines.\nSwitching to expenses, Michael is going to go over all that with you in a moment. But I wanted to take a second to thank our teams across the company for their amazing work on expense management. We are very pleased to have produced a sector-leading 3.1% average growth rate of same-store expenses over the last 5 years. Our teams have embraced innovation and a customer service mindset and are not afraid of change, and it shows in these numbers. Well done, team.\nOn the investment side, we are seeing properties that we would be interested in acquiring, well-located newer properties in our expansion markets in the suburbs of Seattle and Boston trade at high prices and in very low volume compared to prepandemic levels. Investment sales activity in the first quarter was over 60% below average prepandemic levels. Estimates from my colleagues who attended the recent ULI conference indicate that there is over $200 billion of dry powder looking to invest in North American real estate, with a significant portion focused on apartments. Recent data points from the pending AIRC transaction and apartment portfolio and one-off deals are similarly supportive of much higher values than the public market is currently suggesting.\nWhile this is a huge positive signal about the underlying value of our company, it has slowed our portfolio rebalancing efforts. And while pricing in most of the apartment transaction market is strong, buyer interest is not yet fully evident for some of the large urban West Coast assets that we want to dispose of as part of our strategic rebalancing. We expect that to change as these submarkets continue to show improved operations and better quality of life conditions.\nIn the meantime, with the lack of actionable acquisition opportunities, we saw value in our own stock. So we continue to strategically deploy disposition proceeds from the sale of older inferior properties in our portfolio into repurchases of our stock. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $38.5 million of our own common shares at a weighted average share price of about $59 per share. Since we began this activity in the fourth quarter of 2023, we have repurchased approximately $87.5 million of our shares and what we see as an attractive valuation level of a bit below $58 per share. We are using the remaining disposition dollars to drive down our already low leverage, which will create more internal debt dry powder for when opportunities do emerge.\nWe are going to continue to be disciplined in our transaction activities with a focus on growing cash flow over the long term.\nWith regard to external growth, we are on track to deliver 6 newly completed joint venture developments in 2024. These 6 properties, 3 located in Dallas-Fort Worth, 2 located in Denver and 1 located in suburban New York, will be delivered at a weighted average stabilized yield north of 6% and will contribute meaningfully to our normalized FFO starting in 2025 given their completion and lease-up timing. The 3 Dallas-Fort Worth developments are the first completed projects to come out of our partnership with Toll Brothers. With some of the other Equity Residential executives, I recently visited all 6 of these development projects, and I'm inspired by the enthusiasm on display from our lease-up teams and excited about adding these high-quality assets to our portfolio.\nBefore I turn it over to Michael, I wanted to make a quick comment on the new housing laws that were passed over the weekend in New York, though I know we are still digesting the law and its implications. The law allows for renewal increases of CPI plus 5% up to 10%, and provides for vacancy decontrol on the types of units we generally own in New York, which allows rents to move to market when a new resident moves in, and that's similar to the rent laws that were passed a few years ago in California.\nOverall, new price controls on an already undersupplied good, in this case, rental housing, is not an effective way to attract private capital to help solve the housing supply problem in New York State. However, there are also tax incentives in the new law for new rental construction subject to a new higher wage scale required for labor on larger buildings as well as permanent affordability rules. There are also some language on zoning reforms and some rules that aim to make office-to-residential conversions easier.\nWhile the rent control provisions are not helpful, we commend the governor and the legislature for focusing on a supply-based solution similar to recent legislation passed in such politically disparate states as Florida and California. We think focusing on supply, not heavy-handed regulation, has been recognized on both sides of the aisle as the long-term solution. While the new law adds to the complexity of operating in New York, a good portion of our portfolio in New York City is exempt either due to being built during or after 2009 or meeting the luxury exemption thresholds. We'll be happy to discuss all this further in Q&A.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis.\n\nMichael L. Manelis\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review our first quarter 2024 operating performance and our positioning as we start the leasing season.\nWe're off to a very good start thus far. As Mark mentioned, demand remains good across all of our markets, supported by a continuing solid job market and high employment in our affluent renter target demographic. One of the real highlights of the quarter was our turnover, which is the lowest we have ever seen. Our focus on customer satisfaction, harnessing data and leveraging our centralized renewal team to drive results is definitely having an impact here.\nIn the first quarter, we renewed more than 61% of our residents, which is one of the highest percentages that we have seen. A special shout-out to New York, Boston and Seattle, who set their own high marks and greatly contributed to this result.\nOur first quarter same-store revenue growth exceeded our original expectations, including very good performance in San Francisco and Seattle, which I will discuss in a moment. This positions us very well for the year, but we acknowledge that this is just the beginning of a critical primary leasing season. Our efforts to build occupancy in the fourth quarter of 2023, coupled with continued strong demand and high resident retention, have resulted in both slightly above average rent growth since the beginning of the year and a 50 basis point quarterly sequential gain in physical occupancy.\nAt 96.5% occupied this month, which is one of our highest reported occupancies in April, we have a lot of confidence that we will be able to continue to grow rates through the leasing season. The high percentage of residents renewing that I previously mentioned is also a big factor in this strength.\nIn terms of market same-store revenue growth, the East Coast markets in Southern California are producing leading growth, as we expected, with San Francisco, Seattle and the expansion markets following in that order. As we think about these markets performance relative to our expectations, New York and Washington, D.C. are running ahead of expectations, while Boston and Southern California and the expansion markets are in line. San Francisco and Seattle are also running ahead, but remember, these markets have been historically volatile. So we remain cautiously optimistic that we will hold on to the gains in these markets for the remainder of the year.\nNow a little more color on the individual markets before closing out with expenses and commentary in other income and initiatives. Starting in Boston, year-to-date revenue performance is in line with the expectations. City of Boston is currently 97% occupied and we have very little competitive supply to deal with. Concession use is little to none in this market. And overall, we continue to expect Boston to deliver some of the best full year revenue growth in the portfolio.\nAs I mentioned, New York is performing well, with both strong demand and pricing power. The market is over 97% occupied and has very little competitive new supply. So far, we seem to have moved past the rent fatigue we saw in the market in late 2023 and expect good things from this market in '24.\nHats off to Washington, D.C. as this market is outperforming our revenue growth expectations even after a strong 2023. We're benefiting from a very solid employment picture here, particularly in the defense sector which is driving consistent, stable, high occupancy and real strength in our retention. We see good results across the whole market, but The District has recently begun lagging our suburban assets, likely due to nearby supply. Overall, we still expect Washington, D.C. to deliver a good amount of new supply in 2024 with nearly 13,000 competitive units. So we do anticipate the pressure to continue to grow as the year progresses.\nIn Los Angeles, we see good demand, but not a lot of pricing power at the moment, due to the additional units being brought back to the market through the eviction process. Our portfolio is 96% occupied, and we continue to make progress on the delinquency and bad debt situation, which should be a tailwind for growth in 2024. Time frames for processing evictions have recently improved from 9 months to 6 months, which should help us make more progress going forward. But they still do remain nearly twice as long as they used to be. That being said, we are very encouraged by the recent improvement.\nRounding out the rest of Southern California, San Diego and Orange County are continuing to be very strong performers. The general lack of housing is keeping occupancies high. Home ownership costs are also high here, which makes renting in these markets the more attractive option. San Diego will see more competitive new supply in 2024, while Orange County will see similar amounts to last year, with limited pressure at a few of our Irvine locations.\nNow for the markets that may be of most interest: San Francisco, Seattle and the expansion markets of Dallas-Fort Worth, Denver, Atlanta and Austin. For the 2 West Coast markets, remember that we entered the year with relatively modest expectations but potential for upside. So far both markets are doing better than we expected, but it's early and both remain show-me stories as we saw periods of stability and pullback in 2023.\nIn San Francisco, we are well occupied but would like to see continued improvements in pricing power. The South Bay, East Bay and Peninsula continue to perform better than our Downtown portfolio. The situation here remains the same as the market lacks the catalysts, either job growth or more robust return-to-office policies, to create true pricing power. Concessions remain prevalent in the Downtown submarket, but are being issued at a lower rate than they were in the fourth quarter, consistent with what you would seasonally expect.\nIn Seattle, we carried strength from December into the early part of the year, leading to improved occupancy and the ability to move up rental rates, which is evident in our new lease growth for the quarter. That being said, we do expect a fear amount of competitive new supply in the market in 2024, which could temper growth.\nThe East Side is performing better than the City of Seattle, and our Redmond assets are performing very well despite having some direct pressure from a new lease-ups. Overall, the downtowns of both markets are showing real improvement in the quality of life, and the local political situation continues to get much more constructive as a focus on bringing these cities back to the thriving environments they were prior to the pandemic remains front and center with both policymakers and citizens. Recent primary elections in San Francisco were very encouraging as voters supported candidates who are focused on addressing safety and the quality-of-life challenges.\nFinally, some commentary on our expansion markets. Strong demand and a favorable regulatory environment continue to confirm our positive long-term outlook for these markets. Unfortunately, however, in the near term, we are seeing the pressures from high levels of new supply being delivered in 2024. Market occupancies are lower than our established markets and concessions are prevalent. So far, concession usage at stabilized asset properties in Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth and Denver are running at about 30% of applicants, getting about 4 to 6 weeks. And in Austin, it's 60% of applicants getting about 6 weeks.\nOperating conditions are challenging across all of these markets, but Dallas appears to be more resilient, followed by Denver, Atlanta and then Austin. The job growth numbers in both Austin and Dallas are some of the highest in the country, which is clearly aiding in the absorption of some of the new supply. But the volume of deliveries is high and going to continue to grow throughout the year.\nWith regards to bad debt and delinquency, the first quarter results were in line with our expectations. As I mentioned, we continue to see improvements in the time it is taking to process evictions in L.A., which is where the majority of our delinquent residents are, which is resulting in a decrease in the number of long-standing delinquent residents that we have. This is an encouraging sign and continues to support our view that we will see overall improvement in bad debt net contribute 30 basis points to our same-store revenue for the full year.\nNow let me hit on some highlights on expenses. Our 1.3% growth in the quarter was better than expected and driven by a decrease in both utilities and repairs and maintenance, coupled with pretty flat on-site payroll expense growth. On the utility expense, we primarily benefited from lower commodity pricing. We also intend to take advantage of federal and local incentive programs to continue to accelerate our sustainability efforts and moderate future utility growth. For example, we have 26 future solar installations planned, in addition to our 55 active systems, which will help reduce our future overall assumption.\nOur repairs and maintenance expense decrease was driven primarily by lower turnover costs and, to a lesser degree, maintenance expense, which was unusually elevated in the prior year. Once again, our disciplined approach to expense management has continued to pay off.\nOn the innovation front, as we have previously discussed, we will be focused on a number of initiatives to drive both revenue growth and operating efficiencies.\nSpecific to other income, our expectation remains unchanged that this will be a contributor of 30 basis points to our full year same-store revenue growth. During the quarter, we delivered 60 basis points, which was slightly ahead of our original expectations and mostly due to faster implementation of our parking revenue optimization program.\nIn addition to our efforts around other income, we have been very focused on areas of opportunity like leveraging artificial intelligence into our business process. As early adopters of these AI interactions, we are thrilled with the performance [indiscernible] [ Assistant Ella ] has engaged with just over 600,000 customer inquiries, set 2 million responses addressing prospect questions, and booked over 80,000 appointments. Leveraging this type of automation at the top of our demand funnel has been incredibly effective, allowing us to be nimble with increasing initial traffic demand without impacting our remaining on-site employees' ability to provide high-touch customer interactions when needed. We're excited to share that in the coming quarter we will begin testing an AI resident assistant, helping existing residents 24/7 with common questions about their community service and even their account statements.\nI want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to innovation and enhancing customer service. As we sit here today, we're 96.5% occupied and continue to see strength in our renewal process, which positions us very well to capture the pricing power opportunities that the peak leasing season will bring.\nWith that, I turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMartin J. McKenna\n\nFirst VP of Investor & Public Relations, Equity Residential\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's Fourth Quarter 2023 Results and Outlook for 2024. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer; and Bob Garechana, our CFO. Our earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com.\nPlease be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\n\nMark J. Parrell\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Trustee, Equity Residential\n\nThank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter 2023 results and the outlook for 2024. We I will start us off, then Michael Manelis, our COO, will speak to our operating performance in 2024 operating expectations and followed by Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, will give some color on our capital allocation activities in the transaction markets, and then finally, Bob Garechana, our CFO, will review our 2024 guidance and our balance sheet, and then we'll take your questions.\nWe are pleased with our fourth quarter performance, which was in line with our October expectations. Our performance in 2023 was supported by a strong employment situation more than 2.7 million new jobs created. And while the 2024 outlook for overall jobs is more muted, we should benefit from a continued low unemployment rate for the college educated which currently sits around 2.1% as well as continued good real wage growth. We will also benefit in 2024, having low exposure to new supply in the vast majority of our markets, particularly when compared to the Sunbelt markets as well as the customer comfortably able to pay our rents with current rent to income levels at about 20%.\nOverall, with low unemployment and rising real wages, our target renter demographic remains in good shape. They are likely to rent with us longer as the prospect of homeownership in the near term seems less likely. With scarce inventory and relatively high mortgage rates. When 8% of our residents who moved out [ Gate bought home ] as a reason to depart in 2023, which is the lowest we have seen since we started tracking the number.\nAnd over the next decade, the significant net deficit of housing across our country sets us up for good long-term demand.\nDrilling down on the West Coast, we do see clear signs of improvement in quality of life and energy in the street in the urban centers of Seattle and San Francisco. We continue to believe a recovery in rental rates in the downtown submarkets of these metros is coming and expect our shareholders will benefit from catch-up rental growth in these places where rents are still at or a fair bit below 2019 levels and where incomes, both on a nominal and real basis have risen substantially since 2019.\nSo while we have not baked the material improvement in Seattle and San Francisco performance in our 2024 guidance expectations, we do note that other urban centers damaged by the pandemic and other negative trends, for example, New York City, reignited quickly and sharply off of depressed rent levels once quality of life and employment conditions improved. Switching to the cost side of the equation, our consistent ability to grow expenses and overhead more slowly than our competitors will preserve cash flow for our shareholders as rent growth slows across the country and positions us well once growth picks back up.\nAs it relates to capital allocation, before Alex goes through the details of our recent transaction activities and our view of forward market conditions, I do want to highlight that we bought back some of our stock in the fourth quarter for the first time in many years. We bought back a little more than 864,000 EQR common shares for a total of about $49 million spent at about $57 per share. We funded this repurchase activity with proceeds from sales during January of less desirable assets that were on average 40 years old and were sold at a 5.6% disposition yield and believe that at this stock price and funded with these disposition proceeds, buying our shares a very good investment, especially given the lack of available assets to acquire at reasonable prices.\nBefore I turn the call over, I want to thank our teams across the company for their continued hard work and dedication to serving our customers and producing strong results for our shareholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis.\n\nMichael L. Manelis\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Mark. This morning, I will review our fourth quarter 2023 operating performance and our outlook for 2024. We produced same-store revenue growth of 3.9% and same-store expense growth of only 1.3% in the fourth quarter. both of which were in line with our expectations. On the expense side, our low growth in the quarter and full year 4.3% growth were helped by modest property tax cost as well as the savings produced as we continue to roll out initiatives focused on creating operating efficiencies and a seamless customer experience. On the revenue side, the momentum in December was a little better than we thought as sequentially, we grew revenue in the fourth quarter by holding on more occupancy while maintaining positive blended rate growth. This set us up for a good start in 2024.\nDemand was solid across our markets and consistent with seasonal expectations. We finished the year with same-store physical occupancy at 96% as we focused on building up occupancy in the slower part of our leasing cycle. Today, the portfolio is above 96%. As expected, we saw new lease rates go negative in the quarter as they typically do. Meanwhile, renewal rates for the quarter came in at 5.1%, which was slightly above our expectations. Together, this resulted in a fourth quarter blended rate growth of positive 80 basis points. These healthy fundamentals led to outstanding revenue growth in our East Coast markets and good growth in Southern California.\nAs has been the case all year, the East Coast markets outperformed the West Coast and by and large, will likely continue to do so in 2024. As you saw in our earnings release, we have provided 2024 same-store revenue guidance range of up 2% to 3%. The building blocks for this growth starts with embedded growth of 1.4% and a midpoint assumption that both physical occupancy and cash concessions remain consistent with that of 2023. We expect the year to follow the traditional pre-COVID historical patterns with rent growth sequentially picking up in the spring and likely peaking in August.\nOur midpoint assumes renewals for the year averaged just over 4% and new lease change is relatively flat, which together produces blended rate growth of about 2%. This is more modest growth than the 2023 full year blended rate growth of 3.1% and and is reflective of a slowing job growth environment, offset by a mostly positive supply situation in our coastal markets where we have about 95% of our NOI.\nAs you can see from the stats in the release, January is starting out the way we would expect, with new lease change improving, a strong percent of residents renewing and a renewal rate achieved that is healthy, albeit moderating a bit.\nWhile still early, all of these January trends support our outlook for the year, which includes a view that resident retention remains very good as a result of both the benefits of a centralized renewal process our enhanced data and analytics insights and the high cost and low availability of owned housing in our markets.\nTurnover in the portfolio remains some of the lowest that we have seen in the history of our company, and we expect that trend to continue in 2024. Orange County, San Diego, Boston and Washington, D.C. will lead the pack with expected revenue growth of approximately 4%. New York and L.A. will follow closely behind. At the moment, we expect slightly positive same-store revenue growth in San Francisco and Seattle. And in our expansion markets, which reflect only about 5.5% of the total company NOI, we expect to produce negative same-store revenue growth given the unprecedented levels of supply being delivered.\nAs we look to the individual markets, starting with Boston, with high occupancy and limited new competitive supply, this market should continue to perform well in 2024. The market is supported by a strong employment base and finance, tech, life science, health and education. New supply deliveries will be about the same this year as they were in 2023 and this is a market where our urban assets have outperformed suburban ones lately, and we expect that trend to continue in '24.\nNew York should continue to perform well this year, but won't reach the high rate growth achieved over the last few years. Occupancies remain high and competitive new supply is limited, which led to record high market rents causing some rate fatigue to be observed in late in '23. New supply deliveries will be similar to last year with very little being delivered in Manhattan, where a large part of our portfolio is located. Washington, D.C. continues to outperform our expectations despite the delivery of a good amount of new supply. The market delivered over 13,000 units in 2023 and saw the great majority of those units absorbed.\nThis year, the market will see a similar amount of deliveries, but demand has been strong, and we expect this good performance to continue. We are starting the year with occupancies above 97%, which is a great position to be in.\nIn Los Angeles, we expect a tailwind to growth as we work through the delinquency and bad debt issues that have been concentrated here. We continue to make progress, although the court system remains slow taking at least 6 months from our court filing to being able to get the unit back. Bob will give some more color on the impact of bad debt net on our 2024 earnings expectations.\nNew supply deliveries will be slightly higher this year with our Mid will area town and San Fernando Valley portfolios seeing the largest impact from this new supply. Strong retention and solid demand will continue to aid our ability to fill vacant units with paying residents in this market. Rounding out Southern California, San Diego and Orange County should be some of our highest growth markets this year, driven by high occupancies and a general lack of housing. High homeownership costs make renting in these markets a more attractive option.\nSan Diego will see more competitive new supply in 2024, while Orange County will see similar amounts to last year. In San Francisco and Seattle, we had little to no pricing power throughout 2023, and and our base case expectations for this year assume that situation continues. We have seen periods of stability and in pullbacks. Concession use in both markets is widespread, we have strong physical occupancy with both markets being above 96%, which tells us there is demand, although it is very price sensitive.\nAs Mark mentioned, the downtown areas of both markets continue to see improvement in the quality of life but are still lacking the catalyst of return to office and/or job growth. New supply in San Francisco this year will be up from last year levels, mostly due to an increase in the South Bay, although continued healthy demand in this submarket should aid the absorption. Seattle is likely to be the most impacted of any of our established markets when it comes to new supply deliveries with increases in both the city of Seattle and the East side. The lack of expected job growth combined with this new supply have driven our low expectations in Seattle for 2024.\nBoth Seattle and San Francisco continued to see less than normal inbound migration. Seattle in the fourth quarter, however, did see some relative improvement with new residents coming to us from out of state. This positive trend is something that we will keep an eye on as we move through the spring leasing season. Drawing new residents back to the MSAs in both Seattle and San Francisco would be a catalyst for these markets to outperform our expectations. In the expansion markets, our long-term outlook remains positive. That said, high levels of new supply are already pressuring rents and is likely to continue throughout 2024.\nAt present, we are operating from a defensive position and starting the year with occupancies that are 2 to 3 percentage points above the market averages. Denver has demonstrated the most stability despite having limited pricing power in the portfolio and we expect the market to produce slightly positive same-store revenue growth in 2024.\nCurrently, Atlanta is using the least amount of concessions, but we expect a few of our assets to be very challenged due to the sheer number of lease-ups in close proximity, which will likely lead to negative revenue growth for the year. In Texas, Dallas and Austin have widespread concession use, and we expect all of our assets to experience direct pressure from new deliveries all year long, resulting in negative same-store revenue growth in these markets.\nSo putting all of these factors together, our overall same-store revenue outlook for 2024 right now anticipate solid growth led by the East Coast markets and Southern California, which collectively is almost 70% of our NOI. We expect our coastal existing markets to outperform our expansion markets where unprecedented supply will impact operations near term.\nOn the initiative side, in 2024, we will continue to focus on producing operating efficiencies and driving other income with projects tied to flexible living options, parking, renters insurance and monetizing technology deployed for the benefits of our residents. We are almost complete with the rollout of smart home technology across our portfolio, which will create further opportunities to share teams across properties and enable additional self-service options for residents.\nThis, along with other ancillary income should lead to total other income growth of 30 basis points, excluding bad debt. As we sit here today, we like our positioning and look forward to capturing the opportunities the spring leasing season brings, which will help frame pricing power for the full year.\nI want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these results. With that, I will turn the call over to Alex to walk through our capital allocation activities and the transaction market.\n\nAlexander Brackenridge\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Investment Officer\n\nThank you, Michael. Despite an unsettled transactions market, we remain steadfast in our efforts to continue to reposition our portfolio by increasing our presence in markets like Dallas-Fort Worth, Atlanta, Austin and Denver, and expect to see more opportunity to do so as the year progresses.\nAs we underwrite potential acquisitions, we are always mindful of heightened levels of supply pressuring rents in our expansion markets and reflect tempered rent growth and concessions as needed in our projections. Currently, the transaction market remains unusually choppy, with volumes down 60% to 70% compared to 2022 and down 40% to 50% compared to a more typical year like 2019. Nonetheless, pressures on sellers to transact continued to mount as does the volume of new developments being delivered in these markets. New developments in particular, are often not capitalized to be held for the long term. And even with rates decreasing over the last few months, carry costs are high. Owners of stabilized assets will also see pressure to transact as loans mature and extensions that were agreed to as lenders last year expire.\nDespite the short-term operating challenges in our expansion markets, we remain committed to broadening our footprint in markets that will see strong job growth and household formations over time and lower regulatory risks. As regards to our own transactions activity, we didn't acquire any assets in the fourth quarter, but we did sell three, a small property in Seattle, one in the Bay Area and one in L.A. On average, the properties were 40 years old total sales proceeds were $185 million at an average 5.8% disposition yield.\nWhile transaction volume overall is very light, we are seeing some opportunities to lighten the load of noncore older assets, primarily in our West Coast markets. Since the beginning of 2024, we've sold two additional properties, one in Southern California and a small deal in Boston for a total of $189 million at an average 5.6% disposition yield. We've allocated a portion of the capital from these sales to the share buyback activity Mark just mentioned.\nWith ample access to capital either through asset sales or debt issuance and a property management presence in our expansion markets, we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. In terms of anticipated volume, our guidance for 2024 is $1 billion for both acquisitions and dispositions but market conditions will dictate whether we can hit or even exceed these goals.\nTurning to development. In 2024, we'll complete six new apartment properties with a total cost expected to be $624 million and consisting of 1,982 units with lease-ups commencing for two of those projects in Q1 and four in Q2. Three of those lease-ups all through our joint venture program with Toll Brothers are in Dallas, while the remaining three, two in Denver and one in suburban New York City or JVs with other developers. Given the timing for completion and lease up, we don't expect meaningful contribution to NFFO growth in 2024, but would expect these projects to contribute more to 2025 growth.\nWhile our suburban New York project will see limited competition from new supply, not unexpectedly, our lease ups in Dallas and Denver will see substantial new competition. We acknowledge that the competition may be challenging and anticipate that as we may have to adjust pricing and concessions to meet the market, our projected stabilized yields, which at initial underwriting, will on average a mid-6, maybe closer to [ six ]. We believe these lease-ups, once stabilized and past the current supply glut will provide good cash flow growth and be solid long-term investments.\nBeyond these deliveries, we will be very selective without starting any new projects with a primary focus on locations where it's hard to buy such as suburban Boston. I'll now turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert A. Garechana\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Alex. As Michael and Mark mentioned, 2023 ended up right in line with our forecast last quarter. So let's get right to guidance. Michael gave you most of the building blocks for same-store revenue, but I'll finish up with bad debt, walk through drivers of same-store expenses and normalized FFO and conclude with the balance sheet.\nIn 2023, we were able to reduce bad debt significantly once the regulatory environment became more constructive. While we continue to work with nonpaying residents as we have during and after the pandemic, Ultimately, we still ended up processing a high volume of [ skips ] and evicts. In fact, about 1.5x pre-pandemic activity levels, which, coupled with not adding significant amounts of new nonpaying residents, helped us reduce bad debt as a percentage of same-store revenue from well over 2% to just under 1.5%. So great progress overall, but still a long way from the 50 basis points we were accustomed to pre-pandemic.\nMuch like last year, we expect 2024 to continue to show improvement. We also expect the pace of this improvement to be dependent on the speed of the court systems, primarily in Southern California, where delinquency remains highest to quickly process evictions, which is a hard thing to predict. As a result, our guidance assumes that 2024 remains another transition year for bad debt and that we don't get all the way back to pre-pandemic levels.\nInstead, our guidance midpoint assumes that full year bad debt as a percentage of same-store residential revenue is slight of 1% or a 30 basis point contribution to 2024 growth overall. If that plays out by the end of 2024, we would expect to be a little under 2x pre-pandemic levels.\nTurning to expenses. Expense management is a core strength at Equity Residential as evidenced by the historical performance Mark referenced. Our same-store expense guidance of 4% is also reflective of that discipline. This year, the individual drivers of growth are a little different than those from 2023. So let me give you a high-level assessment, and we can get into more detail in Q&A if required.\nIn 2024, we expect real estate taxes and utilities to grow faster than they did in 2023, in part due to some 421a step-ups and commodity prices. while payroll and repairs and maintenance should be slower due to various initiatives and an expected normalization of inflationary pressures. Insurance, a small category at less than 5% of total expenses, but a topic often discussed should grow more slowly than last year but remain above the long-term trend with growth in the low double digits.\nTurning to normalized FFO. Page 2 of the release provides a detailed reconciliation of our forecasted contributors to NFFO growth. As is typical same-store NOI performance is the primary driver of growth but let me provide some color on transaction activity. We are assuming $1 billion in both acquisitions and dispositions for 2024 with limited dilution yet we show a $0.03 reduction in normalized FFO growth there. This is due to our assumption that our acquisition activity mostly occurs later in the year than our dispositions. This is also partly offset in interest expense and interest income as disposition proceeds are used to pay down debt or invested in interest-bearing 1031 accounts while we await acquisitions.\nNow a very brief comment on the balance sheet because we're in really great shape here. We have no debt maturities until the middle of 2025, modest outstanding balances on our commercial paper program and less than 10% floating rate debt. So we're very well positioned. In fact, over 50% of our existing debt doesn't mature until after 2030. The work we've done over the last number of years has reduced our interest rate exposure and allows us for ample debt capacity to run and grow our business. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator."

This call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.\n\nMartin J. McKenna\n\nFirst VP of Investor & Public Relations, Equity Residential\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's third quarter 2023 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer. Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer; and Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, are here with us as well for the Q&A.\nOur earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com as is a management presentation for the quarterly call. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\n\nMark J. Parrell\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Trustee, Equity Residential\n\nThank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2023 results. As you can see from the press release and management presentation, the business continues to do well in most of our markets, with our East Coast markets outperforming our West Coast markets. New York, Boston and Washington, D.C., comprising a bit more than 40% of our net operating income are all having very good years and are meeting or exceeding our expectations.\nOur target renter demographic remains well employed. Unemployment for the college educated is at 2.1%, with increasing pay levels and a continuing high propensity to rent, given elevated single-family ownership costs, low for-sale inventory and lifestyle reasons like delayed marriage and smaller families that favor our business.\nWe're also seeing lower levels of new apartment construction in most of our established markets where we have 95% of our net operating income versus the Sunbelt markets, a pattern that will continue for the next several years.\nConsistent with this view throughout the primary leasing season, our pricing followed a trajectory that was pretty typical for a normal pre-COVID year. And as you can see in the management presentation, on par with our guidance assumption, the normal rent seasonality would return in 2023.\nWe saw our portfolio-wide rents peak in early August and then begin to decelerate as we expected. However, we recently saw a deceleration in pricing in San Francisco and Seattle that was more pronounced than usual seasonal patterns. The main culprit here seems to be a lack of job growth for our target renter demographic.\nMichael will have more detail on this as well as the building blocks for 2024 that are laid out in the management presentation in a moment.\nIn Los Angeles, we are working through the impact of a drawn-out process to normalize delinquency levels and to reduce bad debt. We continue to make good progress here, portfolio-wide bad debt before application of rental relief funds in the third quarter was about 1.3% as compared to 2.4% in 2022. But the process is uneven, and it is lengthy. Evictions are now taking 6 months or more in Los Angeles versus the 2 to 3 months prior to the pandemic.\nGiven the underperformance in San Francisco and Seattle and the lumpiness and improvement in bad debt as well as the impact from the noncash write-off of a $1.5 million straight-line rent receivable in the quarter due to the bankruptcy of Rite Aid, which is a retail tenant of ours, we have adjusted our same-store revenue guidance expectation for the year to 5.5% from 5.875% at the previous midpoint. We have also adjusted our EPS, FFO and NFFO guidance accordingly.\nTurning to 2024, the long-term health and outlook of our business remains positive, with favorable tailwinds that should support performance. While job growth expectations for 2024 are lower than 2023 levels, we'll continue to benefit from demand from a well-employed resident demographic, we think are going to rent with us longer, given the cost of single-family ownership and powerful social trends like delayed marriage and smaller families that I previously mentioned.\nWe also see a significant benefit from lower deliveries of new supply in our established markets compared to the elevated deliveries in the Sunbelt markets over the next few years.\nSwitching to capital allocation. While the overall market remains quiet, we did have some activity in the quarter. We sold a 30-year-old asset in downtown Seattle during the quarter at a 5.4% disposition yield as we continue to lighten the load in the urban centers of our West Coast markets. We also continued to invest in our expansion markets by acquiring 2 assets in suburban Atlanta. One property was built in 2019 and was acquired from a large private equity real estate player. The transaction is a 5.1% acquisition cap rate, including the impact of the mark-to-market on some low-cost debt that we assumed as part of this transaction.\nThis property is located in an upscale mixed-use development, though we acquired none of the retail with a resident base having high-paying jobs at the large education and medical employers nearby.\nThe other asset we acquired is in [ Wanet ] County, with easy access to the [ I-85 ] employment corridor and was acquired for $98 million. This asset is brand new and is still in lease-up, and we expect it will stabilize at a 5.4% year 2 acquisition cap rate. The median home price in the desirable area where the property sits is $600,000, which assuming a normal down payment in current interest rates equates to an all-in housing cost at 2.5x our pro forma rents.\nMedian household incomes in the area and among our residents at the property are around $100,000, making rentership a good financial and quality of life decision. It is important to note that our 2023 acquisition activity was paid forward capital from our asset sales without incurring any dilution as we took a cautious approach to transaction activity given the pricing uncertainty and low volumes in the marketplace.\nWe sold properties that averaged 30 years old, and that we expect will have more capital needs and lower go-forward IRRs than the properties that were acquired, which were 1 year old on average. We are well positioned to further our portfolio diversification by taking advantage of acquisition opportunities that we believe are likely to arise from the substantial development pipeline that is delivering in our expansion markets over the next 2 years. And now I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis.\n\nMichael L. Manelis\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review the third quarter 2023 operating performance in our markets, our outlook for the remainder of the year and some views into 2024 and that we included in our management presentation.\nWe continue to produce very good results with residential same-store revenue growth of 4.4% in the third quarter driven by generally healthy fundamentals in our business and some improvement in delinquency, although not as much as we expected.\nThe East Coast markets continue to outperform the West Coast. Demand and occupancy remains healthy, especially across our East Coast markets and absorption and our results in the Washington, D.C. market continue to impress.\nAs I will discuss shortly, San Francisco and Seattle are experiencing more pricing pressure than we previously expected. Before I get to that, let me touch upon October leasing spreads, new lease, renewal and blended. The stats we published through October 27 captures almost all the months activity, and as we mentioned, are consistent with seasonal declines outside of Seattle and San Francisco. New lease change is negative, which is normal for the month and will continue to get more negative as pricing trend, which is presented on Page 6 of the management presentation, continues to decline for the balance of the year.\nIn a normal pre-pandemic year, by the time you get to December, it is not uncommon to see new lease change be negative 4% or 5%. Given the weakness in our Seattle and San Francisco portfolios, we will likely be slightly more negative than that.\nRenewal rate achieved should moderate slightly, but remain relatively stable and make up more of the transaction mix. Put it all in the blender and Q4 blended rate will continue to moderate. In terms of the specific conditions on the ground in San Francisco and Seattle, as we stated previously, we have had little to no pricing power throughout the year. However, the peak leasing season did demonstrate an increased volume of demand and some moderation of concession use, which led us to what we initially thought could be the beginning of better stability.\nOver the last 6 weeks, however, these markets have slowed more than normal, which has resulted in larger price reductions than seasonally expected, characterized by both declining rates and increased concession use. This is most pronounced in the downtown areas of both markets, though there are other suburban pockets experiencing pressure like Downtown Redmond in Seattle. The uncertainty of back to the office from the big tech employers, combined with their slowdown in new hiring is keeping a lid on demand.\nIn order for these markets to fully recover, we will need to see the vibrancy that comes to these areas when the offices are active, employment increases and residents want to enjoy the city lifestyle and easy commute to the office. Both cities are making progress on improving the quality of life issues, and we are seeing signs that a few of the major tech employers are slowly adding positions back, especially in Seattle, but the improvement in both of these areas need to accelerate in order to generate enough in migration to these markets, which will allow pricing power to return.\nWhile recognizing challenges in these 2 markets, overall, our business remains healthy. Even with these now muted expectations, 2023 is on track to deliver very strong same-store revenue growth with several positive trends that we expect to continue into 2024 and support our business.\nFirst, our residents remain in good shape financially with rent-to-income ratios remaining at 20% portfolio-wide. Resident lease breaks and transfer activities to reduce rent, often early indicators of resident economic stress remain below pre-pandemic levels and in line with seasonal expectations. Overall, the job market and our residents remain resilient, which would expect -- which we expect to carry into 2024.\nOur resident retention remains very good. Turnover in the portfolio remains some of the lowest that we have seen. Single-family home purchases continue to be an expensive housing alternative, especially in our established markets. In fact, only 7.5% of our residents who moved out, bought home as the reason in the third quarter which is one of the lowest numbers we have seen since we started tracking the data back in 2006.\nAt this point, we are not seeing anything to suggest that the overall turnover rate in the portfolio will not remain low. As I mentioned earlier on the demand side, generally, the employment picture, particularly for the college educated, remain solid and supportive of continuing demand into 2024. So as I already noted, the high-quality job creation machine in San Francisco and Seattle recently paused, but longer-term fundamentals support the potential future growth.\nOn the supply side, overall, we are favorably positioned, particularly compared to those concentrated in the Sunbelt. We should benefit from less direct competitive supply pressure in most of our established markets while DC will be about the same and Seattle will have elevated supply in 2024. When looking at new supply as a percent of inventory, there are significant differences between the overall Sunbelt and our expansion markets -- as compared to our established markets.\nThe average new supply as a percent of total inventory in our established markets is around 2%, which includes the Seattle market at 4.5% which is the only outlier both on an absolute percent basis and relative to historical norms. Meanwhile, the Sunbelt markets are forecasted at just around 6% and our expansion markets range between a low 4% in Atlanta and a high of nearly 10% in Austin, which will result in pronounced supply pressure. This shouldn't be overly impactful for us since only 5% of our NOI is located in these expansion markets and, in fact, may present acquisition opportunities for us as financially stressed developers sell properties.\nSo putting all of these factors together, our overall revenue outlook for 2024 right now anticipate solid growth led by the East Coast markets. As you can see in the management presentation, our embedded growth going into next year is trending slightly above pre-pandemic norms and loss to lease is generally in line.\nWith bad debt net, it is hard to predict the exact amount of tailwind from improvement, but our view is that we will continue to gradually work our way back towards pre-pandemic levels. The eviction process is taking twice as long as it did pre-pandemic, and this speed is not yet sufficient to both clear the backlog and allow for new typical volume of evictions to be processed. That said, we see no decline in the credit quality of our resident and their propensity to pay.\nWe continue to believe that we will see meaningful improvement in 2024. In addition to the tailwind from bad debt net, we expect to see some incremental lift from several of the operating initiatives that we have in place around renewals, parking, connectivity and other income opportunities.\nMoving to expenses, which continued to trend in line, we would expect our 2024 same-store expense growth to be slightly below this year. We will feel continued pressure on the repair and maintenance lines with some of the new technology fees like Smart Home and WiFi, although the comp period from 2023 is pretty high, so that will help offset some of that growth rate.\nInsurance is clearly in for another significant increase. And right now, we expect real estate taxes to be higher than this year, but nothing that will create too much overall pressure. Some of the growth in these expense categories will be mitigated by continued operating efficiencies in the payroll line being created from our centralization initiatives.\nLet me wrap up by saying that the apartment business continues to be good with favorable demographics driving demand and limited new supply in most of our markets. We will continue to enhance our operating platform to take advantage of the opportunities that the markets present while delivering a seamless customer experience to our residents. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these results. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Martin McKenna.\n\nMartin J. McKenna\n\nFirst VP of Investor & Public Relations, Equity Residential\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's Second Quarter 2023 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer. Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, is here with us as well for the Q&A.\nOur earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\n\nMark J. Parrell\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Trustee, Equity Residential\n\nThank you, Martin. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2023 results. As we work our way through the leasing season, the business is performing well, with same-store expenses now looking a little bit better than we thought, leading us to lower our guidance for that item last night.\nAs a result of this and lower expected interest expense, we are pleased to again raise our same-store net operating income and normalized funds from operations guidance after raising same-store NOI and NFFO guidance, just 2 months ago based on better expected revenue results.\nIn a moment, Michael Manelis will give you color on revenue drivers across our markets. After Michael's remarks, Bob will address the details of the improvement in our expense and NFFO guidance, as well as our successful pending refinancing activity.\nThe overall theme here is that Equity Residential continues to benefit, like most of the multifamily industry from solid demand, but with the more unique benefit of our mostly coastal portfolio being less exposed to the significant levels of supply just beginning to be delivered in the Sunbelt markets. We also continue to manage expenses well in an inflationary environment, which we expect will allow us to drive more dollars to the bottom line than our competitors over time.\nIn terms of specifics, in the quarter we continued to post strong same-store revenue results driven by good demand across our markets and rapidly improving delinquency in Southern California. As you may recall, we increased the midpoint of our same-store revenue guidance for the year to 5.875% in May, right before the NAREIT conference to reflect these factors. That, in turn, caused an improvement of 100 basis points in our same-store NOI guidance midpoint and a $0.03 per share improvement in NFFO guidance at the midpoint.\nThese continued strong operating results speak to the durable nature of our business in the face of some pretty volatile economic conditions. Despite the layoff headlines, particularly in the tech sector that dominated the news in late 2022 and early 2023, we see substantial demand from our affluent renter demographic. Also in places like Seattle, we are hopeful that the return to office mandates by employers like Amazon will drive incremental demand back into the urban areas of the city as commute times become intolerable for workers who dispersed far outside the city in response to COVID and are now required to be in the office frequently and as quality of life issues in these urban areas improve.\nAnd while new supply is certainly pressuring the Sunbelt and Denver markets, as I mentioned before, we are seeing moderate levels of supply in most of our major markets. Even in Washington, D.C., where we are seeing the highest levels of competitive new supply is being absorbed at a good rate, and the market is performing well.\nSwitching over to the transactions market. That market continues to be relatively quiet. We did not sell anything in the second quarter. But we did buy a couple of deals, including a newly developed property in lease-up in Atlanta, that I spoke about on our first quarter call. The other acquisition in the second quarter is a 287-unit property located in suburban Denver, which we purchased for approximately $108 million at an acquisition cap rate of 5%.\nThe transaction market generally remains stuck between buyers who expect lower prices given the huge shift in interest rates and a less accommodative capital markets and sellers who remain wedded to early 2022 values and by and large, have assets that are still operating pretty well, so they feel no great compulsion to sell right now.\nOur sense is that sales will pick up over the next 6 to 12 months as sellers accept the reality of rates being higher for longer as floating rate loans with expiring caps reset, and as developer capital invested in newly completed development deals becomes impatient.\nNow our capital allocation strategy. As we have discussed with you for the past few years, we continue to have a goal of having a more balanced portfolio between urban and suburban and between coastal and Sunbelt markets. We think such a portfolio will create the highest returns and lowest volatility over time. The recent issues caused by COVID in urban centers and the current issues in the Sunbelt markets due to supply are examples of the opportunities and risks we wish to balance.\nAs opportunities present themselves in the Sunbelt and Denver markets and in select suburban locations of our coastal markets to acquire or develop great assets at fair prices, we will be there to do so. And before I turn it over to Michael, I want to take a moment to celebrate our 30 years as a public company.\nOn August 12, 1993, Equity Residential went public on the New York Stock Exchange. Much has happened in the past 30 years. We grew from about 21,000 units, an initial valuation of $800 million in 1993 to more than 225,000 units across more than 50 markets at the peak, leading to our 80,000 units and a value of more than $26 billion today. On this journey, we acquired a number of other public apartment REITs as well as some very large private portfolios, including Archstone.\nAt the head of this enterprise for all those years was our amazing founder and Chairman, Sam Zell, who we lost in May. Sam's guidance and influence are part of our DNA at Equity Residential, and we will continue to run this company to honor his legacy of delivering superior long-term value to our shareholders. We thank all of you for your support over the past 30 years and for your kind words regarding Sam's passing. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael L. Manelis\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review the second quarter 2023 operating performance in our markets. We continue to produce very solid results with same-store revenue growth of 5.5% in the second quarter that are in line with our improved May guidance expectations.\nResults are driven by a continuing improvement in delinquency along with a continued healthy fundamentals in the business. As with last quarter, East Coast markets continue to outperform West Coast. Our results to date reflect our view that we have previously shared with you that pricing trends will follow a normal, albeit slightly muted seasonal trajectory. Generally, layoff announcements seem to have dissipated and our average resident remains in great financial shape with rent-to-income ratios during the quarter for new residents continuing to hover around 20%.\nResident lease breaks and transfer activities to reduce rent, often early indicators of resident economic stress remain below pre-pandemic levels and in line with seasonal expectations. The overall employment picture continues to be healthy. and young adults are choosing the attractive lifestyles available in our markets. Single-family home purchases continue to be an expensive proposition. In fact, less than 8% of our residents gave bought home as the reason for their move out in the second quarter, which is well below the 12% norm for this period.\nCombine this with the overall favorable competitive new supply position we face in most of our markets, and we are on track for a good year in 2023. As a reminder, a combination of more difficult same-store revenue comparison periods, including the absence of governmental rental relief this year and a reversion to a more normal rent growth pattern will result in more moderate but still above historical growth in the second half of 2023.\nAs we sit here today in the back half of our primary leasing season, the portfolio is 96% occupied with good demand and resident retention. We expect a continued healthy trajectory for the remainder of the leasing season. Our portfolio-wide occupancy is being depressed by turnover in Southern California, primarily L.A. as we work our way through the delinquency issues. In the longer run, replacing these vacant units with paying residents outweighs the slightly lower short-term occupancy.\nNow let me spend a few minutes talking about market performance. So let's start with the East Coast. New York was by far the top performer for the second quarter with same-store residential revenue growth of more than 13%. We have very little competitive new supply in the market, and our occupancy sits near 97%. Demand indicators continue to be positive, making this market the expected top performer for the year.\nBoston produced slightly above 8% same-store revenue growth in the second quarter driven by strong demand across the submarkets with our urban properties outperforming our suburban ones. We continue to hear stories of tough commute times for suburbanites, that are resulting in residents coming back to the city. While new supply in the market is above the 5-year average, the large majority of it is not competitive with our assets and appears to be readily absorbed.\nHeading down to D.C. This market continues to impress with same-store revenue growth of 6.3% in the second quarter despite a high level of new supply across a number of submarkets. The market just keeps going, absorbing these units at a healthy pace and delivering some of the best revenue growth in the portfolio.\nAs an example, Reverb, our new 312-unit development in Central D.C. which is currently in lease-up is delivering weekly application volumes well above expectations, allowing us to reduce concessions and push rate. Occupancy in the D.C. market is just below 97% and we are optimistic for continued strong performance for the year, but recognize the increased volume of new supply that will be delivered in the rest of this year.\nNow for the West Coast. Our Southern California markets achieved some of the strongest sequential revenue growth in the quarter, demonstrating the early financial benefits of backfilling long-term delinquent units with paying residents. Unlike the Orange County and San Diego markets, which posted good quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, Los Angeles produced slightly negative quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. This reported number, however, is not indicative of the health of the market but more noise from bad debt due to large rental relief receipts in the second quarter of 2022.\nWhen you strip this noise out, same-store quarter-over-quarter revenue growth would have been over 5% positive for L.A. We are still seeing healthy demand in Los Angeles and have not felt any negative impact from the workers' strikes in the entertainment industry. Our direct exposure is not significant but acknowledge it may soften overall market conditions in the coming months, which could slow our ability to release some of our vacant units.\nIn addition to the strike, we continue to see more nonpaying residents move out which is resulting in at least 100 basis point drag to occupancy in the market. We view both of these issues as isolated short-term impacts to the market as the strikes will end and delinquency will gradually resolve itself which, coupled with the long-term demand, we see as catalyst for next year above average market growth in L.A.\nMoving to San Francisco. The market reported respectable quarter-over-quarter revenue growth of 3.1%, which would have been 4.6% after adjusting for the impact of rental relief receipts in the second quarter of 2022. Overall, the San Francisco market demonstrated leasing velocity in line with normal seasonal trends and met our expectations for the second quarter. The South Bay, which represents 37% of our NOI in the market, continues to be a bright spot. Prospects are telling our local teams that the area meets their hybrid work requirements by keeping them close for in-office days and providing better lifestyle options and more space and access to the natural outdoor amenities.\nOur recent resident survey tells us that 77% of our residents in the San Francisco Bay Area are either hybrid or fully in office. In downtown San Francisco, we hear from our teams that new residents say that they are leasing to get closer to work. The good news is that the quality of life in downtown San Francisco continues to improve and the local government's focus seems to be showing some signs of promise. While our pricing power in the submarket remains less than desired, and concessions are still being used, downtown has been stable and allowed us to capture demand and regain occupancy to 96% in that submarket.\nThe overall sentiment in the San Francisco market indicates that the tech layoffs are mostly behind us, and there's a lot of momentum around AI, which keeps us optimistic on the continued recovery in this market.\nHeading to Seattle, while there is vibrancy in the market with improvements in the quality of life issues, some return to office activity and tourism back to pre-pandemic levels, the market continues to underperform our expectations. While net effective pricing in the overall market is now 2% below the March 2020 levels, there's a wide dispersion among submarkets with the downtown Seattle well below the March 2020 levels primarily due to the continued concession use in the submarket.\nOverall, Seattle has been a market that has struggled to deliver consistent strong demand over the last couple of years as its tech-heavy workforce has had the flexibility to work from anywhere. For this market to fully recover, it needs to see more consistent strong job growth with better quality of life conditions that will bring people back to the market. The good news is that we are starting to see some positive signs in South Lake Union, which is a tech-heavy neighborhood in the city of Seattle, and this is likely due to the Amazon return to office, which began in May. We are hopeful that this activity will soon spill over to the other downtown submarkets.\nFinally, in our expansion markets, which currently make up about 5% of our same-store NOI, revenue performance has been mostly in line with our acquisition pro formas and guidance expectations. Our portfolios in Denver, Dallas and Austin continue to be the most impacted by new supply like we discussed last quarter. Meanwhile, Atlanta remains a bright spot with double-digit revenue growth for both the quarter and year-to-date.\nIn a minute, I will turn it over to Bob to discuss our operating expense performance and the balance sheet. But let me take a minute to discuss our operating platform, which is humming as we continue to reap the benefits of our focus on innovation and the technology evolution at Equity. We are focused on the customer experience and the feedback we receive from our customers help us in developing our platform to drive superior financial performance and customer satisfaction. The insights we gained from our resident survey, which garnered more than 32,000 responses validates our strategy of combining our growing data science capabilities with streamlined execution while delivering self-service solutions to our customers. Leveraging data and analytics on top of our resident feedback will create further opportunities to expand our operating margin.\nWith a fully centralized and mobile operating platform, we are in a strong position to create a seamless customer experience with a platform that continues to allow us to innovate, experiment and rapidly scale what works across this portfolio. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results. With that, I will turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert A. Garechana\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Michael. Let me start with expenses before covering our financing activities. We reported same-store expense growth of 5.5% in the quarter. The main drivers of this growth were repairs and maintenance and on-site payroll. Repairs and maintenance growth in the quarter was driven by continued wage pressure, particularly from contracted services. Payroll growth was mostly due to elevated employee benefit costs during the quarter relative to the same period last year. Without these costs, reported payroll growth would have been 2.6%, which was more in line with our expectations and reflective of the efficiencies we have been achieving from our various operating initiatives.\nFor the full year, same-store expense guidance, we have lowered the midpoint of our range by 25 basis points to 4.25%. This reduction is driven by expectations of continued low real estate tax growth due to modest rate increases and successful appeals activity as well as significantly lower expectations for commodity prices, which are muting utilities expense growth. These more favorable trends will be partially offset by slightly higher payroll and other on-site expenses stemming from the elevated employee benefit costs mentioned from Q2 and administrative costs from the expiration of the eviction moratoriums, respectively.\nThe revised guidance implies a significantly lower rate of growth for expenses during the second half of the year relative to our results through Q2. We think that this is challenging, but definitely achievable given the easier comparable period from the back half of 2022 and the visibility we have into the items I just described.\nFinally, turning to the capital markets and our 2023 refinancing activities. As we previously discussed, the company has an $800 million secured debt pool that matures in the middle of the fourth quarter. The debt originated from the Archstone transaction back in 2013, currently carries a rate of 4.21% and a portion of it needs to be refinanced in the secured market for tax reasons.\nDuring Q2, we began marketing this opportunity to lenders, and I'm happy to report we received significant interest from a variety of capital providers. In July, we selected lenders and entered into 2 loan commitments and locked in slightly below 5.25% rate for the $530 million that we're refinancing. This was approximately 135 basis points over the 10-year treasury at the time and was lower than what we would have expected to do had we been issuing an unsecured bond.\nAs you may recall, we previously also entered into interest rate swaps to hedge this financing, and those were settled for an over $25 million gain. When the gain is amortized over the life of the loan, it results in an economic cost for these financings of 4.7%, which we believe is an excellent outcome, given the environment. Once these loans close, we would expect the company to end the year with approximately 8% floating rate debt, over $2 billion in immediately available liquidity and no real debt maturities outside of commercial paper until June of 2025.\nThis, coupled with the lowest leverage in the company's history position us very well should any opportunities arise. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for question and answers."

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Martin McKenna. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMarty McKenna\n\nVice President, Investor and Public Relations, Equity Residential\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's first quarter 2023 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer. Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer and Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer are here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.\nNow I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\n\nMark Parrell\n\nCFO, Equity Residential\n\nThank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2023 results. We had a very good quarter to start the year with same-store revenue results exceeding our expectations. And while same-store expense growth was higher than we projected due in large part to California storms, that still left us with first quarter net operating income and normalized FFO better than we expected.\nIn a moment, Mike will take you through our first quarter operating highlights. The strength of our revenue results point to the durable nature of our business in the face of volatile economic conditions.\nWe continue to see substantial demand from our affluent renter demographic and moderate levels of supply in most of our major markets, with the new news in the quarter being the rapidly improving regulatory conditions in California. Based on these continuing positive business conditions and the good prospects we see for our business going forward, during the first quarter, our board raised our common share dividend by 6% on an annualized basis. Despite headlines and layoffs, demand feels solid.\nThe unemployment rate, particularly for the college educated, remains very low, which gives us a good feeling about the employability and earnings power of our affluent renter customer. In our portfolio, we are not seeing increases in residents downsizing their units or giving us their keys because of job loss. In terms of competition from homeownership, monthly costs and down payment requirements remain high in our markets, especially relative to rents, making renting a high-quality equity residential apartment a better value.\nOnly 8% of our residents who moved out in the first quarter bought a home, and that's down from 12% in the first quarter of 2022. On the apartment supply side, as we have discussed with you on previous calls, we expect 2023 national apartment new supply to run at record levels. But we generally feel good about the level of direct competition that supply will pose to us, given our market mix and importantly, the location of supply within markets relative to our properties. In our coastal markets where we still have 95% of our NOI, we see very manageable competitive new supply in most markets, with Washington, D.C. being the exception, though D.C. is holding up remarkably well so far.\nIn the Sunbelt markets, including the Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta markets in which we are increasingly investing. And in Denver, we are seeing higher relative supply and more impact. We anticipated this when we acquired our Sunbelt in Denver properties, and these properties are generally tracking consistently with our underwriting.\nAs we look to expand our portfolio in these markets, we expect that these new deliveries will present buying opportunities for us. Mike will also discuss first quarter same-store expense growth, which was higher than we expected, especially in the repairs and maintenance and other on-site operating expenses lines.\nWe think this growth was inflated for discrete reasons that will pass, and we continue to be comfortable in attaining our full year same-store expense range in part due to lower than previously anticipated real estate tax growth, combined with modest on-site payroll expense growth. We have created at our company a culture and system that uses technology and centralization to improve the customer and employee experience and to contain our payroll costs.\nWhile the transaction markets remain unsettled, we did do a couple of deals to start the year. We sold a small collection of 25-year-old properties that totaled 247 units in Los Angeles for about $135 million in advance of the transfer tax increase. Also after the end of the quarter, we purchased a newly developed property in Atlanta for about $79 million that is currently in lease-up.\nThe property is located directly on a portion of the Atlanta beltline that is being improved and paved. The beltline is a desirable amenity to our demographic and has been a catalyst for economic growth and densification across the area.\nThe property's economics benefit from various tax credits and when fully stabilized next year, we expect to attain a 6.6% acquisition cap rate. Removing the tax benefits, which will burn off over time, we see the stabilized fully taxed acquisition cap rate at 5.7%. We also love our basis in this property, which is at $288,000 per unit, and we see that as a 15% to 20% discount to current replacement costs. Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, is here with us to answer your questions on the transaction market. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Manelis\n\nThanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I'm going to review key takeaways from our first quarter 2023 operating performance in our markets, along with same-store operating expenses. As Mark mentioned, we produced very good same-store revenue growth of 9.2% in the first quarter. These results were ahead of our expectations, primarily due to continuing improvement in delinquency along with continued healthy fundamentals in the business.\nBefore I get into more details on these topics, I want to emphasize that as we sit here today, the early stages of the leasing season and its setup remains strong. With year-to-date pricing trend improvement just above 3.25%, which is where we would expect it to be at this point in the year and is also consistent with expectations underpinning guidance. During the quarter, we continued to see good demand and strong resident retention that produced low turnover, stable occupancy and solid pricing power.\nDespite some recent negative job headlines, our average resident remains in great financial shape. With rent income ratios during the quarter for new residents continuing to hover around 20%. The Resident lease breaks due to job loss and transfer activities to reduce rent, often early indicators of resident economic threats remain below pre-pandemic levels and in line with seasonal expectations. A resilient labor market, along with a large number of young adults choosing the exciting attractive lifestyles our markets provide, along with the convenience and cost benefits of renting continues to result in application volumes that are on par with the same period last year and continue to grow as expected into the leasing season.\nCouple this with the favorable supply position and lack of single-family home ownership competition that Mark outlined, and we should be positioned for another good year. Results to date support the view we shared on our February earnings call that we expect pricing trends for this year to follow a normal, albeit slightly muted seasonal trajectory. Given the difficult comparison periods for 2022 for the back half of the year, along with the return to normal rent growth patterns, we expect that the first quarter will be our highest reported same-store revenue growth with more moderate but still above historical growth in subsequent quarters.\nWhile there may be some uncertainty about the economy, including increasing layoff announcements, as I said previously, we are not seeing this impact our day-to-day operations. While we acknowledge that we are generally a lagging indicator, so far so good as we head to our primary leasing season. Now let me spend a few minutes talking about our market performance. Let's start with the East Coast. New York and D.C. are both exceeding expectations, while Boston is in line. New York was by far the top performer for the first quarter with same-store revenue growth of over 19%.\nWith very limited and isolated supply, the outperformance in this market is consistent across all submarkets. Occupancy is currently 97.5% and all demand indicators continue to flash green, making this market the expected top performer for the year. Turning to D.C. Performance has thus far been a pleasant surprise with the market continuing to absorb significant new supply, while still delivering good revenue growth.\nSimilar to New York, occupancy is strong, and so far, all submarkets remain resilient in the face of new supply. Now for the West Coast, Southern California continues to post good numbers. And most notably, we are starting to see improvement in delinquency, particularly in Los Angeles, which has the heaviest concentration. As the eviction moratorium expired, we are seeing more of our delinquent residents figuring out the best option that works for them, which is either paying rent or moving out.\nThis activity started to pick up pace late in the first quarter, which was sooner than we expected and has continued into April. While these move-outs are pressuring physical occupancy, it will benefit our financial results later in the year as we have good demand in the market to replace these residents with new residents that will pay their rent.\nOur remaining 2 West Coast markets of San Francisco and Seattle have posted respectable quarter-over-quarter revenue growth with good demand, but pricing power remains less than desired, especially in the urban centers of both of these markets. The San Francisco market is performing in line with our expectations, which already assumed a slow recovery. Use of concessions, mostly in the downtown submarket remains common along with limited pricing power.\nMeanwhile, the South Bay submarket is demonstrating signs of improving pricing power and stronger occupancy with less widespread concession use based on a combination of factors that includes a greater variety of stable employers who are committed to the area, coupled with just a better overall quality of life. Heading to Seattle, the overall market continues to demonstrate a lack of recovery, which wasn't completely unexpected, but is behind our forecast.\nSimilar to Downtown San Francisco, Downtown Seattle lacks pricing power with concessions being used on over 70% of our applications. The East side, which we felt may hold up a little bit better, is still outperforming downtown, but is a little more challenging than we thought based on supply pressure, layoffs and overall just less hiring in the submarket.\nAmazon's May 1 mandatory return to the office date has a potential to be a catalyst for this market. Finally, in our expansion markets, which currently make up a little less than 5% of our same-store NOI, revenue performance has mostly been in line with our acquisition performance and guidance expectations. As we expected, we are being impacted by heavy new supply in Austin, Dallas and Denver.\nMeanwhile, Atlanta remained strong with double-digit revenue growth for the quarter. Now moving to expenses. We reported same-store expense growth of 7.2% in the quarter, which was slightly above our expectations. We had always expected Q1 growth to be higher than our full year guidance range, mostly because the growth during the first quarter of 2022 was so low, but also from pressure on a few specific items that outpaced positives in a few other expense categories.\nOn the favorable side, we continue to benefit from good performance in real estate taxes and payroll, along with utilities, which were still elevated but lower than expected. On the unfavorable side, incremental cost in repairs and maintenance, other on-site costs and higher-than-anticipated insurance costs drove higher-than-expected first quarter same-store expense growth.\nFor most of these costs, we had anticipated an increase but not quite to this degree. Elevated repairs and maintenance was in large part due to increased outsourcing in the quarter much of which stemmed from our own internal teams in California, focusing on the after effects of the severe rainstorms, which resulted in incremental outside vendor assistance.\nHigher legal and administrative costs related to faster progress in response to the expiration of the eviction moratorium, the benefit of which can be seen in our bad debt net. Insurance expense was higher due to tougher conditions than the already challenging environment we assumed on the renewal of our property insurance policy, which was completed during the first quarter. Despite this pressure, we remain comfortable with our existing guidance range on the full year same-store expense growth. At this point, we expect slower full year growth in real estate tax and utilities than we initially expected to offset the overages experienced in other categories in the first quarter.\nLastly, I want to spend a minute on our focus on innovation and the technology evolution of our platform. In 2023, we have a positive NOI impact of just over $10 million included in our guidance with about 2/3 of that coming on the expense side primarily in payroll and repair and maintenance. This benefit will mostly be realized in second half of the year which will contribute to lower expense growth for that period. On the revenue side we will continue to focus on other income items like WiFi, parking and pricing optimization. We will also leverage data analytics to create opportunities to expand our operating margins. Our vision is to augment pricing and renewal strategies by combining our growing data science capabilities with streamlined execution while delivering self-service solutions to our customers.\nWe will continue to leverage our mobile platform to create opportunities to share on-site employees across multiple properties. With a fully centralized and mobile operating platform, we are in a strong position to create a seamless customer experience with a platform that continues to allow us to innovate, experiment and rapidly scale what works across the portfolio.\nThis uniquely positions our company to continue to create additional revenue streams while managing expenses to maintain and grow margins even in an inflationary climate. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results.\nWith that, we will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Thank you."

Parrell\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and our outlook for 2023.\n2022 was a terrific year for Equity Residential. We finished the year as we expected, producing same-store revenue growth of 10.6%. We continue to see good demand during the fourth quarter, but certainly saw a return of seasonality to the business. Our strong 2022 same-store revenue growth, combined with modest expense growth of 3.6%, resulted in same-store net operating income growth for the full year of 14.1%.\nWith continuing positive financial leverage, this led to a 17.7% increase in year-over-year normalized FFO. I want to take a moment to thank all my colleagues across Equity Residential for their hard work and dedication in delivering these terrific results.\nIn a moment, Michael Manelis will take you through our 2022 highlights and how we expect 2023 to shape up on the revenue side then Bob Garechana will comment on bad debt and review our 2022 expense results and 2023 expense expectations as well as recent balance sheet activities and then we'll take your questions.\nWe have provided guidance for same-store revenue growth at a midpoint of 5.25%, which would make 2023 another good year for Equity Residential and produce same-store revenue growth well above our long-term average.\nWe do admit to finding 2023 harder to predict than usual. On the positive side, we go into the year expecting to benefit from embedded growth of about 4.2% from leases written in 2022. And we also carry into the year an above-average loss to lease, both of which will contribute to positive momentum for us, particularly in the first half of 2023.\nWe also feel good about the employability and earnings power of our affluent renter customer. There still appears to be plentiful employment opportunities for the highly skilled workers that form the bulk of our residents, as evidenced by last week's blowout January employment and job openings reports. We saw big increases in employment in the professional and business services category, a smaller gain in financial activities and only a modest decline in information services, all big employment categories for our residents.\nSo far, the announced layoffs that tech and some financial firms, while certainly creating a negative environment, have not manifested themselves much in the government's reported numbers or the -- far in our internal numbers, we've only seen a handful of residents terminating leases early due to job loss.\nPossibly, the impact is delayed due to severance and other factors but it is at least equally possible that the workers in these categories are being quickly reabsorbed into the job market. Our renter demographic has proven resilient in the past, and we expect them to continue to be highly employable.\nAs to run our incomes, according to the Atlanta Fed wage Tracker, college graduates wages accelerated in the fourth quarter, outpacing wage gains achieved by hourly workers despite the higher base.\nLooking at competition from homeownership and new apartment supply in 2023, we also generally see a favorable picture. Homeownership costs and down payment requirements remain high in our markets, especially relative to rents, making our product a better value. According to the National Association of Realtors, for their affordability index to return to pre-COVID levels, 1 of 3 things would need to occur. The 30-year mortgage rate would need to decline to 2.6%, home prices to fall by 1/3, or family incomes to increase by 50%. This is all very consistent with our internal data, which shows the percentage of residents leaving us to purchase a home fell to 9.4% in the fourth quarter from 15.8% a year ago.\nOn the apartment supply side, we expect 2023 national new supply to run at record levels. But we generally feel good about the direct level of competition that we will face, given our market mix and importantly, the location of supply within markets relative to our properties.\nThe Sunbelt markets, including the Dallas Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta markets in which we are increasingly investing in Denver, will see higher relative supply numbers in our coastal established markets and likely more impact especially if that's coupled with the job slowdown.\nIn terms of supply in our coastal established markets, where we still have 95% of our properties, our internal research indicates that new apartments delivered near to our properties creates significantly more short-term pressure on our results. As we look at 2023's expected deliveries through that lens, new supply within close proximity to our properties in our coastal established markets is actually forecasted to be below pre-pandemic levels with only the Washington, D.C. and Orange County markets screening is delivering above-average supply close to our properties relative to these pre-pandemic supply averages.\nAnd over the next decade, the significant net deficit of housing across the country sets us up for good long-term demand. We do, however, fully acknowledge that despite what was good GDP growth in the fourth quarter and full year and continuing strong employment reports, the Federal Reserve's rate actions are likely to pressure job growth and economic growth as 2023 progresses.\nWe took this into account in our guidance by assuming a lower rate of rental rate growth during 2023 than usual and a decline in occupancy. But whether there is or isn't a technical recession, is of considerably less importance to us, than whether job growth substantially declines and if so, when.\nA decline at the beginning of our spring leasing season will be considerably more impactful than a slowdown later in the year. We also now expect that the elevated post-pandemic level of bad debt in some of our California markets does improve in '23, but at a slower rate than we had previously hoped as poor public policies encouraging delinquency continue. Bob will discuss all this in a moment.\nIn sum, we make no prediction about a recession, but have assumed some impact to our 2023 results from a job slowdown and flawed government policy and addictions while continuing to see sources of strength in our business in the form of modest forward competition from home purchases and new apartment supply, the high employment ability of our residents even if the job market deteriorates from its current lofty levels and a positive forward momentum from our strong 2022 results.\nOn the transaction front, there was not much activity in 2022 for us. We only purchased one deal and we sold three others, two in New York City and one in Washington, D.C. We did start a handful of new developments. These were mostly in our toll joint venture structure.\nAs we head into 2023, the transaction markets remain unsettled but we see higher than usual supply in the Sunbelt and Denver markets in which we wish to expand as hopefully creating buying opportunities for us later in the year. For now, our guidance does not assume any acquisition or disposition activity but remain committed to our strategy of shifting capital out of California, New York and Washington, D.C. and into our expansion markets of Denver, Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta as well as the suburbs in markets like Seattle and Boston, assuming appropriate opportunities present themselves. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael L. Manelis\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Mark, and thanks to everybody for joining us today. This morning, I will review key takeaways from our fourth quarter 2022 performance, expectations for 2023 and provide some color on the markets before I turn it over to Bob to walk through our financial guidance.\n2022 same-store revenue growth of 10.6% was the best in EQR's history of nearly 30 years as a public company. Reported turnover for both the full year and the fourth quarter was the lowest in the company's history reflecting great demand that produced high occupancy and significant pricing power.\nIn most of our markets, we had a supercharged spring leasing system with more robust pricing power that started earlier than usual in the year. Rents peaked in August, which is typical and then started to seasonally moderate, which is also typical.\nThe seasonal moderation was a little more pronounced than we originally expected and likely due to a combination of rents reaching such a high peak, along with less pricing power than expected as we ended the year. Given current uncertainty about the economy, including increasing layoff announcements, this moderation isn't surprising, though the January employment report that Mark just mentioned was very encouraging.\nSitting here today, we have good occupancy with solid demand across our markets. Our dashboards and current leasing momentum continue to signal a normal spring.\nLet me take a minute and walk through the building blocks of our guidance range of 4.5% to 6% revenue growth. This is an updated look to what we provided in our third quarter management presentation.\nSo first, we start with an embedded growth of 4.2% for 2023, this is slightly below the midpoint of the range we talked about in the third quarter of 4% to 5%, but mostly consistent with expectations and takes into account the additional concessions used in the fourth quarter.\nNext, we expect strong occupancy for 2023 at 96.2%, which includes a continuation of low resident turnover, but is 20 basis points lower than that of 2022. Finally, we're assuming blended rates in 2023 will average approximately 4% for the full year. This assumption incorporates capturing our 1.5% loss to lease along with approximately 2.5% intraperiod growth in rates.\nThis intraperiod growth assumes a positive impact from less overall pressure from competitive new supply and acknowledge some potential headwinds for a softening economy.\nFor your reference, in a normal non-recessionary year, we would expect intraperiod growth to be about 3% to 3.5% with us capturing about half of that gain in same-store revenue. The first half of 2023 will benefit from the momentum we had last year, while the back half of the year faces tougher comps and could feel the impact of the economy as the year progresses.\nThe contribution of this blended rate growth to revenue will be approximately half as we capture it over the 2023 leasing season. Add all of that up, and the implication is revenue growth over 6%, which would be exceptional after a remarkable 2022.\nThe midpoint of our guidance range, however, is 5.25%, which is lower because we do not expect bad debt net to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2023, and it continues to work against us this year due to a lack of expected government rental systems and the extension of the eviction moratoriums in both L.A. and Alameda Counties. Bob will go into more detail on bad debt net, including our assumptions in his prepared remarks.\nThe outlook I just described is based on a belief that while the economy may be slowing, our business continues to demonstrate a number of favorable drivers and resiliency. As we have often said in the past, we focus on our dashboards while also acknowledging the headlines. While keeping in mind that this is very early in the year, when we look at our dashboards today, the portfolio is demonstrating sequential improvement in both pricing trends and application volume as we would expect which, by all indications, is a typical pre-pandemic setup for the spring leasing season.\nNew York and Boston will be two of our top performers in 2023 after delivering strong results in 2022. In San Francisco and Seattle, we are seeing good demand and sequential improvement in pricing with slight reductions in both the quantity and value of concessions being offered since the beginning of the year.\nEven with this modest improvement, the overall level of concessions are still elevated, resulting in weaker than anticipated pricing power. San Francisco and Seattle have been slower to recover than the other markets, but both posted really good revenue growth in 2022. Both cities have been balancing a combination of quality-of-life issues in their downtown, which are getting better and a delayed return to the office from large tech employers.\nIn addition, there have been some layoff announcements from companies based in these two cities. These layoffs are a direct result of excessive hiring during the pandemic. This excess was spread across multiple markets and countries, not just Seattle and San Francisco. The remote nature of work in tech during the pandemic, along with these hiring sprees, likely means that the layoffs are more geographically dispersed than in prior periods.\nBoth of these cities remain hubs of the tech industry and share an entrepreneurial spirit that will continue to incubate the next big idea, be it AI or other innovations we find changing our lives a decade from now.\nThe midpoint of our guidance range assumes that these markets continue to improve modestly as we get into the spring leasing season, but overall weakness persists, which is why our intraperiod growth assumptions for the company overall is somewhat lower than the typical 3% to 3.5% range.\nIf San Francisco and Seattle get some traction this year, they could have a significant positive impact on our same-store revenue growth as could a more rapid improvement in bad debt net leading us to the higher end of our range. Reaching the bottom end of our range would require either rate growth to slow much earlier in the year than expected or occupancy to dip to the mid-95% range for a sustained period of time.\nAnd lastly, before I turn it over to Bob to discuss our guidance, I want to spend a minute on our focus on innovation. On the revenue side, we will continue to focus on other income items like Wi-Fi parking and amenity rate optimization. We will also leverage data and analytics to create opportunities to expand our operating margin. We have been a sector leader in limiting same-store expense growth and this is attributable to our team's willingness to embrace innovation and initiatives focused on centralized activities.\nWe are driven to get the most out of the portfolio and continue to have great success in creating efficiencies in our sales and office functions.\nIn 2023, we will complete the centralization of on-site activities such as application processing and our move-out and collection process. On the service side, we will continue to leverage our mobile platform to create more opportunities to share our resources across multiple properties.\nI want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to the residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results. With that, I will turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert A. Garechana\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Michael. Let me start with bad debt, which should round out our thought process on same-store revenue guidance, followed up with a little commentary on same-store expenses, normalized FFO and the balance sheet.\nAs Michael mentioned, the midpoint of our same-store revenue guidance assumes a 90-basis point reduction in revenue growth due to the impact of bad debt. As we mentioned during last quarter's call, the biggest driver of this drag is the lack of rental relief payments in 2023 relative to 2022. Specifically, we received a little over $32 million in rent relief in 2022 that isn't in the numbers in 2023. And while we ended last year with more residents paying their rent than when we started the year, a trend that we would expect to continue, our forecast doesn't assume this will be significant enough to offset this lack of rental assistance.\nUnfortunately, recent delays in lifting eviction moratoriums and slow processing within the courts led us to this more cautious forecast that reflects a more modest improvement coming later in the year than we had initially hoped for. We're hopeful that discussion might be unwarranted, in which case we could achieve the top end of our guidance range. But for now, we still expect delinquency to return to pre-pandemic levels, but more likely in 2024 than in 2023.\nTurning to expenses. I'm proud to report that in 2022, we once again continued to execute on our strategy of using technology and centralization to reduce exposure to labor pressures. Same-store payroll expense growth was negative for the second year in a row and even when combining payroll with repairs and maintenance, a line item with significant labor exposure and product inflation, growth was below 3% for the second year in a row again.\nCombine that with low real estate taxes, and we were able to deliver industry low expense growth. For 2023, the midpoint of our same-store expense guidance is 4.5%. This forecasted growth rate is about 100 basis points higher than what I just described for 2022, but well below both inflation and our revenue guidance. Meaning we expect 2023 to be another year of operating margin expansion for the company.\nOf the four major categories of expenses, repairs and maintenance and utilities should grow at a pace slower than 2022 while real estate taxes and payroll should be faster. These latter two categories faced challenging comparable periods given 2022's remarkable performance in addition to the following drivers: for real estate taxes, we expect municipalities will recognize the great strong income performance for multifamily in 2022, and as a result, take a more aggressive approach to assess values and rates.\nTotal tax growth should be around 4% up from 1% in 2022, with California continuing to benefit from Prop 13 at the low end of growth and expansion markets like Colorado, Texas and Georgia towards the higher end. These expansion markets are a small part of our same-store portfolio and the expected growth is consistent with what we underwrote on acquisition.\nFor payroll, we expect 2023 growth to be around 3.5% up from the decline of 2% that I just mentioned in 2022 and still well below typical wage inflation. We believe we can achieve this target through our continued discipline around staffing and optimization of our workflow.\nTurning to normalized FFO. Page 2 of the release provides a detailed reconciliation of our forecasted contributors to NFFO growth. Our midpoint of $3.75 per share includes a $0.01 of forecasted casualty losses from the California rainstorms that we mentioned in the release and results in over 6% year-over-year NFFO growth, a very solid year for the company.\nFinally, some comments on our planned financing activity for 2023 and the balance sheet. We mentioned in the past that we have an $800 million secured debt pool coming due, most of which needs to be refinanced in the secured market later this year. The current rate on the pool is 4.21% and the maturity is in November. The pool is very financeable given it is roughly 50% levered and covers debt service nearly 2x.\nWe have favorably hedged more than half the treasury risk on the financing and would expect to be able to refinance later in the year at a 5% rate or better, which is also incorporated in our guidance. After that, the company has no maturities to speak of until June of 2025. We have low floating rate exposure, the lowest leverage in our history, significant debt capacity and ample liquidity, supported by our recently recast revolver that will support our future capital allocation activities. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.\n\nMartin J. McKenna\n\nFirst VP of Investor & Public Relations, Equity Residential\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's Third Quarter 2022 Results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer. Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, is here with us as well for the Q&A.\nOur earnings release and accompanying management presentation are posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\n\nMark J. Parrell\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Equity Residential\n\nThank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results.\nAs you could see from our press release, Equity Residential had an outstanding quarter. Our revenue results in the quarter were driven by steady occupancy, continuing strong renewal rate growth and decelerating but still above trend, new lease rate growth.\nWe couple that with a continuation of modest expense growth leading the same-store NOI growth for the quarter of an exceptional 16.2%. With continuing positive financial leverage, this led to a 19.5% increase in quarter-over-quarter normalized funds from operations. We are proud to have improved margins and created substantial cash flow growth in the turbulent time in the economy.\nI congratulate my colleagues across Equity Residential for their hard work, taking care of our residents and their fellow employees and producing these impressive financial results.\nWe know at this late point in the year, the focus naturally turns to 2023. As usual, we are not giving guidance at this time, but in the management presentation we posted last night, we tried to frame the material factors that will drive next year's revenue results. In a moment, Michael will take you through those factors in some detail. We remind you that the success we've had in 2022 will create a challenging comparable period. So we continue to expect a moderation in 2023 annual same-store revenue growth even if, as we expect, 2023 as a strong above-trend year.\nLooking at it from the top of the house, we like our affluent renter customer and what we expect will be their financial and employment resiliency going into uncertain times. Our target resident is high-earning and employed in knowledge industries, with more durable incomes and employment prospects.\nThe college graduate cohort, which we believe makes up the vast majority of our residents has an unemployment rate of 1.8% and compared to the 3.5% overall unemployment rate. Even if layoffs materialize, we believe that the tighter-than-average labor market for these knowledge workers will allow them to find replacement jobs quickly.\nFinally, although high inflation has impacted everyone's real incomes, our affluent renter is relatively more insulated due to their higher incomes and lower rent-to-income ratios. The average income for the residents who signed new leases with us in the past 12 months is $174,000 or 12% higher than the group we signed with us in the 12 months ending September 2021. These new residents are paying us slightly less than 20% of their income and rent, which is generally consistent with prior rent-to-income levels.\nOn the apartment supply side, we see national apartment deliveries reaching a cycle-high point in 2023. However, in the coastal markets where most of our properties are still located, we see supply as being lower and being delivered further away from our properties than in the past and thus likely less impactful. The Sunbelt markets, including the Denver, Dallas Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta markets in which we are increasingly investing, will see higher relative supply numbers than our coastal established markets and likely more impact, especially if that's coupled with the job slowdown.\nFor us, this may turn into a nice opportunity to acquire assets in these expansion markets, not necessarily at fire-sale prices, but at better values than prevailed in the first half of 2022 when we felt that the market was overheated and chose to stay on the sidelines. We continue to see our strategy of having more balanced portfolio between our established and expansion markets as appropriate as we follow our affluent renter to these new markets and mitigate regulatory and resiliency risks, from overconcentration in any market or in any state.\nIn addition, other housing alternatives remain expensive and in low supply. Though they have been declining of late, current single-family home prices continue to be at record levels, while rising mortgage rates have further stressed affordability, particularly for first-time homebuyers. Single-family housing starts are declining, existing homeowners are more reluctant to sell due to low locked-in mortgage rates along with minimal and expensive for sale replacement options, and competition for homes from investors remain strong.\nGoing against these positive factors for our business is a significant impact of inflation on the economy, where job growth goes in response to the Federal Reserve's actions as well as volatility in the capital markets, the continuing impact of the war in Ukraine and a myriad of other uncertainties. We are currently in an excellent spot but acknowledge that the risks and uncertainties are more elevated than usual.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis.\n\nMichael L. Manelis\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Mark, and thanks to everybody for joining to us today. I'm going to give some brief comments regarding current market conditions, and then we can turn it over to the operator for question and answers.\nWe just completed one of the best leasing seasons in our history. Strong demand across our markets produced high occupancy as well as continued pricing power. As we think about the trajectory of our pricing for the full year, we clearly benefited from a supercharged spring leasing season with more robust pricing power that started earlier in the spring in many markets than we have traditionally seen. This strength led us to adjust our same-store revenue guidance upward in July and to set our current expectations slightly above the midpoint or at 10.6% for the full year 2022 which is the best same-store revenue growth in our history.\nIn both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics which demonstrate the strength of the leasing season and the fundamentals that position this portfolio well for 2023. This includes updates on the percentage of our residents renewing with us, which remains very healthy and is now consistent with historical levels after some moderation in the summer, which was expected as we were moving residents to current market rents. This performance supports occupancy, which continues to be solid at 96.2% even as we enter the slower part of the leasing season.\nAs you can see on Page 4 of the accompanying management presentation and as we disclosed in our August 31 press release, our rents peaked in the first week of August and moderated, which is typical for this time of the year. Seattle and San Francisco are the 2 markets that stand out with more recent moderation than anticipated. Concessions are being used more than declines in rental rate in these markets to drive traffic. All other markets are basically in line with normal rent seasonality. And overall, we continue to have good demand for our units in all of our markets with strong foot traffic, which is generally in line with our historical averages for this time of year.\nWhile we see the same headlines as everyone else on tech hiring freezes and some layoffs, our revenue performance is holding up although we readily admit that we are a lagging indicator. Right now, New York and Southern California continue to lead in both same-store revenue growth performance and our overall current pricing fundamentals.\nSeattle and San Francisco, while producing strong annual same-store revenue growth are the markets that have struggled through the most of the year to gain meaningful momentum. Longer term, these 2 markets present growth opportunities as they continue to be under-housed and have the potential to show improvement very quickly with the infusion of more certainty of jobs.\nAs Mark mentioned, we are not providing 2023 guidance this quarter, but we understand that 2023 is top of mind. As a result, we provided a framework of helpful building blocks for same-store revenue and expense growth which you can find on Pages 5 through 8 of the management presentation.\nWe would expect 2023 to produce quite good above historical average revenue growth based on activity already built into the rent roll from excellent rent growth that occurred in 2022. We call this our forecasted embedded growth, which reflects the contribution to next year's revenue growth assuming no changes to the rent roll occur. We expect this to be about 4.5% by year-end. For historical context, in a normal year, our forecasted embedded growth would be just above 1%. You can see this on Page 6 of the presentation.\nIn addition to this favorable embedded growth, we are positively positioned for leasing activity in 2023 moving forward. Our loss to lease which refers to the revenue improvement we can expect from moving leases in place today to current market levels is significantly larger than historical years as evident on Page 7. Our current loss to lease of approximately 5% will seasonally moderate through year-end, but certainly positions us for growth when leases mature and we capture this loss in '23. For historical context, our loss to lease would be about 50 basis points at the end of a typical non-recessionary year.\nWith that set up in mind, let's not forget about actual market rent growth during 2023 and its contribution to same-store revenue growth. Current visibility here is most opaque. While our business has strong long-term fundamentals, the uncertainty around future economic conditions that Mark just mentioned is high. This 2023 intraperiod growth should remain healthy as favorable demographics, continued low employment rates in our target demographic, strong income growth and less direct supply pressure in many of our markets point to the potential to see a strong spring lease season. That being said, 2023 is unlikely to be as robust as the unprecedented rent growth numbers of 2022.\nOn the occupancy side, general demand trends, including improving retention, supports strong occupancy above 96% for the balance of 2022 and should carry through into 2023, unless there is a substantial loss of jobs in our target renter demographic. Outside of occupancy and the core revenue drivers that I just discussed, Bad debt net will likely continue to play a role in revenue growth as we expect the trend of reduced levels of resident delinquency to continue into 2023.\nThe lack of governmental rental assistance in '23 compared to the $31 million we will receive in 2022 will require continued improvement in resident behavior -- payment behaviors in order to return us closer to historical norms and contribute positively to revenue growth. An improved regulatory environment, coupled with the high quality of our affluent renter should lead us in this direction, but 2023 may be a bit of a transition year to get all the way there.\nSwitching to same-store expense growth. As you can see in the press release, 2022 benefited from limited growth in property tax expense and great controls of our payable expenses and as a result, we expect to produce same-store expense growth of 3.3% for the full year 2022. As we described in the management presentation, if the inflationary environment continues as it is today, we would expect expense growth in '23 to be elevated from these industry-leading levels in 2022.\nWhile we expect that less controllable areas like real estate tax may come under more pressure, we remain focused on initiatives that can assist in moderating growth in areas that are more controllable like payroll and repairs and maintenance. We have had great success in creating efficiencies in our sales and office functions with over half of our portfolio running with shared resources, and we expect that to continue to benefit us in 2023 as we centralize on-site activities such as application processing and our move-out and collection process.\nOn the service side of the business, we continue to leverage our mobile platform to create more opportunities to pad our resources across multiple properties. We also will strategically leverage third parties for outsourcing turns and assisting with after-hours work to reduce overtime pressure in the portfolio.\nOverall, we are well positioned to continue the trend of expanding our fully loaded net operating margin, which currently sits around 69% into 2023.\nI want to give a quick shout-out to our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to the residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session."

We also believe that the desire for more space due to work from home and COVID-related health concerns, has resulted in significant incremental household formation, creating additional demand for our properties.\nAlso, housing alternatives remain expensive and in low supply. Single-family home prices reached record levels in 2022 while rising mortgage rates have further stressed affordability, particularly for first-time homebuyers.\nSingle-family housing starts are declining. Existing homeowners are more reluctant to sell due to low locked in mortgage rates, along with minimal and expensive for sale replacement options and competition for homes from investors remain strong.\nThe near-term apartment supply picture also remains favorable starts within close proximity to our properties in our coastal markets are still at or below pre-pandemic levels. In addition, it seems likely to us that over the next few quarters, new apartment starts should decline due to reduced availability and higher pricing of construction financing, increasing construction costs and continued supply chain disruptions, lengthening construction times and increasing developer risk.\nRecently elevated inflation numbers are certainly a concern, especially if efforts to rein in inflation lead to much weaker job growth. On the positive side, our affluent renter base should be able to better weather rising inflation in part due to lower relative rent-to-income ratios and higher amounts of disposable income. As in the past, if inflation does persist, we would expect the apartment business to perform relatively well. As we look at our resident income, the average income for our residents who sign new leases with us in the last 12 months is 13% higher than the group who signed with us in the 12 months ended June 2021. These new residents are paying us approximately 19.8% of their incomes versus 19.2% last year in rent.\nThey are not rent stressed, and they are willing to pay these rents to live in locations that support the lifestyles they seek to enjoy. On the larger topic of affordability, we see a continued need for more workforce housing and continue to support market-based affordable housing supply solutions, including zoning reform, public-private partnerships and other programs that assist in affordable housing preservation and creation.\nAs part of this support and in addition to the more than 2,600 apartment units that we already operate in affordable programs, we have funded about half of our $5 million commitment to a privately held affordable housing preservation fund that expects to preserve approximately 1,600 affordable housing units when it's fully deployed.\nNow switching gears to the investment side of our business. We saw a material slowdown in the transactions market during the quarter. Higher interest rates, especially for the floating rate debt used by many value-add buyers as well as general uncertainty about the path of the economy and evaluations led most buyers to pause. We did recently close on the sale of 2 properties in New York, 1 property for $266 million at a 3.3% disposition yield in the second quarter and another New York property for $415 million at a 3.4% disposition yield this month.\nThe properties are adjacent to each other on the Upper West side. Both properties represent pricing contracted for before the recent volatility in the apartment transaction market and our continuation of our stated strategy of lowering our New York market exposure. As we have said before, we will continue to have a meaningful exposure to the New York area, but intend to better balance our urban versus suburban exposure in our established markets like New York, while adding over time to our exposure to our expansion markets, which are attracting increasing numbers of affluent renters and have lower regulatory risks.\nFor our part, we are very comfortable letting the transaction market sort itself out and have reset our transaction guidance so it reflects only buys and sales completed to date plus 1 smaller disposition that is under a long-term contract that should close in the fourth quarter. While apartment values are not immune from the more general revaluation of risk assets going on across all asset classes, we expect apartment assets to remain in high demand from institutional buyers and for rising NOIs to partially cushion increases in cap rates. We have the balance sheet and the team ready to take advantage of any opportunities we do see, as we have done in the past.\nMoving on to development. We started 2 new developments in the quarter. The first project is $153 million densification of an existing property we own in Santa Clara, California, about 1.5 miles from Apple's headquarters. We will be demolishing 40 units in buildings built in 1972 in a highly desirable area with little supply of high-quality rental housing and replacing them with 225 new units plus significant amenities that will benefit the remaining 224 units at the property that are undergoing renovation. We are very excited about this project and expect a 6% development yield when it stabilizes.\nAt a cost per unit of about $675,000, we also like our basis as compared to recent sales comps. We're also pleased to have started this quarter, our first development project with Toll Brothers. This $82 million, 362-unit project is being built just West of downtown Fort Worth, Texas in a rapidly gentrifying area with good access to job centers and to the increasing number of nearby lifestyle amenities like restaurants, bars and entertainment venues that are appealing to young well-off renters. We expect to build this property for about $225,000 per unit.\nWe like our expected basis, and we love working with a high-quality, financially strong developer like Toll that has the experience to capably manage construction and a climate with significant inflationary cost pressures. That said, this deal is approximately 75% bought out, reducing our risk. On current rents and costs, this deal has approximately a 5.5% development yield.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael L. Manelis\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Mark. Let me start with a huge shout out to the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. They remain relentless in serving our customers and working together to deliver the strongest results in the history of our company. As expected, we had a very good second quarter. Resident turnover remains at all-time lows with strong demand driving robust pricing power and high physical occupancy at 96.7. Pricing trend, which is the net effective price of our units inclusive of concessions, has grown almost 10% since the beginning of the year, which is well above the 6% range that it historically characterized a very good year. This pricing strength has contributed to an unprecedented new lease change with July expected to be about 16.5% and a significant loss to lease of 12.5%.\nJuly's moderation in the new lease change is less than we expected and is caused by a more challenging 2021 comparable period, not a loss in operating momentum as our sequential rents continue to grow. Our current position will contribute to continued above-average second half revenue growth and strong embedded growth for 2023.\nOur residents are well employed, and as Mark just mentioned, seeing their incomes rise. The unemployment rate for the college educated continues to be below 3%. And while we see the same headlines that you do about slowdowns in hiring or even layoffs, we are not seeing any impact on new leases or renewals. And our operating dashboards continue to flash green. Given the amount of hiring that the tech firms have done over the last few years, even with the moderation, they are still employing more people than they did pre-pandemic.\nThe tenure of our residents has also improved to 2.3 years on average compared to 2.1 years last year, and we are losing fewer and fewer residents to home purchase as single-family homeownership gets more and more challenging. In fact, in the second quarter, we had a 22% decrease compared to the second quarter of '21 in the number of residents who moved out to buy a home. We remain aware of the economic headwinds, and we will position the portfolio more defensively if need be. But given the significant loss to lease, strong retention and healthy demand we are seeing, we remain optimistic. That said, as is true every year in our business, we expect rent growth to peak and then moderate seasonally in the summer, but we are happy to report that has not yet occurred.\nIn sum, our operating metrics and forecast for the balance of the year remain beyond historical norms, and Bob will provide more color on the building blocks of our revised guidance in his remarks.\nLet me take a minute and provide some color on market performance. In Boston, demand ramped up in both the urban and suburban submarkets driving a 90 base improvement in physical occupancy over the first quarter along with robust pricing power that came earlier in the season than usual. Rents have begun to moderate in this market. However, it is not uncommon to see modest reacceleration in August as students typically return then and are an important source of demand for our portfolio. We are definitely bullish on the second half performance, particularly in the suburban submarkets and remain cautiously optimistic on the city of Boston and Cambridge's ability to absorb some of the new units that are scheduled to be delivered later this year.\nThe market continues to have strong employment with life sciences continuing to expand their footprint. New York continues with very healthy pricing power and demand. After significant impact from the pandemic, New York same-store revenue and NOI are now fully recovered back to 2019 levels. Physical occupancy is 97%. New lease change and renewal rate achieved were robust in the second quarter, with a vibrant environment continuing to attract our affluent renter demographic who is well employed and can afford to pay our rent. Despite these rental increases, our new residents are still paying us only approximately 18% of their income, and our data indicates that our rents in this market have grown more slowly over the last 3 years of our new renters.\nThe Washington, D.C. market continues to perform well with physical occupancy at 96.7, and good growth in both new lease and renewals in the quarter. The absorption of new supply was good in the first half of the year, but we're keeping an eye on it as the year progresses. There are more than 12,500 units being delivered in 2022 with over 7,000 of them coming in the back half of the year from a competitive leasing standpoint.\nThe absorption rate slowed a little bit in the second quarter, but still remains very strong and at current level, should support continued pricing power. While this market has historically shown high levels of supply, it is also one of the most resilient in the country during periods of uncertainty. The D.C. area unemployment rate has returned to pre-pandemic levels, and sits below the national average with good growth in the professional services and education health categories where many of our residents are employed.\nHeading West, Denver has solid demand and good pricing power, stronger occupancy in the suburban portfolio, and we expect some pressure from new supply in the downtown submarket. The Denver job market continues to enjoy healthy growth across a number of sectors, including the professional and business services.\nIn Seattle, continued improvement on the quality-of-life issues is helping drive the comeback in the city, which now has rents that are just over pre-pandemic levels. Physical occupancy is above 96%, and we continue to see strength in new lease rates and renewals. Concession use is isolated to the city and continues to moderate with approximately 20% of our applications receiving just under a month.\nThis is down from over 50% from the first quarter, and occupancy in the Downtown submarket is now just over 96% as compared to 93% in March. Supply impact for us in 2022 is limited to our high-rise communities in the city, while 2023 shows less direct competition from new supply overall. This market continues to demonstrate high wage job creation. And while job postings from the major employers did moderate this quarter, the number of available physicians is still near all-time record highs.\nThe San Francisco market continues to improve with high occupancy supporting growth in both new lease and renewal rents. The issues around quality of life are improving but Downtown San Francisco is still taking more time to return to pre-pandemic conditions than other markets across the country. Remember that the city was one of the last areas to ease COVID rules and just recently stepped up its focus on crime issues.\nWhile rents continue to be below pre-pandemic levels in the downtown submarket, they are working their way back. All of our other submarkets in San Francisco are at or above pre-pandemic pricing level. Overall, I would say we are very optimistic on current trends in San Francisco, but have an eye on new supply that is expected to be delivered in the back half of the year and could erode pricing power if demand slows.\nFinally, Southern California continues to perform well with physical occupancy at nearly 97% driving strong rental growth in both new lease and renewal rates.\nSpecific to Los Angeles, the market is seeing elevated new supply as compared to the past several years, but the overall market remains undersupplied. Even in submarkets like Koreatown, where we expected pressure this year, the new supply is being quickly absorbed, leaving us better pricing power than we anticipated.\nOn the delinquency front, we saw a modest improvement in the second quarter in the payment behavior of our residents and continued rental relief receipts. As we look into the second half of the year, we don't expect rental relief receipts to be as material which will lead to revenue growth moderation despite strong continued fundamentals.\nBefore I turn it over to Bob, I just want to give a quick update on some of our innovation initiatives. Innovation is a major contributor to our ability to create operating efficiencies while continuing to maintain a high level of customer service. Despite meaningful progress, we continue to have a lot of opportunity ahead of us as we integrate our initiatives, continue to leverage technology and advance our overall skill set. Just over half of our properties now operate without fully dedicated staff. We continue to invest in and implement software and processes that further enable the autonomous leasing experience, allowing customers to tour a community and interact with a member of our team or our AI leasing agent as much or as little as they desire. Self-guided tours continue to dominate as a preferred tour option with just about 90% of all tours in the second quarter being self-guided.\nWe are extremely excited about the future as we innovate to maximize revenue and minimize expense growth while continuing to provide a great experience for our residents and employees. I will now turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert A. Garechana\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Michael. A quick comment on the quarter before moving to guidance on the balance sheet. Q2 normalized FFO was $0.03 above the high end of our quarterly guidance range. This beat was almost entirely driven by better same-store NOI through a combination of better revenue growth, including lower bad debt expense and modest overall expense growth. Now for our revisions to full year guidance. As you saw in the release last night, we significantly revised same-store revenue and normalized FFO upwards while maintaining our existing same-store expense growth guidance.\nStarting with same-store revenue. Strong first half performance, coupled with the constructive ongoing operating environment has led us to raise our same-store revenue projections above the top end of the prior range. We now expect our same-store revenue to grow between 10% and 11%. Our new 10.5% midpoint sits at 150 basis points higher than the prior midpoint, driven by continued stable physical occupancy of 96.5%, record resident retention and earlier as well as stronger pricing power, both the new lease change and renewal rate achieved across all of our markets, but particularly in New York, where recovery from the pandemic has been a positive to the upside.\nOur revised full year same-store revenue guidance implies a slight deceleration in same-store revenue growth in the back half of 2022. This is the result of the significant governmental rental relief payments we received in Q3 and Q4 of 2021 and the almost complete absence of relief payments we expect to receive from the rest of this year, not any expectation of a slowdown in the core business.\nWe expect third and fourth quarter same-store quarter-over-quarter revenues without the impact of rental relief payments to be more in line with the reported Q2 number. On the expense side, we left our already strong guidance unchanged with June year-to-date expense growth of 2.8% and a number of innovation initiatives underway, we feel confident in our ability to deliver (inaudible) low expense growth for the full year.\nAs you can see in our reported results, both real estate tax growth and payroll are aiding in our ability to accomplish this goal with some offset in utilities and repairs and maintenance. We remain laser-focused on reducing or eliminating exposure to inflationary labor pressures, whether we feel the impact from our own employees through the payroll line item or from contractors through the repairs and maintenance line.\nWe strive to reduce any pressure from higher efficiency and better decision-making along with utilization of technology that can eliminate or permanently reduce labor hours needed. In a category like utilities, we do our best to maximize our resident reimbursement income, reduce usage through both education and technology initiatives and hedge our commodity exposure. Thus far, our approach has significantly buffered growth, but we acknowledge this is a long game if the current inflationary environment continues.\nPutting it all together, the revenue and expense adjustments that I just outlined resulted in a 225 basis point increase for same-store NOI at the midpoint. For normalized FFO at the midpoint our guidance changes added nearly 3% or $30 million to normalized FFO growth, which results in an approximately 18% increase year-over-year for the company.\nA final note on the balance sheet before Q&A. Equity Residential continues to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT sector, characterized by low floating rate exposure and a long weighted average maturity. Subsequent to quarter end, we sent a notice to redeem the $500 million secured unsecured notes that are due in 2023 with proceeds from the dispositions of the 2 New York properties. This use of proceeds will mostly offset the normalized FFO impact of net dispositions for the year while also significantly reducing our refinancing needs in 2023.\nThere is no prepayment penalty associated with the payoff, but there will be a modest write-off of historical discounts and costs, which is estimated on the guidance page. This write-off will be included in EPS and FFO but not in normalized FFO.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A."

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead.\n\nMartin J. McKenna\n\nFirst VP of Investor & Public Relations, Equity Residential\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's first quarter 2022 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer; and Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, are here with us as well for the Q&A.\nOur earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.\nNow I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.\n\nMark J. Parrell\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Equity Residential\n\nThank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results. In a minute, Michael Manelis will walk you through a market update, and then we will take your questions. The growth in our business continues as evidenced by our first quarter performance. Demand is strong, and lease rates are growing faster than we expected. While we are well aware of the recent increases in economic and geopolitical uncertainties, we continue to manage our business by focusing on our operation dashboards, not on the news headlines. Those dashboards continue to nearly universally flash a green signal as our well-located properties and excellent service attract our affluent renter demographic in droves, allowing us to retain a record number of our residents and push rents up nearly everywhere we operate. All of this allowed us to increase normalized funds from operations by 13% in the quarter, and we expect this growth to accelerate over the next few quarters.\nAs we mentioned in our March operating update, our first quarter same-store revenue results were negatively impacted by an increase in delinquency in Southern California. It appears to us that a relatively small number of Southern California residents, who had previously been good payers, declined to pay rent in order to apply for state rental relief funds. While we remain open to working with residents with true COVID-related hardships, this sort of behavior is not acceptable, and we will continue to work with these residents to obtain our full rental payment. Translating all this into the numbers, first quarter same-store revenue results were about 125 basis points lower than we anticipated due to these higher bad debt, partially offset by about 25 basis points of better rate growth, leaving the final quarterly same-store revenue number about 100 basis points lower than we expected when we gave you guidance back in very early February 2022. Normalized funds from operations in the quarter ended up being about $0.01 lower than we expected with a $0.02 per share or about $6 million hit from higher bad debt, offset by the better rate performance I just mentioned, and the better-than-expected expense performance that I'll discuss in a moment. As we think about the full year, we feel that we are in a stronger operating position than we had initially contemplated in our full year guidance with a better lease rate growth trajectory more than offsetting our now more cautious view of delinquency.\nTurning to expenses. Our residents appreciate the increasingly seamless digital experience we are providing them, which in turn allows us to establish smaller and more focused property management team. As a result of these efficiencies as well as low property tax expense growth, we're able to deliver 2.5% same-store quarter-over-quarter expense growth in an increasingly inflationary climate. We look forward to continuing to drive innovation and to expanding our operating margins over the balance of the year, while creating remarkable experiences for our customers and for our employees. On the transaction side, as we expected, we did not have much activity in the first quarter. We purchased 1 asset in San Diego that we discussed in the release and after the quarter end, sold 1 asset in New York.\nWith that, I'm going to ask Michael to fill you in on the operating details. Go ahead, Michael.\n\nMichael L. Manelis\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Mark. We are pleased to report that we are seeing pricing power ahead of our expectations. Strong demand is being driven by the desire of affluent residents to live in our well-located properties, both urban and suburban. We have talked in previous calls about the recovery in our business being connected more to the lifestyle that our residents crave and less to how many days workers are expected to be in the office and that pattern continues. I have visited several of our markets over the last few months, and I am excited by the vibrancy that I'm seeing. We reported 96.4% occupancy for the quarter, which is 140 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2021 and in line with our expectations. First quarter reported turnover of 8.7% was over 100 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2021 and represents the lowest reported turnover in the history of our company. This trend reaffirms the desirability of our product as our existing residents signed renewals at record levels with increases that averaged 11.9% in the first quarter. This trend continues into the second quarter with preliminary April renewal increases averaging 12.5% with approximately 60% of our residents renewing. We are limiting rate negotiations given the strength and demand of new residents willing to pay full price to live in our communities. As we begin our primary leasing season, we feel really good about our pricing position, which includes the near elimination of concession usage across the portfolio outside of Seattle and is translating into robust new lease change performance with April on track to deliver just over 17.5% new lease growth after posting over 15% in the first quarter.\nNow let me give you some color on the markets. Beginning with Boston, Boston is following normal seasonal patterns with improving demand and pricing heading towards the spring. We're almost 97% occupied and the market is benefiting from the big college campuses being opened, and the return of international students and workers and the continued strong demand drivers from lab and life sciences, financial firms, health care and education. Competition from new supply will be modest, and market performance should be strong. New York continues to thrive and was our best performing market in the first quarter with same-store residential revenue growth of 13.6% or 96.9% occupied and continue to expect this market to be our best performer in 2022. Demand is robust. We're renewing about 60% of our residents, which is healthy, but 5% lower to move out versus paying the higher current price, but it is not higher rates. We still expect to feel some pressure from new supply in the Jersey Waterfront and Brooklyn later this year. Washington, D.C. is performing as expected with residential same-store revenue growth of 3% in the first quarter. This market was our best performing East Coast market in 2021, and as I've mentioned in the past, has the least ground to make up. As is often the case in D.C., new supply is likely to pressure rate growth in the market, but the metro area continues to boast record absorption. Strong employment across job sectors in the market is driving this demand, and we are 96.7% occupied. We are renewing about 60% of our residents and feel good about our positioning for the spring leasing season.\nBefore I talk about our West Coast markets, let me give you a little color on our expansion markets. Denver continues to demonstrate very strong demand. We're almost 98% occupied and delivered same-store revenue growth of almost 13% in the first quarter. Despite turnover being on the higher end, we are seeing very good pricing power and healthy occupancy. In Atlanta, our acquisitions are performing ahead of their performance as the market continues to produce strong rent growth. Dallas and Austin continue to enjoy robust demand driven by very good in-migration and job growth in these markets.\nNow to the West Coast. Seattle continues to be slow to recover compared to the other markets, particularly in the downtown submarket. The good news is that the city's new mayor is focused on the quality of life issues, which we expect will have a positive impact. Also, job postings in the market are at the highest level we have seen with Amazon leading the pack with over 19,000 positions posted with 16,000 of them being in the city of Seattle, which is a good sign for future apartment demand. Market occupancy in Seattle currently sits just above 95%, which remains behind our expectations and turnover, albeit within historical norms, was the highest of all of our markets. The suburban portfolio is outperforming the city with the Bellevue, Redmond submarket seeing immediate demand improvement in March after Microsoft's returned to the office announcement. Year-to-date pricing remains flat in the downtown submarket with approximately 60% of new applications receiving a concession at just over a month and occupancy in this submarket is at 93%. Overall, we expect continued strength in the suburban portfolio and remain optimistic that pricing power and occupancy will improve in the downtown submarket as we are just now beginning to see signs of increasing demand as the quality of life issues continue to slowly improve.\nSan Francisco has also lagged the recovery, but at the moment, feels on stronger footing than Seattle. We are very encouraged by the recent announcements from Mayor Breed and the local large employers about a commitment to bringing office workers back to the city, which should help address quality of life issues downtown. There has been consistently good demand and early signs of improved pricing power that the market lacked in 2021. We're almost 97% occupied and resident retention has improved from a year ago. Google, which has asked workers to return this month, made a recent announcement that it is investing more than $3.5 billion in California, including a big chunk in the Bay Area with significant projects in Mountain View, Sunnyvale and Downtown San Jose, all areas where we have a significant number of communities. Pricing trend has increased almost 6.5% since the beginning of the year, which is better than the normal seasonal expectations, which would be in the 4% to 5% range. While this market's pricing remains below pre-pandemic levels, the good news is that initial indicators point to a continued strong recovery of the market.\nNow let me move to Southern California, 3 markets that have performed exceptionally well, but for elevated delinquency. First, Orange County and San Diego continue to show remarkable performance with high occupancy and strong retention, supporting very good new lease rents. Home prices in these markets are out of reach for many of our residents, which is evident by the significant decline in move-out, citing this reason during the quarter. We expect to see continued record high retention likely impacted by the local regulations limiting our allowable increases, increasing home prices and very limited competitive new supply. The result of these factors should allow us to maintain elevated pricing power throughout the year in these markets. Next, Los Angeles. Even with elevated delinquency, L.A. continues to be a star performer. The entertainment content creation business is really thriving and driving demand. Occupancy is almost 97% and pricing power is strong and better than expected. The urban markets performance is now on par with the suburban portfolio, a scenario which we have not seen since the onset of the pandemic. The percent of residents renewing is the highest we have seen likely due to the impact of the local regulations limiting our allowable renewal increases, and we expect to continue to renew between 60% and 70% of our residents.\nNow that rent relief coverage is no longer available for April 2022 rents, we have seen an early uptick in payment activity, but remain cautious. I was in Southern California 2 weeks ago, and I am very encouraged by what I saw. Our on-site teams continue to actively engage our nonpaying residents and are just now beginning to see a few positive signs either through payments being made or in some cases, residents deciding to move out and give us their apartments. Overall, the strength in demand and quality of our portfolio clearly points to above-average performance for our Southern California markets as the delinquency issue slowly clears. On the innovation front, we finished deploying our centralized renewal process in the first quarter and are now focused on centralizing our application process. As we mentioned last quarter, the foundation of our operating platform is in place and we are focused on further process automation and multisite coverage that will create additional efficiencies while continuing to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers and provide them a seamless digital customer experience.\nLet me thank the entire equity residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. These are exciting times for our industry and the overall operations of our company. Not only are we on track to have a very strong year of financial performance, but we are also advancing our platform. Resident expectations are constantly evolving, and our teams continue to focus on leveraging technology to meet those needs and drive operational excellence.\nThank you. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session."

Parrell\n\nPresident, CEO & Trustee, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Marty, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This morning, I'll make some remarks about what we see driving our operating results and cash flow growth this year and going forward. And I will comment on our capital allocation program and what the company will look like when it's complete. After that, Michael Manelis will review our operating performance and outlook for 2022 same-store revenue.\nBob Garechana will spend a few moments discussing our innovation activities and their impact on our business, and then we'll go ahead and take your questions. We're very excited about the prospects for our business in 2022 and beyond. Our affluent resident base is well employed and receiving healthy raises and they are renewing with us at record levels. The robust demand for apartment living in both urban and suburban locations is driving high occupancy and the lowest resident turnover in our history.\nOur same-store revenue guidance calls for 9% growth at the midpoint, while our normalized funds from operations should grow at about 15%, both of which would be the best performance in our history. Cash flow from our business is likewise poised to grow strongly. We see this as the beginning of what should be a good run of performance as we welcome the 67 million member strong Generation Z to the rentership world, and as we continue to attract and retain millennials, with our flexible product offerings and a price point that is increasingly affordable relative to surging single-family housing costs.\nThat said, we are aware of the recent storm clouds on the horizon in the general economy, which include high inflation and related concerns about how the Federal Reserve will manage short-term rates in its balance sheet as well as continuing supply chain disruptions and unfortunately, the latest COVID variant. While we are not immune to these pressures, a considerable amount of our expected 2022 revenue growth is already baked into our results in the form of leases recently signed at higher rates as well as an expectation that even if rental rates do not rise in 2022, resetting leases to current market levels will provide a significant revenue boost.\nIn 2023 and beyond, our ability to reset lease rates annually should create a natural hedge in a more inflationary world. We also continue to successfully execute on our expense control management with 3% growth in 2021 and a midpoint expectation of 3% growth in 2022 despite the impact of inflation on many costs in the economy. We run an incredibly efficient platform and continue to harness technology to control expenses, enhance the customer experience and grow our operating margin.\nBob will comment on all of this in a moment. Switching over to investments. We had a very active year on that side of the business, with $1.7 billion each in acquisitions and dispositions as well as progress in ramping up our development activities. We continue to optimize our portfolio by successfully recycling out of older assets and deploying capital into newer assets in our expansion markets and the suburbs of our established markets.\nOur 17 acquired properties have an average age of 2 years as compared to our 14 disposition assets with an average age of 30 years, and we're recycling all this capital while not diluting earnings. Our 2021 transaction activity on both the buy and sell side was done at an average cap rate of approximately 3.8%. In 2022, we expect to both sell and buy approximately $2 billion in assets. Our acquisition activity is focused on building out our portfolios in Atlanta, Dallas, Fort Worth, Denver and Austin as well as adding select assets in the suburbs of our existing markets. We continue to see great opportunities in our markets and expect to deploy $2 billion into them in 2022.\nOn the development front, we commenced construction on approximately $450 million in development projects during 2021 and expect to deliver high-quality properties in Denver, suburban New York and Central Washington, D.C. in several years. We also completed the construction of our $400 million Alcott Tower in Central Boston during the quarter, and we're pleased to report that the lease-up is going very well.\nIn terms of the development pipeline. In the quarter, we entered into 4 separate development joint ventures, in Texas and in Colorado with the Colorado joint venture beginning construction in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the other 3 expected to do so in 2022. These 3 parcels are the first in our development program with Toll Brothers. As we have discussed with you before, we are reshaping our portfolio to reflect the demand trend we see of some affluent renters spreading out from the coast and congregating in markets like Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth and Denver. We also see a similar but more local dispersion trend in our coastal markets as another group of higher-income renters move to the suburbs of our established markets like Bellevue, Washington, near Seattle; and Burlington, Massachusetts near Boston.\nNow we've always had a presence in the suburban submarkets of our established markets. So what I'm talking about here is just creating a little more balance between urban and suburban markets. We will also continue to have a substantial investment in the urban centers of our markets, and those will continue to attract, we think, high-quality renters seeking to enjoy the many amenities of urban living. Driven by our analytical research and informed by our long experience in the apartment business, we seek to build and buying newer assets in urban and suburban locations in these markets where we see demand from higher renters as being high and likely to grow where single-family housing is expensive relative to renting and where supply is manageable.\nWe expect our refined portfolio to have about 1/3 of its assets in the 3 Northeastern markets of Boston, New York and Washington, D.C., with a reduction in exposure coming from New York and Washington, D.C. dispositions. We see approximately 1/3 or maybe a bit more of the portfolio being in California with divestments there occurring in challenging regulatory locations and of older assets.\nThe remaining 1/3 or so of the company will be concentrated in a diagonal from Seattle through Denver, to Austin and Dallas, Texas and over to Atlanta, Georgia. We think this distinct portfolio of newer, less capital-intensive assets in the 12-or-so most desirable metros for more affluent renters to live will provide high and stable long-term returns. We also see reduced regulatory risk and resiliency benefits from this portfolio shift.\nAnd finally, before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to give a big thank you to all my colleagues in our offices and properties across the country. You are doing an exceptional job during very unusual times, and we're all very proud and grateful. We're in position for a great 2022, and I look forward to delighting our customers and our investors with you. Go ahead, Michael.\n\nMichael L. Manelis\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Mark. This morning, I will provide highlights on how we finish the year and give you some color on 2022 revenue guidance and market performance. So first, a big thank you to our teams across the country who have worked so hard during these trying times to deliver these results and are all geared up to make 2022 a terrific year for Equity Residential. The recovery continues despite the presence of the Omicron variant and noise from uncertainty in back-to-the-office plans with tremendous demand to live at our properties, both urban and suburban. We see reopened restaurants, entertainment venues and other lifestyle amenities as attracting our affluent resident base without regard to continuing low office occupancy rates. Absent a government-mandated closure of businesses in cities, which we see is unlikely, the lifestyle that our residents crave is again available in most of our markets and our residents are voting with their feet and [pocket books] to be in these locations whether they anticipate working fully remote, hybrid or fully in the office.\nInterestingly, we see a little less of this trend in our tech heavy Seattle and San Francisco markets, which I will discuss in a moment. We are currently 96.5% occupied and are on track to deliver about 13.5% achieved new lease growth in January after posting just over 10.5% in the fourth quarter. We reported the lowest turnover in our history for both the fourth quarter and full year 2021 which reaffirms the desirability of our product as our resident signed renewals at record levels with increases that average nearly 11% in the quarter.\nIn addition, our residents received $32 million in rent relief with $15 million of that received in the fourth quarter. This performance has positioned us well for 2022 and what we believe will be the best same-store revenue growth in our history. The majority of our 9% same-store revenue growth at the midpoint is coming from resetting existing leases at current market rates.\nAs of January 1, 83% of our residents were paying on average rents that are about 11% below our current market prices. As we have discussed in the past, we won't be able to capture all of this loss to lease in 2022 because leases will reset over the course of the year either through new move-ins or renewals, and there are currently a few regulations that cap our allowable increases.\nIn addition to capturing this reset, we are anticipating intra-year growth in rates that is more reflective of typical seasonal growth than the steep growth we experienced during the 2021 pandemic recovery year. Strong, continued physical occupancy, particularly relative to the comparably weaker period in early 2021 is also a contributor with the remaining growth projected to come from lower bad debt, improved nonresidential revenues and other income.\nSo far, we continue to see strong retention with the percent of residents renewing expected to be just over 60% in both January and February. We may see some moderation from this high level as the year goes on. But interestingly, in Q4, we did not see much disparity in renewal percent for deal seekers, those residents who had a concession on their current lease versus nondeal seekers, meaning many of our residents are deciding to stay put regardless of the rent increase. While the world remains an uncertain place, we feel good about this expected pricing power, given our net effective pricing trend is currently 27% over 2021 levels and 7% over the same pre-pandemic week in 2020.\nA key driver of this improvement is the sizable reduction in concession use in our portfolio, which is nearly nonexistent with the exception of Seattle, that I will get to in a moment as I provide color on the markets and how they are expected to contribute to 2022. Beginning with Boston, which is following a normal seasonal pattern with improving demand and pricing heading towards the spring, overall, we're 96% occupied today with a drag from the urban core at 95.5 versus the remainder of the market, which is above 96%.\nWith strong continued demand from lab and life sciences, financial firms, health care and education and very little competition from new supply, we expect this market to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 10% in 2022. Another positive note is that we continue to see a return of international students and workers to the market.\nAfter a difficult period early in the pandemic, the quick turnaround of the New York market has been really amazing. We expect New York to be our best-performing market in 2022 with same-store revenue growth of approximately 13% despite some expected pressure from new supply on the Jersey waterfront in Brooklyn.\nDemand is very strong, and we have been renewing about 65% of our residents. Occupancy remains above 97%, rates continue to improve, concessions are not being used and pricing is currently 11% over prepandemic pricing levels. We expect that Washington, D.C. will be a solid performer in 2022, but will end up as one of our lower producing revenue growth markets at about 4%. This market held up the best of our East Coast markets during the pandemic, and so does not have the same ground to make up.\nThis market also continues to deliver 12,000 or so new units each year, absorption of Class A multifamily has been really strong even during the pandemic, making us optimistic that this absorption trend will continue. Occupancy is steady at 97% and rental rates are following a slightly better-than-expected normal seasonal pattern here.\nMoving to the West Coast. Both of our tech heavy markets, Seattle and San Francisco, have been slower to recover than other markets. While there is certainly demand, the downtown submarkets are 93% and 96% occupied, respectively. The ambiguity and return to office by big tech employers and quality-of-life challenges are deferring a fuller recovery. We expect that the quality of life issues will improve through a combination of civic engagement and having more activated streetscapes.\nThe tech companies have a role to play here as they balance their growth plans versus employee preferences or work from home in a highly competitive job market. It appears likely that the balance will be met by a hybrid work model which should benefit our business in these markets. But until there is more certainty, some employees will be hesitant to make housing decisions.\nLonger term, the overall drivers of demand remain positive, and we would expect the urban centers of these markets to fully recover because they remain attractive to the many affluent renters that want to enjoy in urban lifestyle there. Also, the tech giants continue to accumulate large amounts of office space, whether through leases or whole building purchases, which indicates that their long-term plans involve some level of in office.\nWe're optimistic about Seattle's recovery and expect the market to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 10% in 2022. Our expectations are predicated on the CBD, where we have a large concentration of assets recovering in the back half of the year. Demand is improving. Initial lead and tour volume has ramped up past 2021 levels but our on-site teams are reporting a lack of sense of urgency from potential renters to sign leases right now.\nOccupancy has rebounded slightly to just over 94.5%. This market is the primary user of concessions in our portfolio with currently about 1/3 of our applications receiving on average just over 1 month free. Heading down to San Francisco, we are seeing good demand but do not yet have a lot of pricing power.\nWe expect to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 7% in 2022. San Francisco continues to be the only market in our portfolio that has not gotten back to pre-pandemic pricing levels as we are currently 6% below the same week in 2020. Occupancy is holding steady at 96.5%, and we are renewing just under 60% of our residents. Los Angeles continues to be a solid performer with demand driven by a robust return of the online content industry. Occupancy is running at 97%, pricing power is strong.\nWe expect the market to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 9% for the year. The percent of residents renewing is the highest we have seen likely due to the impact of local regulations. We expect to continue to renew 65% to 70% of our residents here. Both Orange County and San Diego continue to show remarkable performance with high occupancy and strong retention, supporting very good new lease rents.\nWe expect these markets to produce same-store revenue growth of 10% or greater in the year. In Denver, we have very good demand and expect the market to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 9% in 2022. Occupancy is strong at 97%, and we're renewing about 50% of our residents. Lastly, a few thoughts on our additional expansion markets of Atlanta, Dallas and Austin. So far, our newly acquired assets are performing well. Demand remains robust and occupancy levels are high. The expansion markets have seen good growth throughout the pandemic, and we expect that growth to continue in 2022. This is an exciting time for the industry and the overall operations of our company.\nThank you. I will now turn the call over to Bob Garechana.\n\nRobert A. Garechana\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Equity Residential\n\nThanks, Michael. Rather than go through a detailed review of our guidance assumptions, which are laid out on Page 4 and Page 27 of the release, I thought I'd take a moment to elaborate on our approach to innovation, our continued investment in our platform and how that's playing out in our financial statements in 2022 and going forward.\nOver the last couple of years, we've had impressive results in our innovation journey, and it's not over. A few highlights that our property management and operations teams have been busy rolling out. We brought mobility to both the service and sales teams to enable and enhance flexibility. We have artificial intelligence handling 80% of our communication with prospects to lower cost and provide 24/7 service. We've deployed roommate matching functionality on our website to drive additional revenue, and we've moved 97% of our tours to self-guided or virtual, all while increasing our gross rent potential by using data and analytics to improve our amenity pricing. These are only some of the examples of how we continue to advance our efforts to maximize efficiencies on site and improve revenue while meeting the ever-evolving expectations of our residents.\nWe have done so successfully through adjusting our processes, deploying new technology like the artificial intelligence I mentioned and through advancing our use of data to inform our business decisions. We have most visibly seen financial benefit from these endeavors and our ability to successfully minimize our on-site expense growth, particularly payroll.\nIn 2021, we reported negative on-site payroll after reporting less than 1% growth in the prior 2 years, and we're just getting started. Our focus moving into 2022 continues to be building upon the success we've already achieved. That means continuing to improve our digital customer experience, our business processes and to advance our sophistication and data-driven decision-making tools. This is an area in which we have historically been a leader and expect to continue to excel at going forward.\nOur approach remains focused on efficiency, marries technology and data and should reduce exposure to expense pressures while increasing revenue growth. In order to accomplish this, we're making investments in foundational areas like centralized teams, IT infrastructure and licensing and data analytics, which is driving a good portion of our forecasted overhead growth in 2022. These investments enable our progress in our innovation journey and have significant ROI that should continue to garner margin improvement benefits in 2022 and beyond.\nI'll now turn it over to the operator for the Q&A session."

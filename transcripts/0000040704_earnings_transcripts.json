Joining me for this morning's presentation are Jeff Harmening, our Chairman and CEO, and Kofi Bruce, our CFO. Before I hand things over to them, let me first touch on a few housekeeping items. First, on our website, you will find our press release that posted this morning, along with a copy of the presentation and a transcript of these remarks. Please note that today's remarks include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists several factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.\n\nAdditionally, I'm pleased to announce that General Mills will be hosting an Investor Day event at our World Headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Tuesday, October 14. We will webcast a presentation and Q&A session with senior management, highlighting our strategic priorities and long-term growth plans focused on driving remarkability across our global brands. We hope you will join us online for that session. In-person attendees will have the opportunity to engage with a broad set of business and functional leaders, experience our product news and innovation, get a firsthand view of our digital capabilities, and tour our global R&D center. For more information, please email our Investor Relations team at investor.relations@generalmills.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff.\n\nThank you, Jeff, and hello to everyone. Let me start with today's key messages. The most important job we have in fiscal 2026 is restoring volume-driven organic sales growth. To achieve this, we're leaning into what makes our brands remarkable for consumers. That means investing to strengthen our value, product news, innovation, advertising, and visibility in store and online. Price remains an important tool, especially in today's environment, but it is not sufficient to drive lasting growth. Sustainable, profitable growth comes from making sure that all elements of remarkability—product, packaging, messaging, omnichannel execution, and value—truly resonate with consumers. We've already seen proof points that give us confidence that this is the right path. In the second half of fiscal 2025, we invested to bring consumers more value in targeted businesses like Pillsbury, Totino’s, and Fruit Snacks, which enabled our product news, advertising, and in-store execution to break through more meaningfully.\n\nThe early results were encouraging, with noticeable improvement in pounds and volume share for those businesses. We've expanded our investment in remarkability in fiscal 2026, and through the first quarter, our top-line performance was in line with our expectations. We expected that the combination of higher investments and the impact of the North American yogurt divestitures would pressure our reported sales results this year. We've been closely watching our Nielsen-measured in-market performance to measure success. Thus far, we've been pleased with the results, with improved pound trends and increased volume share across most of our top 10 categories. Looking forward, we're focused on driving further improvement behind continued execution of our price investments, new advertising campaigns, stronger in-store events, and exciting innovation like Blue Buffalo’s new Love Made Fresh line of fresh pet food, which started shipping this week.\n\nWith early momentum, a continued disciplined focus on execution, and confidence in our strategies, we reaffirmed our full-year fiscal 2026 guidance this morning. Our first quarter results are summarized on slide five. We improved our competitiveness, including holding or growing pound share in eight of our top 10 U.S. categories and driving continued strong share performance in international and food service channels. Organic volume was down 1%, and organic net sales were down 3%, which were in line with our expectations and included the impact of price investments and trade phasing headwinds, as well as shipment timing headwinds in our North America pet segment. Our adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS results were both down double digits, though they finished a bit ahead of our expectations.\n\nThe profit and EPS declines in the quarter were driven largely by an eight-point reduction in reported volume, including the impact of the yogurt divestitures. We continue to manage through an evolving operating environment in fiscal 2026, with cautious consumer behavior connected to economic uncertainty, global conflicts, and changing food policy regulations. We continue to see consumers seeking value and prioritize their spending on key benefits like protein, bold flavors, and feelings of nostalgia for brands they love. In pet, we expect pet parents to continue to look for more elevated and humanized pet offerings while maintaining a focus on value. Against this consumer backdrop, we are executing against three key priorities for fiscal 2026. First, we are working to return North America retail to volume growth by investing in remarkable experiences to strengthen pound share and household penetration for our brands.\n\nSecond, we will accelerate our North America pet growth, including improving our core Blue Buffalo businesses and driving new opportunities with our Love Made Fresh launch, our recently acquired Tiki Cat business, and the rollout of Edgar and Cooper Super Premium Dog Food in the U.S. Third, to help fund these investments, we'll drive efficiencies to reinvest in growth. This means continuing to deliver best-in-class holistic margin management, or productivity and transforming how we work to free up our teams to focus on growth. As I mentioned earlier, our plans to reinvigorate growth for our brands are guided by our remarkable experience framework. By evaluating how our brands perform across five key dimensions: product, packaging, brand communication, omnichannel execution, and value, we can clearly see where we are meeting consumer expectations and where we need to raise our game to be more competitive.\n\nThis framework is the lens through which we will continue to make brand investment decisions, ensuring each business has a defined path to stronger remarkability and greater impact for consumers. Let me show you how we use remarkability to deliver results in Q1. In North America retail, our team is focused on a multi-year journey to improve the remarkability of our brands, and we have robust plans in place to strengthen all elements of the framework. We saw positive results from these plans in the first quarter, with eight of our top 10 U.S. categories holding or growing pound share, building on improved momentum we delivered in Q4 of fiscal 2025. We saw our pound trends improve sequentially from Q4 to Q1 across seven of our top 10 U.S. categories, and we grew household penetration for our U.S. portfolio for the first time in three years.\n\nOur dollar performance lagged our pound performance in Q1, as we expected, due to investments to address key price cliffs and gaps. We expect this to continue through fiscal 2026, though we think the gap between pounds and dollars will begin to narrow in the second half as we start to lap the initial price investments we made a year ago. Our progress in Q1 in North America retail was driven by our investments to improve brand remarkability across each of the five elements of our framework. On product superiority, our Q1 innovation lineup was a great success, with customer acceptance, distribution, and volume all tracking ahead of our expectation for new items like Cheerios Protein, Progresso Pitmaster Soups, and Mott's Fruit-Filled Bars. We continue to expect our total net sales from innovation and NAR will be up 25% this year.\n\nOn remarkable package design, we leveraged our Price Pack Architecture toolkit to deliver new sizes and package formats to meet key price points for consumers in Q1, helping drive Nielsen-measured pounds up high single digits on salty snacks and up low single digits on fruit snacks. On brand communication, we launched new social-first media campaigns on some of our biggest brands, including Cheerios, Pillsbury, and our Fruit Snacks franchise, and we continue to see improved ROIs on our media investment driven by advanced data-driven marketing capabilities. On omnichannel execution, we leveraged our broad portfolio to execute a fully omnichannel back-to-school event themed \"Free Snacks for Every Backpack,\" where we delivered significant value to consumers during a stressful back-to-school shopping season. We were able to gain differential retailer engagement on this event, with strong increases in display, distribution, and merchandising left.\n\nFinally, we expanded our work to deliver compelling value to consumers by investing to address key price cliffs and gaps. As we said at the start of the year, our goal is to make price value adjustments in roughly two-thirds of our NAR portfolio in fiscal 2026. We got a bit more than half of that reflected in the market in Q1, with elasticities in line with our expectations. We expect to complete the remainder of that work in Q2, and we'll track closely and adjust where necessary to ensure we continue to see ROIs in line with our expectations. We continue to see more and more evidence that when we deliver greater remarkability for consumers across all elements of the framework, our business grows. We saw this play out in Q1 on Cinnamon Toast Crunch, the number two brand in the U.S. cereal category.\n\nWe emphasized the great taste of Cinnadust on our truly remarkable product, adding a new flavor variety, highlighted value through multiple pack sizes, and amplified it all with a truly remarkable new social-led Must Cinnadust campaign that generated a 500% increase in social engagement for the brand. By leaning into all aspects of remarkability, we were able to drive growth in pounds, pound share, and dollar share for Cinnamon Toast Crunch in Q1. As we transition to Q2, we have strong plans in place that address all aspects of remarkability to further strengthen our offering for consumers. We'll bring more compelling product news, highlighting our Bake Up Bigger renovation on Pillsbury refrigerated dough. We'll introduce more remarkable innovation, like our Totino’s Ultimate Pizza, and we'll expand availability for protein innovation like Annie’s Super Mac, which is already turning in the top third of the category at major customers.\n\nWe'll deliver value to consumers through remarkable package design, featuring a new brand partnership with Wednesday and Wicked, expanding Price Pack Architecture formats, and increased seasonal offerings. We'll strengthen our brand communication with increased investment behind new campaigns across many of our global brands, including Old El Paso, Cheerios, Pillsbury, and Nature Valley. We'll elevate our omnichannel execution with another strong game-day event planned in Q2, including partnerships with NFL All-Star wide receivers Justin Jefferson, Ja'Marr Chase, and Amon-Ra St. Brown, who will be featured on Big G cereals. We have terrific plans for baking and soup seasons, leveraging consumer-relevant innovation, renovation, and in-store visibility. We'll continue to improve our value for consumers by completing our work to address key price cliffs and gaps across our NAR portfolio. Stepping back, I'm pleased with the progress we made in driving greater remarkability across NAR in Q1.\n\nI'm confident in our plans for Q2, and I think we're on the right track to returning this business to volume growth in fiscal 2026. Now turning to North America pet, our plan for fiscal 2026 is to improve growth on our core Blue Buffalo business and accelerate into faster-growing segments of the category, like fresh feeding. Our performance on the core was mixed in Q1, with a slowdown in dog feeding offset by improvements in treats, while our cat feeding business continued to lead our growth. For the quarter, we held or grew pound share across dog feeding, cat feeding, and treating. On dog feeding, our main challenge continues to be our Wilderness subline, which slowed sequentially from Q4 to Q1.\n\nTo address this, we're doing work on all elements of remarkability to ensure we're delivering the right combination of product news, brand communication, in-store execution, and value that will help Wilderness better resonate with pet parents. At the same time, we're continuing to support Life Protection Formula to maintain its strong track record of growth. On treats, we drove encouraging improvement in Q1 behind stronger in-store visibility and selective price investments to improve value for pet parents, resulting in mid-single-digit pound growth and stable dollars across all channels. As we move to Q2, we expect to continue this momentum behind our new Nudges game-day campaign and seasonal treat offerings.\n\nWe continue to deliver great results for our core Blue Buffalo cat feeding business, with retail sales for our Tastefuls subline up mid-single digits behind increased support for our head-to-head taste preference advertising and new trial pack formats to recruit new pet parents into the brand. On our pet accelerators, we're making good progress and continue to see exciting opportunities to build a stronger presence in high-growth segments of the pet food category. Just this week, we started shipping Love Made Fresh, Blue Buffalo’s first full line of refrigerated fresh pet food for dogs. We're launching nationally with a broad array of roll and tub offerings in a variety of proteins and breed sizes. We've had strong retailer acceptance, and we expect to be in roughly 5,000 coolers by the end of our second quarter.\n\nWe'll support the launch with a national media campaign rolling out this quarter, geared toward driving awareness and trial and highlighting our ingredient superiority and our compelling kibble plus fresh positioning. We're taking a thoughtful approach to our growth plans for Love Made Fresh to maximize our odds of success. We expect this business will start small and build over time as we grow distribution, drive trial, and eventually generate repeat and increased turns at the shelf. For those interested in learning more, be sure to attend our Investor Day event next month. In addition to Love Made Fresh, we have two more accelerators that are adding growth for our North America pet segment this year. We launched Edgar and Cooper in the U.S. earlier this summer through an exclusive partnership with PetSmart, and we're already seeing a great response from pet parents after just a few months in market.\n\nWe acquired the super premium European brand a little more than a year ago, and we're excited for the opportunity to bring this line of high-quality products to more pet parents across 1,000 stores in the U.S. Finally, our recent acquisition of the North America Whitebridge business is further adding to our pet growth. The Tiki Cat brand is the jewel of this portfolio, and it is driving double-digit retail sales growth behind remarkable innovation and distribution expansion. We're working to accelerate that growth through innovation, like our recent launch of Tiki Cat Solutions. Turning to our North America food service segment, our focus in fiscal 2026 is driving growth by leading in breakfast through nutrition and by expanding our frozen baked goods portfolio. I'm pleased to share we're off to a great start on both.\n\nOn breakfast, our cereal market share was up another full point in Q1, led by continued strong growth in K through 12 schools. We're driving our strong share momentum with our regulation-ready portfolio, including our commitment to removing certified colors by the summer of 2026, which is ahead of USDA regulations. We're also investing behind growth initiatives like frozen breakfast, offering a broad array of solutions that meet school nutrition guidelines and minimize challenges for K through 12 operators. On our frozen baked goods portfolio, we're driving share growth with relevant innovation, like our new Blondie bars. Our continued efforts to reinvest in the remarkability of our biscuits platform have resulted in almost three points of share growth fiscal year to date. Turning to our international business, we're pleased with the growth we delivered in the first quarter across our global brands.\n\nOutside of shops, retail sales for Häagen-Dazs were up double digits, driven by increased distribution of our core flavors, as well as strong performance on our renovated European stick bar line. In China, a relaunch of our stick bar business helped drive high single-digit growth for Häagen-Dazs in retail channels. Old El Paso remains the global category leader in Mexican food, and we see tremendous opportunity for long-term growth for this brand. Others have seen this opportunity too, which has translated into increased competitive activity and resulted in flat retail sales for the brand in Q1. We have plans to improve our competitiveness by investing in brand building and innovation to reach new households and to encourage existing consumers to make Old El Paso a more frequent part of their meal routine.\n\nOn Nature Valley, we drove high single-digit retail sales growth in Q1, led by continued strong performance in France, where our brand building investment and distribution gains helped us expand our number one market share position in the snack bar category. To support our growth plans and investments in remarkability, we continue to drive efficiency across our business. Our efforts are focused in two key areas: holistic margin management cost savings and our global transformation initiative. We're building on our industry-leading productivity track record, with good visibility to delivering another year of 5% savings in cost of goods sold in fiscal 2026. These results have been enabled by our increased use of digital and AI tools within our supply chain, helping drive efficiencies in our sourcing, manufacturing, and logistics networks.\n\nOn our global transformation initiative, we are streamlining our end-to-end processes and identifying new ways of working that match today's evolving environment. One specific example where we're seeing good progress is in demand forecasting. We started from a position of strength, benchmarking in line with leading peers in terms of demand forecast accuracy. By leveraging advancements in AI and machine learning, our transformation work is reducing our team's efforts while still delivering top-tier accuracy. We're in the process of transitioning more business to no-touch demand forecasting with no manual interventions. For these businesses, this has created time savings for our brand teams of greater than 50%. We think we can reach 75% time savings over time, enabling greater focus on demand generation. As an added benefit, these efforts have resulted in our highest operational demand forecast accuracy on record, which has driven measurable waste reduction and improved customer service.\n\nWith good progress on our priorities in Q1 and strong plans to drive further improvement into the year to go, we remain on track to deliver the financial outlook we provided for fiscal 2026. Now, let me turn it over to Kofi to go into more detail on our first quarter fiscal 2026 results. Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Our first quarter financial results are summarized on slide 19. As a reminder, we expected our price investments, the divestiture impact, and trade expense timing would put significant pressure on sales and profit results in the first half of the year. Before favorable trade timing comparisons, a 53rd week and improved volume trends drive positive results in the second half. Recorded net sales of $4.5 billion were down 7%, including a four-point headwind from the net impact of divestitures and acquisitions.\n\nOrganic net sales were in line with our expectations at down 3%, driven primarily by unfavorable price mix due to our price investments and unfavorable trade expense timing. On the bottom line, our Q1 results finished a bit ahead of our expectations, driven by favorable phasing of input cost inflation and timing benefits in international, both of which we expect will largely unwind in Q2. Adjusted operating profit of $711 million was down 18% in constant currency, driven by lower volume and higher input costs, partially offset by favorable product mix stemming from the North American yogurt divestitures. Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.86 in the quarter and were down 20% in constant currency, driven primarily by lower adjusted operating profit.\n\nMoving to the components of total company net sales growth in the quarter, organic net sales declined 3% in the quarter, driven by lower organic price mix and pound volume. Organic pound volume was down 1%, including the impact of a shipment timing headwind in North America pet. In terms of inorganic items, foreign exchange was immaterial to net sales, and the net impact of divestitures and acquisitions was a four-point headwind to net sales in Q1. Shifting to segment results, first quarter organic net sales for North America retail were down 5%. Our organic net sales lagged Nielsen-measured U.S. retail sales by roughly one point, driven primarily by a previously anticipated headwind from trade expense timing. Including the North America yogurt divestitures, reported net sales declined double digits for the Big G cereal and Canada operating unit, which represents the combination of the previous U.S.\n\nMorning Foods and Canada operating units. Net sales were down high single digits for U.S. snacks and low single digits for U.S. meals and baking solutions. As Jeff noted, our increased consumer value, innovation, and product news drove improved pound competitiveness in Q1, including pound share growth in eight of our top 10 U.S. categories. On the bottom line, constant currency segment operating profit was down 24% in the quarter, due primarily to lower volume, including the impact of yogurt divestitures. Net sales for our North America pet segment increased 6%, including the impact of the Whitebridge acquisition. Organic net sales were down 5%, driven largely by a four-point shipment timing headwind in the quarter. Including the Whitebridge acquisition, reported net sales in the quarter were up double digits for cat feeding and pet treating, and down mid-single digits for dog feeding.\n\nWe maintained our pound competitiveness in Q1, holding pound share in dog feeding, cat feeding, and treating. On the bottom line, first quarter North America pet segment operating profit was down 5% in constant currency, driven by higher input costs and higher SG&A expenses, including investments ahead of our upcoming fresh pet food launch, partially offset by favorable price mix. North America food service organic net sales were up 1% in the quarter, driven by good growth in cereal and biscuits, partially offset by a two-point headwind from market index pricing on bakery flour. We continued our strong competitiveness in the quarter, with 80% of our priority businesses holding or growing share, driven by positive results in non-commercial channels, including healthcare, K through 12 schools, and colleges and universities.\n\nOn the bottom line, North America Foodservice segment operating profit was down 1% in Q1, with a headwind from the yogurt divestitures, largely offset by growth on the remaining businesses. Shifting to our International segment, we generated good growth in net sales and operating profit, helped in part by certain timing benefits totaling approximately 3% of segment net sales that are expected to unwind in the remainder of this year, primarily in the second quarter. First quarter organic net sales were up 4%, driven primarily by growth in India, North Asia, and Europe. Our net sales performance in China improved in Q1 relative to our fiscal 2025 trend, with a relatively small decline resulting from the closure of certain underperforming Häagen-Dazs shops.\n\nExcluding shops, we delivered net sales growth in China, driven by Häagen-Dazs retail and foodservice channels and our Wanchai Ferry dumpling business, giving us more confidence that our long-term plans for China are on the right track. We continued to compete effectively in International Q1, including holding or growing dollar share in roughly half of our priority businesses. Inclusive of timing benefits, first quarter segment operating profit totaled $66 million compared to $21 million last year, driven by favorable price mix, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. Slide 25 summarizes our joint venture results. Cereal Partners Worldwide net sales were down 2% in constant currency in Q1, driven by declines in Latin America and Europe, partially offset by growth in Asia, Oceania, and Africa. Häagen-Dazs Japan net sales were up 7% in constant currency, reflecting growth on our core cup and handheld formats.\n\nFirst quarter combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased to $7 million compared to $19 million in the same period in fiscal 2025, driven primarily by asset impairment charges and transaction costs related to assets held for sale at CPW. Turning to margin performance, adjusted gross margin of 34.2% of net sales was down 120 basis points versus last year, driven primarily by higher input costs, partially offset by favorable mix impact from the North American yogurt divestitures. Our first quarter adjusted operating profit margin was down 210 basis points to 15.7%, driven by lower adjusted gross margin and higher SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales. Moving to other noteworthy Q1 income statement items, adjusted unallocated corporate expenses increased $11 million in the quarter, driven by the lapping of favorable one-time items from last year.\n\nAs a reminder, we expect corporate unallocated expenses to be up significantly for the full year, driven by a normalization of corporate incentive compensation after last year's below-average payout. First quarter net interest expense was up $9 million, driven by higher average long-term debt balances. The adjusted effective tax rate was 24.1% compared to 21.9% a year ago due to certain non-recurring discrete tax benefits in fiscal 2025 and unfavorable earnings mix by jurisdiction in fiscal 2026. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were down 4% to 542 million, reflecting our continued net share repurchase activity. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on slide 28, first quarter operating cash flow decreased year over year to $397 million, driven primarily by lower net earnings, including the impact of divested earnings related to the North American yogurt divestitures, as well as unfavorable changes in core working capital.\n\nCapital investments in the quarter totaled $110 million. We paid $330 million to shareholders in dividends in Q1, and with the divestiture of our U.S. yogurt business closing in June, we received $1.8 billion in gross proceeds. After taxes and transaction costs, we utilized the majority of the net proceeds to pay down debt, which will help us make progress on our deleveraging goal for the year. Finally, we returned $500 million in cash to shareholders in the quarter through net share repurchases. I'll wrap up my comments by summarizing our reaffirmed fiscal 2026 outlook. We expect organic net sales to range between down 1% and up 1%.\n\nAdjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted earnings per share are both expected to be down 10% to 15% in constant currency, including the impact of significant growth investments, a five-point headwind from the net impact of divestitures and acquisitions, and a three-point headwind from the normalization of corporate incentive expense. While there have been changes to our forecast on tariffs over the past three months, we continue to expect the gross impact of tariffs to add another 1% to 2% of COGS. We continue to work to mitigate as much of that impact as possible through product reformulation, ingredient substitution, and strategic revenue management actions. Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of at least 95% of adjusted after-tax earnings. With that, let me turn it back to Jeff for some closing remarks. Thanks, Kofi. Let me wrap up with a few closing thoughts.\n\nOur number one goal for this year remains clear: restoring volume-driven organic sales growth. The path to that goal is equally clear: investing to improve the remarkability of our total product offerings. We've been encouraged by the fact that where we've made investments, we've seen the returns we've expected, including in Q1. While we're pleased with our progress, we are by no means yet satisfied. We remain sharply focused on executing our plans and getting back to growth. I have confidence in our plan and in our team, whose track record of execution is excellent. I look forward to reporting our progress as we execute our priorities, accelerate our growth, and drive returns for our shareholders."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Jeff Siemon, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Siemon\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Julienne, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our Q&A session on our fourth quarter fiscal '25 results. I hope everyone had time to review our press release, listen to our prepared remarks and view our presentation materials, which we made available this morning on our Investor Relations website.\nPlease note that in this morning's Q&A session, we may make forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. Please refer to this morning's press release for factors that could impact forward-looking statements and for reconciliations of non-GAAP information, which may be discussed on today's call.\nI'm here today with Jeff Harmening, our Chairman and CEO; Kofi Bruce, our CFO; and Dana McNabb, Group President of North America Retail and North America Pet.\nBefore we open for questions, I'm going to hand it over to Jeff Harmening for a few opening remarks.\n\nJeffrey L. Harmening\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, General Mills, Inc.\n\nYes. Thanks, Jeff. And I thought I'd start this morning, there's a lot going on up and down our P&L within our business and then certainly a lot going on in the broader world. So I thought I'd just take a couple of minutes to summarize what we're trying to accomplish.\nThe first and most important thing is really returning to volume growth, specifically in NAR, and we're really encouraged by what we've seen. We started to invest in value in Q3 of last year, with Pillsbury in those -- top by really good advertising. And we like the results of that so much that we decided that we'd expand the value of investments we made in soup and cereal and fruit snacks in the fourth quarter.\nAnd we saw the results there that we expected. And so as we go into this year, we're kind of just continuing the formula that we had in the fourth quarter, which is we said to expand some of the value investments on targeted businesses that we saw, but also really importantly, backing that up by a significant consumer news.\nIn fact, I think our new product news and our core renovation news is the best that I have seen since I've been a CEO. And we use our remarkable experience framework. We talked a lot about these in our prepared remarks. Certainly, our launch into fresh pet food, all the protein innovation we've seen in our portfolio, renovating Haagen-Dazs stick bars and so forth gives us confidence that we can get our business back to the kind of growth we're looking for.\nImportantly, as we're doing all this work in NAR, we did see share growth in our internal businesses this past year as well as foodservice and health care and pet. And so that gives us a lot of confidence. We're backing up all of this investment with record levels of holistic margin management and also productivity initiatives. So we're not sitting still on that front.\nBut we know that it's an investment year, but we're very confident that these investments will pay off given what we've seen over the last couple of quarters.\nSo with that, let's open the floor to questions.\n\nJeff Siemon\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGreat. Julienne, you can go ahead."

Please.\n\nPlease note that today's remarks include forward looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions.\n\nThe second slide in today's presentation lists several factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.\n\nAnd with that I'll turn it over to Jeff.\n\nThank you, Jeff and good morning, everyone.\n\nLet me start with today's key messages.\n\nOur Q3 results finished below our expectations driven largely by greater than expected retailer inventory headwinds and a slowdown in snacking categories.\n\nTwo developments, we initially called out at the Cagny Conference last month.\n\nWe've continued to improve our market share trends across our pet foodservice and international businesses with each segment posting positive pound share results in the third quarter.\n\nWe delivered improved performance in U S refrigerated dough and Haas next two businesses, where we made incremental investments last quarter, though our share and other snacks categories was more challenged.\n\nOn our Q3 results and moderated expectations for Q4, we've adjusted our fiscal 2025 guidance and we're adapting our plans and stepping up our investment to address these recent headwinds strengthen our competitiveness as we close the year and deliver improved growth for fiscal 'twenty six.\n\nTo fund that investment, we're targeting industry, leading levels of holistic margin management cost savings and anticipated new initiatives in fiscal 'twenty six designed to further boost efficiency to enable investment for growth.\n\nOur Q3 results are summarized on slide five organic net.\n\nNet sales were down 5%, which was below our expectations for three main reasons.\n\nFirst our Nielsen measured retail sales were down 1% in the quarter.\n\nThe four point gap between organic sales and retail sales growth was driven primarily by unexpected retailer inventory headwinds in and pet .\n\nWhich we referenced at Cagny and did not see a reversal as we closed the quarter and.\n\nAnd by the expected reversal of favorable timing items from Q2.\n\nSecond we saw a deceleration in U S snacks retail sales trends in the quarter, driven by softer category growth and increased competitive activity.\n\nAnd third we saw a slowdown in demand and U S away from home channels in Q3 that pressured organic sales growth in North America foodservice, even as we continue to gain share in those channels.\n\nIn response to these headwinds we've moved quickly to adjust our plans leveraging what's working on businesses like Pillsbury, totino's and blue Buffalo and applying it more broadly across our portfolio with a goal of driving improved growth moving forward.\n\nSlide six outlines our three key priorities for fiscal 2025.\n\nOur number one priority is to accelerate organic sales growth by delivering remarkable consumer experiences across our leading food brands, resulting in stronger volume and improved market share performance.\n\nSecond we are focused on creating fuel for investment by generating strong levels of H M M cost savings to offset inflation and reinvest back into our brands and third we will continue to drive strong cash generation, while maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation.\n\nA remarkable experience framework is how we assess our brands across five key areas product packaging brand communication omnichannel execution and value to identify where we are differentiated and where we lacked a distinct competitive advantage using learnings from this framework, we are better able to identify where we lead.\n\nversus where we have worked to improve our total product offering.\n\nWe're putting this framework into action.\n\nme provide a few examples of how it is making a measurable impact on our brands.\n\nLast quarter, we highlighted challenges and our pillsbury refrigerated dough business more specifically that are value for consumers was not right, which didn't allow for innovation renovation and brand communication to resonate with consumers. We quickly put into action a series of initiatives to reverse the trends in this business I am pleased to share that these initiatives are saying.\n\nGood returns with refrigerated dough retail pound volume up 10% in the month of February driven by value improvements expanded product news investment behind our cookies platform and increased brand building featuring our iconic Pillsbury doughboy.\n\nSimilarly, we drove improved trends in our Hot snacks business in Q3, leveraging a remark ability approach leading into value forward messaging robust merchandising plans and improved in store execution, our hot snacks business drove 3% retail pound volume growth in February which represents a significant step up versus.\n\nLast year's results. These improved trends give us continued confidence that when we leverage our remarkable experienced framework, we can unlock significant improvements in competitiveness across our brands.\n\nRetail sales for our U S cereal business were down mid single digits in Q3, which we anticipated due to more difficult comparisons from Q3 last year, including the shift in Thanksgiving timing as well as increased competitor service levels Q.\n\nQ3 was also our lightest quarter of the year in terms of media support and in store activation.\n\nAs we shift to Q4, we expect to drive improved momentum on cereal as we exit the quarter supported by the strength of our plans leveraging relevant product news brand partnerships and media support.\n\nIn terms of product news cheerios protein is off to a great start since launching in January with both flavors turning in the top third of the category at key retailers and bringing new consumers into the cheerios franchise.\n\nWe're continuing to build distribution on this line and we will add a third variety cookies and cream in the fourth quarter we.\n\nWe have an exciting partnership with Marvel and Q4 that features the fantastic four across our core cereal brands and we'll activate this news through in store displays and promotions in partnership with our retailers and will support this news with a double digit increase in media investment.\n\nOn soup, our retail pound volume was up in fiscal 'twenty, five and we expect to strengthen our momentum in Q4, leveraging our data driven marketing tools. We've introduced highly successful media campaigns to drive growth with targeted audiences, including both , one and 55, plus consumers who are seeking progresso protein and fiber benefits.\n\nWe have a strong support plan in Q4 behind Progresso protein and our new old El Paso soup line.\n\nAnd we're launching a new line of Progresso soups and partnership with Pitmaster ahead of summer grilling season in the U S. This progresso pitmaster lie and delivers on the increased protein benefits our core consumers are increasingly seeking in their daily routines.\n\nWhile we've made progress in important parts of our portfolio, we've seen challenges in others, including recent softness in U S snacks, including snack bars fruit snacks and salty snacks here too our response starts with ability.\n\nWe are investing to bring consumers added value through price pack architecture changes and by addressing key price gaps, we're launching strong new products and core renovation and in fruit snacks, we are introducing exciting new licensing partnerships, including a partnership with Warner brothers to launch Harry Potter fruit snacks. This summer.\n\nOn snack bars, we're innovating to bring more consumer relevant benefits like indulgence in protein and Fat General Mills brands account for eight of the top 10, new products in the snack bar category in fiscal 'twenty five.\n\nMoving forward our focus on North America retail is to deliver more of the elements of our marketability that resonate for consumers.\n\nStepping up product news with a focus on bold flavors and functional benefits enhancing our brand communication with data driven marketing, leading an omnichannel execution with improved distribution display and ecommerce visibility and bringing consumers more value by addressing price gaps and stepping up our price pack architecture work successfully executing.\n\nplans on our core brands will be the key to returning North America retail to growth.\n\nAcross North America Pet, we drove another quarter of pound share growth on Blue Buffalo in Q3 with performance led by our life protection Formula dry dog food business.\n\nOur results on Lps have been driven by strong media investment and Activations across key retail partners. We also recently launched our biggest new product of the year life protection Formula Salmon Salmon is an on trend protein variety geared towards pet parents, who are increasingly seeking chicken free options. This addition to our Lps.\n\nhas already received strong retail enthusiasm and early distribution wins.\n\nOur wilderness line continues to show year to date improvement and is now posting retail sales growth across some of our key customers successful.\n\nSuccessful innovation is a theme here too with our latest loss of grain free variety is performing above our initial expectations and highly incremental to our core wilderness offerings and.\n\nAnd we're excited about adding the white bridge business to our portfolio this quarter.\n\nThe Tiki Cat brand continues to drive great momentum with retail sales for wet cat food up 19% over the past 52 weeks.\n\nWhile we're proud of the improvements we made to our pet business in recent quarters. We know there's more work to be done to get back to the level of growth, we aspire to over the long term.\n\nWe will look to continue building on our positive momentum in Q4 supported by another strong increase in media investment.\n\nIn North America Foodservice, we've continued to drive strong market share gains in our priority channels in fiscal 'twenty, five including more than 70% of our measured business growing or holding share in Q3.\n\nWe're maintaining our leadership in K through 12 schools, where we stayed ahead of the competition through our regulation ready portfolio of reduced sugar cereals individually wrapped muffins and whole grain cereal bars, and we're leveraging our industry leading capabilities in DAU to expand our presence in frozen baked goods, bringing in store bakeries restaurants and noncommercial.\n\nOperators remarkable products, while helping them minimize back of house labor.\n\nIn international our performance in fiscal 'twenty five has been mixed with strong market share results in most regions offset by headwinds from a tougher consumer environment in China, our largest market outside North America our.\n\nOur focus remains on driving remark ability to improve growth on our global platforms and other core markets, while working to stabilize our performance in China.\n\nOutside of China, our focus on innovation brand building and distribution on our core products contributed to 6% retail sales growth in Q3 for haagen dazs and retail outlets across our top markets and Brazil, we drove share growth in four of our top five categories and we delivered another quarter of growth in our distributor markets capitalizing on disk.\n\nAbuse and opportunities for Hagen Dazs old El Paso and nature Valley.\n\nWe're also encouraged by the strong momentum for our Edgren Cooper European Pet food business, which continued to post double digit net sales growth, including benefits from the recently launched cat treats line.\n\nOur second priority for fiscal 2025 is to create fuel for reinvestment back into our brands and our business. We're leveraging our best in class holistic margin management program to identify and deliver cost savings measures that enable investment in our long term growth of our brands and our capabilities will need to compete today and tomorrow.\n\nWe remain on track to generate 5% Cogs H M. M savings this fiscal year, which is ahead of our long term trend.\n\nAnd our third priority driving strong cash generation, we remain on track to deliver 95% free cash flow conversion in fiscal $2025 with free cash prioritized toward capital investment and dividends.\n\nOn M&A in the near term, we remain focused on completing the U S yogurt divestiture in ensuring smooth transitions for our Canada yogurt divestiture and North America White Bridge Pet brands acquisition.\n\nAs we look ahead, we'll continue to look for bolt on acquisitions that improve the growth profile of our business and give us long term opportunities to do what we do best ROE bold and iconic brands and.\n\nAnd on share repurchases, we now expect a 4% reduction to average diluted shares versus our previous estimate of 3% based on our strong share repurchase activity to date.\n\nStepping back it's been a challenging year in fiscal 'twenty, five with prolonged value seeking consumer behaviors and volatility in the operating environment, creating significant headwinds and still we know that our job is to adapt quickly to the external environment and grow as we look ahead to fiscal 'twenty six we are fully committed to.\n\nImproving our organic sales growth following the playbook that has successfully return blue Buffalo to share growth strengthen our share leadership in foodservice channels and more recently improved our performance on Pillsbury and .\n\nWe're planning to increase our investment centered on key elements of our ability. This includes stepping up our innovation, but more big bet launches focused on taste value and relevant functional benefits, increasing our investment behind compelling digitally enabled brand communication elevating our execution in store and online and improving value for .\n\nTumors by offering a broader array of pack sizes, reducing price gaps and more.\n\nWe will fund that investment with increased cost savings, we have good visibility to delivering another year of at least 5% cost savings in fiscal 'twenty, six which translates to more than $600 million in gross productivity savings driven by further advancement of digital supply chain initiatives leveraging connected data autonomous plan.\n\nand AI enabled execution.\n\nIn addition, we're reviewing new cost efficiency initiatives that are anticipated to generate at least $100 million in additional savings in fiscal 'twenty six with further savings expected in fiscal 2007 and beyond.\n\nWith that let me turn it over to coffee to go into more details on our third quarter results and the assumptions behind our updated outlook for the year.\n\nThanks, Jeff and Hello, everyone.\n\nthird quarter financial results are summarized on slide 20 reported net sales of $4 $8 billion were down 5% and organic net sales were also down 5%, reflecting lower pound volume and lower price mix as Jeff noted. These results trailed our Nielsen measured retail sales performance by roughly four points in the quarter.\n\nDue largely to unexpected retailer inventory headwinds and the reversal of certain Q2 timing benefits, which we had anticipated.\n\nAdjusted operating profit of $801 million was down 13% in constant currency driven by input cost inflation unfavorable price mix lower volume and supply chain deleverage, partially offset by cost savings.\n\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1 in the quarter and were down 15% in constant currency driven by lower adjusted operating profit a higher adjusted effective tax rate and higher net interest expense, partially offset by a lower share count.\n\nSlide 21 summarizes the components of total company net sales growth organic net sales decreased 5% in the quarter driven by both lower organic pound volume and unfavorable organic price mix Foreign exchange was a one point headwind and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a one point benefit.\n\nNet sales in Q3.\n\nOur North America retail results are summarized on slide 22.\n\nAs a reminder, we closed our Kennedy yogurt divestiture in late January and we continue to expect the U S yogurt divestiture to close in calendar 2025.\n\nThird quarter organic net sales for North America retail were down 6%.\n\nLagged our Nielsen measured U S retail sales by approximately four points.\n\nConsistent with the enterprise results this gap, primarily reflecting unexpected retailer inventory headwinds and the reversal of Q2 timing benefits.\n\nAs Jeff noted we are encouraged by the improved retail sales trends, we drove in Q3 on Pillsbury refrigerated dough and Hot snacks, two businesses that we targeted last quarter for incremental investment.\n\nHowever, this improvement was offset by slower retail sales in U S cereal, which we anticipated and in U S snacks, where the combination of slower category growth and increased competitive activity drove results below our expectations.\n\nOn the bottom line cost.\n\nConstant currency segment operating profit was down 14% driven by lower volume input cost inflation and unfavorable price mix, partially offset by H M M cost savings through.\n\nThrough nine months, our organic net sales were down 2% and segment operating profit was down 6% in constant currency.\n\nNorth America Pet segment results are highlighted on slide 23.\n\nOur Q3 operating performance includes the results from the North America White Bridge Pet brands acquisition, which closed in late December and is reported on a one month lag third quarter organic net sales for North America were down 5%, leaving our year to date organic net sales in line with last year, we estimate consumer takeaway across all channels with Russ.\n\nThe flat in the quarter with five point gap to organic sales growth, primarily driven by unexpected retailer inventory headwinds.\n\nWe continue to compete effectively amid a slower than expected U S. Pet food category. This year with Blue Buffalo pound share up again in Q3, including the retailer inventory headwinds net sales in the quarter were down mid single digits for dry food up mid single digits for wet food and up mid single digits for treats on the Bottomline.\n\nThird quarter, North America Pet segment operating profit was down 20% in constant currency driven by a double digit increase in media investment as well as higher input costs.\n\nThrough nine months segment operating profit was up 6% in constant currency.\n\nNorth America Foodservice organic net sales were up 1% in the quarter driven by positive price mix, partially offset by lower pound volume strong net sales growth on cereal and breads was partially offset by a decline in bakery flour, including a one point headwind from index pricing.\n\nThough industry growth in away from home channels slowed in Q3, we continued to drive market share gains, including strong performance in K through 12 schools healthcare and colleges and universities on the bottom line third quarter North America Foodservice segment operating profit was up 1% in constant currency driven by favorable price mix and .\n\nCost savings, partially offset by input cost inflation and higher other supply chain costs.\n\nThrough nine months North America Foodservice organic net sales were up 3% in constant currency segment operating profit was up 15%."

Four result, and we drove a significant increase in the proportion of our business growing share.\n\nOur pound share has improved most notably with dollar share improving at a slower rate as we expected given our investments to increase value for consumers.\n\nThese results are due to our continued focus on delivering remarkable experiences to consumers across a total product offering we are investing to bring consumers superior products and benefits at the right value supported with remarkable brand building an omnichannel visibility. This work drove improved performance on many important businesses.\n\nSuch as pet food cereal fruit snacks, and our foodservice product lines at the same time, we have more work to do in other places with refrigerated dough offering the biggest opportunity for improvement and challenging consumer trends in China, continuing to present, a headwind in that market.\n\nTo achieve and build on our broad based improvements in volume and share we've stepped up our investment to bring greater value to consumers, which results in a lower outlook on operating profit and EPS in fiscal 2025.\n\nAmidst the dynamic and uncertain macroeconomic backdrop for consumers. We believe this is the right choice to further strengthen the marketability of our offerings, which will better position general mills for sustainable growth in fiscal 'twenty six and beyond.\n\nOur Q2s results are summarized on slide five .\n\nOrganic net sales were up 1% adjusted operating profit was up 7% in constant currency and adjusted diluted EPS was up 12% in constant currency. These results were ahead of our expectations, especially on the bottom line, even as our outlook on the Euro has come down.\n\nThe key reason for this unusual difference is that our Q2 results benefited from timing related items that drove a one five point benefit to net sales and a six point benefit to operating profit and EPS all of which are expected to reverse in the second half.\n\nwill provide more context on these items and our back half expectations later in the presentation.\n\nSlide six outlines our three key priorities for fiscal 2025, as I mentioned upfront our number one priority is to accelerate our organic sales growth by delivering remarkable consumer experiences across our leading food brands, resulting in a stronger volume and improved market share performance.\n\nWe will create fuel for investment by generating strong levels of H M M cost savings to offset inflation and reinvest back into our brands and third we will continue to drive strong cash generation, while maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation.\n\nSlide seven shows our pound and dollar share performance through the first half of fiscal 2025.\n\nWe strengthen our competitiveness in Q2 with 56% of our priority businesses growing or holding pound share and 38% growing or holding dollar share both of which were significant improvements from Q1 and fiscal 2024 levels.\n\nImportantly, all four segments drove improved pound and dollar share trends in Q2, and we saw our U S. Pet food business returned to pound share growth and held dollar share for the first time in more than two years.\n\nWe will look to build on this positive share momentum as we move through the second half of fiscal 'twenty five.\n\nWe're seeing encouraging broad based improvements and our competitiveness across North America retail as well North America, Retail's pound and dollar trends strengthened in Q2 and seven of our top 10 U S retail categories, nearly 60% of our U S retail priority businesses grew or held pound share in Q2.\n\nAnd our results on dollar share moved up to 50% growing or holding share over the past month as we returned to our U S cereal business to dollar share growth behind great consumer news advertising and merchandising execution, including successful campaigns with the Kelsey brothers and checks holiday season.\n\nThese share improvements have translated into strengthened retail sales growth across most of our U S portfolio from Q1 to Q2.\n\nThose gains have been largely offset however by a step back on refrigerated dough.\n\nJust had a disappointing start to the key baking season, as we move to the second half we will build on our improving momentum on businesses like cereal fruit snacks, Mexican food and soup, and we'll step up our plans and reinvest to improve our trends on refrigerated dough.\n\nOur plan for refrigerated, though this year included product renovation news stronger marketing behind the Pillsbury doughboy and targeted investments in value as we move through the second quarter. It became clear that our product news and media support we're not breaking through because we didn't have the right value for consumers at the shelf we've.\n\nWe've taken a number of actions recently to reverse the trends on refrigerated dough.\n\nAlready brought more value to consumers in December by adding investment to narrow price gaps across a broader range of items where.\n\nWe're stepping up our tastes renovation news in the second half across 30% of our portfolio with new more cinnamon news on Pillsbury cinnamon rolls and continued support behind our more flaky layers news on biscuits.\n\nWe're launching new cookie varieties, including Monster Cookie and double chocolate flavors as well as grants holiday shapes to accelerate the strong growth we've been delivering since we unlocked new capacity earlier this year.\n\nAnd we're significantly increasing our media support in the third quarter to ensure pillsbury has greater visibility through the remainder of the key baking season. The return of the Doughboy and our new campaign is working and we expect media investment to be up more than 40% on our can do line in Q3.\n\nStepping back we've driven tremendous growth on pillsbury refrigerated dough over the past five years getting this business back on track will be key to improving our North America retail growth prospects. We're confident that the actions, we're taking to increase for marketability will improve our momentum going forward.\n\nTurning to North America pet.\n\nOut of the continued progress we've made to restore this business to growth by focusing on blue Buffalo's ingredient superiority and executing our improvement plans across the portfolio.\n\nWhile we're not all the way to where we want to be we've continued to drive sequential improvement in our market share with our pound share growing and dollar share flat in the U S. In Q2.\n\nAnd we liked the positive momentum, we're seeing across our key product lines.\n\nWe drove high single digit retail sales growth on our life protection Formula dry dog food business in Q2, leveraging compelling advertising focus on ingredient superiority.\n\nWe've dramatically reduced retail sales declines on our wilderness dry dog food line by addressing a few key challenges, we launched new comparison advertising highlighting wilderness as higher protein content versus a key competitor we can.\n\nIntroduce smaller bag sizes to provide lower absolute price points for pet parents, and we reintroduced green free varieties that are driving incremental household penetration gains.\n\nOn wet food, we adjusted our price points on targeted offerings to get below key price cliffs.\n\nAnd we're seeing positive returns our treaty portfolio is where we have the most work still to do but even here, we're seeing green shoots with better shelf visibility and good merchandising execution driving improved turns at key customers.\n\nAnd we continue to strengthen our portfolio earlier this quarter with the announcement of our proposed acquisition of White Bridge Pet brands, North America premium cat feeding and pet treating business, which includes the tychy pet and clouds to our portfolio of brands.\n\nThe jewel of this acquisition is a tiki cab brand, which has a strong presence in wet cat food the fastest growing segment within the U S pet food category and an area, where blue Buffalo is underdeveloped retail sales for Tiki GAAP were up more than 20% over the past year and with household penetration still below 2%, we see tremendous.\n\nIndus runway for future growth, we expect the transaction to close shortly and we're looking forward to welcoming the whitebread team to general Mills, and working with them to expand our mission of loving and feeding more pets like family.\n\nIn North America Foodservice, we continue to deliver strong market share growth across the segment with more than 70% of our priority businesses growing or holding share in Q2.\n\nOur World Class R&D team is providing category leading renovations in service of our operators leveraging the remarkable experience framework in Q2, we launched a product renovation on our baked biscuit line delivering improved product quality, while also doubling the whole time, which helps operators better manage labor shortages and minimize product.\n\nWaste.\n\nWe're already seeing strong excitement and sell them a key distributor partners on the back of this news.\n\nWe also continued to drive strong share results and noncommercial channels, including continued share growth in K through 12 schools, we've built our leading position in cereal. Thanks to our ongoing commitment to nutritional leadership, leveraging our two equivalent grain packaging innovation and our reduced sugar offerings.\n\nIn International we made progress stepping up our market share performance on our global platforms, while continuing to navigate challenging macro headwinds in China, we grew or maintained share on 45% of our priority businesses in Q2, driven by improving share performance in our distributor markets and in Europe and Australia.\n\nThis includes strong performance on Hagen Dazs, we've delivered share growth and retail outlets in Q2 fueled by increased distribution on core flavors like Belgian chocolate and strawberry.\n\nOur China business continues to see double digit traffic declines in our Hagen dazs shops in Q2, but we're working to mitigate those headwinds by expanding distribution and retail foodservice and e-commerce channels.\n\nOur second enterprise priority for fiscal 'twenty five is to create fuel for reinvestment back into our business through industry, leading HSM cost savings.\n\nEven as we have added incremental investment to support stronger volume and share growth the midpoint of our updated guidance ranges still translates into an adjusted operating margin profile in fiscal 'twenty five that is higher than our pre pandemic margin.\n\nWe've done that by delivering record levels of H M M, including our forecast for 5% savings in our cost of goods sold this year, which is ahead of our long term trend. This elevated ATM delivery continues to provide fuel to invest in our brands and capabilities for the long term.\n\nFor our third priority continuing to drive strong cash generation, we expect to deliver at least 95% free cash flow conversion in fiscal 'twenty five consistent with the guidance. We provided at the start of the year, we remain committed to our long standing record of deploying our cash in a disciplined and shareholder friendly manner through capital investments dividend.\n\nM&A and share repurchases on.\n\nOn M&A, we continue to advance our portfolio reshaping ambitions and improve the growth profile of our business once our north American yogurt divestitures, and White bridge pet acquisition or closed general Mills will have turned over approximately 30% of our net sales base since fiscal 2018.\n\nIn terms of future M&A, our near term focus is on ensuring our organization is set up to deliver seamless transitions for each of those three transactions as.\n\nAs we look further out we remain focused on bolt on acquisitions as our most likely opportunities for M&A.\n\nBefore transitioning to coffee I will highlight our updated fiscal 2025 guidance on slide 17.\n\nWe reaffirmed our organic net sales guidance with our current expectations for the lower end of the range adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS growth are each expected to be two points below our prior ranges, reflecting the incremental investments, we're making to support our volume and market share gains.\n\nAnd we remain on track to deliver free cash flow conversion in line with our previous expectation.\n\nWith that let me turn it over to Kofi to go into more details on our second quarter results and the assumptions behind our updated outlook for the year.\n\nThanks, Jeff and Hello, everyone. Our second quarter financial results are summarized on slide 19 reported net sales of $5 $2 billion were up 2% and organic net sales were up 1% adjusted operating profit of $1 1 billion was up 7% in constant currency driven.\n\ncost savings and higher volume, partially offset by input cost inflation unfavorable price mix and higher SG&A expenses adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1 40 in the quarter and were up 12% in constant currency driven by higher adjusted operating profit and the lower share.\n\nOur counts.\n\nAs Jeff mentioned, our Q2 results were impacted by certain favorable timing items, including an increase in retailer inventory in our due in part to the Thanksgiving holiday shifting from the final week of Q2 last year to the first week of Q3, this year as well as favorable trade in other expense timing.\n\nThese items represented approximately a one and a half point benefit to net sales and a six point benefit to operating profit and EPS in the quarter. We expect these timing items to reverse in the second half with most of the impact in Q3.\n\nSlide 20 summarizes the components of total company net sales growth.\n\nnet sales increased 1% in the quarter driven by higher organic pound volume, partially offset by lower price mix foreign exchange and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures were not material to net sales in Q2.\n\nShifting to segment results second quarter organic net sales for North America retail were up 1%.\n\nOur organic net sales outpaced Nielsen measured U S retail sales by roughly two points driven by an increase in retailer inventory due in part to the impact of the later Thanksgiving timing.\n\nWe expect this retailer inventory build to reverse in the third quarter.\n\nOrganic net sales in Q2 also benefited from faster growth in non measured channels at.\n\nAt the operating unit level net sales for U S morning Foods increased 4% in U S. Snacks were up 1% net sales for U S meals and baking solutions were down 1% and Canada net sales declined 4% in constant currency.\n\nAs Jeff noted, we strengthened our competitiveness and our with our pound and dollar trends improving in seven of our top 10 U S categories from Q1 to Q2.\n\nOn the bottom line constant currency segment operating profit in our essentially matched year ago results driven by cost savings and favorable price mix offset by input cost inflation higher other supply chain costs and lower volume.\n\nMoving on to slide 22 second quarter organic net sales for our North America Pet segment were up 5%.\n\nThis result, outpaced our Nielsen measured retail sales performance by roughly four points. The difference reflected a rebuild of retailer inventory after significant reductions and second quarters of fiscal 'twenty, three and fiscal 'twenty four.\n\nWe do not expect to see a material change in retailer inventory in the second half net.\n\nNet sales were up high single digits for dry food up mid single digits for west food and up low single digits for treats.\n\nQ2 represented our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential market share improvement for our U S pet food business with our pound share growing and our dollar share flat in the quarter on the bottom line second quarter in North America Pet segment operating profit was up 36% in constant currency driven by H M M costs.\n\nSavings higher volume and lower other supply chain costs, partially offset by unfavorable price mix and higher SG&A expenses, including an increase in media investment.\n\nNorth America Foodservice organic net sales were up 8% in the quarter driven by a mid single digit increase in organic pound volume and positive price mix.\n\nNet sales results were led by strong growth in our brands cereal and frozen meals.\n\nWe continued to drive strong market share gains year to date across key channels, including K 12 schools healthcare and colleges and universities on the bottom line second quarter North America Foodservice segment operating profit was up 24% in constant currency driven by favorable price mix.\n\nMoving to slide 24 second quarter organic net sales for our international segment were down 3% driven by declines in China, and Brazil, partially offset by continued growth in our distributor markets as well as Europe, and Australia as Jeff mentioned continued macroeconomic consumer headwinds in China drove double digit declines for .\n\nshops to traffic in the market.\n\nAnd we are working to mitigate those headwinds by expanding Hagen dazs distribution across retail foodservice and e-commerce channels within our retail outlets. We've continued to drive sequential improvement in market share on Hagen dazs, reaching share growth in Q2.\n\nSecond quarter segment operating profit totaled $24 million compared.\n\nCompared to $35 million, a year ago, driven by unfavorable price mix and higher SG&A expenses, partially offset by cost savings.\n\nSlide 25 summarizes our joint venture results in Q2 cereal partners worldwide net sales were up 2% in constant currency with growth in Latin America, partially offset by declines in France and the UK.\n\nHagen Dazs, Japan net sales were up 1% in constant currency, reflecting growth on our handheld formats, partially offset by lower contributions from the timing of new product launches and cup formats.\n\nSecond quarter combined after tax earnings from joint ventures of $30 million were up 23% in constant currency.\n\nBy lower input costs and favorable price mix at CPW, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses and a decrease in volume at CPW and higher input costs and Hagen Dazs, Japan.\n\nTurning to margin results, our second quarter adjusted gross margin increased 130 basis points to 36, 3% of net sales driven by H M. M cost savings, partially offset by input cost inflation and unfavorable price mix, our second quarter adjusted operating profit margin.\n\n100 basis points to 23% with benefits from higher adjusted gross margin, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales.\n\nTiming benefit I referenced earlier added roughly 100 basis points to our Q2 adjusted operating profit margin and we expect that to reverse largely in Q3.\n\nMoving on to other noteworthy Q2 income statement items adjusted unallocated corporate expenses decreased $23 million in the quarter drill.\n\nDriven by certain favorable one time items.\n\nSecond quarter net interest expense was up $7 million driven by higher average long term debt balances.\n\nThe adjusted effective tax rate of 21% compared to 28% a year ago, driven by favorable earnings mix by jurisdiction compared to last year.\n\nFinally average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were down 4% to $560 million, reflecting our continued net share repurchase activity.\n\nOur first half financial results are summarized on slide 28.\n\nNet sales of $10 1 billion essentially matched year ago results on an organic basis adjusted operating profit of $1 9 billion was up 2% in constant currency, while adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $2 47.\n\nAnd were up 6% in constant currency.\n\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow on slide 29, first half operating cash flow increased 19% to $1 8 billion.\n\nDriven primarily by a change in accounts payable, partially offset by changes in inventory and other current assets.\n\nCapital investments in the first half totaled $301 million.\n\nAnd we returned $1 $2 billion in cash to shareholders in the first six months of the year through dividends and net share repurchases.\n\nOn slide 30, we've provided a few updates to our key financial assumptions for fiscal 2025.\n\nAs Jeff stated earlier, our improvement in volume and market share is requiring higher promotional investment than we initially planned a portion of that incremental investment on the first half and we expect a greater portion of hit in the second half.\n\nWithin cost of goods sold we continue to expect to EQM cost savings to outpace input cost inflation for the full year.\n\nWe now expect to generate savings of 5% of Cogs and input cost inflation is now expected to be 4% of Cogs in fiscal 2025.\n\nAs we look to the second half of fiscal 'twenty five the midpoint of our revised guidance implies adjusted operating profit would be down roughly 8% in constant currency.\n\nThis reflects a three point headwind from the reversal of favorable timing items in the first half.\n\nThree point headwind from incremental growth investments and a two point headwind from a partial reset of incentive compensation.\n\nWith these assumptions in mind, our updated annual fiscal 2025 financial outlook can be seen on slide 31 organic net sales are still expected to range between flat and up 1% with our current outlook targeting the lower end of that range.\n\nAdjusted operating profit is now expected to be down four to down 2% in constant currency.\n\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share are now expected to be down three to down 1% in constant currency and we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be at least 95% of adjusted after tax earnings.\n\nNote that our outlook does not include the impact of the North American yogurt divestitures, nor the White bridge pet brands acquisition as those transactions have yet to close.\n\nWith that let me turn it back to Jeff for some closing remarks.\n\nThanks, Kofi I'll close out with a few thoughts we are encouraged by our progress we've made to accelerate our volume growth and improve our market share trends driven by our continued focus on delivering remarkable experiences to consumers across the total product offering to deliver those gains and build on them going forward, we've made incremental investments to bring consume.\n\ngreater value amid a challenging macroeconomic backdrop.\n\nAnd our teams who are operating with agility and doing what's right for our consumers and I'm confident that the actions, we're taking will better position general mills for sustained growth in fiscal 2026 and beyond."

This is Jeff Siemon, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for listening to General Mills' prepared remarks for our Fiscal 2023 Second Quarter Earnings. Later this morning, we will hold a separate live question-and-answer session on today's results, which you can hear via webcast on our Investor Relations website. Joining me for this morning's presentation are Jeff Harmening, our Chairman and CEO; and Kofi Bruce, our CFO. Before I hand things over to them, let me first touch on a few items.\nOn our website, you will find our press release that posted this morning, along with a copy of the presentation and a transcript of these remarks. Please note that today's remarks will include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists several factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey L. Harmening\n\nChairman & CEO, General Mills, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by summarizing today's key messages. Building on a good start to the year in Q1, we delivered strong results in our second quarter, including double-digit growth in organic net sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We also delivered a second consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion representing continued progress toward restoring our pre-pandemic margin profile. The operating environment remains volatile. While we've seen some modest improvements in recent months, it is still far from pre-pandemic conditions, particularly at our upstream suppliers. In this context, our team continues to execute well, and we remain focused on advancing our Accelerate Strategy and delivering our fiscal 2023 priorities.\nGiven our strong first half results and positive momentum on our business, we are once again raising our full year guidance for organic net sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS growth. Slide 5 summarizes our financial performance for the second quarter and the first half of fiscal '23. We drove 11% organic net sales growth in the quarter, fueled by strong net pricing realization in response to significant levels of input cost inflation. Adjusted operating profit was up 7% and adjusted diluted EPS was up 12%, each in constant currency.\nOur first half results were also strong with double-digit growth in organic net sales and adjusted diluted EPS. The operating environment in fiscal 2023 remains challenging and dynamic. On the cost side, we continue to forecast total input cost inflation of approximately 14% to 15% for the full year, including double-digit inflation in the second half. Volume elasticities continue to remain below historical levels in the first half, particularly in North America Retail. We are watching these trends closely, but we do not expect a return to pre-pandemic elasticity levels during fiscal 2023.\nWe've seen some modest improvement in supply chain environment in recent months with logistics challenges continuing to ease and a slight reduction in the level of upstream supply disruptions. As a result, our customer service levels reached a high 80% range in the U.S. Retail by the end of the quarter, up from the mid-80s last quarter, though still well below our normal range of 98% to 99%. Despite these improvements, supply disruptions remain well above historical averages and we aren't forecasting a return to pre-pandemic levels of supply disruptions or customer service during the fiscal year.\nFinally, we continue to see the pandemic impacting consumers' health and mobility around the globe. This has been most acute in China during the first half of this year. Overall, while it's encouraging to see some signs of supply chain improvement recently, we expect the pace of change in the operating environment to remain high for the foreseeable future. As we've said in the past, our job is not to predict the future better than our competition, but instead to be better able to adapt to change and deliver winning results regardless of the environment. That has been our recipe for success in the recent years, and we're focusing on continuing that success in fiscal 2023 and beyond.\nWe are continuing to drive our Accelerate strategy this year by executing on the 3 priorities outlined on Slide 7. We will continue to compete effectively by boldly building our brands, relentlessly innovating and servicing the business with excellence. We will continue to invest for the future by delivering HMM and SRM to offset inflation, making strategic investments in the business and continuing to progress against our ESG commitments. And we will continue to reshape our portfolio by ensuring smooth transitions for our announced transactions and assessing the landscape for additional growth and value-enhancing acquisitions or divestitures. I'm pleased to say that we are making progress against each of these priorities through the first half.\nWe're competing effectively once again in fiscal 2023, building on 4 consecutive years of strong market share performance. We are holding or gaining share in 37% of our priority businesses through the first half. But that includes a share decline in cereal, where we're comparing against our unusually strong share gains in the U.S. a year ago when a key competitor was dealing with significant service challenges. On a 2-year basis, our market share in cereal is still up. And after adjusting for that change, we are holding or gaining share in 54% of our priority businesses, including a broad array of platforms in the U.S. and internationally.\nIn addition to executing for today, we continue to make strategic investments to strengthen our brands and our competitive advantages for the future. Our media investment was up double digits in Q2, and we expect it to be up double digits for the full year behind compelling campaigns that are increasingly leveraging our digital capabilities to reach consumers everywhere they interact with our brands.\nWe've invested significantly in recent years to strengthen our capabilities that are critical to our future success, including digital and technology, strategic revenue management, e-commerce, global impact and others. Our total capability investments will be up again in fiscal 2023, led by digital and technology. In fact, we've increased our investment in this area by more than $100 million over the past few years, and we expect to grow in this area by double digits again this year.\nAdditionally, we plan to increase our investment in growth capital by more than 50% in fiscal '23. This includes investments to increase internal manufacturing capacity on key platforms where we see sustained growth into the future, such as pet food, Mexican food, hot snacks, fruit snacks and cereal.\nAnother important way we are investing for the future is through our commitment to standing for good. For decades, General Mills has taken action to reduce hunger and food insecurity in our communities through grants, corporate contributions and food product donations.\nWe work with food banks in more than 40 countries to expand food security and build long-term resilience for the future. One example is Feeding America. General Mills was a founding member of this U.S. hunger relief organization more than 40 years ago. More recently, we supported the creation of Feeding America's MealConnect, a solution for the nation's charitable food system that allows member food banks to coordinate and receive donations from their local food businesses and grocers. As the only food rescue technology available nationwide, MealConnect serves more than 12,000 nonprofits and has enabled the recovery of more than 3.5 billion nourishing meals since its launch in 2014.\nIn addition to providing monetary support, General Mills helped co-create MealConnect logistics function, which works to reroute rejected or damaged but perfectly safe food products for donation at food banks. Standing for good is a critical pillar of our Accelerate strategy and is an important way we are investing for our future, for our company, our planet and for our communities.\nSwitching gears, I'd like to spend a few minutes highlighting several businesses where we are consistently competing effectively and investing for the future, led by North America Retail. As we've shared in the past, we built a multiyear success story in cereal behind strong innovation, renovation and investment in what we believe are the best brands in the category.\nIn fact, annual Nielsen-measured retail sales for our U.S. cereal business are up 20% since fiscal 2018 to more than $3 billion. We've gained 2.5 share points over that time and solidified our #1 position in the category. We're bringing more compelling news and innovation to the cereal category in fiscal 2023.Cheerios, which is, by far, the largest brand in the category, continues to keep its heart health messaging fresh for consumers, while Cinnamon Toast Crunch the second largest brand in the category is engaging new consumers with its crazy squares. In addition, we've launched 3 of the top 5 new products in the category so far in fiscal '23, and we are particularly excited about our second half innovation plans.\nOur new Minis platform brings consumers miniature versions of their favorite cereal brands, providing a fun new way to enjoy the big flavors they love. We've seen exceptional retail acceptance for these new products, and they are already among the top turning items in their first few weeks on shelf.\nWe've grown our retail sales for our Pillsbury U.S. Refrigerated Dough business by nearly 50% over the past 5 years, to nearly $2 billion and we're working on our 5th consecutive year of market share gains after having added 5 points of share in the past 4 years. Pillsbury provides convenience and joy to families for special occasions and everyday meals. We're having another strong key baking season this year and we're bringing the brand more regularly into consumers' everyday meal routines.\nOur most recent messaging with consumers highlights the many ways to conveniently make homemade using Pillsbury dough products outside the oven. And we are leveraging our data and connected commerce capabilities to personalize our messages. For example, by targeting our make homemade messaging to consumers who recently purchased an air frier, we were able to drive lower cost-per-click and convert a higher share of our new Pillsbury consumers, further building confidence in the value of our first-party data.\nOur Fruit Snacks platform is an underappreciated local gem in our portfolio, like Pillsbury dough, but on a smaller scale. Here too, we've generated tremendous growth in recent years with our retail sales in U.S. fruit snacks, up nearly 70% since fiscal 2018 to more than $800 million and our market share up almost 4.5 points to 54% of the category. We accomplished these results despite being capacity constrained for much of that time. But we completed a $100 million capacity expansion on fruit snacks in Q1, which has allowed us to execute new channel expansion plans for e-commerce and convenience stores.\nYear-to-date, we've driven a 44% increase in our e-commerce retail sales on fruit snacks by optimizing our online, shelf and consumer experience, leveraging our connected commerce capability. We've also expanded our fruit snacks presence in impulse channels, launching new peggable packaging that has helped us drive a 12-point increase in fruit snacks market share in convenience stores. With strong momentum, growing consumer demand and plans for further capacity expansion ahead, we are excited about the continued runway for growth on fruit snacks.\nAnother business that has a long runway of growth is Blue Buffalo pet food. The trend for humanization and premiumization in the Pet Food category are strong and will continue to grow in the U.S. and around the world. We are focused on leading and expanding our presence in high-quality natural feeding and treating for dogs and cats. We are led by our purpose to love them like family, feed them like family, which is the reason Blue Buffalo ranks as the #1 brand pet parents are likely to recommend, the top brand pet parents will pay more for and the most loved and trusted natural brand in the category. This has helped us drive terrific growth since we acquired the business in 2018 with our Pet net sales up by $1 billion through fiscal '22.\nWhile we continue to believe in the long run growth opportunity for our Pet business, we experienced an unexpected headwind in Q2 in the form of inventory reductions at some key retailers. As a result, while our all-channel retail sales grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter, our net sales were essentially flat. Beyond the unexpected retail inventory decline, our Pet results in Q2 largely reflected the continued impact of the capacity limitations and resulting customer service challenges that we called out on our first quarter earnings call.\nBecause of these service challenges, we pulled back on media and in-store support, so as not to amplify our issues with on-shelf availability. While these headwinds have been felt across our Pet business, they've been particularly acute on our Dry Dog Food and Treats subsegments. As we move into the second half of fiscal 2023, we expect to get back to double-digit net sales growth on Pet supported by better customer service, stronger product news, increased brand support and stable retail inventory levels.\nWe expect our customer service will improve because of the external manufacturing capacity we've added on dry dog food and treats. To further improve service, we recently added a new distribution center and expanded capacity at our existing warehouses. We initially prioritized customer service improvements on Life Protection Formula, which makes up more than half of our dry dog food retail sales, and we've seen encouraging volume growth on that business in Nielsen-measured channels in the past 6 weeks.\nWe're now expanding our service improvement focus to the rest of our dry dog portfolio and to treats, leveraging our increased capacity. Improved customer service will also allow us to step up our media and in-store support, including a strong double-digit increase in media investment on Pet in the back half. And we have an exciting lineup of innovation and renovation launching across dog food, cat food and treats.\nOur back half news on Pet starts with significant renovation and innovation on our Wilderness dry dog food line. We're adding 20% more meat to our core Wilderness dry dog food products, and we're ramping up spending behind the news. We're also launching Wilderness Premier Blend, a new super premium offering that includes Kibble, plus a new proprietary tender meaty piece that dogs love, in a convenient all-in-one solution pet parents will love too.\nOn cat food, we're renovating our core dry portfolio and relaunching it under the Tastefuls equity. This launch builds on the success of the Tastefuls wet cat food line we introduced in 2021. Blue Tastefuls now offers a complete portfolio of feeding options for cats that provides the perfect combination of great taste and healthy ingredients. The new packaging is just starting to hit shelves now and will support the news with media and in-store activations in the coming months. And on treats, our added capacity will help us drive improved customer service on our Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews products, which now carry the Blue Buffalo shield.\nWith better on-shelf availability, we'll be able to turn on national media support and in-store merchandising leveraging the Blue Buffalo master brand, which will help amplify awareness of these highly differentiated products. We remain bullish about the growth prospects for our Pet business. With the retailer inventory reduction and the worst of our capacity and service challenges behind us and with exciting innovation and brand-building investment behind the strongest natural brand in the category, we're poised to continue Pet's track record of outstanding growth in fiscal 2023 and over the long term.\nTaking a step back, I continue to be pleased with how we're executing our Accelerate strategy to drive profitable growth on our core while continuing to reshape our portfolio. Now let me turn it over to Kofi to provide more details on our second quarter results and our increased guidance.\n\nKofi A. Bruce\n\nCFO, General Mills, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Our second quarter financial results are summarized on Slide 18. Note that there were a handful of events that impacted our year-over-year comparisons this quarter. These included the acquisition of TNT Crust, as well as the divestitures of our European yogurt business, our international dough businesses, and the Helper and Suddenly Salad business in North America. We also had the impact from the international Häagen-Dazs ice cream recall that we announced last quarter. We do not expect any further material impact from the recall in the remainder of the year.\nNow let's move on to our Q2 results. Reported net sales of $5.2 billion were up 4% and organic net sales grew 11% in the quarter, reflecting continued positive price/mix in response to significant input cost inflation, partially offset by lower volume. Adjusted operating profit of $880 million was up 7% in constant currency, with benefits from positive price/mix, partially offset by higher input costs, lower volume and higher SG&A expenses, including a double-digit increase in media investment. Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.10 in the quarter and were up 12% in constant currency.\nSlide 19 summarizes the components of our net sales growth in the quarter. Organic net sales were up 11%, reflecting 17 points of positive organic price/mix, partially offset by a 6-point decline in organic pound volume. Foreign exchange reduced net sales by 1 point, and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a 5-point headwind to second quarter net sales.\nNow let's turn to our segment results, beginning with North America Retail on Slide 20. NAR continues to perform exceptionally well, with our brands delivering for consumers and the business is executing successfully amid ongoing volatility in the operating environment. Organic net sales grew 13% in the quarter, driven by positive price/mix, partially offset by lower volume. Despite elevated levels of inflation-driven pricing, elasticities continue to remain below historical benchmarks. Growth in NAR this quarter was broad based with double-digit net sales growth in U.S. Snacks, U.S. Meals & Baking Solutions and U.S. Morning Foods and mid-single-digit net sales growth in Canada in constant currency.\nWe continue to compete effectively with 67% of our North American Retail priority businesses holding or growing share so far this fiscal year, when adjusting for cereal on a 2-year basis. Second quarter constant currency segment operating profit increased 24%, driven by positive price/mix and HMM cost savings, partially offset by high input cost inflation, lower volume and higher SG&A expenses.\nSlide 21 summarizes our Pet segment results. As Jeff mentioned, Pet net sales in Q2 were negatively impacted by a reduction in retail inventory. All channel retail sales were up high single digits in the quarter. We expect Pet net sales growth to accelerate in the second half behind increased capacity, improved customer service, strong innovation and renovation news and increased brand building investment.\nAdditionally, we expect retailer inventory levels to remain stable in the back half of the year. On the bottom line, second quarter segment operating profit totaled $87 million compared to $132 million a year ago, driven primarily by high teens input cost inflation, a significant increase in costs related to capacity expansion and supply chain disruptions and lower volume including the impact of retailer inventory reduction. These headwinds were partially offset by positive price/mix. We expect to deliver profit growth on Pet in the back half with stronger volume performance, less headwind from capacity and supply chain disruption costs and better alignment between price mix and inflation.\nMoving on to our North America Foodservice segment. On Slide 22, organic net sales grew 17% in the quarter. As we expected, this quarter's performance included greater price mix benefit on our non-flour businesses compared to Q1 and less benefit from market index pricing on bakery flour, which is dollar profit neutral. Segment operating profit for the quarter was up 20%, driven by positive price/mix partially offset by higher input costs and higher SG&A expenses.\nSecond quarter international segment results are summarized on Slide 23. Organic net sales were up 5% this quarter, driven by good growth in Brazil, our distributor markets, and Europe and Australia, partially offset by a decline in China due to continued consumer mobility restrictions due to the Zero-COVID policy as well as the impact of the international ice cream recall.\nSecond quarter segment operating profit totaled $18 million compared to $59 million a year ago driven by higher input costs and lower volume, including the impact of divestitures and the ice cream recall, partially offset by positive price/mix and lower SG&A expenses. With comparisons against the yogurt divestiture and ice cream recall now behind us, we expect to generate profit growth in the international in the back half of fiscal '23.\nSlide 24 summarizes our joint venture results in the second quarter. Cereal Partners Worldwide net sales were up 2% in constant currency, driven by favorable price mix, partially offset by lower volume. Häagen-Dazs Japan net sales were down 10% in constant currency as the business lagged strong new product performance last year. Second quarter combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $25 million compared to $33 million a year ago, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange as well as lower constant currency profit at Häagen-Dazs Japan, partially offset by favorable CPW price/mix.\nTurning to total company margin results on Slide 25. Our second quarter adjusted gross margin increased 100 basis points versus last year to 33.2%driven by positive price/mix and HMM cost savings, partially offset by mid-teens input cost inflation, higher other cost of goods sold and supply chain deleverage. While this is our second quarter of gross margin improvement, our adjusted gross margin is still below pre-pandemic levels, and we have more work to do to restore our historic margin profile. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 60 basis points in the quarter to 16.9%, driven by higher adjusted gross margin, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses.\nSlide 26 summarizes other noteworthy Q2 income statement items. Adjusted unallocated corporate expenses increased $30 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting increased capability investments this year and certain discrete favorable items 1 year ago. Net interest expense decreased $1 million driven by lower average long-term debt balances partially offset by higher rates. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1% compared to 22.3% a year ago, driven by certain discrete tax benefits this year. And average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were down 2% to 602 million, reflecting our net share repurchase activity.\nOur first half fiscal '23 results are summarized on Slide 27. Net sales of $9.9 billion were up 4%, including a 5-point headwind from net divestiture and acquisition activity and 1 point of unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Organic net sales increased 11% driven by positive organic price/mix, partially offset by lower organic pound volume. Year-to-date, adjusted operating profit of $1.8 billion increased 8% in constant currency. And adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.21 were up 13% in constant currency.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 28. While we drove strong growth in adjusted net earnings in the first half, our operating cash flow was down from $1.5 billion a year ago to $1.2 billion in the first half of fiscal '23 driven primarily by an increase in inventory and higher cash tax payments. Year-to-date capital investments in the quarter totaled $227 million. We remain on track for capital investment to total roughly 4% of net sales in the full year. And we returned $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders in the first 6 months of the year through dividends and net share repurchases.\nOn Slide 29, you can see our increased guidance for fiscal 2023. We now expect organic net sales to increase to 8% to 9%, reflecting better volume performance and improved price/mix relative to our prior outlook. We continue to expect elasticity to remain below historical levels over the remainder of the fiscal year.\nWe now expect adjusted operating profit to increase 3% to 5% in constant currency reflecting stronger top line performance. We continue to expect total input cost inflation of 14% to 15% of total cost of goods sold, HMM cost savings of 3% to 4% of COGS, moderately lower supply chain disruptions versus last year and increased investment in brand building and other growth-driving activities.\nConstant currency adjusted diluted earnings per share are now expected to increase 4% to 6%. This updated outlook reflects stronger profit growth and higher net interest expense, which is now expected to total more than $400 million for the full year, reflecting rising interest rates. Our guidance for both adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS both include a 3-point net headwind from divestitures and acquisitions and an estimated 1-point headwind from the ice cream recall. Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion will be at least 90% of adjusted after-tax earnings. Now let me turn it back to Jeff for some closing remarks.\n\nJeffrey L. Harmening\n\nChairman & CEO, General Mills, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kofi. Let me close with a few thoughts. I continue to be pleased with how we're executing our Accelerate strategy and driving profitable growth, including delivering strong results again in Q2. We are competing effectively, building on 4 consecutive years of positive market share performance and we continue to invest for the future. While we have work to do to overcome some short-term headwinds in Pet and International, we've taken actions to drive stronger results in those segments in the second half of this year.\nI'm also pleased that we are once again raising our guidance for the full year, building on our strong first half results and compelling plans for the back half.\nThank you for your time this morning. This concludes our prepared remarks. I invite you to listen to our live question-and-answer webcast, which will begin at 8:00 a.m. Central time this morning and will be available for replay on our Investor Relations page at generalmills.com."

This is Jeff Siemon, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I want to thank you for listening to our prepared remarks on General Mills' Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings. Later this morning, we will hold a separate live question-and-answer session on today's results, which you can hear via webcast on our Investor Relations website.\nJoining me for this morning's presentation are Jeff Harmening, our Chairman and CEO; and Kofi Bruce, our CFO. But before I hand things over to them, let me first touch on a few items.\nOn our website, you'll find our press release that posted this morning, along with a copy of the presentation and transcript of these remarks. You should note that beginning with this quarter, we are reporting our results under a new segment structure, which we first highlighted at CAGNY. You can find supplementary information on our IR website that shows our historical net sales and segment operating profit results recast for this new segment structure.\nPlease also note that today's remarks include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey L. Harmening\n\nChairman & CEO, General Mills, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by summarizing today's key messages. We are executing well in an operating environment that remains as volatile as ever. Input cost inflation is at historic levels with increasing variability and disruptions continue to impact our supply chain, including some acute supply shortages that constrained a few of our U.S. platforms in the third quarter. We worked quickly to address those disruptions, driving a faster-than-expected rebound in service levels, the final weeks of the quarter, which translated into Q3 results that were ahead of our latest guidance. We expect to drive strong growth in the fourth quarter, fueled by accelerating benefits from our recent strategic revenue management actions, which will help offset an expected step-up in inflation in Q4. With the confidence in our plans and positive momentum on our business, we are raising our full year outlook on net sales, operating profit and EPS.\nSlide 5 summarizes our third quarter and year-to-date financial performance. Organic net sales growth was up 4% in the quarter, driven by a positive price/mix. Higher supply chain costs and lower volume outstripped our pricing and productivity efforts, resulting in a 6% decline in constant currency adjusted operating profit. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS was up 2% in the quarter due to lower net interest and higher JV earnings.\nThis quarter marks 2 years since we began to see the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Many markets, like the United States, are moving to a new normal, while some continue to face elevated cases and mobility restrictions. At this milestone, we thought it would be helpful to take stock of what has changed.\nGeneral Mills was accelerating as we entered the pandemic, and we've built on that momentum over the past 2 years. Our worldwide net sales are up nearly $2 billion or 11% from 2 years ago, and our earnings have outpaced net sales growth with adjusted diluted EPS of 12%. We've grown household penetration on many of our biggest brands around the world. We've strengthened critical capabilities, like digital and technology, connected commerce and SRM. Our portfolio is more oriented toward profitable growth, thanks to our recent acquisitions and divestitures. And our balance sheet is much stronger today than it was 2 years ago, providing us with increased financial flexibility.\nShifting the focus back to fiscal 2022, we're continuing to deliver this year against our 3 enterprise priorities. First, we continue to compete effectively by executing our Accelerate strategy. Second, we are successfully navigating the dynamic supply chain environment. And third, we are executing our portfolio and organizational reshaping actions without disrupting our base business. Let me share a few examples of our performance across these 3 priorities.\nGeneral Mills brands are winning in the marketplace. We're competing effectively in fiscal 2022, holding or growing market share in 66% of our priority businesses year-to-date. This includes important global platforms, such as cereal, pet food, ice cream and Mexican food as well as local gem brands, like Pillsbury refrigerated dough and our fruit snacks business in the U.S., Wanchai Ferry frozen dumplings in China, and Yoki and Kitano snacks and seasonings in Brazil.\nWe are winning in an operating environment that remains highly volatile. The whole industry continues to face transportation challenges and labor shortages. Our suppliers are facing these same constraints leading to significant disruptions for our business.\nAt CAGNY, we called out supply-driven challenges on our U.S. refrigerated dough, pizza and hot snacks platforms that were causing lower customer service and reduced on-shelf availability for those businesses. We responded urgently to address the problems. Our actions drove a sharper rebound than we expected at the end of the third quarter, and we're seeing that improvement continue into Q4.\nNot only have supply chain disruptions been a challenge, but we are also facing historic levels of input cost inflation. Our market basket, measured at spot rates, has been at a multi-decade high in recent months, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine has driven further spot market inflation and volatility. Critically, we've seen very limited impact from those movements on our fiscal '22 inflation outlook, which remains at 8% to 9% across our full cost of goods, including raw and packaging materials, manufacturing and logistics. Our hedging strategy is working, reducing input cost volatility and increasing visibility, which gives us more time to take actions. And importantly, we are covered on certain key commodities at competitive prices through calendar 2022.\nWe continue to rely on HMM cost savings and SRM pricing actions to address rising costs. As we've shared before, we've taken broad-based SRM actions across our portfolio this year in response to elevated inflation. Our organic price/mix has increased each quarter, reaching 7% in Q3, and we expect another step-up in Q4 as we get the full impact of the SRM actions we put in place in recent months. Looking ahead, we remain committed to taking the necessary actions to address rising costs and protect our bottom line.\nWe've also made progress on our third priority, including streamlining and realigning our operating structure. This includes shifting our U.S. convenience store business into our North America Retail segment to better leverage our scale and unlock omnichannel snacking growth. Our renamed North America Foodservice segment is now exclusively focused on the U.S. and Canadian foodservice channels. And with the completion of our European divestitures, we've consolidated our Asia and Latin America and Europe and Australia segments into a single international reporting unit to simplify our global operations.\nIn total, these changes position our businesses for greater competitiveness and agility and strengthen our ability to deliver a long-term profitable growth in line with our Accelerate strategy.\nAnother critical element of our Accelerate strategy is our focus on being a force for good in the world, as a company and through our brands. As we shared with you earlier this fiscal year, each quarter, we intend to highlight an ESG-related topic and discuss our progress and future goals. This quarter, we focused our attention on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the growing humanitarian crisis in the region. We extend our deepest sympathies and condolences to the people of Ukraine, and we've taken action to support those impacted in Ukraine and neighboring countries with a particular focus on food security.\nThrough General Mills and our Cereal Partners Worldwide joint venture, we have provided funding to our partners at the European Food Banks Federation and the International Federation of Red Cross Societies, and we've made direct food donations for people in need. Our employees are also supporting these initiatives through our charitable gift matching program.\nTo conclude, I like the way we're competing and managing through this challenging environment better than our competition. We are growing our core while making important changes to our portfolio to position us for a stronger, more profitable growth over the long term. And we're doing what we said we would do, with fiscal '22 marking the fourth consecutive year where we expect to meet or exceed our key financial targets. We have good momentum, and we are set up to continue to win as we exit the pandemic and move into the next phase of growth.\nWith that, I will pass it over to Kofi to review our financial performance in the quarter.\n\nKofi A. Bruce\n\nCFO, General Mills, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Let's start with our third quarter financial results on Slide 14. Net sales of $4.5 billion were flat in the quarter. Organic net sales grew 4%, driven by positive price/mix from our broad-based SRM actions, partially offset by lower pound volume. Adjusted operating profit of $676 million was down 6% in constant currency, driven primarily by input cost inflation, supply chain deleverage and higher other cost of goods sold and lower volume, partially offset by positive price/mix, HMM cost savings and lower SG&A expenses. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.84 were up 2% in constant currency, due primarily to lower net interest expense and higher after-tax JV earnings, partially offset by lower adjusted operating profit. On a 2-year compound growth basis, third quarter organic net sales grew 5%, adjusted operating profit decreased 1% in constant currency, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 4% in constant currency.\nSlide 15 summarizes the components of our reported net sales in the quarter. Organic net sales grew 4%, with 7 points of positive organic price/mix, partially offset by a 4-point headwind from lower organic pound volume. Our net acquisition and divestiture activity reduced net sales growth by 3 points in the quarter.\nNow let's turn to segment results, beginning with North America retail on Slide 16. Note that in addition to shifting our convenience store business into NAR this quarter, we've also streamlined the segment's operating unit structure, most notably by combining U.S. Cereal and U.S. Yogurt into a single U.S. Morning Foods Operating Unit.\nThird quarter organic net sales for NAR were up 1%, driven by positive price/mix, partially offset by lower volume. NAR had a difficult comparison this quarter with organic net sales up 11% a year ago. On a 2-year compound growth basis, third quarter organic net sales were up 6%. Net sales growth lagged Nielsen-measured retail sales growth by roughly 3 points in the quarter, driven by the acute supply shortages that Jeff mentioned earlier on refrigerated dough, pizza and hot snacks. As Jeff mentioned, we started to see improved customer service on these platforms in the last few weeks of Q3, and we expect further service improvement in Q4.\nFrom an operating unit standpoint, third quarter net sales growth in U.S. Morning Foods and U.S. Snacks was partially offset by a decline in U.S. Meals & Baking Solutions. We continue to compete effectively with 56% of our U.S. retail business holding or growing share year-to-date.\nThird quarter constant currency segment operating profit decreased 3%, driven primarily by higher input costs and lower volume, partially offset by a positive price/mix and lower SG&A expenses. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit was up 5%.\nThird quarter net sales for our Pet segment increased 30%, including 14 points of benefit from the pet treats acquisition. Organic net sales were up 16% in the quarter, including double-digit growth in cat food and treats, and high single-digit growth in dog food and treats. On a 2-year compound growth basis, third quarter organic net sales were up 15%.\nFiscal year-to-date, the Blue Buffalo brand continued to drive strong retail sales growth and market share gains in measured channels, and the Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews brands generated year-to-date retail sales growth of 21%.\nOn the bottom line, constant currency segment operating profit increased 8%, driven primarily by a positive price/mix and higher volume, including benefits from the pet treats acquisition, partially offset by higher input costs and higher SG&A expenses. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit also increased 8%.\nTurning to Slide 18. Third quarter organic net sales for North America Foodservice grew 22%, reflecting increased demand in away-from-home food channels, including schools, restaurants and lodging as well as benefits from market index pricing on bakery flour. On a 2-year compound growth basis, third quarter organic net sales were down 3%.\nSegment operating profit decreased 13% in the quarter, driven by higher input costs, partially offset by positive price/mix. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit decreased 29%.\nThird quarter net sales for our International segment were down 23%, primarily reflecting the divestiture of our European yogurt and dough businesses. Organic net sales were down 1%, reflecting a difficult comparison to year-ago results that grew 10%. On a 2-year compound growth basis, organic net sales increased 4%. We continue to compete effectively, including growing year-to-date market share in Mexican food and ice cream.\nThird quarter segment operating profit was down 16% in constant currency, driven primarily by lower volume, including the impact of the European yogurt and dough divestiture, and higher input costs, partially offset by positive price/mix and lower SG&A expenses. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit was up 1%.\nSlide 20 summarizes our joint venture results in the third quarter. Cereal Partners Worldwide net sales increased 1% in constant currency, driven by positive price/mix, partially offset by lower volume. Häagen-Dazs Japan net sales were up 9% in constant currency, driven primarily by strong performance on core products and improved distribution.\nThird quarter constant currency after-tax earnings from joint ventures increased to $30 million versus $12 million a year ago, driven by higher profit at Cereal Partners Worldwide.\nNow let's turn to total company margin results on Slide 21. As we expected, we cut our Q2 margin decline roughly in half, with Q3 adjusted gross margin down 160 basis points. Increased benefits from positive price/mix and continued HMM cost savings outweighed a step-up in input cost inflation in the quarter but were not enough to fully offset headwinds from supply chain disruptions and other cost of goods sold. Adjusted operating profit margin in the quarter was down 90 basis points, driven by lower adjusted gross margin, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses.\nSlide 22 summarizes other noteworthy Q3 income statement items. Adjusted unallocated corporate expenses increased by $19 million in the quarter. Net interest expense decreased $20 million, driven by lower average debt balances. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21% compared to 21.6% a year ago due primarily to favorable earnings mix by market. And average diluted shares outstanding were down 1%, reflecting our share repurchase activity.\nOur fiscal '22 year-to-date results are summarized on Slide 23. Net sales of $14 billion were up 4%. Organic net sales also increased 4% driven by positive organic price/mix. Year-to-date adjusted operating profit of $2.3 billion decreased 5% in constant currency and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.82 were down 2% in constant currency. On a 2-year compound growth basis, organic net sales were up 6%, constant currency adjusted operating profit was up 3%, and constant currency adjusted diluted EPS was up 6%.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow. 9 months operating cash flow of more than $2.2 billion was up 1% versus last year. Our core working capital balance decreased $159 million from a year ago due to an increase in accounts payable and timing in inventory. Year-to-date capital investments totaled $351 million, and we've returned nearly $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders in the first 9 months of the year through dividends and net share repurchases.\nOn Slide 25, we've provided an update on some key financial assumptions for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. We expect price/mix to step up again in the fourth quarter, reflecting a full quarter of benefit from SRM actions that went into effect in recent months. On the cost side, we continue to expect double-digit input cost inflation in the fourth quarter and 8% to 9% inflation for the full year. We are close to fully covered on our ingredients and packaging material requirements in fiscal 2022.\nWe expect the operating environment will remain challenging and volatile as we close out the year. We anticipate demand will remain elevated, and we expect the improvement in customer service that we saw at the end of the third quarter will carry into Q4, though will still be well below normal service levels.\nAs Jeff mentioned earlier, we've raised our full year outlook for fiscal 2022, which you can see on Slide 26. We now expect to generate organic net sales growth of approximately 5%, which is at the upper end of our prior range. We expect constant currency adjusted operating profit to range between down 2% and flat compared to our previous range of down 4% to down 1%, reflecting the flow-through of stronger top line growth. Constant currency adjusted diluted earnings per share are now expected to range between flat and up 2% compared to our prior guidance between down 2% and up 1%. And we continue to expect free cash flow conversion will be at least 95% of the adjusted after-tax earnings.\nLet me now turn it back to Jeff for some closing remarks.\n\nJeffrey L. Harmening\n\nChairman & CEO, General Mills, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kofi. Let me close by saying that I'm proud of the way we're executing and competing in such a challenging environment. We moved quickly to address recent supply disruptions and exited Q3 with improved momentum. We expect to generate strong growth in Q4 and deliver full year results that are ahead of our original guidance. And we remain focused on executing our Accelerate strategy and driving superior shareholder returns over the long term.\nThank you for your time this morning. This concludes our prepared remarks. I invite you to listen to our live question-and-answer webcast, which will begin at 8:00 a.m. Central Time this morning and will be available for replay at generalmills.com."

Later this morning, we will hold a separate live question-and-answer session on today's results, which you can hear via webcast on our Investor Relations website. Joining me for this morning's presentation are Jeff Harmening, our Chairman and CEO, and Kofi Bruce, our CFO. Before I hand things over to them, let me first touch on a few housekeeping items. First, on our website, you'll find our press release that posted this morning, along with a copy of the presentation and a transcript of these remarks. Please note that today's remarks include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists several factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff for some prepared remarks.\n\nJeff Harmening\n\nChairman and CEO, General Mills\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me kick off by summarizing our key messages for today. Our primary focus this year is investing to strengthen the remarkability of our brands because we know that delivering greater remarkability to consumers is the key to restoring organic sales growth for our business. During Q2, our team continued to execute exceptionally well against that goal while navigating a volatile operating environment. We finalized base price adjustments across two-thirds of our North America Retail business, launched into the fresh segment of the pet food category with Love Made Fresh, and drove another quarter of strong market share gains in our North America Foodservice and international businesses. We did this all while continuing to deliver world-class levels of Holistic Margin Management cost savings, transitioning two divestitures and one acquisition, advancing our digital and AI initiatives, and expanding our enterprise transformation efforts.\nOur good progress on our Remarkability agenda led to improved volume and sales trends from Q1 to Q2. With strong second-half plans and continued confidence in our executional ability, we expect to drive further improvement over the remainder of the year. As a result, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2026 guidance today. Our Q2 results are summarized on slide five. Organic volume was flat, and organic net sales were down 1%, representing a one-point and two-point improvement, respectively, relative to our first-quarter results. Importantly, we posted organic volume growth in NAR for the first time in more than four years, and we returned our North America Pet segment to organic sales growth in the quarter.\nOn the bottom line, our Q2 adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS results were both down double digits, driven primarily by our investments in remarkability, the impact of our North America yogurt divestitures, and unfavorable trade expense timing. These results were ahead of our expectations, and we expect that profit favorability to unwind in Q3, as Kofi will describe in more detail shortly. We remain focused on three priorities that are critical to our success in fiscal 2026. First, we are working to return North America retail to volume growth by investing in remarkable experiences to strengthen pound share and household penetration for our brands. Second, we will accelerate our North America pet growth, including improving our core Blue Buffalo business and driving new opportunities with our Love Made Fresh launch, our recently acquired Tiki Cat business, and the rollout of Edgard & Cooper in the US.\nAnd third, to help fund these investments, we'll drive efficiencies to reinvest in growth. This means continuing to deliver best-in-class Holistic Margin Management, or productivity, and transforming how we work to free up our teams to focus on growth. To achieve these priorities, we'll lean on our Remarkable Experience Framework as our guide. Remarkability, at its core, is how we compete and win. By advancing five key pillars: product, packaging, brand communications, omnichannel execution, and value, we're positioning our brands for greater consumer affinity and long-term growth. We are laser-focused on leveraging our Remarkable Experience Framework across the enterprise to guide our brand investment decisions. Let me share a few examples of how our focus on Remarkability delivered results in the second quarter. In North America Retail, we're encouraged by the progress we've made to improve our competitiveness.\nAs we've shared before, we're on a multi-year journey to improve the remarkability of our brands, guided by our framework. During Q2, we completed our work to improve consumer value through base price adjustments across roughly two-thirds of NAR's portfolio. This is allowing our investments in remarkable product news, innovation, brand building, and in-store events to work even harder for us. We saw that play out with another quarter of strong competitiveness in Q2, holding or growing pound share in eight of our top 10 US categories. In fact, within those top 10 categories, which is where we focused our base price investments, our Nielsen measured pounds were up 1% in the quarter, representing a three-point improvement on our performance in fiscal 2025. And we grew household penetration for the second consecutive quarter.\nWhile we're encouraged by the progress we're making in improving volume, we've seen a change in consumer behavior this year that is driving an increase in the cost of volume across our categories. More specifically, with lower and middle-income consumers continuing to feel significant economic pressure, we've seen them make a greater proportion of their food purchases on promotion rather than at everyday prices. This has not been driven by increased frequency or depth of promotions by General Mills or our competitors. Those metrics are essentially unchanged from a year ago. It's simply a reflection of stressed consumers finding ways to stretch their dollars further. This is a phenomenon we'll watch closely as we move through the rest of this year.\nIt gives us even more confidence that our focus on delivering more value to consumers, along with amplifying the other elements of our Remarkability framework, is the right one in the current environment. I'm proud of the way our team has strengthened all five elements of Remarkability across the biggest brands in our North America retail portfolio this year. For example, on superior product, our first-half innovation and renovation news delivered the right combination of product benefits, great taste, convenience, and affordability that resonated with consumers and drove results ahead of our expectations, including strong performance from Cheerios Protein, Pillsbury's bakes up bigger news, Mott's snack bars, and Annie's Super Mac. With early success on our lineup of bigger and better new product launches, we remain on track to deliver a 25% increase in sales from new products in fiscal 2026.\nOn remarkable package design, we're winning at the shelf by bringing consumers new sizes and formats to deliver the right price points or meet new occasions. For example, our Chex Mix tubs are proving to be highly incremental to our core bag line. And we've added a unique car cup format to deliver consumers value and convenience, helping drive high single-digit retail pound growth for our salty snacks in Q2. And on fruit snacks, our price pack architecture work helped us win new distribution and deliver holiday offerings that drove high single-digit retail pound growth this quarter. On brand communication, we've seen a double-digit increase in Media ROI so far this year on new social-first media campaigns on many of our largest brands, such as Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Progresso, Old El Paso, and many more.\nWe've leveraged digital tools to efficiently reach consumers with the right messages, and we supported these new campaigns with a double-digit increase in media investment in the first half. On omnichannel execution, we drove stronger brand growth through cross-portfolio omnichannel events during key shopping seasons, leveraging the power of our portfolio brands to spotlight our remarkable mealtime solutions. And as I mentioned earlier, during Q2, we brought more compelling value to consumers by adjusting base prices to address key price cliffs and gaps across roughly two-thirds of our NAR portfolio. Encouragingly, we've seen elasticities in line or ahead of our expectations across roughly 90% of those investments. We look to build on this momentum with strong plans for the second half of the year. This includes a great seasonal lineup with news and new offerings across Pillsbury, Betty Crocker, Chex, Nature Valley, and our Toast Crunch cereal franchise.\nWe're also launching a slate of remarkable innovation in North America Retail in the second half of fiscal 2026, focused on the fastest-growing consumer trends in food, including better-for-you benefits like protein, bold flavors, and products that deliver familiar and fun experiences for stressed consumers. On protein, we're highlighting 50% more chocolate chunks and our new line of Nature Valley Creamy Protein Snack Bars. We're introducing new indulgent flavors of our fast-growing Nature Valley Protein Granola line, which generated Nielsen measured pounds growth of nearly 20% in Q2. We're expanding availability of our Ghost Protein Cereal line, and we'll start to scale up a remarkable line of Ghost performance nutrition bars that deliver 20 grams of protein, only two grams of sugar, and exceptional taste. On bold flavors, we're launching new Old El Paso chimichangas and Mexican pizza offerings.\nWe'll roll out our new Totino's Ultimate Pizza line to national distribution, and we're expanding availability of our renovated bolder-flavored Chex Mix varieties. On familiar and fun, we're introducing a new line of Cheerios Granola, bringing the biggest brand in the category to the fastest-growing cereal segment with familiar flavors that families will love. In fact, across our entire granola business, we're launching 10 new items in the second half that will help strengthen our position as the leader in the US granola segment, which is growing double digits in Nielsen measured outlets. We're also launching a new line of Fruit Roll-Ups and Fruit by the Foot that are made without colors from artificial sources. Stepping back, the NAR team has done fantastic work to strengthen remarkability across our portfolio, and we saw that translate into encouraging improvement in retail sales through the first half.\nWe have great plans to build on this momentum, continue to drive strong pound share, and improve our dollar share performance over the remainder of fiscal 2026. Shifting to North America Pet, our focus in fiscal 2026 is to strengthen our core Blue Buffalo business while driving differential growth across our accelerators, including the successful launch of Blue Buffalo's Love Made Fresh. We made good progress improving our competitiveness in Q2, accelerating our all-channel retail sales growth, and holding dollar share. This was led by mid-single-digit growth on cat feeding, with Tastefuls and Tiki Cat continuing to drive strong results. Our dog feeding results were mixed, with positive retail sales acceleration on Life Protection Formula and continued challenges on Wilderness.\nAs we mentioned at our investor day, we are working all elements of our remarkable experience framework to ensure we improve the total product offering on Wilderness to better deliver for today's pet parent needs. And on treats, we deliver low single-digit pound growth driven by strong promotional execution on Nudges and Health Bars. Turning to our pet accelerators, I'm tremendously proud of the work our team has done to successfully execute the national launch of Love Made Fresh, Blue Buffalo's new line of refrigerated fresh food for dogs. Our distribution is approaching 5,000 coolers after a little more than two months in the market. The products have received great ratings and reviews thus far, and we're seeing sales ramp up as we continue to build awareness, supported by strong levels of brand investment.\nWe'll continue accelerating the growth of Love Made Fresh through the second half of fiscal 2026, expanding to additional customers and introducing a third product format to further round out our offering. On Tiki Cat, we've continued to drive double-digit retail sales growth so far this year, leveraging expanded distribution, pet specialty, and strong performance in pure-play e-commerce. And we have an exciting innovation pipeline to continue the momentum on this differentiated brand. And on Edgard & Cooper, we're continuing to support the US launch of this super premium dog food brand, including recently launching a new direct-to-consumer website to further broaden the brand's availability. Between our core Blue Buffalo business and our accelerators, we're confident in our plans across North America Pet, and we expect them to drive further acceleration in our organic sales growth in the second half of fiscal 2026.\nTurning to our North America Foodservice segment, we continue to compete exceptionally well in the second quarter with a continued focus on leading in breakfast through nutrition and expanding our frozen baked goods portfolio. We held our gross share and nearly 90% of our priority businesses in Q2, led by cereal and biscuits. On cereal, we continue to expand our leadership in K-12 schools with great tasting, convenient, and regulatory compliant offerings across our leading brands. This helped us drive 8% retail sales growth on cereal in K-12 schools, resulting in one and a half points of cereal share growth in this quarter. We're also delivering strong momentum on our category-leading Pillsbury biscuits within K-12 schools and commercial restaurants, contributing to more than two points of share growth in biscuits in the second quarter, further strengthening our position as the category leader.\nAs we look ahead, we're doubling down on our nutritional leadership in schools by bringing remarkable breakfast solutions that deliver for students and school operators. For example, we recently launched a new Pillsbury Pancake Puffs innovation that combines easy prep with great taste, all while meeting school nutrition requirements. Turning to our international business, we drove another quarter of strong growth led by results on our global brands. Häagen-Dazs continues to delight consumers with new flavor launches in Europe and renovation on core products like Cookies & Cream, helping drive low single-digit retail sales growth in the quarter. We're looking to build on that with a new brand campaign launching in Q3 to further elevate the brand and drive consumer engagement. On Old El Paso, we've continued to see healthy category growth and plenty of competitive activity from new entrants.\nAs the market leader, we're working to bring more remarkable product news and brand campaigns to attract new households and encourage more repeat purchases for existing Old El Paso consumers. And on Nature Valley, we grew dollar share across our core geographies, led by France and Mexico, where our brand-building investments and expanded distribution reinforced our leading position in the snack bar category. For our third priority, we're continuing our strong track record of driving efficiencies across our business so we can reinvest in growth. Our industry-leading Holistic Margin Management program remains on track to deliver 5% savings in cost of goods sold in fiscal 2026, driven by our digital advancements, particularly in logistics and manufacturing, with more opportunities ahead in sourcing. And we continue to expand the impact of our global transformation initiative, embracing new ways of working that match today's evolving business environment.\nWith strong execution in the first half of the fiscal year and plans to deliver further improvements in the year ahead, we remain on track to deliver our fiscal 2026 guidance. Now let me turn it over to Kofi to go into more detail on our second quarter results and key assumptions for the remainder of the year.\n\nKofi Bruce\n\nCFO, General Mills\n\nThanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Our second quarter financial results are summarized on slide 19. As a reminder, these results included our price and other remarkability investments, the impact of our North American yogurt divestitures, and unfavorable trade expense timing, which, as we expected, were significant sales and profit headwinds in Q2. Reported net sales of $4.9 billion were down 7%, including a six-point headwind from the net impact of divestitures and acquisitions. Organic net sales were down 1%. On the bottom line, adjusted operating profit of $848 million was down 20% in constant currency, driven by lower volume and higher input costs, partially offset by the favorable impact of price mix on margins, including the product mix benefit from the North American yogurt divestitures. As Jeff mentioned, this profit result finished ahead of our expectations.\nThis was driven by timing benefits in our supply chain, stronger-than-expected sales growth in International, and a modest amount of shipment timing benefit in North America Retail. We expect these items will unwind in the third quarter. Q2 adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.10 and were down 21% in constant currency, driven primarily by lower adjusted operating profit and a higher adjusted effective tax rate, partially offset by lower net shares outstanding. Moving to the components of total company net sales growth in the quarter, organic net sales declined 1% in the quarter, driven by unfavorable price mix. Organic pound volume was flat in the quarter, which represented sequential improvement from Q1. In terms of inorganic items, foreign exchange was immaterial to net sales, and the net impact of divestitures and acquisitions was a six-point headwind to net sales in Q2.\nShifting to segment results, second quarter organic net sales for North America Retail were down 3%, driven by unfavorable price mix, partially offset by growth in organic volume. Organic volume growth modestly outpaced Nielsen measured retail volume growth in the quarter, driven largely by shipment timing differences. As Jeff noted, we strengthened our retail sales performance in NAR in the second quarter, with eight of our top 10 US categories holding or growing pound share. In addition, Nielsen measured pound and dollar trends both improved by a full point from Q1 to Q2. On the bottom line, constant currency segment operating profit was down 21% in the quarter, driven primarily by lower volume, including the impact of the North American yogurt divestitures.\nSecond quarter net sales for our North America Pet segment were up 11%, including the impact of Whitebridge acquisition, with double-digit growth in cat feeding, pet treating, and a low single-digit decline in dog feeding. Organic net sales were up 1%, driven by favorable price mix, partially offset by lower volume. We estimate that all-channel retail sales were up 1% in Q2, which translated into the segment holding dollar share in the quarter. On the bottom line, second quarter North America Pet segment operating profit was down 12% in constant currency, driven by higher input costs and higher SG&A expenses, including investments supporting the launch of Love Made Fresh, partially offset by favorable price mix and higher volume.\nNorth America Foodservice organic net sales were flat in the quarter, with growth in frozen baked goods, cereal, and frozen meals, offset by a decline in bakery flour, including a three-point headwind from index pricing. We continue to drive improved competitiveness in NAP in Q2, with nearly 90% of our priority businesses holding or growing dollar share in the quarter, led by strong performance in healthcare, colleges and universities, and lodging channels. On the bottom line, North America Foodservice segment operating profit was down 12% in Q2, reflecting the headwind from our North American yogurt divestitures, partially offset by growth on the remaining business. Moving to our international segment, second quarter organic net sales were up 4%, driven by growth in Brazil, China, India, and North Asia. Our focus on remarkability is driving positive share performance for our global platforms and local gem brands in international markets.\nWe held or grew dollar share in 54% of our priority businesses in Q2, led by Häagen-Dazs ice cream and Nature Valley snack bars. Second quarter international segment operating profit was up 30% in constant currency, driven by favorable price mix and higher volume, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. Slide 25 summarizes our joint venture results. In Q2, Cereal Partners Worldwide net sales were down 1% in constant currency, driven by a decline in Latin America, partially offset by growth in Asia. Constant currency net sales for Häagen-Dazs Japan essentially matched year-ago levels. Second quarter combined results from joint ventures totaled an after-tax loss of $60 million, compared to after-tax earnings of $30 million in the same period a year ago, driven by our $85 million pre-tax share of a non-cash goodwill impairment charge at Cereal Partners Worldwide.\nTurning to margin results, our Q2 adjusted gross margin of 34.8% of net sales was down 150 basis points versus last year, driven primarily by higher input costs, partially offset by the favorable mix impact from the North American yogurt divestitures. Our adjusted operating profit margin was down 290 basis points to 17.4% in Q2, driven by lower adjusted gross margin and higher SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales. The higher rate of SG&A expenses was due to a double-digit increase in media investment in the quarter. Moving to other noteworthy Q2 income statement items, adjusted unallocated corporate expenses increased $11 million in the quarter, driven primarily by a normalization of corporate incentive compensation after last year's below-average payout. Second quarter net interest expense was up $1 million.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate was 23.3% compared to 20.1% a year ago due to unfavorable earnings mix by jurisdiction in fiscal 2026 and certain non-recurring discrete tax benefits in fiscal 2025. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were down 4% to 537 million, reflecting our continued net share repurchase activity. Our first half financial results are summarized on slide 28. Reported net sales of $9.4 billion were down 2% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating profit of $1.6 billion was down 19% in constant currency, while adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.96 and were down 21% on a constant currency basis.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow, H1 operating cash flow decreased year-over-year to $1.2 billion, driven primarily by lower net earnings excluding the pre-tax gain on divestitures, partially offset by the change in after-tax joint venture earnings and the change in restructuring, transformation, impairment, and other exit costs. Capital investments in H1 totaled $253 million, and we paid $659 million in dividends and returned $500 million in cash to shareholders through net share repurchases in H1 2026. Before I close, let me share some of our key assumptions on the remainder of fiscal 2026 that underpin our guidance. We continue to expect to deliver improved organic net sales in H2, driven by the expanded impact of our remarkability investments and amplified by the trade timing benefits in Q4.\nOn the bottom line, we expect Q3 operating profit to be down more than we previously anticipated, driven by the unwind of Q2 outperformance drivers, as well as the higher cost of volume that Jeff mentioned earlier. As we move to Q4, we expect to drive strong profit growth thanks to favorable trade timing comparisons, the benefits of the 53rd week, and the continued improvement in organic sales trends. I'll wrap up my comments by summarizing our reaffirmed fiscal 2026 outlook that is outlined on slide 30. Organic net sales are expected to range between down 1% and up 1%. Adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be down 10% to 15% on a constant currency basis, and we expect free cash flow conversion to be at least 95% of adjusted after-tax earnings.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Jeff for some closing remarks.\n\nJeff Harmening\n\nChairman and CEO, General Mills\n\nThanks, Kofi. Let me wrap up with a few closing thoughts. I'm proud of our execution and encouraged by the improved top-line performance we delivered in Q2, driven by our continued focus on remarkability. I'm confident in the strength of our plans to further improve our momentum in the second half. I want to thank the entire General Mills team, who continues to deliver exceptionally well amid a volatile external environment. With remarkable brands and remarkable people, General Mills is well-positioned to deliver on our goals and drive strong returns for our shareholders."

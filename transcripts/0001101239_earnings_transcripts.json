With us today are Adaire Fox-Martin, CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will be taking questions from sell-side analysts.\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to Adaire.\n\nAdaire Rita Fox-Martin\n\nPresident of Global Customer Operations & Member of Executive Board, SAP SE\n\nThank you, Phillip. Hello, everyone, and a very warm welcome to our Q3 2025 earnings call. Equinix delivered a very strong third quarter. Our performance that continues to demonstrate our ability to rapidly invest in significant expansion whilst growing our top line and improving profitability. This performance was underpinned by 3 highlights. First, top line growth. We are seeing continued revenue acceleration, delivering MRR growth of 8% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Further, we also achieved record annualized gross bookings of $394 million, a meaningful 25% increase year-over-year and up 14% over Q2.\nImportantly, this accelerated growth comes from a highly diversified set of customers across geographies, industries and segments. Second, profitability. We again delivered strong adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter, and AFFO was up 12% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. This was better than expected and reflects strong flow-through of our operating results, favorable net interest expense and timing of recurring CapEx spend.\nAs a result, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share guidance for the full year. Third, expansion. Given the strong demand backdrop, we are advancing our build bolder strategic move where our intent is to double capacity by 2029. We have recently closed on substantial land acquisitions in our greater Amsterdam, Chicago, Johannesburg, London and Toronto metros. Which will support over 900 megawatts of retail and xScale capacity. These results indicate that our strategy is gaining even more traction and resonating with our customers. as we continue to deliver differentiated infrastructure, products and levels of service. On the topic of customer resonance, we achieved significant momentum in Q3. Closing over 4,400 deals with more than 3,400 customers. This volume reflects continued demand for a wide variety of latency-sensitive AI and non-AI workloads, supporting significantly increased data residency and sovereignty requirements and delivering seamless connectivity to distributed data sources. Our rich ecosystems continue to proliferate across a variety of sectors. Including key verticals such as automotive, financial services, networks as well as cloud and AI service providers. Hyundai Motor Group, for example, runs its proprietary [indiscernible] cloud platform at Equinix. Using Equinix Fabric, Hyundai connects to multiple cloud providers in Asia Pacific, the U.S. and EMEA. This enhances customer experience and improved service quality for over 10 million Hyundai connected car subscribers worldwide. Zetaris, an AI data lake house platform provider relocated its AI workloads to Equinix. Using Equinix's distributed AI infrastructure, Zetaris is helping its customers develop agentic AI and other AI applications 6x faster and at 1/3 of the cost. ING is making a strategic shift by migrating its core banking infrastructure in Germany to Equinix, showcasing our ability to help customers meet strict regulatory standards and requirements. Nitori, the largest furniture and home furnishing chain in Japan with over 1,000 stores across Asia and the U.S. partners with Equinix to connect its Osaka and Tokyo operations with low latency to Oracle Cloud.\nThis helps them simplify their network for future expansion. And supports Nitori's growth objectives of tripling their branches worldwide. In addition, we saw continued momentum with key AI-related magnets and enterprises, including Ally Bank, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Nebius and Groq, amongst others. As I've shared in previous earnings calls, our strategy comprises 3 strategic moves orchestrated across the business, to accelerate our expansion, innovation and profitable top line growth. We continue to deliver strong results and see accelerating momentum against each.\nThe first strategic move is SAR better. As evidenced by our recent customer wins, SAR Better is rooted in delivering value to customers at every stage of their engagement with us. Customers are increasingly looking to secure both their immediate and their long-term infrastructure requirements. This robust demand profile resulted in a record $394 million of annualized gross bookings in Q3. For clarity, this annualized gross bookings number represents the bookings we expect to start generating revenue within the next 90 days.\nAdditionally, we have a presold balance totaling $185 million of annualized gross bookings. This presell cumulative balance will start generating revenue beyond 90 days. As of yesterday, we have closed more than 40% of our Q4 bookings plan. We have ample pipeline to achieve our Q4 bookings targets and to build momentum heading into 2026. Our second strategic move, Solve Smarter, is focused on simplifying the consumption of our solutions and extending the value of our leading interconnection capabilities. Our interconnection products had an exceptional quarter. We added 7,100 net physical and virtual connections in Q3. We bringing our total to more than [ $499,000 ]. Interconnection revenue grew 8% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. To $422 million, driven partially by a 57% year-over-year increase in our fabric bookings in Q3. We also added 2 new native cloud on-ramps in Barcelona and Dubai, adding to our market-leading share of native private cloud on ramps. These results highlight the critical importance of low latency and proximity to end users and our ability to deliver it as both enterprises and service providers manage their distributed architectures.\nIn September, we unveiled our distributed AI infrastructure solution. This includes a new AI-ready networking backbone and fabric intelligence software designed to support enterprise inferencing workloads. We showcased these capabilities at our first AI Summit, together with key partners and industry leaders. Including NVIDIA, Dow, Groq, HPE, Adobe, Zayo Zoom and WWT. Our customers and partners provided use cases to highlight how Equinix is uniquely positioned to comprehensively deliver on their demands and requirements at enterprise level. And finally, Build Boulder. Through Bill Boulder, we are both accelerating and innovating the delivery of capacity around the world and securing our future through strategic land acquisitions. As mentioned earlier, we are excited to announce that we have recently closed on land acquisitions in several high demand markets to serve customer demand across both our retail and xScale businesses.\nThis brings our total developable vocasity to approximately 3 gigawatts and nearly 50% increase from last quarter. These are the latest steps towards doubling our available capacity in the next 5 years. Since our last earnings call, we added 7 new projects, including our Dallas 12 development. which is expected to deliver roughly 3,700 cabinets or approximately 67 megawatts of capacity to this key metro. We now have 58 major projects underway globally including 12 xScale projects. 20% of our retail capacity has been considerably accelerated from the initial delivery date. We also opened our 77 market in Chennai, India as we continue to invest in this fast-growing region.\nMore than 75% of our retail expansion is in major metros, and more than 90% of our expansion CapEx is on owned land or where we have long-term ground leases. Our stabilized cash-on-cash return expectations for these retail expansions are approximately 25%, which is consistent with our existing portfolio. Our North American JV continues to show exciting progress with the closing of our Chicago land acquisition, which we anticipate will be contributed in large part to our xScale business in 2026. In addition, we are in late-stage negotiations for the lease of the entire capacity at our Hampton campus with potential xScale customers. The overall demand picture for our xScale business remains robust. As key players continue to seek capacity in major metros aligning with our xScale strategy.\nAs our results show, we are consistently delivering on the immediate needs of our customers and the expectations of the market, whilst expanding our salable capacity in anticipation of even greater sustained long-term demand. And we are doing this very profitably. We have been built for this opportunity, and we will continue to build for it.\nLet me now turn it over to Keith to share more on the quarter and our Q4 outlook.\n\nKeith D. Taylor\n\nChief Financial Officer, Equinix, Inc.\n\nThanks, Adaire, and good afternoon to everyone. Further to Adaire's remarks, the business delivered a very strong third quarter, which immediately translated into solid financial and nonfinancial results. Nearly every key metric was at or better than expected. Our sales team has delivered a record annualized gross bookings across our diversified customer base, resulting in very healthy net bookings in Q3. To further demonstrate the strong momentum in the business, Adaire highlight that we now have $185 million of annualized presales, which will be recorded as bookings in future quarters. Over 40% of the current presales balance was signed in Q3. As customers increasingly look to secure their future growth within our ecosystems. And we continue to deliver accretive value to the bottom line with AFFO well ahead of our expectations for the quarter.\nSo our strong performance in Q3, coupled with our strategic efforts to continue to secure land for future growth in our major metros is setting the stage for 2026 and beyond. And given our balance sheet is a strategic differentiator, it provides us with the flexibility to invest into a robust demand backdrop and the financial capacity to secure our future energy needs. Finally, our relentless focus on best-in-class capital allocation for our investors while delivering durable long-term value remains a key priority for us as we execute against our Build Bolder initiatives. As it relates to our nonfinancial metrics, they continue to demonstrate positive momentum across nearly all dimensions, including net interconnection additions, provision BC capacity, pricing, volume of transactions and cabinets billing. We added a healthy 7,100 net interconnection ads in the quarter supported by cloud and enterprise connectivity. Cabinets billing stepped up 2,500 cabinets led by strength in the Americas region. With our record Q3 gross bookings performance, we expect our Cabinets billing metric to continue to be strong in Q4.\nOur global MR per cabinet yield stepped up $41 quarter-over-quarter on a normalized and constant currency basis, primarily due to increasing densities strong interconnection and firm pricing across each of our regions, consistent with the broader supply-demand dynamics in the marketplace. As Adaire highlighted, we continue to make great progress with our Build Bolder strategy. Our recent land purchases will support more than 900 megawatts of incremental capacity across our full product continuum once built out, meaningfully increasing the capacity to be developed across our portfolio.\nThe capacity to be developed now stands at 3 gigawatts positioning the Equinix to serve the expanding market opportunity across hybrid and multi-cloud and AI. Our investments remain focused on either enhancing our strong existing ecosystems or laying the foundation for both current and future AI inferencing solutions, which will be built on top of our highly differentiated platform.\nNow let me cover the highlights for the quarter as depicted on Slide 7. Do note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. Global Q3 revenues were approximately $2.32 billion, up 5% over the same quarter last year. Our recurring revenue growth stepped up 8% and which is underpinned by the continued bookings momentum of the business. As expected, our nonrecurring revenues moderated sequentially, largely due to lower xScale fees. Q3 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $9 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $1.15 billion or approximately 50% of revenues, up 8% over the same quarter last year. Q3 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included a $4 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 AFFO was $965 million, up 12% over the same quarter last year and meaningfully above our expectations due to strong operating performance, disciplined balance sheet management and timing of recurring CapEx spend.\nQ3 AFFO included $2 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. As expected, global MRR churn in Q3 stepped down to 2.3%, and we expect Q4 MR churn to be within our 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range. And now looking at our capital structure. Please refer to Slide 10. Our balance sheet was approximately $38 billion, which included cash and short-term investments totaling $2.9 billion. Our cash and short-term investments stepped down from elevated levels in Q2 as our capital and real estate investments stepped up, and we repaid $1.2 billion of senior notes. Our net leverage was 3.6x our annualized adjusted EBITDA. During the quarter, we issued U.S. dollar equivalent $500 million in Singapore denominated green notes at a rate of 2.9%. We also published our green bond allocation and impact report in September. Equinix has now issued approximately $9.5 billion in green bonds with $7 billion in net proceeds allocated to eligible green projects.\nTurning to Slide 11 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $1.14 billion, including a recurring CapEx of $64 million. We opened 8 major projects across 7 markets since our last earnings call adding retail capacity in key metros, including in London, Miami, Montreal and Washington, D.C. We opened 2 new data centers, one in Chennai, India, the other in Monterrey, Mexico. Revenues from owned assets are 69% of our recurring revenues. Now moving to Slide 12. Our capital investments continue to generate strong returns. Our now 180 stabilized assets increased revenues by 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and are collectively 82% utilized and generate a 26% cash-on-cash return on the gross PPE invested.\nAnd finally, please refer to Slides 13 through 17 for an updated summary of 2025 guidance and bridges. Do note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year, we're maintaining our underlying revenue outlook with a 7% to 8% normalized and constant currency growth rate. Our expected quarter-over-quarter MRR step-up is greater than $60 million. A significant year-over-year increase, highlighting the underlying momentum in the business and gives us the confidence as we look into 2026. And as we previewed in July, our Q4 revenue guidance also includes a meaningful step-up in nonrecurring fees attributable to the xScale business. As Adaire mentioned, our discussions with potential xScale customers are in their advanced stages. But as with transactions of this size and complexity, the timing of contracting can be fluid. Hence, the expanded revenue guidance range.\nGiven our strong profitability in Q3, we're raising our underlying 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance by another $21 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to range between 49% and 50% for the full year. We're also raising our underlying 2025 AFFO guidance by another $31 million. AFFO is expected to grow between 11% and 13%, while AFFO per share growth is expected to range between 8% and 10% compared to the previous year.\nAnd finally, 2025 CapEx is now expected to range between $3.8 billion and $4.3 billion including approximately $290 million of recurring CapEx spend.\nSo I'm going to stop here. I will turn the call back to Adaire.\n\nAdaire Rita Fox-Martin\n\nPresident of Global Customer Operations & Member of Executive Board, SAP SE\n\nThanks very much, Keith. So in closing, we remain excited and optimistic about the future and our differentiated and durable market position. We are focused on executing against our Q4 expectations. And building our momentum for 2026, and we are very much on track on both accounts. Our intent is to continue to build on the outcomes that defined this quarter. Greater capacity, increased revenue and improved profitability and accelerate them as our strategy achieves even greater traction. We were built for this moment. And I am confident we will continue to make the very most of this opportunity in regards to both the long-term growth and long-term value creation for our shareholders.\nSo I'll stop here and open it up to questions."

Following our prepared remarks, we will be taking questions from sell-side analysts.\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to Adaire.\n\nAdaire Rita Fox-Martin\n\nPresident of Global Customer Operations & Member of Executive Board, SAP SE\n\nThank you, Chip. Hello, everyone. Good afternoon and a warm welcome to our earnings call for the second quarter 2025. Our Q2 results demonstrate that our strategy is meeting the opportunity. This is evidenced not only by strong financial metrics, but also by our continued customer momentum and strong delivery in key areas of our business.\nBy way of highlights. First, from a financial perspective, the Equinix team delivered. In Q2, our revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO were all in line with or better than expectations. This performance was underpinned by strong recurring revenue growth and solid operating flow-through, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins hitting 50%. Second, our relevance to existing and new customers continues to deepen. In Q2, we closed 4,100 deals across more than 3,300 customers, resulting in $345 million of annualized gross bookings for the quarter, a new metric that we disclosed at Analyst Day. Our teams delivered this performance through strong small- and medium-sized deal activity with a notable uptick in inter and intra region sales, all whilst maintaining favorable pricing across deal sizes.\nThird, our performance translated into solid nonfinancial results with substantial net interconnection additions, solid cabinets billing led by the Americas and strong MRR per cabinet yields. Our diverse interconnected ecosystems continue to drive industry-leading returns as seen in the performance of our stabilized asset portfolio.\nNow before we take a closer look at Q2, I want to focus for a moment on our long-term vision. It was a pleasure to connect with many of you at our Analyst Day last month. At that time, we outlined the opportunities we see in the market across AI, hybrid and multi-cloud and networking. We presented this strategy we have defined to unlock these opportunities and against which we are already rapidly executing. And we shared important financial guidance for the next 5 years.\nSince Analyst Day, we have had a fruital dialogue with many of our shareholders and analysts to listen to your feedback and to answer your questions. With those conversations in mind, I would like to offer some key points of clarity on the build bolder component of our strategy, whilst Keith will provide additional commentary on the long-term financial outlook in his remarks.\nFirst, as outlined on Slide 6, our capital expenditure is about capacity expansion with the aim of accelerating revenue. The vast majority of our investments over the next 5 years are expected to be allocated to our future growth. This includes the purchase of land, the construction of new IBX data centers, investment in our xScale joint ventures and developing digital product offerings. As I outlined in my presentation at Analyst Day, we see a significant addressable market opportunity in front of Equinix. And this opportunity is affirmed by the demand signals from our customers. Our customers rely on Equinix for the digital infrastructure necessary to support and scale their AI models. They look to us as they embrace hybrid and multi-cloud strategies for their application architecture.\nOur customers are the motivation for the expansion and scale of our capital investments. Second, only about 1% of our nonrecurring capital expenditures will be allocated to the redevelopment of select high-value IBX assets. The redevelopment of key ecosystem facilities like Washington, D.C. and Miami One will not only extend the economic lives of these assets. But at the conclusion of these projects, we believe we will be able to yield meaningful additional space and power capacity at attractive returns.\nThird, with regard to returns, we expect to underwrite our investments in assets that will yield approximately 25% at stabilization, in line with our current stabilized portfolio. Our growth investments are intended to skew towards our major markets, where we generate over $100 million in annual revenue. By prioritizing our large markets, we can leverage our diverse and deep customer relationships and our in-place operating capabilities to derisk our investment plans and drive efficiencies at scale.\nFinally, with regards to timing of revenue, whilst it takes approximately 18 to 24 months to build a core shell and first phase of an IBX asset, we are anticipating an accelerated path to stabilization relative to historical trends. Hence, whilst we guided through 2029, our near- to medium-term investments will support our durable growth beyond 2029. We see a path to drive the business to double-digit revenue growth as our Build Bolder strategy becomes fully operational. Our capital expenditures and data center expansion are grounded in the demand signals we see from our customer base. Organizations are moving beyond the experimentation and pilot phase of AI adoption into the phase of a genic integration and automation.\nMany of our customers have deployed AI centers of excellence. These teams are working to establish standardized governance policies and TCO-based management of enterprise AI road maps. These are the necessary prerequisites to enable the scaling of agentic use cases and their integration into core systems, resulting in always-on AI that is compliant to policy. The use cases that we see are far ranging from those that are grounded in privacy and sovereignty requirements to use cases requiring distributed delivery and secure interconnection to those that have at their core predictable performance, coupled with neutrality and control.\nCustomers' priorities are unique but Equinix is uniquely positioned to address these priorities. Alembic, Block, Bristol Myers Squibb, Continental, Harrison AI and ServiceNow, amongst many others, are working with us to support their AI ambitions and their growth objectives. As I noted at our Analyst Day, we firmly believe that Equinix has been built for this moment. We are investing in our future in service to our customers and in service to the opportunity ahead. Through these efforts, we believe we will continue to deliver attractive revenue growth, expanded margins and accretive value to our shareholders over the long term.\nNow I would like to take a closer look at our financial results for the quarter and our customer momentum. As a reminder, the growth rates shared are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. In Q2, we delivered revenues of $2.26 billion, up 5% year-over-year. This was driven by strong recurring revenue growth, up 7% year-over-year, the result of our continued strong bookings performance. As previously stated, our second half outlook implies underlying recurring revenue step-up, a reflection of our strong first half bookings and conversion of backlog. For nonrecurring revenues in Q2, we had lower ex-scale fees, which was as expected and planned for.\nBased on our current pipeline for xScale and consistent with our initial full year guidance, we are anticipating a meaningful step-up in NRR in the second half, more specifically in Q4. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased to 50% of revenues for the first time in our history. AFFO per share increased 8% year-over-year. In both instances, results were above our expectations due to strong operating performance and lower-than-expected SG&A expenses, in part due to the timing of spend. Keith will provide additional insight into these numbers shortly.\nTurning to our customer momentum. We continue to cultivate and win opportunities across our product set and in service to the enduring demand for AI, hybrid and multi-cloud deployments and networking requirements. Lyceum Technologies, a German GPU as a service provider recently added a liquid-cooled AI deployment in EMEA to bring automated cloud experiences to their customers. Schneider Electric chose Equinix to lower the overall carbon footprint of their digital infrastructure as they build out a multi-cloud solution leveraging fabric cloud router.\nWoolworths, the largest retailer of food and everyday essentials in Australia and New Zealand has developed a payments platform called WPay, utilizing HPE GreenLake and Equinix data centers. This end-to-end solution features a robust architecture that not only offers scalability but also enhances cost efficiency for both WPay and its merchant partners. eBay leverages Equinix to ensure low latency connectivity and high performance for its global marketplace with distributed network hubs. This infrastructure enables eBay to deliver a seamless user experience, reducing delays and optimizing interactions for buyers and sellers worldwide.\nAnd finally, EssilorLuxottica, a global leader in advanced Vision Care products, eyewear and medtech solutions chose Equinix to enhance operational efficiency and support seamless global expansion with high performance connectivity. This breadth of customer use cases across geography, segment, industry and product set underscores the distinct value of Equinix and the diversity of the opportunity ahead. We intend to build on this momentum through the remaining quarters of '25 and beyond.\nWe continue to execute against our 3 strategic moves in pursuit of our long-term accretive growth ambitions. Our Serve Better strategic move is focused on our customers who are at the heart of everything we do. The differentiating force behind serving better is our customer and revenue organization. I would like to take a moment to welcome Shane Paladin as our new Chief Customer and Revenue Officer and a member of our executive team. Shane brings with him over 2 decades of global expertise in go-to-market strategies, close collaboration with product organizations and the delivery of transformative results.\nI'm also pleased to share that we are already off to a strong start in Q3. Through presales from prior quarters and continued momentum from our sales team, as of yesterday, we have closed more than 40% of our bookings planned for Q3. We have a strong pipeline to support our remaining bookings ambitions for the quarter. Looking forward to Q4, our pipeline is the most robust we have seen and speaks to the demand in the market for the products and services offered by Equinix. As we work to solve smarter, we are focused on simplifying the consumption of our digital infrastructure and interconnection solutions for our customers. Our industry-leading interconnection franchise continues to perform well. Interconnection revenues grew a healthy 8% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, crossing $400 million of quarterly revenues for the first time.\nWe added a net 6,200 total interconnections in the quarter, driven by cloud and AI expansion activities. We now have more than 492,000 total interconnections deployed. Our ability to connect businesses with one another and across their value chain, including through our market-leading share of native cloud on-ramps continues to be an attractive differentiator for our customers. This is why Equinix has become the home to ecosystems across network, cloud, financial services and content and digital media providers. Equinix Fabric continues to over-index with provision capacity now over 100 terabits. In the quarter, we surpassed 4,000 customers using Equinix Fabric, and we saw a continued diversification of use cases with solid pull-through from our fabric cloud router and network edge products.\nAs I said before, AI inference use cases are growing. We believe our leading market share of cloud on ramps, when combined with fabric will be vital to address the increased bandwidth and multi-cloud connectivity these workloads will require. As we build bolder to meet growing demand from our customers, we now have 59 major projects underway globally, including 12 ex-scale projects. Since our last earnings call, we added 9 new retail projects in key markets such as Chicago, Dallas, London and Silicon Valley and have commenced our first build in Bangkok, Thailand. In early June, we finalized our acquisition of 3 data centers in the Philippines to enter the Manila Metro as we broaden our footprint in Southeast Asia.\nOur xScale focus continues to expand. Our pipeline of potential North American campuses is growing, and we are in late-stage negotiations for additional locations, which we look forward to disclosing in the near future. We are making excellent progress on our Atlanta campus as we prepare the land for the construction process. Across our open and announced projects, our ex-scale assets are more than 85% leased or preleased, and as noted earlier, we have a strong pipeline of opportunities primed for execution in the second half of the year. Serve Better, Solve Smarter and Build Bolder are the right strategic moves for our customers and for our business, and our continued execution gains them is paying off.\nNow I'm going to turn it over to Keith to share more on the quarter's financials and our outlook for the balance of the year.\n\nKeith D. Taylor\n\nChief Financial Officer, Equinix, Inc.\n\nThanks, Adaire, and good afternoon to everyone. Well, we had another great quarter, and we're very excited about what the future holds for Equinix. We had strong and diversified annualized gross bookings, our new metric of $345 million in the second quarter. These bookings are foundational to the expected quarter-on-quarter recurring revenue growth in the next 2 quarters and as we set the stage for 2026. Also, we delivered healthy operating leverage to the business, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins hitting 50% for the quarter, the first time in our history. And our nonfinancial metrics continue to trend favorably. All of this, alongside stronger non-U.S. dollar operating currencies allowed us to raise our guidance across all of our key operating metrics, while maintaining flexibility to invest in the second half of the year in support of our strategic moves.\nNow before I get into details for the quarter, I wanted to provide some clarifying thoughts related to the long-term financial outlook, which we shared with you at the June Analyst Day. First and most importantly, our Build Bolder investment strategy is about pressing our advantage by investing in future growth through the development of new data centers, as highlighted by Adaire. This build strategy is in support of our selling strategy to put the right customer with the right application into the right asset. Simply Build Bolder is about creating new capacity to meet the future demands for digital infrastructure.\nSecond, the Analyst Day 5-year plan made a number of assumptions about the funding of our growth. As you've seen over the past couple of years, we've benefited by accessing many foreign debt capital markets, where interest rates are not only lower but where we can also mitigate potential FX exposure while also being tax efficient. It is our intention to continue to access these 4 markets to our fullest ability while not exposing our balance sheet to undo FX risk. Over the short term, you should expect us to continue to access lower capital cost markets in Canada and for -- while raising more debt capital in Europe in 2026.\nAnd finally, when rates and spreads move in the right direction in the United States, you should expect us to appropriately move to access this market while looking at the appropriate tenor for these capital raises. As it relates to our forecasted interest expense, we fully expect to capitalize a portion of our interest expense, which will be determined by the cost of that raised, the amount of assets under development, including land and the time line to operationalize these assets. Later this year, as we work through the annual planning cycle for next year, we plan to refine our estimate of net interest expense after interest capitalization, and we'll share these details with you in early 2026.\nAnd finally, as a reminder, our long-term goal is to deliver $50 or greater of AFFO per share in 2029. This AFFO per share target implies a 7% CAGR growth rate from 2025 through 2029. Given we expect 2026 will be at the lower end of our guided range, this outlook, therefore, implies an AFFO per share growth rate towards the top half of the range each year thereafter with 2029 being at the top end of the range. Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter as depicted on Slide 7. We do know that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. Global Q2 revenues were approximately $2.26 billion, up 5% over the same quarter last year and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range.\nOur continued bookings momentum resulted in another quarter of strong recurring revenue growth at 7%, offset by a decrease in nonrecurring revenues, largely due to lower scale fit out revenues and fees as expected. Net of our FX hedges, there was minimal FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1.13 billion or 50% of revenues above the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance, including solid gross profit and lower-than-expected SG&A expenses in part due to timing of spend. Q2 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included a $2 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q2 AFFO was $972 million up 11% over the same quarter last year and well above our expectations for the quarter due to strong operating performance and lower income tax expenses.\nQ2 AFFO included a $3 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q2 MRR churn was 2.6%, slightly above the high end of our range primarily due to the GEO bankruptcy. Absent the specific MRR churn, our metric would have been 2.4%. For the full year, we continue to expect MRR churn to be comfortably in our 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range. With respect to our nonfinancial metrics, they continue to trend favorably with global MR for cabinet yields stepping up $33 quarter-over-quarter on a constant currency basis, largely the result of favorable pricing and increasing power densities from the base.\n[ CabE's ] billing also saw a solid step-up in the quarter led by the Americas region, and we added 6,200 total net interconnections for the quarter. Now looking at our capital structure. Please refer to Slide 10. Our balance sheet increased to approximately $39 billion, including elevated cash and short-term investments totaling approximately $4.5 billion. Higher than typical, given the $1.2 billion of Q3 senior note repayments, one which has already been settled in July and the other expected to be settled in September. In the quarter, we issued $1.7 billion of euro-denominated senior green notes at a weighted average rate of 3.625%.\nCumulatively, Equinix has issued $9 billion of green bonds making Equinix a top 5 U.S. issuer in the investment-grade green bond market. Our net leverage was 3.5x our annualized adjusted EBITDA. As noted during our Analyst Day, we fully expect our net leverage to increase over the next several years as we fund our growth both from the cash generated in business and with the incremental debt we plan to raise. Through 2029, we continue to remain comfortable raising our debt levels up to 4.5x in support of this growth and to fund our other strategic initiatives while maintaining our investment-grade rating.\nTurning to Slide 11. For the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $990 million, including recurring CapEx of $55 million. We opened 5 major projects since our last earnings call. adding retail capacity in Chicago, Dallas, Toronto, Washington, D.C. and Salalah, Oman. Over 70% of our announced retail expansion project spans is allocated to our largest metros where we have strong established ecosystem and can benefit from our economy of scale.\nNow moving to Slide 12. Our capital investments have continued to deliver strong returns. Our now 189 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and are collectively 82% utilized and generated a 26% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested on a constant currency basis. And finally, please refer to Slides 13 through 17 for an updated summary of 2025 guidance and bridges. Do note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year, we're raising our 2025 revenues guidance by $58 million. This maintains a 7% to 8% normalized and constant currency growth rate.\nImportantly, our outlook continues to imply a robust quarter-over-quarter step-up of our underlying recurring revenues in Q3 and Q4 and strong NRR activity in the fourth quarter driven by our pipeline of scale opportunities. We're also raising our 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $46 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be approximately 49% with strong second half adjusted EBITDA margins at or near 50%. We're raising our 2025 AFFO guidance by $28 million. AFFO is expected to grow between 10% and 12%, and AFFO per share growth is expected to range between 7% and 10% compared to the previous year.\nAnd finally, 2025 CapEx is now expected to range between $3.8 billion and $4.3 billion, including approximately $450 million of on-balance sheet ex-scale spend, funds we expect to be reimbursed later this year as we transfer these assets into our U.S. joint venture. The increase in nonrecurring CapEx spend is largely due to a meaningful investment in prepurchase of long-lead equipment, the timing of contributing our scale investments to the new xScale joint venture and our newly approved projects. Recurring CapEx spend is expected to be about $280 million.\nSo I'm going to stop here and turn the call back to Adaire.\n\nAdaire Rita Fox-Martin\n\nPresident of Global Customer Operations & Member of Executive Board, SAP SE\n\nThanks very much, Keith. In closing, we delivered a strong first half of 2025, achieving robust bookings and financial outcomes. We remain excited and optimistic about the future of Equinix and our differentiated and durable market position. We were built for this moment. No other player in the digital infrastructure landscape possesses the unique combination of strengths that are an inherent part of Equinix. Our diverse and neutral interconnected ecosystems our extensive global footprint across key metros, our more than 10,000 enterprise customers across geographies, industries and segments, our track record of reliability and service excellence.\nAs the world's digital infrastructure company, we are shortening the path to bandwidth connectivity to enable the innovations that enrich our work, life and planet. I'll stop here and open it up to questions."

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Chip Newcom, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nChip Newcom\n\nDirector, Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind everyone that some of the statements that we will be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we've identified in today's press release as well as those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed February 12, 2025. Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update on or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call.\nIn addition, in light of regulation fair disclosure, it is Equinix's policy not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure.\nOn today's conference call, we will provide non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a list of the reasons why the company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix Investor Relations page at www.equinix.com.\nWe've made available on the IR page of our website a presentation designed to accompany this discussion, along with certain supplemental financial information and other data. We would also like to remind you that we post important information about Equinix on the IR page from time to time, and encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current available information.\nWith us today are Adaire Fox-Martin, Equinix's CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in 1 hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to 1.\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to Adaire.\n\nAdaire Rita Fox-Martin\n\nPresident of Global Customer Operations & Member of Executive Board, SAP SE\n\nThank you, Chip. Good afternoon, and a warm welcome to our earnings call for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Before we dive into the key figures, I wanted to take a moment to underscore that 2024 was a year in which we proved our ability to adapt and to deliver in equally successful measure. Our performance not only demonstrates the strength, resilience and consistency of our business, but also, and increasingly importantly our, ability to meet the future moments in the market.\nOur unique business model enables us to serve the full spectrum of our customers' connectivity and digital infrastructure requirements. This gives me great confidence as we continue to shape our organization to make the very most of the opportunity ahead.\nNow turning to our results. We had an outstanding close to 2024. Revenues for the full year were $8.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year, an amazing 22 years of consecutive quarterly revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.1 billion, a 160 basis point improvement in our margins year-over-year. AFFO per share, our lighthouse metric, grew 10% year-over-year. This performance is at the top end of our long-term expectations as we continue to compound value for our shareholders. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis, excluding lower power costs passed through to our customers.\nOur as-reported numbers and outlook have been tempered by a significantly stronger U.S. dollar during Q4. Our team has focused on executing against all the variables within their control to deliver an exceptional quarter and strong outlook, highlighting the underlying health of our business and the scale of our opportunity.\nTo give a sense of our accelerating pace of execution, in both Q4 and 2024, we delivered the best gross bookings performing in our 26-year history, with solid pricing dynamics and strong execution across all 3 regions. This translated to more than 16,200 deals across more than 6,000 customers in 2024.\nSupported by proactive demand shaping, putting in the right customer, with the right workload, in the right location, in 2024, we delivered record megawatts sold, including our best year ever for volumes sold in non-Tier 1 metros. Our channel program delivered nearly 30% of bookings and more than 50% of company new logos for the year, with wins across a wide range of industry segments and use cases.\nIn our xScale business, during 2024, we leased approximately 150 megawatts of capacity and nearly tripled the investment capital of the program. Our best-in-class operations team delivered greater than [ 5/9 ] of uptime for our customers. They also decreased our PUE by more than 6%, lowering operating costs by $18 million for 2024. This supports both our customers' efforts to green their digital infrastructure and enhances our operational efficiency.\nNow as we look to 2025, it is clear that the pace of technological change has never been faster. At the same time, I strongly believe that the market opportunity and Equinix's relevance to that opportunity has never been greater. We are fortunate to host a diverse range of customer workloads within our data centers as we support their broad digital infrastructure needs, from networking and peering to capital market value creation, to hybrid multi-cloud architectures, and through the workloads driving artificial intelligence use cases and training.\nWe remain confident that the continued democratization of and investment in AI represents a secular demand driver for our business. We continue to cultivate and win significant opportunities for both inferencing and training workloads as we cement Equinix as the place where private AI happens. In Q4, more than half of the volume of our top 25 deals was related to high-performance compute and AI workloads. Importantly, we are increasingly seeing a diversification of AI and machine learning use cases across healthcare, finance, transportation and gaming.\nRecent wins in customer production use cases include Outrider Technologies, the leader in autonomous yard operations, who are deployed at Equinix to support AI-based training and inference workloads that maximize freight throughput and enhanced safety in logistics yards.\nTo seize the market opportunity, we are on a journey to simplify the path for our customers to consume digital infrastructure. Our focus is on 3 strategic moves: how we can, one, serve better; two, solve smarter; and three, build bolder. These critical priorities are already bearing fruit, and we expect them to enable our accretive growth in 2025 and beyond.\nFirst, we are serving our customers better by enabling our customer-facing resources to execute with precision and velocity. We introduced automated quoting and capacity visualization tools, revised our compensation plans and rolled out a more sophisticated approach to segmentation. These changes are part of our journey to accelerate value creation for customers as we nurture our opportunities into bookings and from bookings to revenue faster. It also means that we continually refine our cost to serve whilst simultaneously improving the customer experience.\nSecond, we are solving smarter for our customers. We are simplifying our product portfolio and working to make Equinix the easy button that manages the inherent complexity of hybrid multi-cloud and AI environments. We are prioritizing products that will continue to differentiate and extend the value of Equinix, particularly around our enduring value proposition of connectivity. This focus also resulted in our decision to end-of-sale Equinix Metal, so we can concentrate our development efforts on solutions core to interconnection.\nFinally, we are building bolder. Based on the demand signals we are seeing in the marketplace, we plan to build bigger data centers in fewer, larger phases, allowing us to optimally accommodate the full product continuum on our campuses across traditional retail, larger footprint retail and xScale. This balanced approach should accelerate our delivery of salable capacity whilst allowing us to respond to our customers' needs as market dynamics, particularly those related to generative AI, continue to evolve at a rapid pace. No other provider in the market offers this unique combination of a data center product continuum with interconnection density at a global scale.\nWhilst we delivered record gross bookings in Q4, we could have delivered an even stronger bookings outcome if we had available capacity in our Tier 1 metros. By building bolder, our intent is to sprint towards this demand. More than 65% of our retail expansion is supporting capacity in major metros, and here, we have clear visibility into pipeline and fill rates.\nNow pivoting to the operational highlights for the quarter. Our customers value our premium service and our global footprint. With 2/3 of our recurring revenues now generated by customers deployed in more than 10 IBXs, we continue to invest to build our network of data centers across the globe. We now have 62 major projects underway in 36 metros across 25 countries, including 16 xScale projects. This represents approximately 34,000 cabinets of retail and 165 megawatts of xScale capacity, which will be delivered through to the end of 2026.\nIn November, we were pleased to announce our Singapore 6 build. This facility will provide 20 megawatts of capacity in one of APAC's fastest-growing digital economies. This month, we opened our first data center in Jakarta. This new Indonesian presence expands our reach to 74 metros across 35 countries.\nOur interconnected digital ecosystems continue to drive growth and customer value. We now have more than 482,000 total interconnections deployed on our industry-leading platform. We added an incremental 6,000 underlying interconnections in Q4. Interconnection revenue stepped up 9% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, now representing 19% of our recurring revenues.\nEquinix Fabric continues to over-index as customers increasingly adopt 25 and 50 gigabit per second circuits. Interconnection and ecosystem customer wins and use cases included payments processing company, WebPays, who is leveraging Fabric cloud router to connect to their key cloud partners and lower their networking costs. Zayo, the largest independent fiber provider in North America, is aggressively expanding its fiber infrastructure in key markets with Equinix, delivering unplanned high-capacity connectivity to meet the growing demands of enterprise and exponential bandwidth growth driven by AI.\nOur xScale portfolio continues to see strong overall demand as service providers expand to support their cloud and AI businesses. Since our last earnings call, we leased an incremental 31 megawatts across our Paris 12 and Paris 13 assets. Cumulative xScale leasing is now over 400 megawatts globally. Whilst our announced and completed projects are more than 85% leased and pre-leased, we have a strong funnel of additional xScale opportunities in 2025 as customers increasingly look to secure capacity for delivery dates in 2027 and beyond.\nWe secured 2 new native cloud on-ramps this quarter in New York and Mexico City. We host more than twice the metros with multiple native cloud on-ramps as our nearest competitor. Native access to the cloud enables improved management of security, cost, control and neutrality, especially for customers pursuing a hybrid and/or a multi-cloud strategy. Ease of connectivity and access to data stored in the cloud is a key requirement for inferencing use cases and training workloads.\nOur ability to deliver value for our customers and accretive growth for our shareholders in 2024 is a testament to the strength of our team and the quality of our differentiated business model. I'm proud of our performance and excited by the opportunity for our business in the year ahead.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Keith to cover the quarter's financials.\n\nKeith D. Taylor\n\nChief Financial Officer, Equinix, Inc.\n\nThanks, Adaire, and good afternoon to everyone. As already noted by Adaire, we had a great end to the year. The Equinix team continued to deliver across all levels of the organization.\nFor the full year, our record gross bookings and robust performance across each of our regions highlight the diversity and strength of our unrivaled go-to-market engine. We had solid net bookings and healthy net pricing actions while our pipeline conversion improved throughout the year.\nWe also celebrated our 10th year operating as a real estate investment trust, a meaningful milestone for the company. Over this 10-year period, our as-reported lighthouse metric AFFO per share has grown 10% on an annual compounded basis, while we also returned more than $9.3 billion of capital to our shareholders via our quarterly cash dividends.\nOur customer focus and differentiated business model and strong consistent execution has truly allowed us to create value over the past decade. And as highlighted by Adaire, we continue to see a very significant opportunity ahead and are positioning the business to drive accretive growth for the many years to come. Yes. This is in a very exciting time.\nAnd our nonfinancial metrics continue to trend favorably as we completed the year. Our net cabinets billing stepped up by 2,200 in the quarter, driven by continued strong booking activity. Our backlog of cabinets sold but not yet installed doubled over the last year, which, when combined with our 2025 operating plan goals, should drive continued performance of this core metric.\nNet underlying interconnection additions also showed a healthy step-up as the gross cross-connect activity was at its highest level in 3 years. Finally, our MRR per cabinet yield stepped up to $2,326 per cabinet driven by net positive pricing actions and increasing power densities.\nSo simply put, we continue to drive value on both the top line and at the per-share level, while delivering meaningful operating leverage across the business.\nOn the sustainability front, we're pleased to be recognized on CDP's prestigious Climate Change A List for the third consecutive year, while also rated AAA by MSCI for the first time. We consider our sustainability efforts to be a fundamental tenet of our business, which both supports the needs of our customers and drives operational efficiency, both very good for the business.\nAnd finally, as we look forward into 2021 and beyond, we plan to continue to adapt each of our organizations and our products and services to serve our customers better with greater efficiency. This includes the end-of-sale of our metal product offering, while realigning the organization to enable us to make investments in other key priority areas.\nGiven the metal decision, we booked a $160 million impairment charge on specific assets related to metal. Separately, we recorded a one-off and discrete charge for the impairment of our Hong Kong 4 asset totaling $73 million. We also recorded a $31 million restructuring charge, primarily related to the reduction in force in the quarter.\nThese decisions, although difficult at the time, are the right decisions for our business. They allow us to reprioritize where we invest while also reducing the net drag on the business and improving our return on invested capital.\nNow let me cover the highlights for the quarter as depicted on Slide 4. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis and exclude the impact of lower power cost passed through to our customers.\nGlobal Q4 revenues were $2.261 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year and at the midpoint of our guidance range, with both solid recurring and nonrecurring revenue growth across our regions, despite a portion of our xScale fees being deferred into Q1. Q4 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $22 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates given the meaningful strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter.\nGlobal Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $1.021 billion or approximately 45% of revenues, up 9% over the same quarter last year and at the midpoint of our guidance range, due to strong operating performance, though down sequentially due to planned timing of spend and xScale fee mix. Q4 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included a $9 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates.\nGlobal Q4 AFFO was $770 million, up 10% over the same quarter last year, due to strong operating performance offset by our seasonally higher recurring CapEx spend, as expected. Q4 AFFO included a $2 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates.\nGlobal Q4 MRR churn was 2.5%, as planned, due to the previously discussed deferral of MRR churn from late September into early October. Normalized for this timing, churn would have been 2.2%. For the full year, our average quarterly churn was 2.2%, well placed in the lower half of our 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range.\nTurning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized basis, excluding the impact of lower power costs passed through to our customers, APAC was our fastest-growing region at 13%, followed by the Americas region at 8%. Our EMEA region grew 2% year-over-year, dampened by the significant xScale leasing activity in Q4 of 2023. Again, as noted earlier, xScale fees are inherently lumpy and can impact the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth rates both at the consolidated and regional levels.\nThe Americas region had a strong quarter with solid gross bookings as revenues for the region reached the $1 billion quarterly revenue threshold for the very first time. Also, our Americas team had strong sales across our global assets, achieving its best export quarter in 2 years. We saw particular strength in our Denver, Montreal and Santiago markets, as well as continued momentum in our Tier 1 metros.\nOur EMEA business delivered record gross bookings and firm pricing, led by our flat metros with strong momentum also in Geneva, Istanbul and Milan. In the quarter, we signed our first power purchase agreement in Italy with Neoen to support 53 megawatts of new solar projects. This agreement brings Equinix's total global renewable energy capacity under long-term contracts to greater than 1.2 gigawatts across 10 countries.\nAnd finally, the Asia-Pacific region had a great quarter with record gross bookings. We saw particular strength in both our Osaka and Tokyo markets as we continue to capture significant AI deployments from both domestic and international customers. We also saw strength in our Mumbai, Singapore and Sydney markets.\nAnd now looking at the capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our 3.4x net leverage continues to remain low, both in absolute and relative terms to our peers. As of year-end, we had cash and short-term investments of $3.6 billion on our balance sheet, due to record customer collections and our financing activity, which puts us in a solid funding position to meet our 2025 capital needs and sets us up for 2026.\nIn the quarter, we issued EUR 1.15 billion in senior green notes at a weighted average rate of 3.4%. Additionally, we repaid $1 billion of senior notes in the quarter and raised approximately $700 million of equity through our ATM program. We plan to continue to take a balanced and opportunistic approach to accessing the capital markets as and when the market conditions are favorable, to fund our future growth.\nTurning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $1 billion, including seasonally higher recurring CapEx of $115 million, as planned. We opened 3 major projects since the last earnings call: Barcelona, Jakarta and Rio de Janeiro. We also purchased land for development in Lagos and Paris. More than 85% of our current retail expansion spend is on our own land, our own buildings, with long-term ground leases.\nOur capital investments delivered strong returns, as shown on Slide 10. Our now 177 stabilized assets increased revenues by 3% year-over-year on both an as-reported and constant currency basis. Stabilized assets were collectively 83% utilized and generated a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. As a reminder, unlike prior years, we plan to update our stabilized asset summary on the Q1 earnings call.\nAnd finally, please refer to slides 11 through 16 for our summary of 2025 guidance and bridges. Do note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis.\nStarting with revenues. For the full year 2025, we expect top line growth of 7% to 8%. As noted, this is on a normalized and constant currency basis, which adjusts for the significant net impact of FX, but also lower power cost passed through to our customers and the end of sale of our metal product offering.\nAnd given our bookings momentum and our largest backlog of 3 years and timing of capacity additions across our major metros, our Q1 guidance assumes a $28 million step-up in recurring revenues, but continued healthy step-ups in recurring revenues over the course of the year.\nMRR churn is expected to remain within our targeted quarterly range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter.\nWe expect 2025 adjusted EBITDA margins to be approximately 49%, a 190 basis point improvement over last year, due to strong operating leverage, targeted expense management efforts and anticipated lower power prices. And like our revenues, we expect quarterly margins to step up over the course of the year with a meaningful increase in Q2 margins over Q1, in part due to seasonality. And second half adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be at or near 50%.\n2025 AFFO is expected to grow between 9% and 12% compared to the previous year. And AFFO per share is expected to grow between 7% and 9%, despite the sizable investment in warehouse capital to support our future growth into '26, '27 and beyond, and also the refinancing of debt maturing in the year.\n2025 CapEx is expected to range between $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion, including approximately $200 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend, which we expect to be reimbursed as we transfer assets into our U.S. joint venture, and about $250 million of recurring CapEx spend.\nAnd finally, we're increasing our 2025 cash dividend on a per share basis by 10% due to strong operating performance, our tenth consecutive year of dividend per share growth since our REIT conversion. The cash dividend will be approximately $1.8 billion, a 13% year-over-year increase, 100% of which is expected to be derived from operating performance.\nSo I'm going to stop here and turn the call back to Adaire.\n\nAdaire Rita Fox-Martin\n\nPresident of Global Customer Operations & Member of Executive Board, SAP SE\n\nThank you, Keith. In closing, Q4 was a record quarter for Equinix in a year of record performance. 2024 demonstrated the enduring market demand for the services offered by Equinix, the execution excellence of our team in prosecuting that demand in service to our customers, and our continued drive to improve our profitability and our return to our shareholders.\nIn 2025, we will double down on these qualities and further prime ourselves for growth. We will focus on the elements of our business that define our relevance and our differentiation in a rapidly evolving world: our product continuum, our global reach, our interconnection density and our cloud connectivity.\nWe will embrace the relentless pursuit of efficiency and effectiveness in all that we do. We will work to make it easy at Equinix for our customers and our partners so that we can deliver the greatest value and capture as much of the opportunity as possible, driving attractive revenue growth, expanding margins and increasing profitability.\nWith that, I'll stop here and open it up to questions."

At this time, I'll turn it over to Adaire.\n\nAdaire Rita Fox-Martin\n\nPresident of Global Customer Operations & Member of Executive Board, SAP SE\n\nThank you, Chip. Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. I'm honored to be hosting my first earnings call today as CEO and President of Equinix. I'm immensely proud to lead our dedicated team of more than 13,000 employees around the world. I would like to express my gratitude to Charles and the entire Equinix team for the warm welcome and the facilitation of a smooth transition over the past 2 months. I look forward to the continued partnership with Charles in his role as Executive Chairman, and I'm excited and optimistic about the road ahead. .\nAs a Board member for the past 4 years, I've witnessed many of the unique qualities that have driven Equinix' durable success. Our 25 years of investment has built a business now spanning 264 data centers in 72 metros across 6 continents. Our focus on customer value and outcomes has created interconnected digital ecosystems unrivaled in our industry. It is a phenomenal foundation to build upon as CEO.\nAs the stewards of some of the most important digital infrastructure in the world, we are exceptionally and uniquely positioned to capitalize on the immense opportunities that lie ahead. Business transformation remains a critical priority for our customers and the emergence of AI marks a pivotal point for our industry. AI, similar to the growth of cloud technologies a decade ago will take time to fully develop.\nIn the near term, AI training workloads are driving significant demand, particularly from service providers. Our xScale program continues to be a direct beneficiary of this demand. We intend to build on this momentum, meaningfully augmenting and extending our xScale portfolio, particularly in North America. This will complement our robust portfolio across Europe and Asia Pacific. We are excited to share that we recently closed [ on land and power ] for our first multi-hundred megawatt xScale campus in Atlanta. We look forward to announcing details of this project and our next xScale joint venture in the coming months.\nAt the operational end of the AI spectrum, our network knows inference workloads. As with cloud, Equinix continues to be the preferred location for network nodes as customers seek the right connectivity solutions for data ingestion and distribution. We also see inference demand beginning to take shape. We believe the implementation and deployment of these workloads will accelerate over the coming years. The neutrality, global reach and scale of Platform Equinix can deliver the performance, network density and cloud adjacency, which inference workloads will require.\nWe are already seeing significant enterprise and service provider interest in our deployment capabilities. In Q2, we partnered with WWT to serve [ Alembic ] Technologies, an AI-powered marketing analytics platform for enterprise. [ Alembic ] Technologies deployed their AI infrastructure at Equinix to run proprietary inference algorithms on massive data sets for predictable cost, privacy, speed, and secure access to data sources in the cloud.\nInstaDeep, a leading provider of AI decision-making solutions deployed Nvidia AI cluster at our [ Paris 10 asset ] to access key ecosystems, optimize their network and support their growth objectives. Our approach to the market opportunity created by AI is multifaceted and we believe it will deliver value in the short term and sustainable growth over the medium to long term. Our xScale offering provides the infrastructure and expertise required for massive scalable data center operations for our cloud and large-scale technology customers.\nFor our enterprise and mid-market customers, we offer AI-ready data centers and turnkey solutions, enabling them to scale efficiently and effectively as they introduce AI technologies into their business operations. For those who require high-performance inferencing, our Edge solutions handle the data at the edge where it is generated ensuring optimal performance for the next generation of business applications. Over the past 2 months, I have embarked on a [ listening tour ] across a number of our locations, meeting with our customers, partners and employees. And whilst it is still early in my tenure, and there is still work that I need to complete, I have noted some areas of opportunity that will underpin our strategy for the company going forward, the opportunity to simplify across numerous aspects of our business. This will allow us to accelerate our pace of execution, the opportunity to drive more focus whilst we may do less, the programs of work that we focus on will represent excellence in execution and deliver the highest quality outcomes.\nThe opportunity to amplify our go-to-market efforts to delight our customers and energize our partners. Equinix has consistently demonstrated discipline and execution. This mantra of discipline allows us to deliver market-leading returns on capital and serves as the underlying fuel for long-term growth in AFFO per share, our core financial metric. Building on this foundation and executing on the opportunities I noted should create a simpler, more focused and ultimately higher valued company.\nWith all of this in mind, I'll turn to our Q2 performance. Equinix had a great second quarter. We delivered record gross bookings. Our pricing remains strong. We continue to invest broadly across our offerings to further enhance the scale and reach of our industry-leading platform. Our delivery of adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share continues to run ahead of expectations.\nAs you can see on Slide 3, Q2 revenues were $2.2 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year. This represents our 86th consecutive quarter of top line growth. Adjusted EBITDA was up 17% year-over-year, with strong AFFO per share flow through. Interconnection revenue stepped up to 9% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. In May, we announced the opening of our first data center in Johor with strong interest from customers across our new Malaysian footprint. In July, we announced our expansion into the Philippines through the planned acquisition of 3 data centers in Manila from Total Information Management. This transaction valued at approximately $180 million is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, adding more than 1,000 cabinets of capacity in addition to land for future development.\nThe combination of our strong leadership position in our Singapore hub and our entries into Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, strategically position Equinix to help our customers capitalize on the expanding digital opportunity in the fast-growing Southeast Asia region. Customers taking advantage of our expanding global footprint include FirstDigital, an Internet and telecommunications provider. FirstDigital is significantly lowering total cost of ownership by building a multi-cloud network with Equinix Fabric Cloud Router to connect to Cisco WebEx and AWS across all 3 regions.\nOur global interconnection franchise continues to perform with over 472,000 total interconnections now deployed. Gross interconnection additions were at the highest level in 2 years and pricing continues to trend favorably. However, net interconnection adds were 3,900 due to grooming activity, primarily in our content and networking verticals. We do expect this grooming to lessen over time. Equinix Fabric growth was underpinned by 100 gigabit port additions and strong pull-through from other digital services products.\nNetwork Edge experienced continued rapid growth with an expansion activity from existing customers. The recent interconnection and ecosystem wins, include Nuam Exchange. This is a new company formed after the integration of the Santiago Lima and Colombia Stock Exchanges. Capital market participants can now benefit from Nuam's extended reach, low latency and secure connectivity supported by Equinix in key markets like New York and Sao Paulo. Our channel program delivered another solid quarter, accounting for over 30% of new bookings and 55% of company new logos. We continue to see growth from partners like AT&T, Avant, Dell, HPE and Orange business, with wins across a wide range of industry segments and use cases. Notable wins included an AI as a service solution via our distribution partner, Tech Data and MSP partner [ Asia Pac ].\nLeveraging a combination of co-location and Equinix Fabric, our partners are delivering an LLM for a high-level learning institution based in Malaysia. Now before I turn the call over to Keith, I wanted to recognize that we believe we are in a position of strength financially from both a balance sheet and from an access to capital perspective. Our investment strategy delivers a strong return on invested capital, all of which gives us the flexibility to execute our go-forward strategy.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Keith to cover the results from the quarter.\n\nKeith D. Taylor\n\nChief Financial Officer, Equinix, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Adaire. Now let me first say, I look forward to the next phase of the Equinix journey alongside you and I know it's going to be a very exciting time for all of us at Equinix. And also good afternoon to all of those that are on the call today or who might be listening later. So to start, we had a great second quarter as the team continued to execute against our plans. We had record gross bookings, closing more than 4,000 deals with more than 3,000 customers. .\nWe continued our trend of net positive pricing actions, and we ended the quarter with solid net bookings. Our forward-looking pipeline remains deep, which we expect will drive momentum in the second half of the year, and we're delivering profitability ahead of our expectations. As a result, we're again raising our full year adjusted EBITDA and AFFO guidance, and therefore, AFFO per share too, our lighthouse metric.\nAlso, as Adaire highlighted, I'm excited about the next phase of our xScale initiatives. We plan to lean into this program as we've seen strong demand from this offering -- for this offering, as evidenced by both our cloud and AI bookings momentum. We continue to believe this off-balance sheet JV structure with our equity partners is the right model to pursue this significant opportunity, which also drives durable value on a per share basis. To date, through the xScale JVs, we've invested about $4.7 billion in the program.\nSince our last earnings call, we leased an incremental 17 megawatts of capacity in our Silicon Valley 12 and Paris 13 assets. This brings our total global xScale leasing to 365 megawatts, representing nearly $6 billion of total contract value and more than $700 million of annualized revenue once these assets are fully ramped. Looking forward, we have a strong funnel of additional xScale opportunities and we look forward to updating you on our future JV partnerships in the near term.\nFor nonfinancial metrics, MR per cabinet is rising, increasing 7% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis to $2,287 per cabinet, driven by favorable pricing environment, solid interconnection attach rates and increasing prior densities. As discussed on our last earnings call, as expected, we saw continued pressure on our unadjusted net cabinets billing metric due to capacity constraints in certain key markets, increasing power density and timing of churn.\nStackPath unexpectedly announced their immediate liquidation in June, resulting in 300 cabinets churning at quarter end as an example. Related to cabinet density, the Q2 cabinet churn were on an average density of 4 kilowatts per cabinet while the new cabinets booked were at an average density of 5.9 kilowatts per cabinet. In Q2, non-xScale net megawatts sold increased meaningfully compared to the prior 6 quarters. As we look forward, given our strong gross bookings and as a result, the rising backlog of cabinets sold but not yet installed, we expect billable cabinets to improve in the second half of the year.\nOn the sustainability front, we're continuing to advance our bold Future First agenda, implementing innovative ways to integrate into the communities in which we operate. This includes new heat export programs across Europe and the Americas, including our new Paris 10 IBX, which helps heat a portion of the aquatic center at the Paris Olympics. This is one example of a sustainability initiative that we believe will become commonplace in the markets we serve in the future.\nNow let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, Global Q2 revenues were $2.59 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year and in the upper half of our guidance range on a constant currency basis, including the impact of a one-off charge against recurring revenues. As expected, nonrecurring revenue stepped up sequentially due to strong xScale leasing activity in the quarter. Q2 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $6 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates due to the weaker Brazilian real and the Japanese yen in the quarter.\nGlobal Q2 adjusted EBITDA was [ $1.036 ] billion or 48% of revenues, up 17% over the same quarter last year and above the $1 billion quarterly threshold for the very first time. Relative to our expectations, adjusted EBITDA was at the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating profits and timing of spend. Q2-adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included a $3 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and $4 million of integration costs.\nGlobal Q2 AFFO was $877 million, up 17% over the same quarter last year, better than our expectations due to strong operating performance and the timing of the land lease payment related to our upcoming Singapore 6 build. Q2 AFFO included a $3 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q2 MRR churn was 2.3%. For the balance of the year, we expect MRR churn to remain in the 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range.\nTurning to our regional highlights, the results, which are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized basis, APAC was our fastest-growing region at 11%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions growing at 9% and 5%, respectively. The Americas region had a great quarter with record gross bookings led by strong financial services activity, firm pricing and a higher mix of medium and large footprint deals. We saw particular strength in our Tier 1 markets, including Dallas, New York, Washington, D.C.\nOur EMEA business delivered a solid quarter with healthy bookings activity and strong pricing. The team did an excellent job selling our global platform with record exports and strong intra-region activity, including into growth in emerging markets such as Abu Dhabi, Istanbul and Warsaw. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a strong quarter with momentum in our largest markets in the region, including Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo as well as strong customer interest in our new Asian metros.\nEncouragingly, we saw strong intra-region activity driven by customers deploying AI workloads in both Japan and Malaysia. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased to approximately $33 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of $2 billion. Our cash balance increased quarter-over-quarter due to strong operating cash flow and the debt raised in the quarter, offset by our growth investments and the cash dividend.\nIn May, we raised $750 million of senior U.S. dollar notes due in 2034, and we immediately swapped these notes into euros at an effective interest rate of 3.9%. Our net leverage remains low relative to our peers of 3.5x our annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our blended debt borrowing rate is now 2.4%, the lowest in our industry. As noted previously, given the global nature of our business, we plan to opportunistically raise additional debt capital in low rate markets where we intend to expand, creating both incremental debt capital to fund our growth but also placing a natural hedge into these markets.\nTurning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were $648 million, including recurring CapEx of $45 million. We continue to invest across our platform with 54 major projects currently underway in 36 markets in 24 countries, including 15 xScale scale projects. Since our last earnings call, we opened 10 projects across 8 metros, including new data centers in Johor, [ Lusaka ], Silicon Valley and Warsaw. We also purchased our Helsinki 5 and Madrid 2 assets and land for development in Atlanta, Dallas and Milan.\nRevenues from owned assets increased to 69% of our recurring revenues and more than 80% of our current retail expansion will be on our own land or own buildings with long-term ground leases. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. 180 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Stabilized assets were collectively 83% utilized and generated a 26% cash-on-cash return on the gross [ PP ] invested.\nAnd finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for an updated summary of 2024 guidance and bridges. Do note all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year 2024, we're maintaining our underlying revenue outlook with expected top line growth of 7% to 8%. This reflects our solid execution in the first half of the year and a strong pipeline to drive momentum in the second half of the year. We're raising our underlying 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance by another $15 million due to strong operating performance and lower integration costs.\nWe're raising our underlying 2024 AFFO guidance by $15 million, an 11% to 13% increase over the previous year. AFFO per share is expected to grow between 9% and 11% at or above the top end of our long-term plan as we continue to compound value for our shareholders. And finally, 2024 CapEx is expected to range between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion, including about $240 million of recurring CapEx.\nSo let me stop here. I will turn the call back to Adaire.\n\nAdaire Rita Fox-Martin\n\nPresident of Global Customer Operations & Member of Executive Board, SAP SE\n\nThank you, Keith. In closing, we had a strong first half of 2024. We stand apart from our competitors by seamlessly integrating a global footprint with cutting-edge infrastructure. This allows us to effectively address the wide range of opportunities in the era of AI from the training needs of the service providers to the business needs of our enterprise customers. .\nIt also positions us to continue to effectively address the broader set of demands of our customer base. We believe our unwavering commitment to discipline, simplicity and focus. Combined with our amplified go-to-market efforts, we'll continue to drive growth and deliver higher value for our employees, customers, partners and shareholders. With that, I'll stop here and open it up to questions."

You may begin.\n\nChip Newcom\n\nDirector, Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind everyone that some of the statements that we will be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we've identified in today's press release and those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed February 16, 2024, and recently filed Form 10-Q. Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call.\nIn addition, in light of Regulation Fair Disclosure, it is Equinix' policy not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure.\nIn addition, we'll provide non-GAAP measures on today's conference call. We provide a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a list of the reasons why the company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix Investor Relations page at www.equinix.com.\nWe've made available on the IR page of our website a presentation designed to accompany this discussion, along with certain supplemental financial information and other data. We would also like to remind you that we post important information about Equinix on the IR page of our website from time to time and encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current available information.\nWith us today are Charles Meyers, Equinix' CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in 1 hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to one.\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\n\nCharles J. Meyers\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Equinix, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chip. Good afternoon and welcome to our Q1 earnings call.\nWe had a great start to 2024 driven by our highest Q1 bookings performance on record, strong conversion rates, completely favorable pricing dynamics, and lower-than-expected churn, all resulting in our 85th key quarter of top-line revenue growth, the longest such streak of any S&P 500 company. We closed more than 3,800 deals across more than 3,100 customers for the quarter demonstrating both the scale and the consistency of our go-to-market machine. And we again saw accelerating hyperscale demand translate into robust xScale leasing in both EMEA and Asia. While we continue to operate in an environment of broader economic uncertainty, and see some level of corresponding customer caution, our forward-looking pipeline is strong, and we remain optimistic about the opportunity ahead.\nDigital transformation, particularly given the rapid adoption of AI, serves as a powerful catalyst for economic expansion, and our customers remain steadfastly committed to their digital initiatives, recognizing the pivotal role they play in fostering long-term revenue growth and driving operational efficiency.\nAs we continue to make digital infrastructure more powerful, more accessible and more sustainable, we're thrilled that Merrie Williamson has joined our team as chief customer and revenue officer. Merrie is an operational and visionary leader with unique skills and experience to help drive the next chapter of our growth and brings a proven track record of building new routes to market, enhancing the customer experience, and accelerating go-to-market productivity.\nOn the sustainability front, we continue to advance our bold future first agenda, with Gartner estimating that by 2027, 80% of CIOs will have performance metrics tied to the sustainability of their IT organization. It's clear to us that companies are prioritizing sustainability in their digital infrastructure decisions. We recently published our ninth Annual ISR Report and continued our industry leadership with 96% renewable energy coverage across our growing portfolio, marking our sixth consecutive year with over 90% coverage. Equinix PPAs now support more than one gigawatt of new clean energy in high-impact markets, and we continue to seek additional clean energy projects that will support our growth.\nIn late April, we were pleased to announce our first renewable PPA in Singapore, an important part of our plan to continue to grow in this strategically critical market. This project will provide 75 megawatts of solar and is in line with Singapore's Green Plan 2030, which seeks to have all business sectors supported by cleaner energy sources.\nIn parallel, we remain highly focused on improving the energy efficiency of our existing facilities as measured by power usage effectiveness. In 2023, we invested $78 million in high-returning efficiency projects, improving our average annual PP&E by over 8% year over year to 1.42, another lever in continuing to drive performance in our stabilized assets. We also continue to make progress on adjusting the thermostat in our facilities, with more than 50 of our data centers now operationally ready to enable A1A and strong industry support for the implementation of this important new temperature standard.\nTurning to our results as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q1 were $2.1 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year driven by strong recurring revenues and xScale fees. Adjusted EBITDA was up 6% year-over-year and AFFO per share was meaningfully better than expectations due to strong operating performance. Interconnection revenues stepped up 9% year over year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant-currency basis. Our unmatched scale and reach continue to drive performance in our data center services portfolio. Given strong underlying demand for digital infrastructure and the long duration in delivering new capacity, we see a growing scarcity mindset, and therefore we continue to invest broadly across our global footprint. We currently have 50 major projects underway in 34 markets across 21 countries, including 14 xScale builds, representing more than 16,000 cabinets of retail and more than 50 megawatts of xScale capacity through the end of 2024. This quarter we added new projects in Frankfurt, Madrid, Osaka, and Silicon Valley. Key multi-market wins this quarter include ServiceNow, expanding with Equinix in multiple locations globally, powering their continued growth including new GenAI workloads, and Wasabi technologies, a cloud object storage service provider expanding across all three regions to support their continued growth.\nOur MRR per cabinet continues to rise increasing $119 year over year on a normalized and constant-currency basis to $2,258 driven by continued mark-to-market momentum, solid attach rates for interconnection and digital services, and increasing power densities.\nWith respect to our net cabinets building capacity constraints in certain key markets and the meaningful delta in power density between churned cabs and booked cabs continues to pressure this metric. But gross additions remain strong and our booked kilowatts in the retail business were at near-record levels. Given strong bookings and upcoming capacity additions, we expect billable cabs to increase in the second half and continue to see cabinet growth as part of the long-term growth story for the business.\nTurning to our industry-leading global interconnection franchise, we now have more than 468,000 total interconnections deployed on our platform. In Q1, interconnection adds picked up to 6,200 supported by healthy gross adds and a moderation of consolidations into higher bandwidth connections, and we continue to see a healthy pricing dynamic with a roughly 16% spread in the quarter between churned interconnects and new additions. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 5% quarter over quarter and 24% year over year to nearly 38 terabits per second led by the Americas.\nWe remain confident that Equinix's unique and durable advantages will continue to position our platform as the logical point of nexus for buyers and sellers of digital services to come together to fuel digital transformation and unlock the enormous potential of AI. This year, Gartner projects the spending on public cloud services will grow 20% to reach $679 billion as business needs and emerging technologies, including GenAI, drive cloud model innovation. We're seeing this translate into strong demand across multiple vectors with key cloud and IT customers broadly and with the hyperscalers specifically. In the quarter, we added one new native cloud on-ramp in Madrid, bringing us to 220 native cloud on-ramps across our portfolio, spanning 47 metros. This represents a nearly 40% market share of private cloud on-ramps in the markets where we operate.\nWe remain an integral and growing part of hyperscaler architectures, with these customers collectively representing more than $1.3 billion of annualized revenue in Q1 in our retail business alone, with deployments across an average of more than 60 of our data centers around the world. Importantly, we're also seeing strong go-to-market momentum with these market-shaping players as we partner to meet end-customer needs for hybrid cloud and private AI, making the hyperscalers some of our most productive channel partners.\nIn our xScale program, demand remains robust as cloud and AI needs are translating into strong pre-leasing activity. Since our last earnings call, we've pre-leased an incremental 48 megawatts capacity across our Frankfurt 10, Osaka 4, and Osaka 5 assets, including approximately 34 megawatts leased in mid-April. This brings total xScale leasing to nearly 350 megawatts globally with nearly 90% of our operational and underconstruction capacity leased, and a meaningful pipeline of opportunities to drive continued xScale momentum in the quarters to come.\nAdditionally, in mid-April, we announced our first U.S. xScale joint venture with PGIM Real Estate for our SV12x asset. When combined with our existing joint ventures in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, this new JV will bring the expected global xScale portfolio to more than $8 billion in investment across more than 35 facilities and greater than 725 megawatts of power capacity when fully built out. We're also making good progress on additional planned xScale opportunities in the U.S, and we look forward to updating you on those developments in the coming quarters.\nShifting to our digital services portfolio, Equinix Fabric and Network Edge continue to overindex relative to the broader business. We see solid interest from customers looking to use the combination of Fabric, Network Edge and Metal for their digital infrastructure requirements. In support of this need, our engineering teams recently completed the integration of Metal and Fabric, significantly improving the VC creation experience for Metal users. Wins across the business included global security leader CrowdStrike, exploring a cloud-adjacent storage solution on platform Equinix in EMEA to leverage proximity to Equinix's rich ecosystem of cloud and storage provider customers. And an online AI and data analytics education company building out AI infrastructure to support learning for global practitioners.\nOur channel program delivered another solid quarter with channel and partner influence deals accounting for over 30% of gross bookings and over 60% of new logos. We continue to see growth from the hyperscalers and from other key partners like AT&T, Avant, Dell, Kyndryl, and Zenlayer with wins across a wide range of industry segments and a broad mix of Equinix services. As we expand into new markets, our partners are accelerating our efforts to sell the global platform.\nIn Q1, we had a number of wins with Zenlayer in Malaysia, including delivering co-locations and interconnection solutions to a fintech firm, extending its reach into Kuala Lumpur, as well as supporting logistics consulting firm extending into Johor. We also saw a win with Kyndryl who also selected Platform Equinix to service some of its largest customers in Canada, including from the public sector.\nSo, let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter.\n\nKeith D. Taylor\n\nChief Financial Officer, Equinix, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone.\nAs highlighted by Charles, we had a strong start to the year, delivering better-than-planned results across each of our core financial metrics. Our net bookings were meaningfully better than expected. We had strong customer momentum, lower-than-expected churn, and continued positive pricing actions, and our forward-looking pipeline remains deep as we look to execute against our plan for the remainder of the year.\nGlobal MRR per cabinet, our ARPU metric measured in U.S. dollars, continues to show momentum across all three regions. With each of our regions now eclipsing to $2,000 for the first time despite the weaker foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar. Also, our xScale business continues to perform very well having leased another five assets year to date with a meaningful pipeline of opportunities for the quarters to come.\nNow, as many of you know, Equinix's competitive advantage in the marketplace is derived from both our interconnected digital ecosystems and our industry-leading global scale and reach. But also, Equinix's operational reliability and putting the customer at the center of everything we do is a third competitive advantage.\nAs an example, our global ops teams strive to deliver greater than six-ninths of annual availability to our customers, which means being up and running for all, but approximately 30 seconds a year on average. To achieve this outcome, our ops team performed thorough capacity reviews and regularly monitored both our average and peak customer power draw against the shared facility capacity to ensure we can support our commitments to our customers. As demonstrated throughout our greater than 25-year history, we've reliably delivered against these operational commitments, which is why nearly 90% of our new reported bookings activity has historically come from existing customers, and by reliably delivering on our commitments to our customers, our team has also been able to deliver sustained value accretion to you, our shareholders.\nAs an additional update, we're also pleased to share that the audit committee of the company's board of directors conducted and has substantially completed a previously announced independent investigation with the assistance of independent third-party professional advisors. Based on the findings of the independent investigation, the audit committee has concluded that Equinix's financial reporting has been accurate and the application of its accounting practices has resulted in an appropriate representation of its operating performance. The audit committee had full discretion over the scope of the investigation and was not restricted in any way. As part of this assessment, the audit committee did not identify any accounting inconsistencies or errors requiring an adjustment to or restatement of previously issued financial statements or non-GAAP measures.\nAlso, as previously disclosed, shortly after the release of the short seller report, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office from the Northern District of California. Additionally, on April 30th, 2024, we received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are cooperating fully with both subpoenas and do not expect to comment further on such matters until appropriate to do so.\nNow, let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant-currency basis.\nAs depicted on Slide 4, global revenues were $2.127 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year in the upper half of our guidance range on a constant-currency basis. As expected, non-recurring revenue stepped down sequentially yet still remained elevated as a percentage of revenue due to the level of xScale leasing activity in the quarter.\nFor Q2, given our strong Q1 net bookings activity and increased non-recurring revenues related to our APAC xScale business in April, Q2 revenues are expected to step up 2% to 3% over the prior quarter.\nQ1 revenues, net of our FX hedges included a $14 million headwinds when compared to our prior FX guidance rates due to the strong U.S. dollar in the quarter. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $992 million or 47% of revenues, up 6% over the same quarter last year and above the top end of our guidance range due to lower utilities expense and timing of spend. Q1 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included $6 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and $1 million of integration costs. Global Q1 AFFO was $843 million, up 8% over the same quarter last year and above our expectations due to strong operating performance and lower-than-expected net interest expense. As planned, we had seasonally lower recurring capex spend, consistent with prior years. Q1 AFFO included a $4 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 MRR was better than expected at 2.1%. For the full year, we continue to expect MRR churn to average in the 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range.\nTurning to our regional highlights, these full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized basis, APAC was our fastest-growing region at 12% followed by the Americas and EMEA regions both growing at 6%.\nThe Americas region had a great quarter with strong bookings performance led by the public sector activity and healthy pickup in exports to the other regions as our team sold across our global platform. We saw particular strength in our Atlanta, Culpeper, and Miami metros, as well as a strong interest in the additional soon-to-be open capacity in the New York Metro.\nOur EMEA business delivered a strong quarter with robust gross bookings activity including an increased mix of medium and larger footprint deals. In the quarter, we saw booking strength in our Barcelona, Frankfurt and Paris markets.\nAnd finally, Asia Pacific region had a great quarter with firm pricing and strength from our digital services products, including increased adoption of inter metro connections on Equinix Fabric as customers continue to focus on their network optimization efforts. In the quarter, we saw Good Inc. recently opened capacity in Malaysia and continued momentum in our largest markets in the region including Hong Kong, Tokyo and Sydney.\nAnd now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our net leverage remained low relative to our peers at 3.6 times our annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our balance sheet decreased approximately $31.9 billion, including unrestricted cash balance of over $1.5 billion. Our cash balance decreased quarter-over-quarter as our strong operating cash flow was more than offset by the growth investments and the quarterly cash dividend. As noted previously, and given our strong balance sheet and liquidity position, we plan to remain opportunistic as it relates to the timing, size and currency of our future capital market activities, including when we plan to refinance the $1 billion of debt maturing later this year.\nTurning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $707 million including seasonally lowered recurring capex of $21 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened three retail projects in Mexico City, Mumbai and Paris. We also purchased our Dublin 2, Mumbai 2 and Stockholm 3 assets, as well as land for development in Santiago, Chile. Revenues from owned assets increased at 67% of our recurring revenues, and more than 90% of the current retail expansion investment will be on owned land or owned buildings with long-term ground leases.\nNow, we're also entering a stage in our asset lifecycle where we're evaluating select opportunities to invest in highly valued IBXs that have been operating for 20 years or longer. Starting this quarter, we added a new category of non-recurring capex spend to our disclosures, referred to as redevelopment capex, to track these investments to enhance the capacity, efficiency and operating standards of facilities in this category, and to attract capital investments that are intended to meaningfully extend the economic life of assets. Our first redevelopment project is DC2, one of our original IBXs that opened in the early 2000s, and home to our networking ecosystem in northern Virginia. Total estimated spend on this DC2 project will approximate $76 million broken into two primary categories of capex investment, redevelopment and recurring. We expect the $56 million redevelopment portion of the investment to yield meaningful additional space and power capacity, and, given the favorable pricing environment and high customer demand for the DC2 asset, we anticipate that this capacity will generate additional revenues and cash flow that should result in an IR well above our current stabilized asset yields. The remaining portion of the investment, which relates to maintaining our existing revenues, such as roof replacement, will be categorized as typical as recurring capex.\nNow moving to Slide 10. Our capital investments have continued to deliver strong returns. Consistent with prior years in Q1, we completed the annual refresh of our IBX categorization exercise, and our stabilized asset count increased by a net six IBXs. Our now 180-stabilized asset increased recurring revenues by 5% year over year on a constant-currency basis, a quarter-over-quarter step-down as we lap the power price actions in 2023. Stabilized assets were collectively 84% utilized and generated a 26% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested.\nAnd finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for updated summary of 2024 guidance and bridges. Do note all growth rates are on a normalized and constant-currency basis. For the full year 2024, we're maintaining our underlying revenue outlook with expected top-line growth of 7% to 8%, a reflection of our continued strong momentum. We're raising our underlying 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $5 million due to lower integration spend. We're raising our underlying 2024 AFFO guidance by $25 million to now grow between 10% and 13% compared to the previous year due to lower net interest expense. AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 8% and 11%. 2024 capex is expected to range between $2.8 billion and $3 billion including about $220 million of recurring capex spend.\nSo, let me stop here, and I'll turn the call back to Charles.\n\nCharles J. Meyers\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Equinix, Inc.\n\nThanks, Keith.\nIn closing, we continue to see our customers derive compelling value from platform Equinix, leveraging our superior global reach, our scaled digital ecosystem, our market-leading interconnection platform and our greater-than-25-year track record of delivering on our commitments to fuel their investments in digital transformation. We are delighted to see the continued strength and fundamentals of our business, we remain highly confident in the integrity of our financials and we are as optimistic as ever that we'll continue to be an important partner for digital leaders as they accelerate AI investments and embrace hybrid and multi-cloud as the clear architecture of choice.\nBefore we turn to Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes on my transition. In reflecting on the last six years, it has been both a pleasure and a privilege to be the CEO of Equinix, showing up every day in service to our customers, to our employees, and to our shareholders. As I transition to the role of Executive Chairman later this quarter, I'll continue to take an active part in the business as Adaire Fox-Martin steps into the CEO role. Adaire is an extremely accomplished executive with a proven ability to deliver sustained value to the full range of stakeholders. I'm confident that she brings the experience, the skills, and the passion that we need to inspire our teams and support the evolving needs of our customers, driving growth and unlocking the extraordinary power of Platform Equinix. I look forward to working with Adaire in this next chapter of the Equinix journey.\nI'd also like to thank Peter Van Camp, a shining example of the magic of Equinix over the last 25 years, and look forward to partnering with him as he moves from our Executive Chairman to Special Advisor to the board.\nI look forward to further collaboration with both Adaire and the broader leadership team as we continue on our path as the world's digital infrastructure company capturing and creating new opportunities and leveraging our distinctive advantages to ensure digital leaders can harness our trusted platform to create and interconnect the foundational digital infrastructure that enhances our world.\nSo, let me stop there and open it up for questions."

Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in 1 hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\n\nCharles J. Meyers\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Equinix, Inc.\n\nChip. Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We had a solid close to 2023 as digital transformation and accelerating AI demand drove a record quarter for xScale leasing, robust pricing dynamics and continued momentum across our data center and digital services portfolios. For the full year, we delivered more than $8 billion of revenues, eclipsing 21 years of consecutive quarterly growth, all while driving AFFO per share performance above the top end of our long-term expectations.\nAs we look ahead, we see our overall relevance to customers continue to rise with our global reach, highly differentiated ecosystems and full-range portfolio of services, positioning us as a key long-term partner to fuel digital transformation and unlock the enormous potential of AI. At the same time, many customers remain cautious in the face of macro uncertainty and are driving optimization across their broader IT infrastructure. Freeing up dollars for AI-related investments while still managing within tighter overall budgets. These dynamics, combined with capacity constrained in certain key markets continue to create cross currents in our business with solid gross demand and strong pricing dynamics being offset by more deliberate buying decisions and slightly higher levels of churn.\nMeanwhile, we continue to realize the benefits of efficiency investments over the past few years and are showing strong operating leverage in the business, allowing us to maintain our differentiated return on invested capital, expand margins and deliver outsized performance on AFFO per share, which we continue to see as our lighthouse metric and the bedrock of long-term value creation.\nAs work to make digital infrastructure more powerful, accessible and sustainable, we are building relationships as trusted advisers to our customers, innovating across our product portfolio, deepening our technology partnerships to solve customer challenges and maintaining our discipline to put the right customers with the right workloads into the right assets.\nThis approach reinforces the kind of advantages of Platform Equinix as we focus our efforts in 2024 on 4 key areas: First, we plan to continue to expand our unmatched global reach, extending the 76 metros in 35 countries by year-end, including opening new markets in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and South Africa. We also intend to add much needed capacity in high-demand existing markets across all 3 regions, including significant retail phases in New York, Paris and Tokyo and accelerated investment in our xScale portfolio.\nSecond, we intend to extend our interconnection leadership by combining the scalability and performance of physical interconnection and the agility of Equinix Fabric with a commitment to lead the way in the massive market of multi-cloud networking, with new innovations and products like our recently announced Equinix Fabric Cloud Router.\nThird, we'll continue to prioritize our future first sustainability strategy, making Equinix a clear partner of choice to help our customers track and [ see ] their sustainability goals and manage an increasingly complex global power landscape.\nAnd finally, we intend to unlock the power of platform clinics, embracing key partners and making it easier than ever to combine our value with theirs. So we can solve our customers' problems together. In particular, we focus on Gen AI as we join forces with incredible partners such as NVIDIA, to ensure that Platform Equinix is the place where private AI happens.\nTurning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for the full year were $8.2 billion, up $925 million, a 15% increase year-over-year or a 9% increase, excluding the impact of power price increases. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.7 billion, up 11% year-over-year. AFFO was more than $3 billion for the first time, resulting in AFFO per share growth of 11% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. On the AI front, we saw strong momentum across the value chain in Q4 as we cultivated key partnerships and one significant opportunities. While still early, Gen AI has the capacity to transform every industry and is poised to accelerate rapidly. By 2026, Gartner predicts over 80% of enterprises have used Gen AI APIs and models or deployed Gen AI-enabled applications in production environments, up from just 5% in early 2023.\nWe're leaning into this opportunity and recently announced our expanded partnership for IBX private cloud at Equinix. This new service provides customers a fast and cost-effective way to adopt advanced AI infrastructure that's operated and managed by experts globally. So enterprises can move quickly, while balancing performance requirements, a need for cloud adjacency and a rapidly increasing desire to maintain control of critical enterprise data. We're seeing strong interest in this service across all 3 regions with early adoption from digital leaders in biopharma, financial services, software, automotive and retail subsegments.\nEarly wins in this partnership include a Fortune 100 global biopharma company who will create an AI [ of ] excellence to accelerate its research and development process and shorten time to market for new medications.\nOur data center services portfolio continues to scale with 9 new data center openings since our last earnings call. Given the strong underlying demand for digital infrastructure and the long duration in delivering new capacity, we continue to invest broadly across our global footprint. We currently have 49 major projects underway in 35 markets across 21 countries including 11 xScale builds representing nearly 20,000 cabinets of retail and more than 50 megawatts of xScale capacity through 2024.\nWins this quarter included a European biotechnology company, exiting their traditional data centers in favor of a global network dense, hybrid and multi-cloud environment, including liquid cooling requirements. [ Andor ] in holding, a Turkish conglomerate, mainly serving as a strong global automotive supply company, expanding with Equinix to support their operations across 15 countries.\nShifting to our xScale initiative, the wave of hyperscale demand to support AI and cloud is translating into robust demand in pre-leasing activity. Since our last earnings call, we leased 90 megawatts of capacity across 6 assets in EMEA and APAC, including approximately 32 megawatts leased at the start of the year. This brings total xScale leasing to 300 [ megaport ] globally. Wins this quarter included supporting strategic Gen AI workloads as well as the hyperscalers first-scale liquid cooling deployment at Equinix. Looking ahead, we have a meaningful pipeline of opportunities to drive continued xScale momentum in the quarters to come.\nTurning to our industry-leading global interconnection franchise, we now have more than 462,000 total interconnections deployed on our platform. In Q4, interconnection revenue stepped up 8% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, and we added an incremental 4,300 organic interconnections for the quarter. We, again, had healthy gross adds activity, offset somewhat by continued grooming and consolidations into higher bandwidth connections.\nInternet exchange saw peak traffic up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 22% year-over-year, to nearly 36 terabits per second, led by expansion from existing customers. Additionally, during the quarter, we added 4 new native cloud on-ramps in Bogota, Calgary and Zurich. Equinix customers can now enjoy low latency access to multiple native cloud on-ramps in 37 metros, including 8 out of the 10 world's largest metros by GDP. Wins this quarter included a leading European quantum computing company, offering its technology through Equinix Metal and Equinix Fabric, enabling different industries to explore potential use cases in quantum computing. And on insurance, a South African insurance company expanding in EMEA, leveraging Equinix Fabric and a managed service solution to be ready to begin trading.\nIn our digital services portfolio, we saw continued momentum as Equinix Metal and Network Edge drove attractive pull-through to Equinix Fabric. In January, we announced the general availability of Equinix Fabric Cloud Router, a new virtual routing service to simplify enterprises complex cloud to cloud and hybrid cloud networking challenges. By providing an easy-to-configure enterprise-grade multi-cloud routing service that can be deployed in under a minute. Customers can deploy Equinix Fabric Cloud Router in all 58 Equinix fabric-enabled metros globally, with low latency connectivity to all the major cloud providers as well as hundreds of other service providers.\nKey digital wins included NetApp, who expanded their partnership with Equinix to deliver a Bare Metal service solution, a comprehensive compute, network and storage infrastructure stack with low latency connections to major public clouds. And a leading semiconductor company, establishing a cloud adjacent storage presence using Equinix Metal and Pure Storage with integration into AWS.\nOur channel program delivered another good quarter, accounting for 35% of bookings and over 50% of new logos. We saw continued growth from partners like HPE, HCL, NVIDIA and WWT, with wins across a wide range of industry verticals and digital first use cases. Wins this quarter included supporting a consumer health care company's business unit spin-off with Dell, setting up a hybrid IT environment by leveraging colocation and cloud for their SAP environment in London and Singapore.\nNow let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter.\n\nKeith D. Taylor\n\nChief Financial Officer, Equinix, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. As highlighted by Charles, we had a solid end to 2023. The Equinix team continued to execute across all levels of the organization to ensure our strategy as the world's digital infrastructure company continue to separate us from our peers.\nFor the full year, our healthy gross bookings allowed the team to close almost 17,000 deals across more than 5,900 customers. Highlighting the diversity and strength of our unrivaled go-to-market engine. Then pricing activity, both in the quarter and throughout the year, created strong pricing dine resulting in normalized and constant currency MRR per cap yield stepping up $38 for the quarter and $127 for the year to [ $2,227 ] per cap.\nAnd we had record [ excel ] leasing over the year while generating approximately $49 of nonrecurring xScale fee revenue in the quarter, primarily related to the EMEA region. On the sustainability front, we're pleased to again be listed on CDP's prestigious 2023 Climate Change A-List and again, to be recognized in JUST Capital's 2024 rankings as #1 in real estate.\nAs we look forward into 2024, our customers remain committed to all things digital, and we believe we're the best manifestation of this opportunity as customers digitally transform their [ form ] both in the cloud and through AI. Hence our enthusiasm about our position in the broader market and the opportunities that lay out for us.\nThat said, we remain highly vigilant to the current market conditions and the impact on our customers. As mentioned last quarter, capacity constraints exist across a few of our markets, driving continued firm pricing power, albeit with some moderation to short-term growth. But as highlighted, on our expansion tracking slide, we have several new markets and additional capacity coming online later this year, with many other projects currently being contemplated as we look to extend our platform and drive growth. Also, we're very pleased with the operating leverage the business is delivering, benefiting from prior investments while being highly present future spend, resulting in improving adjusted EBITDA margins for the year. Importantly, our forward guide on our core metric being AFFO per share reflects our confidence in the long-term opportunity of our business, a preferential position, I believe, relative to any others in our space given the foundational differences of our platform.\nAdditionally, our as reported guidance includes positive FX tailwinds due to the weaker U.S. dollar relative to '23 rates, and net power price decreases as utility rates moderate across both our regulated and unregulated markets.\nNow let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Do note that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $2.11 billion, up 15% over the same quarter last year due to strong recurring revenue growth, power price increases and record xScale nonrecurring fees. As you would expect, we're very pleased with the continued success of our xScale portfolio and the MRR and other fees generated, while also expecting a strong year in 2024.\nAs noted previously, xScale MRR is inherently lumpy. For Q1, we expect MRR will step down sequentially, yet remain elevated as a turn of revenues due to strong APAC leasing activity in January. Q4 revenues or FX hedges includes a $3 million benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates.\nGlobal Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $920 million, or 44% of revenues, up 12% over the same quarter last year due to strong operating performance, although down quarter-over-quarter due to a $15 million charge related to our planned corporate real estate activities and a higher seasonal increase in repairs and maintenance spend.\nQ4 adjusted EBITDA net of our FX hedges had a minimal FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates and does include $4 million of integration costs. Global Q4 AFFO was $691 million, above our expectations due to strong business performance and favorable interest income, offset in part by higher seasonal recurring CapEx. The Q4 included a $4 million FX headwind compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q4 MRR terms stepped up to 2.4% in the higher end of our range due to customer optimizations.\nFor 2024, we expect MRR churn to stay in the upper side of our churn range in the first half of the year, then moderate down in the second half, and we expect this key metric average within our targeted 2% to 2.5% per quarter range for the year.\nTurning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized and constant currency basis, EMEA was our fastest-growing MRR region at 27% due to power price increases. Followed by our APAC and Americas regions at 9% and 7% MRR growth, respectively. The Americas region had a solid quarter of strong new logo growth and firm pricing led by our Chicago, New York and Washington, D.C. metros. The Americas saw a step-up in cabinets billing in the quarter, which now includes the intel assets in our nonfinancial metrics.\nEMEA business had a strong quarter led by our German business and our growth in urging market metros. We've had strong xScale activity across a number of our markets over the year. MainOne, our business in Ghana, Ivory Coast in Nigeria is performing better than our business case on a constant currency basis. Additionally, we signed our first deal in our Johannesburg 1 asset in South Africa, which opens in Q3.\nAnd finally, the Asia Pacific region saw good performance in both our Japanese markets and in Mumbai. As it relates to our soon-to-be opened new markets in the region, we're actively building a strong pipeline of key ecosystem customers, which we expect to close prior to the IBX openings. Also, we're pleased to have recently announced our first long-term PPA in APAC for 151 megawatts. To date, Equinix has executed 21 PPAs across Australia, France, Iberia, the Nordics and the U.S. which will generate more than 1 gigawatt of clean energy once operational. This will certainly help these markets accelerate their clean energy transition.\nAnd now looking at our capital structure. Please refer to Slide 8. Our net leverage remains low relative to our peers at 3.7x our annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our balance sheet increased approximately [ $32.1 billion ], including an unrestricted cash balance of $2.1 billion. Our cash balance includes the settlement of approximately $433 million of ATM food equity sales, the timing triggered by the increase in our Q4 quarterly cash dividend. Additionally, during the quarter, we executed an incremental $500 million of ATM forward equity sales, which we expect to settle in late 2024.\nAs I've noted previously, we expect to remain opportunistic in the timing and currency of our financing strategy, including our plans to refinance the $1 billion of debt maturing this year.\nTurning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were $996 million, including recurring CapEx of $105 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened 7 retail projects, including 4 new data centers in Frankfurt, Kuala Lumpur, also Washington, D.C. In our xScale program, we opened 7 new projects and are now 87% leased or pre-leased for all of our operational and the [ Nose ] projects. During the quarter, we also purchased our London IBX asset and land for development in Mexico City. Revenue from owned assets increased to 66% of our recurring revenues, a meaningful step up in last quarter, highlighting the progress we've had around asset ownership and long-term control of our assets.\nOur capital expenditures delivered strong returns, as shown on Slide 10. Our 174 stabilized assets increased revenues by 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis or 5% excluding the benefit attributed to our power price increases. Our stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. As a reminder, unlike prior years, we plan to update our stabilized asset summary on the Q1 earnings call.\nAnd finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for an updated summary of 2024 guidance and bridges. Starting with revenues. For the full year 2024, we expect top line growth of 7% to 9% on an as-reported basis or 7% to 8% on a normalized and constant currency basis, excluding the impact of lower power cost pass through to our customers. We expect 2024 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 47%. And a 160 basis point improvement over last year due to strong operating leverage, targeted expense management initiative and power price decreases. We expect to incur $25 million of integration costs, primarily related to the main 1 business, projects which we expect to complete by end of year.\nAFFO is expected to grow between 9% and 12% compared to previous year. AFFO per share is expected to grow between 8% and 10% at the top end of our longer-term targeted range on both an as reported and normalized and constant currency basis. 2024 CapEx is expected to range between $2.8 billion and $3 billion, including about $220 million of recurring CapEx.\nAnd finally, after moving forward with the 25% increase in our per share cash dividend last quarter, we're holding our quarterly cash dividend cost at $4.26 per share for 2024. For the full year, the cash dividend will approximate $1.6 billion, a year-over-year increase of 19%, 100%, which is expected towards from ordinary income given our expected strong operating performance.\nSo let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles.\n\nCharles J. Meyers\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Equinix, Inc.\n\nThanks, Keith. In closing, 2023 was a year of significant progress and focused execution against our ambitious agenda. While macro uncertainties persist, we anticipate continued economic recovery as we move through 2024 and believe this will continue to [ embolden ] customers to accelerate their digital transformation agendas with a keen focus on capturing business value through the extraordinary power of AI. Against this backdrop, demand for hybrid digital infrastructure should continue to grow, and we're confident that the character of this demand will increasingly align with the distinctive advantages of Equinix, offering customer flexibility to deploy architectures that are more distributed, more cloud connected, more on-demand and more ecosystem rich than ever before. Features that have positioned Equinix once again as a leader in IDC MarketScape's worldwide assessment of data center services.\nDigital transformation is reshaping the fabric of our world, unlocking extraordinary possibilities and changing the basis for competition in almost every industry. Thanks to our distinct and durable advantages, Equinix is well positioned to capture these opportunities. Through the combined balance sheet power of Equinix and our JV partners, we'll continue to invest in supporting the vigorous demand for large-scale cloud and AI infrastructure around the world. Simultaneously, we will leverage the reach and connectivity of the world's leading retail platform to ensure that Equinix remains the best manifestation of the digital edge and a critical point of [ Nexus ] for modern cloud-centric architectures. Reaffirming our purpose to be the platform where the world comes together, enabling the innovations that enrich our work, our life and our planet.\nSo let me stop there and open it up for questions."

Meyers\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Equinix, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chip. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call.\nDespite an increasingly complex macro environment, we delivered another solid quarter of results and continue to drive strong value creation, raising both our dividend and our AFFO per share outlook for the full year. While we continue to operate in an environment characterized by customer caution, this caution is balanced by a clear commitment to digital transformation and accelerating interest in AI and a growing reliance on Equinix as a critical partner in designing and implementing hybrid, multi-cloud and data-centric architectures.\nCustomers continue to see digital as a critical priority, and they remain focused on optimizing existing infrastructure spend and capabilities across cloud, network and other categories. Demand remains strong. New logo growth is accelerating, and we see a highly favorable pricing environment, allowing us to deliver higher MRR per cabinet yields driven by price, power density and strong interconnection demand. The net result is solid revenue growth, a strong forward pipeline and continued optimism about our differentiated ability to deliver compelling value to our customers and in turn, to our shareholders.\nIn Q3, our go-to-market engine continued to execute well with more than 4,200 deals in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers, including record new logos from high-value targeted customers. We saw solid performance across all aspects of our platform strategy with data center services, digital services and our xScale, all coming together to address the evolving demands of our customers and strong cross-regional bookings highlighting the power of our unmatched global reach.\nOn the AI front, we continue to cultivate and win significant opportunities across our existing customer base and with AI-specific prospects. A recent Gartner poll found 55% of organizations are in pilot or production mode with generative AI. We are seeing this manifest in accelerated interest from both enterprise customers and from emerging service providers looking to service this demand. We see strong similarities between the evolving AI demand and the multi-tiered architectures that have characterized the cloud build-out for the past 8 years. And believe that our broad portfolio of offerings in tandem with our key technology partners will allow us to capture high-value opportunities across the AI value chain along 3 key vectors.\nFirst, in our retail business, we will aggressively pursue magnetic AI service provider deployments to support on-ramps, inference nodes and smaller scale training needs. We are well positioned here with nearly 40% market share of the on-ramps to the major cloud service providers, key players in the AI ecosystem. And in Q3, we're proud to have been recognized at a 2023 Google Cloud Customer Awards winner for our work supporting Google AI technology. Key wins in this area for Q3 included Core Wheat, a specialized GPU cloud provider, deploying networking nodes at Equinix leveraging our unique multi-cloud on-ramps and network connectivity across multiple metros.\nAnd Lambda, selecting Platform Equinix to offer customers expanded regional connectivity, higher networking performance, security and scale for an enterprise-grade GPU cloud, dedicated to large language models and generative AI workloads.\nSecond, we intend to meaningfully augment our xScale portfolio, including in North America to pursue strategic large-scale AI training deployments with the top hyperscalers and other key AI ecosystem players, including the potential to serve highly targeted enterprise demand. We expect some builds will be tightly coupled with our retail campuses like our newly announced Silicon Valley 12x asset while other builds will be larger-scale campuses in locations with access to significant power capacity.\nAnd finally, in response to burgeoning enterprise AI demand, we will leverage our unique advantages to position Platform Equinix as the place where private AI happens, allowing customers to place compute resources in proximity to data and seamlessly leverage public cloud capabilities, all while maintaining control of high-value proprietary data. We also anticipate a dramatic acceleration in inference workloads and see Equinix as well positioned to deliver performance and economic benefits derived from our reach, network density and cloud adjacency.\nWhile still early, we're seeing broad-based demand for private AI from digital leaders with specific wins in the transportation, education, public sector and healthcare verticals, including Harrison.ai, a clinician-led healthcare artificial intelligence company that is dedicated to addressing the inequality and capacity limitations in our health care system, by developing AI-powered tools in radiology and pathology. An exciting opportunity that not only drives our business, but clearly aligns with Equinix values.\nAs AI demand accelerates, we are adapting our product portfolio and our physical platform in response to evolving customer requirements. In terms of data center design, we're using our co-innovation facility in Ashburn to evaluate technologies to support escalating power requirements and have already commercialized our early work in this area with liquid cooling solutions that are supportable in all markets, including support for direct-to-chip liquid cooling in 45 markets across all 3 regions. We are already supporting significant liquid cool deployments across our range of deployment sizes and densities and we look forward to sharing more with you on our progress in this space.\nTurning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q3 were $2.06 billion, up 14% year-over-year driven by strong recurring revenue growth and power price increases. Adjusted EBITDA was up 9% year-over-year, and AFFO per share was better than our expectations due to strong operating performance and timing of recurring CapEx spend. Interconnection revenues grew 9% year-over-year with continued strength from Equinix Fabric. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our data center services portfolio continues to perform well. Given the strong underlying demand for digital infrastructure and the long duration in delivering new capacity, a factor that continues to drive positive pricing trends, we're investing broadly across our global footprint. We currently have 56 major projects underway in 39 markets across 23 countries, including 14 xScale builds that will deliver more than 100 megawatts of capacity once opened.\nMore than 50% of our expansion capital is supporting capacity in our major metros where we have strong visibility to fill rates. Recurring revenues from customers deployed in more than 1 region stepped up 1% quarter-over-quarter to 77% as customers continue to move to more distributed architectures. On interconnection, we now have over 460,000 total interconnections with 4,200 net interconnections added in Q3 thanks to healthy gross adds, offset somewhat by continued grooming activity and consolidations into higher bandwidth connections.\nEquinix Fabric saw continued momentum with record port orders and significant growth in provision bandwidth, up 8% quarter-over-quarter to more than 200 terabits per second. Internet Exchange had another strong quarter in APAC with peak traffic in the region, surpassing the Americas for the first time. Globally, peak traffic was up 9% quarter-over-quarter and 27% year-over-year to nearly 35 terabits per second. Recent interconnection and ecosystem wins include Southern Cross, expanding their relationship with Equinix by deploying their SX NEXT subsea cable into our LA4 IBX to boost aggregate capacity on their U.S. to Australia and New Zealand network by 50%.\nAnd the Warsaw Stock Exchange, migrating their primary matching engine and trading system to Equinix' Warsaw 3 IBX to offer more capabilities and enhanced trading performance.\nWe continue to invest behind our platform strategy with revenue growth from our digital services portfolio significantly over-indexing relative to the broader business, including strong adoption of our network edge offering by enterprise customers. We're also seeing momentum in expanding our partnerships with leading technology companies, including the recent announcement of NetApp storage on Equinix Metal, which is an integrated full stack solution that provides enterprise customers low latency access to all clouds while keeping control of their data, a critical consideration for AI workloads.\nKey digital services wins this quarter included McGraw Hill, a leading educational publishing company, deploying virtual hubs using Network Edge across multiple markets to connect to key cloud providers via Equinix Fabric. And a significant win with a global gaming company using Equinix Metal to support a major new product launch. Our channel program delivered another strong quarter, amplifying the reach of our sales team and accounting for over 65% of new logos with wins across a wide range of industry segments focusing on digital transformation initiatives. We continue to see growth from partners like AT&T, Cisco, Dell and HPE.\nKey wins included a top 5 U.S. public school district seeking to modernize aging IT infrastructure while improving systems uptime and enhancing cybersecurity. This win executed with partners, Dell Technology Managed Services, Carasoft and ImpEx technologies, will deliver low latency, multi-cloud connectivity and secure network access to key ecosystem resources while lowering operational expenses.\nNow let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results from the quarter.\n\nKeith D. Taylor\n\nChief Financial Officer, Equinix, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are doing well.\nNow notwithstanding these complex and difficult times, we continue to remain bullish about our business and the opportunities ahead as we work hard to expand our strategic and preferential position in the marketplace. As you all know, 1 of the core tenets of our strategy revolves around long-term shareholder value creation. With that in mind, we continue to build capacity in markets that will enhance our platform positioning and differentiate our offerings into the future. Also, we continue to work diligently to maintain rigor with our pricing strategies while closely overseeing our spending decisions. As it relates to our capital structure, we've been able to maintain a highly advantaged balance sheet with ample liquidity and lower leverage. This gives us the flexibility to opportunistically access the capital markets under terms and conditions that are beneficial to us.\nIn addition, we're actively working to support other strategic operating goals, including how and where we source our supply chain, including energy costs, while increasing our investments in and around our future first sustainability initiatives, both highly important matters for our customers.\nLastly, we remain pleased with our efforts to manage our derivative risks, including our exposure to foreign currencies and interest rates.\nMoving on to the business. We continue to perform well. In Q3, we had solid gross and net bookings with strong customer demand. Our pricing dynamics are very positive. MRR churn is well within our targeted range. Also, given the tight supply environment across many of our metros, we and our customers continue to look for ways to optimize deployment, including increasing the power density of the cabinets sold. This drives improved bottom line profitability and higher return on invested capital. Global MRR per cabinet was up $57 quarter-over-quarter to $2,214 per cabinet, a 12% increase on our yield year-on-year on a constant currency basis.\nWith respect to our net cabinets billing metric, it remains flat compared to Q2, largely due to the meaningful increase in density of cabinet and the timing of bookings and churn at the end of the quarter. We have a solid backlog of booked but not yet installed cabinets and the depth of our pipeline and the related coverage ratios support an expected strong bookings performance to close out our year.\nNow let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Know that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q3 revenues were $2.061 billion, up 14% over the same quarter last year due to strong recurring revenue growth and power price increases. Nonrecurring revenues remained flat compared to the prior quarter. Although it was not before nonrecurring revenues, particularly those attributable to our xScale business are inherently lumpy, for Q4, our guide implies a meaningful step-up on nonrecurring revenues attributed to a number of deals expected to close across different markets this quarter.\nQ3 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $1 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $936 million or 45% of revenues, up 9% over the same quarter last year due to strong operating performance. Looking forward, our Q4 adjusted EBITDA is expected to remain roughly flat due to the timing of our spend and specific onetime costs attributed to corporate real estate activities. Q3 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, includes a $1 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and $2 million of integration costs.\nGlobal Q3 AFFO was $772 million, above our expectations due to strong business performance and timing of recurring CapEx spend. Q3 AFFO included minimal FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 MR turned step down to 2.2%, and we expect Q4 MR churn to remain consistent with our Q3 levels in the lower half of our 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range.\nTurning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized and constant currency basis, EMEA and APAC were our fastest-growing regions at 26% and 10%, respectively, followed by our Americas region at 7% year-over-year growth. The Americas region had a solid quarter across many of our key metros, and we experienced strong public sector activity. As it relates to AI, sales activity discussed in Charles' remarks, the vast majority of the demand is destined for Americas footprint. And as highlighted by Charles, this quarter, we won a mix of AI training, inference and networking deployments with the pipeline of anticipated deals to follow.\nOur EMEA business had a strong quarter led by our U.K. and Dutch markets and record digital services bookings. In EMEA, as highlighted previously, we continue to lean into our future first sustainability strategy, including implementing heat export initiatives into Frankfurt, Helsinki and Paris communities while supporting other innovative environmental initiatives to support many other communities and where we operate.\nAnd finally, the Asia Pacific region saw a solid performance led by our Hong Kong, India and Singapore markets. Capacity constraints exist across a number of our markets, particularly Singapore. These supply constraints will help drive strong deal discipline and pricing power in these markets. During 2024, we'll be opening new markets in India, Indonesia and Malaysia, expanding our APAC platform and ecosystems in pursuit of larger opportunities given the demand for digital infrastructure.\nAnd now looking at our capital structure. Please refer to Slide 8. Our net leverage remains low relative to our peers at 3.5x our annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our balance sheet increased slightly to approximately $31.7 billion including an unrestricted cash balance of over $2.3 billion. Our cash balance remained flat quarter-over-quarter as our strong operating cash flow and financing activity was offset by our investment in growth CapEx and the quarterly cash dividend.\nAs I've previously noted, we've been opportunistically looking to raise additional debt capital in reduced rate environments. To that end, in September, we raised $337 million of Swiss Franc denominated 5-year paper at an attractive 2.875% rate. Additionally, during the quarter, we executed an incremental $230 million of ATM forward equity sales, which we expect to settle alongside our Q2 ATM forward contract in late 2023. These financing transactions will help fund our 2024 growth initiatives, alongside other sources of capital while allowing us to maintain our strategic flexibility.\nAlso in September, we published our 2023 green bond allocation report. As highlighted in the report, we have now fully allocated the net proceeds from our green bonds aligning our financing efforts with our commitment to create a more environmentally friendly data center footprint.\nTurning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $618 million, including recurring CapEx of $52 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened 6 new retail projects, including 2 new data centers in Dubai and Montreal. We also purchased our Dublin 1 and Montreal 1 IBX assets and land for development in Manchester in Washington, D.C. Revenue from owned assets were 64% of recurring revenues for the quarter.\nOur capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 174 stabilized assets increased revenues by 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Our stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generated a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested.\nAnd finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2023 guidance and bridges. Do note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis.\nFor the full year 2023, we're maintaining our underlying revenue outlook with expected top line growth of 14% to 15% or approximately 9% growth, excluding the impact of power costs passed through to our customers, a reflection of our continued strong execution. We are raising our underlying 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $17 million due to favorable operating costs and lower integration spend and we're raising our underlying AFFO guidance by $27 million to now grow between 12% and 14% compared to the previous year. AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 10% and 11%. CapEx is expected to remain in the $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion range, including approximately $215 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend, which we expect to be reimbursed for when these assets are transferred to JVs early next year and about $225 million of recurring CapEx spend, an increase over the prior quarter as we accelerate costs into Q4.\nLastly, given our strong operating performance and our historically low AFFO payout ratio, we've accelerated the timing of our cash dividend increase into Q4 of this year from Q1 of next year. As a result, the quarterly cash dividend will increase by 25% to $4.26 per share this quarter. Looking forward, we expect our annual cash dividend growth rate will track at or above our AFFO per share growth rate for a number of years.\nSo let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles.\n\nCharles J. Meyers\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Equinix, Inc.\n\nThanks, Keith. In closing, we continue to see strong demand as customers embrace AI and advance their digital transformation agendas with infrastructure that is more distributed, more cloud connected and more ecosystem enabled than ever before. Despite a variety of cross currents in the business, we are translating healthy bookings growth, a favorable pricing environment and increasing power densities into strong increases in cabinet yield. These dynamics, combined with the continued focus on driving operating leverage and expense discipline through the business, are allowing us to deliver compelling value on a per share basis.\nAs we close out '23 and look towards 2024, our forward-looking strategy and vision for our platform will enable us to amplify our unique strengths, leveraging them to expand our market opportunity and drive sustainable growth in a rapidly evolving landscape. We remain optimistic about the road ahead and steadfast in our commitment to show up every day in service too, starting with the resolve to align, inspire and empower our teams around our strategy and our mission, enabling them to deliver durable value and meaningful impact to our customers, our shareholders and the communities in which we operate.\nSo let me stop there and open it up for questions."

Thank you, sir. You may begin.\n\nChip Newcom\n\nDirector, Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that some of the statements that we will be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we've identified in today's press release and those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed February 17, 2023, and 10-Q filed May 5, 2023. Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition, in light of regulatory disclosure, it is Equinix's policy not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure.\nIn addition, we will provide non-GAAP measures on today's conference call. We provide a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a list of the reasons why the company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix Investor Relations page at www.equinix.com.

Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in 1 hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to one.\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\n\nCharles J. Meyers\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Equinix, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chip. Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As reflected in our results, Equinix continues to enjoy momentum in our business as digital transformation accelerates the pace of innovation and changes the way business is done. By 2026, IDC is forecasting that 40% of revenue from G2000 companies will come from digital products, services and experiences, a dynamic that is reshaping the basis of competition in nearly every industry and making digital an unprecedented force for economic growth. These secular drivers, combined with an accelerating appetite for companies to rapidly integrate AI into their operations are driving increased demand for data center capacity as a broad range of service providers extend and scale their global infrastructure to support the clear enterprise commitment to hybrid and multicloud as the IT architecture of choice. .\nEquinix remains exceptionally well positioned to respond to this demand environment, delivering against the need for infrastructure that is more distributed, more cloud connected, more sustainable and more ecosystem-centric than ever before. Against this backdrop, we had a great second quarter with solid gross and net bookings, very strong pricing dynamics, excellent pipeline conversion and healthy new logo growth. We continue to drive disciplined sales execution at scale with more than 4,100 deals in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers, demonstrating the continued strength of our unmatched go-to-market machine and approach.\nTurning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q2 were $2.02 billion, up 14% year-over-year driven by strong recurring revenue growth, power price increases and timing of ex-scale fees. Adjusted EBITDA was up 7% year-over-year, and AFFO was again better than our expectations due to strong operating performance. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. With customers deployed in all 3 regions now representing approximately 2/3 of our recurring revenues, we continue to invest behind the scale and reach of our data center services portfolio. We now have 53 major projects underway across 40 metros in 24 countries, including 11 next scale builds that we expect will deliver approximately 90 megawatts of capacity once opened.\nThis quarter, we added 12 new projects, including new data center builds in Lisbon, Monterrey, Mumbai and our first build in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Over the past several years, we have seen Malaysia emerge as an increasingly important location for digital infrastructure. By expanding Platform Equinix in Johor and Kuala Lumpur, the 2 most strategic markets in Malaysia, we will enable local and global businesses to leverage our trusted platform to bring together and interconnect the foundational digital infrastructure that will power their success. Additionally, we are delighted with the recently announced results of Singapore's data center call for application, where Equinix was 1 of a very limited set of participants selected to build incremental data center capacity in the critical Singaporean market.\nEquinix is honored to have this opportunity to strengthen Singapore's digital capabilities, delivering sustainable infrastructure that will fuel the economy, cultivate critical ecosystems and aligned to Singapore's green plan. Multi-region customer wins this quarter included Cogent Communications, a U.S. multinational ISP using Equinix's robust ecosystem and interconnection platform to optimize and enhance their global services and [indiscernible] a provider of software-defined cloud optimized networks for digitally transforming global enterprises as they leverage Equinix Fabric and other digital services for low-latency network and cloud connectivity.\nOur global interconnection franchise continues to thrive with over 456,000 total interconnections on our platform. In Q2, interconnection revenue stepped up 11% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by healthy pricing, increasing traffic levels and strong gross adds. Net interconnection adds remain on the lower side at 4,100 due to continued grooming activity and consolidation into higher bandwidth connections, but the number of unique interconnection relationships across our platform continues to expand with over 110,000 unique pairs, reflecting the exceptional value of our scaled digital ecosystems.\nEquinix Fabric had another strong quarter with total virtual connections passing 50,000 for the first time and the addition of new capabilities to support data-intensive workloads like AI and cloud migration. Beginning in the third quarter, Fabric customers will be able to provision virtual connections to cloud providers with bandwidth up to 50 gig per second with Google Cloud as the first cloud partner to support this capability. Internet exchange saw strength in our EMEA and APAC markets with peak traffic up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 25% year-over-year to nearly 32 terabits per second.\nKey interconnection customer wins this quarter included a gaming and entertainment company, expanding interconnection across all 3 regions to optimize the gamer experience and Pier 1 a Brazilian telco leveraging Platform Equinix to establish its digital presence through network hubs, beginning with South America and Miami.\nTurning to our xScale portfolio. We continue to see strong overall demand as cloud adoption remains a driving force in digital transformation. In Q2, we leased 10 megawatts of capacity in our Osaka 2 asset with cumulative ex-scale leasing now over 200 megawatts globally, and we have a strong funnel of additional scale opportunities for the back half of the year. We also won 3 new native cloud on-ramps this quarter in Bogota, Madrid and Toronto, further strengthening our cloud ecosystem, which represents nearly 15% of total interconnection on our platform. Key enterprise to cloud ecosystem wins this quarter, including 1 of the largest auto insurers in the U.S., continuing to expand interconnections on our platform to optimize its networks and multi-cloud connectivity and a leading European automotive company deploying at Equinix to support reliable and scalable connectivity to the cloud worldwide.\nAs businesses increasingly look to consume their digital infrastructure at software speed, we're continuing to enhance our platform strategy and expand our partnerships. In Q2, we announced our expanded partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise for pre-provisioned HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise and HPE GreenLake for private cloud business addition, both available on demand at select Equinix IBX data centers. These new offerings in 7 metros around the globe will help businesses expand their hybrid multi-cloud strategies, while providing greater agility, control and predictability of workload costs and data. Additional key digital services wins this quarter included BioNexo to Brazil, a health tech company that offers digital solutions for managing health care processes, using fabric and network edge for seamless connections with partners and customers, while reducing complexity and cost. Antenna, a global mobile network infrastructure provider using Platform Equinix to facilitate its marketplace for cellular connectivity among its customers. Our channel program delivered another strong quarter, accounting for 40% of bookings and nearly 60% of new logos.\nWe continue to see growth from partners like Accenture, Avant, Dell, SICO and HPE with wins across a wide range of industry verticals and digital use cases. Key wins this quarter included partnering with Kindrel to support a large American health insurance provider with their network and application modernization efforts, featuring the deployment of cloud adjacent infrastructure and interconnection to the health care ecosystem.\nNow let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter.\n\nKeith D. Taylor\n\nChief Financial Officer, Equinix, Inc.\n\nThanks, Charles, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you're all doing well and enjoying the summer months. I must say it was great to be back in New York City spending time with many of you at our June Analyst Day in person. As you might have guessed, we were excited to share with you our views on the expanding market opportunity. Our continued ability to manage through this dynamic and complex global environment, while working to maximize the value of our business. And perhaps, most importantly, share our thoughts on how we believe we can deliver durable shareholder value. Now as you can see from our Q2 earnings report, we again delivered solid results, while addressing many of the complexities affecting our business. We had solid gross and net bookings and positive pricing dynamics reflecting the continued momentum we see in the market. Overall, we continue to focus on driving a higher yield on both our new and existing investments.\nOn a constant currency basis, including our net positive pricing actions, Global MRR per cabinet was up $39 quarter-over-quarter to $21.56 per cabinet. Now given the tight supply environment across many of our metros and the high utilization levels across our portfolio, we remain very focused on our strategy of putting the right customer with the right application into the right IBX. Also, we're being particularly selective at backfilling space in certain constrained markets, focusing on high price points and increased power densities. As a result, the timing of these deployments may create some fluctuations in our quarterly net cabinet billing metric, an outcome we're actively managing across all 3 regions. This is positively offset by strong stabilized asset growth, higher MRR per cabinet and better returns on our invested capital.\nTurning to some of the macro factors affecting our business. We remain pleased with how the organization has mitigated the impacts of energy price volatility across our business and with our customers. Concessions and distributes remain low and our cash collections are in line with historical trends. As it relates to our foreign operating currencies, we continue to hedge where appropriate to dampen the volatility attributed to the actions of many central banks to adjust interest rates. Also, we made some modest FX to our 2023 outlook, largely attributable to the recent devaluation of the Nigerian Naira and the weaker Japanese yen, 2 of the currencies that we do not hedge.\nNow let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Note that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $2.018 billion, up 14% over the same quarter last year due to strong recurring revenues, power price increases and the timing of ex-scale nonrecurring fees. As we've noted before, nonrecurring revenues, particularly those attributable to our xScale business and certain custom installation works are inherently lumpy. Hence, NRR was down quarter-over-quarter as planned. But given our significant scale pipeline, we expect to see a meaningful step-up in NRR in the second half of the year. Q2 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $3 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates.\nGlobal Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $901 million or 45% of revenues, up 7% over the same quarter last year due to strong operating performance, including an $11 million one-off software expense related to our Americas managed services business and higher variable salaries and benefit costs. Also, Q2 saw certain EMEA energy contracts reset at higher average rates resulting in increased net utility costs as forecasted. Q2 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges included a $2 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and $3 million of integration costs.\nGlobal Q2 AFFO was $754 million, above our expectation due to strong business performance and lower net interest expense. Q2 AFFO included a $1 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q2 MR churn was 2.3%. For the full year, we continue to expect MR churn to average at the lower half of our 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7.\nOn a year-over-year normalized and constant currency basis, EMEA and APAC were our fastest-growing regions at 21% and 16%, respectively. Although when excluding the impact of the benefit attributed to the power price increases, EMEA and APAC region growth rates were 8% and 11%, respectively, while the Americas region grew 7% year-over-year. The Americas region had another solid quarter with continued strong pricing trends, solid momentum from our channel and public sector teams and healthy exports across the global platform. We had strong activity in Boston, Chicago and call paper metros and the Canadian business.\nOur EMEA business delivered a solid quarter with firm pricing, continued lower churn and a healthy step-up in deal volume. Revenue was down slightly due to the timing of large NRR deals between quarters. We had strength come from our Amsterdam, Dublin and Frankfurt metros, while booking a substantial space and power deal in Lagos, Nigeria with a large multinational energy company, highlighting the momentum across our platform, including our main 1 assets. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a strong quarter with record net bookings and firm deal pricing as well as strong imports to our Mumbai, Osaka and Singapore markets. And as evidenced by the number of new expansions, Chennai, Jakarta, Johor, Kuala Lumpur, customer interest in expanding their footprint into new Asian markets is high, and we're investing behind this demand.\nAnd now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased slightly to approximately $31.6 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of over $2.3 billion. As expected, our cash balance decreased slightly quarter-over-quarter due to our investment in growth CapEx and a quarterly cash dividend, offset by our strong operating cash flows. Our net leverage remains low at 3.6x our annualized adjusted EBITDA. And as mentioned previously, we plan to opportunistically raise additional debt capital and reduce rate environments where we currently operate. This will create both incremental debt capital to fund our growth and placed a natural hedge into these markets.\nAdditionally, during the quarter, we executed about $200 million of ATM forward sale transactions, which will be settled in early 2024 to help fund our 2024 growth plans alongside our other sources of capital.\nTurning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $638 million, including a recurring CapEx of $40 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened 7 retail projects across both the Americas and EMEA regions and 2 xScale projects in Frankfurt and Tokyo. Revenue from owned assets increased to 64% of our recurring revenues for the quarter. We expect this trend to continue with over 85% of our expansion CapEx spend on owned or long-term ground lease properties, including 100% of our 16 bills in the Americas.\nOur capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our now 174 stabilized assets increased revenues by 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Taking out the benefit attributed to the power price increases, stabilized assets increased 7% year-over-year. Our stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested.\nAnd finally, please to refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2023 guidance and bridges. Do not all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year 2023, we're maintaining our underlying revenue outlook with expected top line growth of 14% to 15% or 9% to 10%, excluding the impact of par cost pass-through to our customers, a reflection of our continued strong execution. We're raising our underlying 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $20 million, primarily due to favorable operating costs and lower integration spend. and we're raising our underlying AFFO guidance by $28 million to now grow between 11% and 14% compared to the previous year. AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 9% and 11%.\nCapEx is expected to range between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, including approximately $120 million of on balance sheet xScale spend, which we expect to be reimbursed as we transfer assets into the JV later this year or early next year and about $220 million of recurring CapEx spend.\nSo let me stop here, and I'll turn the call back to Charles.\n\nCharles J. Meyers\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Equinix, Inc.\n\nThanks, Keith. In closing, we had a strong first half of the year and continue to see a robust demand environment as key secular drivers positively influence buying behavior even in the face of a challenging macro climate. The relevance of Platform Equinix continues to grow as service providers scale out their global infrastructure in response to growing enterprise demand for hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice and the associated need for hybrid infrastructure to deliver performance, agility, scalability and sustainability. In this context, we believe Equinix remains uniquely positioned and highly differentiated and will continue to drive disciplined execution of our strategy with a focus on extending our market leadership, driving operating leverage, expanding our platform capabilities to fuel sustained growth and delivering superior returns on capital, all of which we are confident will translate to distinctive and durable value for our customers, and sustained performance for you, our investors, with a keen focus on AFFO per share as our lighthouse metric.\nSo let me stop there and open it up for questions."

Welcome to the Equinix First Quarter Earnings Conference Call.\n[Operator Instructions]\nAlso today's call is being recorded.\n[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Chip Newcom, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin.\n\nChip Newcom\n\nDirector, Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that some of the statements that we will be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we've identified in today's press release and those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed February 17, 2023.\nThe Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition, in light of Regulation Fair Disclosure, it is Equinix's policy not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure.\nIn addition, we will provide non-GAAP measures on today's conference call. We provide a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a list of the reasons why the company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix Investor Relations page at www.equinix.com. We've made available on the IR page of our website a presentation designed to accompany this discussion, along with certain supplemental financial information and other data. We would also like to remind you that we post important information about Equinix on the IR page from time to time and encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current available information. With us today are Charles Meyers, Equinix's CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in 1 hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\n\nCharles J. Meyers\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Equinix, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chip. Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call.\nWe had a strong start to the year, delivering quarterly revenues right at $2 billion with adjusted EBITDA and AFFO above the top end of our expectations. Despite a challenging macro environment, customers remain committed to their digital transformation journeys, driving 4,000 deals in the quarter across more than 3,000 customers, highlighting the scale and diversity of our go-to-market engine and the broad-based demand that continues to propel the business. We continue to see enterprises and service providers build out their IT infrastructure on Platform Equinix. And that infrastructure is more distributed, more cloud connected and more hybrid than ever before.\nAnd while some customers are appropriately cautious about the timing of their investments given macro conditions, Equinix continues to be a critical partner in their efforts to advance hybrid architectures, unlock digital performance gains and optimize cloud and network spend. As a result, our deal win rates remain steady compared to historical trends, and we continue to see a robust pricing environment across all 3 regions.\nTurning to power. We're very pleased with how the organization has navigated a volatile energy market and we remain in a strong position, significantly mitigating the impacts of this volatility for our business and for our customers. As previously discussed, we raised pricing in January to more than 7,000 customers across 16 countries, generating approximately $90 million of incremental revenue in the quarter, fully offsetting the impact of higher power costs. Thanks to timely and transparent communications, concessions and disputes are low and our days of sales outstanding remain in line with historical trends.\nOn the sustainability front, we are committed to responsible growth and continue to advance our bold future first sustainability agenda. Sustainability is increasingly becoming a board-level issue and Gartner estimates that by 2026, 75% of organizations will seek to increase business with IT vendors that have demonstrable sustainability goals and timelines, and we'll seek to replace those who don't.\nWe recently published our eighth annual CSR report. And in 2022, we extended our industry leadership with 96% renewable energy coverage, making our fifth consecutive year with over 90% coverage. We're also progressing well on our science-based targets with a 23% reduction in operational emissions across Scope 1 and Scope 2 from our 2019 baseline.\nAdditionally, Equinix continues to evolve its power procurement portfolio to increase the quality of its renewable energy purchases. This year, we signed new long-term power purchase agreements for solar projects in Spain totaling 345 megawatts of capacity, bringing Equinix's contracted renewable energy PPA portfolio to 715 megawatts globally once fully operational.\nLooking forward, where feasible, we'll continue to prioritize projects that create new sources of clean energy directly in the grids where we operate and support a healthy renewable energy coverage mix.\nTurning to our results. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q1 were $2 billion, up 16% year-over-year, driven by strong recurring revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA was up 18% year-over-year, and AFFO was better than our expectations due to strong operating performance. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our unmatched scale and reach continues to differentiate our data center services portfolio and the tremendous strength of our balance sheet positions us to sustain our investment in new capacity to support a robust demand environment. We currently have 50 major projects underway across 37 metros in 25 countries, including 10x scale projects that will deliver more than 90 megawatts of capacity once opened.\nThis quarter, we added new data center builds in Lagos, Frankfurt and Rio de Janeiro. Revenues from multi-region and 3 region customers increased 1% quarter-over-quarter to an impressive 76% and 65%, respectively. Key multi-region wins in the quarter included a Fortune 500 manufacturing conglomerate, expanding its Performance Hub deployments across all 3 regions to assist with a business unit divestiture and in Cloud Native Zero Trust cybersecurity company using Equinix Metal to expand its business across all 3 regions. Our platform remains the logical point of Nexus for hybrid and multi-cloud deployments and hyperscalers continue to look to Equinix as a critical infrastructure provider and a valued go-to-market partner.\nThis quarter, we won 5 new cloud on-ramps across Milan, Mumbai, [indiscernible], Tokyo and Warsaw as we continue to enjoy a strong leadership position in multi-cloud connectivity compared to our closest competitors. We're also seeing the unique breadth of our product portfolio across retail colo, interconnection services, ex scale and digital services resonate strongly with customers as they embrace rapidly emerging opportunities in AI. We've closed several key AI wins over the past few quarters and are seeing a growing pipeline of new opportunities directly and with key partners for both training and inference use cases that benefit from the unique performance characteristics and multi-cloud proximity of our platform.\nIn our [indiscernible] portfolio, we continue to see strong overall demand. In Q1, we pre-leased our entire Frankfurt 16 asset, representing 14 megawatts of capacity, taking us to over 75% leased or pre-leased across our nearly 260 megawatts of operational and announced xScale facilities. And we have a strong funnel of additional scale opportunities in the coming quarters. Enterprise to cloud wins this quarter included a leading consumer products company, leveraging Equinix's robust ecosystems for their private multi-cloud connectivity needs and the Hearst Corporation, a diversified media company deploying on Platform Equinix to execute its cloud-first strategy, including the deployment of Network Edge for their network aggregation.\nTurning to our industry-leading interconnection business. We now have over 452,000 total interconnections on our platform. In Q1, interconnection revenue stepped up 12% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. and we added an incremental 5,300 interconnections for the quarter. We saw some continued driving activity and consolidation into higher bandwidth VCs on fabric, but both moderated from the prior quarter, while gross adds remain strong, pricing is firm and the diversity of our customer interconnection continues to expand. As global data volumes continue to accelerate, Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 26% year-over-year to greater than 30 terabits per second for the first time. And as enterprises continue to embrace hybrid and multi-cloud as their architecture of choice, they are increasingly seeking the security, performance and convenience of Equinix Fabric, to connect to their choice of cloud and IT services across the broader digital ecosystem. One example is Cisco, whose multiple edge delivered services now rank among the leading end destinations on fabric. Customer wins included Kaisa, Brazil's federal financial services company, partnering with Equinix to accelerate its business by optimizing and securing its network core via fabric. We also continue to enhance our platform with our digital services portfolio and saw strong new user growth for our Equinix Metal offering as we cultivate product-like growth.\nWins this quarter included a Japanese video game company, utilizing Equinix Metal in all 3 regions to support a new product launch and Restack, an Australian SaaS integrator and managed services provider, utilizing Equinix Fabric and our edge services to optimize their solution offerings. Our channel program delivered another strong quarter, accounting for roughly 35% of bookings and 60% of new logos. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and digital first use cases with strong engagement across the hyperscalers and continued momentum with partners like AT&T, Dell, Cisco, HPE, Orange Business and Zenlayer. Key wins included a digital modernization win with Intel, our largest local partner in Chile.\nOn behalf of Impressa Nationale de Petroleo, a Chilean oil and gas company. Entel is delivering a fully managed SD-WAN solution based upon Cisco technology while leveraging Equinix data center and interconnection services, demonstrating how local partners can help deliver value to clients in new Equinix markets.\nNow let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter.\n\nKeith D. Taylor\n\nChief Financial Officer, Equinix, Inc.\n\nThanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone.\nAs highlighted by Charles, we had an outstanding start to the year. As you can see from our financial results, the team delivered on multiple fronts in the quarter with record net bookings, including power price increases. Excluding those power price increases, our net bookings performance was solid. The result of again, net positive pricing actions across each of our regions and lower MRR churn. Global MR per cabinet yield increased by $124 per cabinet on an as-reported basis or about $27 per cabinet adjusting for prior price increases and other one-offs. And as we highlighted on the last earnings call, we completed our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet, raising both debt and equity in the quarter and remain well funded to meet our future growth expectations.\nNow as you would expect, despite the continued strength of our business, we remain highly focused on the broader market dynamics. But as we've stated before, during periods of disruption, Equinix thrives, given our high-quality and diverse set of customers, who view Equinix as a mission-critical partner to place their ecosystem-driven digital infrastructure, whether it be a cloud on-ramp, a networking node, a cable landing station or a trading platform. As you remember, our quarterly bookings come from those existing customers as they expand their current environment or maybe move to more markets or simply buy more services.\nFinally, our strong liquidity position, low dividend to AFFO payout ratio and reduced debt leverage allows us to continue to invest to extend our product portfolio and expand our global footprint in both cases driving top line growth. Simply put, we're in a strong, fully funded financial position, allowing us to meet all of our capital needs while maintaining the strategic and operational flexibility we need to grow and scale the business.\nNow let me cover the highlights from the quarter, note that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis.\nAs depicted on Slide 4, our global Q1 revenues were $1.998 billion, up 16% over the same quarter last year and above the top end of our guidance range due to strong recurring revenues and the timing of xScale nonrecurring fees. As we've noted before, nonrecurring revenues, particularly those revenues attributed to our xScale business and custom installation works are inherently lumpy. And given the momentum we're seeing in our xScale business across all 3 regions, nonrecurring revenues could fluctuate meaningfully over the next 3 quarters of the year. Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $2 million tailwind when compared to our prior guidance rates due to a weaker U.S. dollar in the quarter. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $944 million or 47% of our revenues, up 18% over the same quarter last year and again above the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance, including flat quarter-over-quarter SG&A spend.\nAs expected, Q1 adjusted EBITDA benefited from lower seasonal power consumption and favorable energy hedge rates, which will reset higher starting in Q2 as anticipated, resulting in increased net utility spend over the next 3 quarters of the year. Q1 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges included a $2 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates and $5 million of integration costs.\nGlobal Q1 AFFO was $802 million, above our expectations due to strong business performance, including lower net interest expense and income taxes. As expected, we had seasonally lower recurring CapEx spend consistent with prior years. Q1 FFO included a $2 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 MR term was 2%, a continued reflection of our disciplined sales strategy. For the full year, we expect MRR churn to average at the low end of 2% to 2.5% of our quarterly range.\nTurning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized basis, EMEA was our fastest-growing region at 28% due to our significant power increases. Excluding the benefit attributed to those price increases, EMEA growth was 14%. Our APAC and Americas region growth rates were 15% and 9%, respectively. The Americas region had another solid quarter with strong performance from our public sector team and continued favorable pricing trends. We saw strong momentum in our Chicago, [indiscernible], Seattle metros and a Brazilian business. Our EMEA business delivered a great quarter, successfully executing on our price increase program while also seeing lower-than-expected MRR churn.\nIn the quarter, we saw bookings strength in our Amsterdam, Dublin and Manchester metros. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a solid quarter led by our Mumbai, Tokyo and Singapore markets with strong new logo additions and firm pricing. Now while Singapore remains capacity constrained as part of our IBX optimization efforts, we continue to proactively negotiate with certain customers with larger deployments to recover capacity which we anticipate to be backfilled at much higher rates, although it could affect our in-quarter MRR churn and net CapEx billing metric.\nAnd now looking at the capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased to approximately $31.3 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of $2.6 billion. Our cash balance increased quarter-over-quarter due to strong operating cash flow while we also raised approximately $580 million of yen-denominated debt and closed at the prior year's forward sales from our ATM program. Our net leverage remains low at 3.4x our adjusted EBITDA with 96% of our outstanding debt being fixed with no near-term maturities.\nGiven the global nature of our business, we continue to look to raise additional debt capital and reduce rate countries where we intend to expand, creating both incremental debt capital to fund our growth and placing natural hedges into these markets.\nTurning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $530 million, including seasonally lower recurring CapEx of $22 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened 4 retail projects in Frankfurt, Paris, Singapore and Sydney. We also purchased land for development in Calgary and Madrid. Revenues from owned assets were 63% of our recurring revenues for the quarter.\nOur capital investments delivered strong returns, as shown on Slide 10, are now 171 stabilized assets increased revenues by 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Taking out the benefit attributed to power price increases, stabilized assets increased 7% year-over-year. Consistent with prior years, in Q1, we completed the annual refresh of our IBX categorization exercise. Our stabilized asset count increased by a net 13 IBXs. Now stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested.\nAnd finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2023 guidance and bridges. Do note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year, we're raising our revenue guidance by $30 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $20 million, primarily due to favorable FX rates and lower integration costs. This guidance implies a revenue growth rate of 14% to 15%, inclusive of power price increases or 9% to 10%, excluding the power cost pass-through and adjusted EBITDA margins of 45%, excluding integration costs. We now expect to incur $33 million of integration costs in 2023. And we're raising 2023 [ AFFO ] guidance by $44 million to now grow between 10% and 13% compared to the previous year, and AFFO per share is now expected to grow 8% to 11%. 2023 CapEx is expected to range between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, including approximately $150 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend, which we expect to be reimbursed as we transfer assets into the JVs of about $205 million of recurring CapEx spend.\nSo let me stop here. I'm going to turn the call back to Charles.\n\nCharles J. Meyers\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Equinix, Inc.\n\nThanks, Keith. In closing, we had a solid start to the year. While we remain vigilant to the challenges in the broader macro economy. Our Q1 results were strong and our outlook remains positive with the overall demand for digital transformation, fueling our conviction around the long-term secular drivers of our business. We look forward to our upcoming Analyst Day in June where we will further outline the significant opportunity ahead and discuss our strongly differentiated position in capturing this opportunity as we enable our customers to access all the right places, partners and possibilities. We also look forward to diving more deeply into our evolving platform capabilities, our industry-leading go-to-market engine and sharing expectations of how all of this will translate into durable and differentiated value creation for our investors, our customers and the communities in which we operate. So let me stop there and open it up for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Also, today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I'd now like to turn the call over to Chip Newcom, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nChip Newcom\n\nDirector, IR, Equinix, Inc. (REIT)\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we have identified in today's press release and those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed February 18, 2022, and 10-Q filed November 4, 2022.

Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\n\nCharles J. Meyers\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Equinix, Inc. (REIT)\n\nThank you, Chip. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We had a great finish to 2022, delivering one of the best bookings performances in our history, led by the Americas with continued strength in demand and favorable pricing trends across all 3 regions. For the full year, we delivered more than $7 billion in revenue for the first time and completed our 80th consecutive quarter of revenue growth, an amazing 20 years of continuous growth. All while driving AFFO per share performance above the top end of our long-term expectations.\nAs we look to the year ahead, even amidst a dynamic and complex global landscape, it's increasingly clear that the secular tailwinds of digital transformation remain strong. In 2023, IDC estimates spending on digital technology by organizations will grow 8x faster than the broader economy. In the current macroeconomic environment, we believe spending on digital transformation will remain robust for 2 simple reasons. First, as companies work harder for each incremental revenue dollar, digital is seen as a critical driver of competitive differentiation, accelerating time to market and enabling product set evolution. And second, digital transformation is increasingly a means to do more with less, enabling businesses to reduce costs and drive operating leverage while simultaneously becoming more agile and responsive in serving their customers.\nIn the context of this secular demand environment, we remain confident that Platform Equinix is uniquely positioned to support our customers' digital infrastructure needs. Digital leaders are demanding infrastructure that is more distributed, more ecosystem-powered, more flexible and more interconnected because it is fundamental to their ability to differentiate in the marketplace and lower their costs.\nOur market-leading global reach, vibrant digital ecosystems and comprehensive interconnection platform allow our customers to scale with agility, speed to launch of digital services, deliver world-class experiences and enhance value to all their stakeholders. While we will continue to closely monitor the macro environment and we'll adapt our execution accordingly, the fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we're investing behind the momentum we're seeing, including adding quota-bearing heads, evolving our product set and expanding our industry-leading data center portfolio.\nWith regards to power, our multiyear hedging efforts continue to create visibility and predictability for Equinix and our customers in the coming year. Effective January 1, we raised pricing, passing on the full impact of these additional power costs to our customers, increasing costs but giving our customers much needed budget certainty and, in most cases, leaving them with rates below the prevailing spot market. Overall, we believe we remain in a good position relative to competitors and the broader market, and I'm pleased with where we landed for our customers and our business.\nTurning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3. Revenues for the full year were $7.3 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 8% year-over-year and AFFO per share grew 11% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our data center services portfolio continues to extend its scale and reach. And given strong demand and high utilization, we see continued opportunity to deliver highly attractive returns on capital, as evidenced by the largest development pipeline in our history.\nWe currently have 49 major projects underway across 35 metros in 23 countries, including 9 xScale projects representing over 34,000 cabinets of retail and over 75 megawatts of xScale capacity. New projects this quarter include new data center builds in Istanbul, Seoul and Tokyo, and our first builds in both Johannesburg, South Africa and Johor, Malaysia. Our new IBX in Johannesburg augments our current footprint in Africa, entering the largest and most digitally developed nation on the continent. And our new IBX in Johor represents our entry into one of the most requested markets in Asia Pacific by our global customers.\nEquinix remains the best manifestation of the interconnected digital edge. And with these new builds, our unparalleled global footprint will span 75 metros and 35 countries. The strength of our global platform continues to shine, with nearly 90% of our revenue coming from customers operating in multiple metros and nearly 2/3 coming from customers operating in all 3 regions. Key multi-market wins this quarter included one of the world's leading hospitality companies, finding performance gains at the edge by deploying in strategic markets across all 3 regions; and a leading cloud and CDN provider extending coverage and scaling globally to support new services and meet growing demand.\nIDC estimates that more than 750 million cloud-native applications will be developed globally by 2025. And as this digital transformation wave continues, customers see Equinix as the logical point of nexus for hybrid and multi-cloud deployments. This quarter, we won 4 new cloud on-ramps, including 1 in Mumbai, making it the 12th metro on Platform Equinix enabled with native cloud on-ramps from all 5 of the leading cloud providers. No other data center operator has more than 1 metro with all 5 clouds.\nIn our xScale business, we continue to see strong overall demand, leasing approximately 8 megawatts of capacity across our Tokyo 12 and Osaka 2 assets with meaningful expansions in our forward pipeline. Enterprise wins leveraging the cloud this quarter include a global technology company in the payments industry, deploying infrastructure to place their corporate and customer networks closer to AWS and Azure; and a leading paints and coatings company choosing Equinix for its cloud on-ramp capabilities and virtualized service offerings.\nOur industry-leading interconnection franchise continues to perform well with revenues for the quarter growing 13% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, outpacing the broader business. We now have over 446,000 total interconnections on our platform. In Q4, we added an incremental 4,500 organic interconnections, slightly lower than our historical run rate due to seasonally slower gross adds, customer consolidations into higher bandwidth BCs on fabric and some elevated grooming activity. Equinix Fabric saw continued growth and is now operating at a $200 million revenue run rate, one of our fastest-growing products. Attach rates for Fabric continue to move higher with 40% of customers realizing the benefits of connecting their digital infrastructure at software speed.\nInternet Exchange saw peak traffic jump 7% quarter-over-quarter and 28% year-over-year to greater than 29 terabits per second, driven by FIFA World Cup streaming demand and reflecting the continued strategic importance of having the world's largest Internet exchange footprint on Platform Equinix. Key interconnection wins this quarter included one of Korea's largest conglomerates, establishing interconnection in Seoul for SJC2, the Southeast Asia-Japan Cable, which will be ready for service this year, and the largest water authority in the Netherlands, implementing Equinix Fabric to directly and securely connect to distributed infrastructure and digital ecosystems to ensure a clean water supply.\nTurning to our digital services portfolio. We saw continued momentum with Equinix Metal and Network Edge, driving attractive pull-through to Fabric. Digital services wins this quarter included a leading insurance and financial services company evolving their internal systems from their own data center to a public cloud plus Metal approach at Equinix; and a Belgian advertising service provider using Equinix Metal for fast, efficient, reliable data movement to support localized online advertising.\nAnd our channel program delivered its seventh consecutive record quarter, accounting for nearly 40% of bookings and nearly 60% of new logos. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and digital first-use cases with hybrid multicloud as the clear architecture of choice. We saw continued strength from partners like AT&T, Avant, Cisco, HPE and Microsoft. Key wins included delivering a critical time-sensitive site migration for a multinational banking and financial services client in partnership with Options IT and Dell, leveraging a combination of Equinix Metal, Network Edge and Fabric to overcome supply chain delays and ensure continuity of operations while interconnecting to critical trading platforms.\nSo let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results from the quarter.\n\nKeith D. Taylor\n\nCFO, Equinix, Inc. (REIT)\n\nThank you, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. To start, we had a great end to the year, finishing Q4 with healthy bookings, strong pricing, which included a nice uplift in MRR per cabinet in each of our regions and a solid forward-looking demand pipeline. We closed over 17,000 deals across more than 6,000 customers in 2022, and no single customer represents more than 3% of our MRR, highlighting the tremendous scale, reach and diversity of our go-to-market engine that continues to produce despite volatile and shifting macro conditions.\nGiven the weaker U.S. dollar relative to our prior guidance rates, FX has shifted from a meaningful headwind to a tailwind, which is positive, although 2023 exchange rates still remain below the average FX rates for 2022. And while we continue to remain vigilant to the challenges in the broader economy, we do remain optimistic about our business and the key demand drivers and feel we're very well positioned to grow in scale due to our industry-leading risk management efforts across procurement and strategic sourcing, power and treasury and our future-first sustainability program.\nAlso, the diversity and mix of our customers is benefiting us, with large established businesses constituting a majority of our revenues as greater than 80% of our recurring revenues come from companies generating $100 million or more in annual revenues. And more than 85% of our recurring revenues in the quarter come from customers deployed in 3 or more data centers, making Equinix a core vendor for our customers' digital infrastructure needs.\nEquinix remains in excellent financial health with strong liquidity positions, low net leverage, allowing us to be both strategically and operationally flexible in this current market environment. Now as part of our larger programmatic approach to managing power costs, we initiated efforts to enhance our customer communications last fall, providing our customers insights into our efforts while continuing to protect our customers and ourselves against the rising costs through our multiyear hedging efforts.\nAt the start of 2023, we raised our power prices primarily in the EMEA region to recover these rising costs. While power markets remain volatile, our hedging approach meaningfully dampened the impact of the inflated energy costs for many of our customers. We expect these power price increases will generate approximately [$350 million] of incremental revenues and costs in 2023. And as a result, the cumulative power price increases are expected to increase our revenue growth by approximately 500 basis points.\nNow despite these increases, our cost management efforts have protected both our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO on a dollar basis, but as expected, have negatively impacted our adjusted EBITDA margins for the year. We expect these higher energy costs to be transitory and should reverse course over our future yet-to-be-determined period, at which time both our gross profit and adjusted EBITDA margins will return to our targeted and expected levels.\nNow let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $1.871 billion, up 11% over the same quarter last year, above the midpoint of our guidance range on an FX-neutral basis, largely due to strong recurring revenues led by the Americas region. We continue to enjoy net positive pricing actions in the quarter. And similar to prior quarter, price increases outpaced price decreases by a ratio of 3:1. Q4 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included an $8 million tailwind when compared to our prior guidance rates due to the weaker U.S. dollar in the quarter. As we look forward, we expect a significant step-up in Q1 recurring revenues, largely due to strong net bookings performance and significant power price increases.\nGlobal Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $839 million or 45% of revenues, up 7% over the same quarter last year, at the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance. Q4 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges included a $1 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates and $7 million of integration costs. Global Q4 AFFO was $658 million, above our expectations due to strong operating performance, including seasonally higher recurring CapEx and included an $11 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates.\nGlobal Q4 MRR churn was 2.2%, a derivative of disciplined sales execution, whereby we put the right customer with the right application into the right asset. For the year, MRR churn was better than expected with the average quarterly MRR churn at the low end of our guidance range. As we look forward into 2023, we expect MRR churn to remain comfortably within our targeted 2% to 2.5% per quarter range.\nTurning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC was the fastest revenue-growing region on a year-over-year normalized basis at 17%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions at 10% and 9%, respectively. The Americas region had another quarter of strong gross bookings, lower MRR churn and continued favorable pricing trends led by our New York, Toronto and Washington, D.C. metros. The strength in the region remains broad-based, and the acquired Entel assets in Chile and Peru have performed better than we planned.\nOur EMEA region delivered strong quarter with continued healthy pricing trends and an attractive retail mix as well as record inter- and intra-region exports as the team sold across the Equinix Platform. In the quarter, we saw strength in the Amsterdam, Madrid and Stockholm markets and our network vertical. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a solid quarter led by our Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore businesses. Also, we're seeing significant interest from our customers in edge metros as we expand our footprint in the region. More specifically, in Mumbai, we had 40 -- we added 40 new logos in 2022, and we're already seeing customer interest for our Jakarta and Johor sites.\nAnd now looking at the capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased slightly to greater than $30 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of $1.9 billion. As expected, our quarter-over-quarter cash balance decreased due to the significant planned increase in growth CapEx and real estate purchases and our quarterly cash dividend. I'd said previously, we plan to take a balanced and opportunistic approach to accessing the capital markets when conditions are favorable. As such, we're happy to share that we recently priced a Japanese yen private placement, raising the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $600 million of debt with an average duration of greater than 14 years and a blended cost to borrow at an attractive 2.2%. This transaction is expected to fund in Q1.\nWe also executed some ATM forward sale transactions in Q4, providing $300 million of incremental equity funding when settled. Pro forma for these transactions, we have nearly $7 billion of readily available liquidity and remain very well funded to meet our ongoing cash needs.\nTurning to Slide 9 for the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $828 million, including recurring CapEx of $80 million. In the quarter, we opened 6 retail projects in Geneva, Los Angeles, Osaka, Singapore, Washington, D.C. and Zurich and 3 xScale projects in Dublin, Sao Paulo and Osaka. We also purchased our Geneva 2 and Sao Paulo 4 IBX assets as well as land for development in London. Revenues from owned assets increased to 63% of our recurring revenues for the quarter.\nOur capital investments delivered strong returns, as shown on Slide 10. Our now 158 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 87% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. As a reminder, similar to prior years, we plan to update our stabilized asset summary on the Q1 earnings call.\nAnd finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 of our summary of 2023 guidance and bridges. Do note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. Starting with revenues. For 2023, we expect top line revenues will step up by nearly $1 billion, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 14% to 15%. Excluding our power price pass-throughs, we expect top line revenue growth to range between 9% and 10%, above the top end of our long-term growth rates, as highlighted at our 2021 Analyst Day, reflecting the continued momentum in the business.\nWe expect 2023 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 45%, excluding integration costs. And excluding the impact of power price increases to revenues and higher utility costs, adjusted EBITDA margins would approximate 48%, the result of strong operating leverage and efficiency initiatives. We expect to incur $35 million of integration costs in 2023. 2023 AFFO is expected to grow between 9% and 12% compared to the previous year, and AFFO per share is expected to grow 8% to 10% at the top end of our long-term range from our 2021 Analyst Day. 2023 CapEx is expected to range between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, including approximately $150 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend, which we expect to be reimbursed as we transfer assets into the joint ventures and about $205 million of recurring CapEx spend.\nAnd finally, we're increasing the annual growth rate of our cash dividend on a per share basis to 10% due to strong operating performance. The cash dividend will approximate $1.3 billion, a 12% year-over-year increase, 100% of which is expected to be attributed to operating performance. So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles.\n\nCharles J. Meyers\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Equinix, Inc. (REIT)\n\nThanks, Keith. Our record of strong and consistent operating performance continued in 2022, and I'm proud of how the team delivered value for our customers and our shareholders. In 2023 and beyond, we believe the opportunity for our business remains significant as enterprises and service providers alike look to Platform Equinix as their key digital infrastructure partner to advance their digital transformation agenda.\nTo expand our market leadership, reinforce our competitive advantage and drive sustained value creation, the leadership team and I have outlined a clear set of priorities for the coming year. First, we intend to press our advantage in our interconnected colo franchise, continuing to scale and evolve our best-in-class bookings engine, delivering on key projects to enhance operating leverage, further extending our superior global reach, refining processes and systems to enhance the Equinix experience for our customers and partners, and integrating our sustainability leadership into our services in ways that better help our customers meet their commitments to environmental and social responsibility.\nSecond, we intend to continue to enrich our platform value proposition by accelerating our digital services growth, delivering a more unified set of platform capabilities and by investing in ecosystem enablement, empowering key partners to bring their value to our platform more quickly and easily and allowing us to leverage their significant go-to-market reach.\nAnd we will advance these priorities by continuing to cultivate a culture that remains firmly people-first. We're committed to making Equinix a place that attracts, inspires and develops the best talent in our industry, cultivating an in-service-to mindset and creating a place where every person every day can say, \"I'm safe, I belong and I matter.\"\nIn closing, our business remains well positioned. Despite a challenging macroeconomic and sociopolitical environment, digital transformation remains a clear priority across all industries and digital leaders will continue to harness our trusted platform to bring together and interconnect the foundational infrastructure that powers their success. In that vein, we're pleased to welcome Tom Olinger to our Board of Directors. As the longtime CFO at Prologis, Tom has extensive international operating experience spanning real estate and technology, which will benefit our business.\nI'd also like to thank Bud Lyons for his exceptional service and contributions to the growth and success of the company over the past 15 years as he rotates off the Board. So let me stop there and open it up for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Also, today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Katrina Rymill, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance and Sustainability. You may begin.\n\nKatrina Rymill\n\nVP of IR, Equinix, Inc. (REIT)\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we identified in today's press release and those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 18, 2022, and 10-Q filed on July 29, 2022. Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition, in light of Regulation Fair Disclosure, it is Equinix' policy not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an exclusive public disclosure.\nIn addition, we will provide non-GAAP measures on today's conference call. We provide a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a list of the reasons why the company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix IR page at www.equinix.com. We have made available on the IR page of our website a presentation designed to accompany this discussion, along with certain supplemental financial information and other data. We'd also like to remind you that we post important information about Equinix on the IR page from time to time and encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current available information.\nWith us today are Charles Meyers, Equinix' CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. (Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\n\nCharles J. Meyers\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Equinix, Inc. (REIT)\n\nThanks, Katrina. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We had another outstanding quarter as global demand for digital infrastructure continues to grow, and customer preferences trend convincingly toward architectures that are highly distributed, persistently hybrid, deeply cloud connected and increasingly on demand, all factors fueling the Equinix position as a trusted partner in digital transformation. This vigorous demand backdrop fueled another great quarter, delivering record gross and net bookings with strong demand across all 3 regions, resulting in our 79th quarter of consecutive revenue growth and further demonstrating the resiliency and durability of our business even in the face of a complex and challenging macro environment.\nIt is increasingly evident that the global pandemic has been a catalyst for a fundamental shift in how customers view digital transformation and its importance as a strategic imperative. And this commitment to digital transformation continues even in the face of a broader dynamic of belt tightening as companies look to do more with less and see digital as a catalyst to both maximize revenues and optimize costs.\nWhile we continue to closely monitor macro conditions and adapt our execution accordingly, the fundamentals of our business remain exceptionally strong. Our expansive global reach and robust interconnected ecosystems continue to attract a wide and diverse customer set as they prioritize digital investments and embrace Platform Equinix as a point of nexus to support hybrid and multi-cloud. This wave of digital infrastructure demand and our highly differentiated value proposition are translating to a robust pipeline, a highly favorable pricing environment and low churn, all fueling record performance across the business year-to-date and setting us up for a strong trajectory as we look to 2023 and beyond.\nAs customers navigate rising interest rates and broad-based inflation, they're benefiting from our scaled purchasing power and our sophisticated capabilities in hedging, risk management and sustainability. Our operating scale and scope give us a variety of levers to manage an increasingly dynamic environment, hedging currency, power and interest rates, investing in advanced procurement teams, expanding renewables coverage and taking a programmatic approach to improving the efficiency of our world-class data centers, an advanced set of capabilities supported by a strong and flexible balance sheet.\nSpecifically, on power, we have had a keen focus in this area and continue to feel confident in our position. Our approach to multiyear hedging is affording Equinix the visibility and predictability to communicate to customers in advance of expected power price increases and is allowing us to deliver cost points to customers that remain highly favorable against spot rates in many markets as volatility persists. While our aim remains to dampen this volatility for our customers through hedging, we do expect meaningful increases in power costs in many markets. And per our contracts, the full impact of these additional power costs will be passed on to customers. Overall, we believe we remain in a good position relative to competitors and the broader market.\nTurning to our results. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q3 were $1.84 billion, up 11% over the same quarter last year, driven by strong recurring revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA was up 11% year-over-year with AFFO meaningfully ahead of our expectations due to strong operating performance. Interconnection revenues continue to outpace the broader business, growing 13% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis.\nEquinix continues to extend its leadership as the most interconnected platform with 4 on-ramp wins this quarter, bringing the total in our portfolio to more than 200 on-ramps across 44 markets. We now have 11 metros across Platform Equinix enabled with on-ramps from all 5 of the leading cloud providers. No other competitor has more than one. In addition to placing critical networking nodes and on-ramps at Equinix, hyperscalers are also integral to our go-to-market motion as customers continue to aggressively migrate workloads to the cloud and demand cloud proximity for their own private cloud implementations.\nAs indicated in our recently published Global Interconnection Index, current trend lines indicate that more than 80% of Global 2000 companies will be interconnecting with more than 4 hyperscale providers and over 30 SaaS providers or other business partners on average by 2026.\nWe're continuing to invest behind the momentum we're seeing in our data center services business with 46 major projects underway across 31 markets in 21 countries. We continue to build capacity under our xScale offering, including 10 ongoing xScale projects that we expect will deliver another 80 megawatts of capacity once opened. This quarter, we added 6 new projects, including new data center builds in Barcelona, Tokyo and our first organic build in Jakarta, Indonesia. Our new IBX in Jakarta will add a strategically important high-growth market to our platform as we look to enable local businesses and global organizations to unleash Indonesia's digital potential.\nThis commitment to market-leading reach continues to drive our business with customers operating in all 3 regions now accounting for an amazing 64% of our recurring revenues. Key customer expansions this quarter included StackPath, a leading edge computing platform provider, which expanded into Dubai and Mumbai to support the growth of its worldwide edge compute, delivery and security offerings; a win with a global multinational airline leveraging Equinix to connect to their federated ecosystem of partner airlines; as well as a significant multi-metro expansion with one of the world's largest custodian banks, deploying across all 3 regions and utilizing the full suite of Equinix digital services.\nOn that note, our digital services portfolio saw continued momentum as companies increasingly demand infrastructure and interconnection services that can be delivered as a service and on demand. Equinix Metal had a strong bookings quarter as customers leveraged flexibility and agility across multiple metros. Wins this quarter included a major design win with a global SaaS provider and a significant expansion with a leading pediatric treatment and research facility using Network Edge and Equinix Fabric to create an edge hosting environment in key U.S. metros and enable seamless and high-performance connectivity to their cloud partners.\nIn Q3, we added an incremental 7,300 interconnections and now have over 443,000 total interconnections on our platform. Equinix Fabric had another strong quarter as interconnection diversity continues to increase. Expansions this quarter included Colt Technology Services further expanding its footprint in Europe and interconnectivity with Equinix Fabric to optimize performance for its customers as well as a financial software tools and enterprise applications provider implementing a global network optimization project leveraging Equinix Fabric.\nInternet Exchange saw peak traffic up 8% quarter-over-quarter and 28% year-over-year to greater than 27 terabits per second, representing the largest peak traffic growth since prior to the pandemic.\nOur channel program delivered a sixth consecutive record quarter, accounting for 37% of bookings and approximately 60% of new logos and remains a critical vector in how we are expanding our reach and scaling our go-to-market engine. We continue to see particular strength from strategic cloud technology and systems integrator partners like AWS, Cisco, Dell, Google, HPE, Infosys and Microsoft. This segment accounted for approximately half of our channel bookings and continues to grow in both deal dollar -- deal and dollar volume.\nWith these partners, we jointly offer a blend of IT and networking technologies that allow customers to interconnect seamlessly with hyperscale cloud and other as-a-service providers and benefit from solutions that deliver optimal performance, cost, security, agility and scale across our global platform. Channel wins included a U.K. insurance firm with Equinix partner, Softcat, for a data center consolidation and modernization project at our London campus where technology elements from HPE, Cisco and Palo Alto Networks are being brought together in a cloud-adjacent architecture, all directly interconnected to Microsoft and AWS.\nNow let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter.\n\nKeith D. Taylor\n\nCFO, Equinix, Inc. (REIT)\n\nThanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. As you can see from our results, the Equinix team continues to execute for our customers, our communities and for our investors. Our go-to-market engine delivered record gross and net bookings in Q3, closing over 4,200 deals with more than 3,000 customers. Our success is derived from the breadth of our service offering, the scale of our growing platform, the quality of our operations organization and the focus of our investing for the longer term.\nFor the quarter, our net bookings performance moved up significantly both compared to our Q3 expectations and the same quarter last year due to strong gross activity, a favorable pricing environment, lower-than-expected churn and the strength of our digital services offerings. Again, we had net positive pricing actions. Consequently, our consolidated MRR per cabinet increased to greater than $2,000 per cabinet despite the weaker foreign operating currencies.\nA note: the expected price increases or PPIs discussed by Charles are not in either our reported or our guided numbers. These price increases will be passed through to our customers in 2023. Over the past couple of months, we've been communicating with our customers about the pending power price increases. And most recently, we've notified them of the expected range of their power cost increase at the market level. The dialogue with our customers highlighted the value of our multiyear power planning and sourcing efforts, which is expected to meaningfully dampen the impact of inflated energy cost to many of our customers, both relative to the competition and the broader market.\nFinally, notwithstanding the strong bookings performance in Q3, our forward-looking pipeline remains healthy. And our backlog and our book-to-bill interval remains constant, allowing us to remain confident as we look ahead into Q4 and plan for 2023. So given the momentum in our business, we're again raising our underlying guidance across each of our core financial metrics for the year.\nNow while our business remains well positioned and resilient, we continue to keep macro factors top of mind. Consequently, we chose to increase the liquidity position of the company. At quarter end, we had over $2.5 billion of unrestricted cash in our bank accounts and full access to our $4 billion line of credit, increasing the financial and operational flexibility of the business. Our net leverage remains low at 3.5x our adjusted EBITDA, creating plenty of balance sheet flexibility.\nNow let me cover the highlights for the quarter and note that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q3 revenues were $1.841 billion, up 11% over the same quarter last year, above the top end of our guidance range on an FX-neutral basis, largely due to strong recurring revenues. Q3 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $9 million impact when compared to our prior guidance rates, largely due to weaker euro and British pounds.\nGlobal Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $871 million or 47% of revenues, up 11% over the same quarter last year, above the top end of our guidance range due to strong cash gross profit and lower-than-planned operating costs, including professional fees and consulting costs. Q3 adjusted EBITDA net of our FX hedges included a $5 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates and $4 million of integration costs.\nGlobal Q3 AFFO was $712 million, above our expectations due to strong operating performance and lower net interest expense and included a $5 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 MRR churn was 1.9%, a continued reflection of our disciplined sales execution to put the right customer with the right application into the right asset. For Q4, we expect MRR churn to continue to trend at the lower end of our 2% to 2.5% per quarter range.\nTurning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC was the fastest-growing region on a year-over-year normalized MRR basis at 19%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions at 11% and 10%, respectively.\nThe Americas region had another great quarter with strong gross bookings, lower MRR churn and favorable pricing trends led by our Washington, D.C. and New York metros. In August, we added Lima, Peru to our platform as part of the Entel acquisition, expanding our Latin American footprint to a fifth country and extending the Equinix platform to 32 countries and 71 markets globally. Our EMEA region delivered another record bookings quarter with strong pricing and robust channel activity led by our Amsterdam, Dublin and Frankfurt markets with strength in our IT services and enterprise verticals.\nAnd finally, the Asia Pacific region had a strong quarter with robust exports from Japan. As part of our Future First sustainability strategy, we're very proud to announce our partnership with the Centre for Energy Research & Technology at the National University of Singapore to explore sustainable technologies and alternate fuel sources for data center infrastructure.\nAnd now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased slightly despite the weaker non-U.S. operating currencies to $29.3 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of $2.5 billion. Our cash balance increased quarter-over-quarter due to strong operating cash flow and about $800 million of ATM activity settled in the quarter. As stated previously, we'll continue to take a balanced and opportunistic approach to accessing the capital markets when conditions are favorable.\nOn the debt side of the house, on the heels of the rating upgrades from both Fitch and Moody's last quarter, S&P increased their debt tolerance for the company by 1 leverage turn, thereby increasing the level of flexibility from our balance sheet. We're pleased and appreciative of the rating improvements over the past quarters and look forward to our continued dialogue with our rating agencies.\nTurning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $553 million, including recurring CapEx of $50 million. In the quarter, we opened 6 retail projects in Istanbul, Madrid, Manchester, Melbourne, Paris and Toronto and 2 xScale projects in Frankfurt and London. We also purchased land for development in Monterrey, Mexico.\nOur capital investments delivered strong returns, as shown on Slide 10. Our 160 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are now collectively 88% utilized and generate a 29% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested.\nAnd finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2022 guidance and bridges, including the anticipated financial results from the Entel Peru purchase. For the full year 2022, due to strong momentum that we're seeing in the organic business, we now expect our revenues to increase between 10% and 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis over the prior year. Relative to our prior guidance, we're increasing our underlying revenues by $15 million due to strong recurring revenue performance. We expect 2022 underlying adjusted EBITDA to increase by $46 million compared to our prior guidance due to strong revenue performance and lower operating spend. We now expect to incur $20 million of integration costs in 2022.\nWe're raising our underlying 2022 AFFO by $52 million to grow between 10% and 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis due to strong operating performance and lower net interest expense. And as a result, our AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 9% and 10% on a normalized and constant currency basis, above the top end of our prior guide, including the impact from our Q3 ATM activity. Finally, 2022 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion, including about $190 million of recurring CapEx and about $135 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend, down slightly due to timing of expansion spend.\nSo let me stop here. I'm going to turn the call back to Charles.\n\nCharles J. Meyers\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Equinix, Inc. (REIT)\n\nThanks, Keith. Our results this quarter continue to reflect strong execution by our global team and highlight the unique position that Equinix enjoys in facilitating digital transformation. As we continue to deliver exceptional business results, I want to also highlight our significant progress in advancing our Future First sustainability commitments.\nThis quarter, in addition to our continued investments and commitments around environmental sustainability, we're very pleased to have launched the Equinix Foundation, an employee-driven charitable organization working to advance digital inclusion through philanthropic grant making and strategic partnerships. The foundation reflects our ongoing commitment to social sustainability, and we are excited about the work we can do to build a better, more inclusive, more sustainable world, harnessing and amplifying the passion of our people to help close the digital divide in our communities across the globe.\nAs we advance Q4 and position for 2023, our highly differentiated position continues to drive strong momentum, robust customer demand and a deep, high-quality pipeline. We are delivering sustained growth at the top line and AFFO per share while maintaining our clear focus on driving operating leverage across our business. We continue to effectively exercise multiple growth levers, including expanded market reach, enhancement of our product portfolio, accelerated new logo capture through our multichannel go-to-market engine, pricing adjustments that reflect our exceptional value and a commitment to a bold innovation and sustainability agenda, all of which demonstrates the resilience of Platform Equinix and highlights our ability to deliver distinct and durable value to our customers and our shareholders.\nSo let me stop there and open it up for questions."

Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping the call up in 1 hour, we would like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to 1.\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\n\nCharles J. Meyers\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Equinix, Inc. (REIT)\n\nThank you, Chip. Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. On the heels of a record Q1, we had an outstanding Q2, with strong and sustained demand across our product portfolio, broad pricing momentum and solid sales execution, with particular strength in Americas and EMEA, resulting in record growth and net bookings and our best-ever quarterly revenue step-up.\nAs our customers progress and accelerate their digital transformation journeys, the relevance of Platform Equinix continues to grow. In our recent global tech trend survey, nearly 70% of the 2,900 IT decision-makers polled indicated their intention to adopt private or hybrid as their cloud architecture of choice, with over 45% of those polled working with 3 or more cloud providers and over 80% indicating their intention to sustain or increase their spend on interconnection.\nToday, we're seeing this demand for interconnected digital infrastructure across our regions. This quarter's bookings sizably surpassed the prior peak, a great indicator of the strength of the business and our go-forward pipeline. Our business remains resilient and highly diversified, with nearly 1/3 of our 10,000-plus customers closing incremental business in any given quarter.\nDespite macro conditions, this customer demand, paired with lower-than-expected churn, is driving us above the upper end of our Analyst Day revenue guidance this year and benefiting our AFFO per share guide, with the impact of pricing increases still largely unrealized.\nTurning to our results. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q2 were $1.8 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year, representing our 78th consecutive quarter of top line revenue growth, a clear reflection of the durability of our business model across economic cycles. Adjusted EBITDA was up 8% year-over-year, with AFFO meaningfully ahead of our expectations due to continued strong operating performance. Interconnection revenues continue to outpace the broader business, growing 13% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis.\nCustomers continue to embrace Equinix as the best manifestation of the interconnected digital edge. And we continue to scale, extend and innovate across our data center services portfolio. We now have 49 major projects underway across 34 metros in 21 countries, with 13 new projects this quarter, including new data center builds in Dublin, Montreal, New York, Paris, Warsaw and our first build in Chennai, India, the first of several anticipated metro expansions in this fast-growing market.\nOur unparalleled global scale and reach continues to be a strategic advantage, driving success with service providers looking to extend their reach and rapidly implement as a Service models and with enterprise customers across nearly every sector of the global economy as they modernize their infrastructure and embrace hybrid and multicloud.\nWins this quarter included a multinational energy conglomerate, implementing their hybrid cloud strategy across multiple regions, leveraging Network Edge and Equinix Fabric, and F5, a global technology leader in application security and multicloud networking, establishing additional networking nodes in all 3 regions to better support their customers.\nIn May, we closed our acquisition of 4 data centers from Entel, extending Platform Equinix into Chile and bringing our global footprint to 70 metros across 31 countries. Equinix has a decade-long history in Latin America, and this acquisition provides significant expansion capacity, enabling both local businesses and multinationals the opportunity to accelerate their digital transformation and our Lat Am aspirations. We also expect to close on the acquisition of one additional data center from Entel, extending our reach to Lima, Peru in Q3.\nAs the world's digital infrastructure company, we believe it's our responsibility to help bring about a more sustainable future. In 2022, we continue to advance our bold future-first sustainability strategy and are pleased to have been recognized by Sustainalytics as among the best large-cap REITs for ESG and to be ranked seventh on US EPA's National Top 100 list of the largest green power users.\nWe continue to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy grids and recently executed our second Virtual Power Purchase Agreement in Finland. Once operational, these 2 new wind projects, combined with our prior projects, will bring Equinix' total renewable VPPA capacity to 300 megawatts, and we continue to explore additional PPA projects across all 3 regions as we progress towards our goal of 100% clean and renewable energy.\nTurning to our industry-leading interconnection franchise, we're seeing continued diversification of our ecosystems and robust activities, including a win with Fast Shop, one of Brazil's largest electronics retailers, who chose Equinix to help strengthen interconnection for its digital core, improved cloud connectivity and integrate with the digital retail ecosystem.\nIn Q2, we added an incremental 7,600 interconnections and now have over 435,000 total interconnections on our platform. Equinix Fabric saw a notable increase in provision capacity as channel enablement is driving network resale use cases and customers are increasingly using inter-metro connections on Fabric to connect across their deployments, including a win with [Zivver], a cybersecurity company in the Netherlands using Equinix Fabric to connect deployments in Amsterdam and London to provide connectivity for its customers as part of its business expansion.\nInternet Exchange saw peak traffic up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 25% year-over-year, to greater than 25 terabits per second.\nPivoting to our digital services portfolio. We continue to see strong growth and significant opportunity as customers increasingly leverage more Virtual as a Service and Edge solutions. Equinix Metal had a strong bookings quarter as partner-driven solutions like Pure Storage and Dell PowerStore on Equinix Metal are driving performance-centric hybrid cloud opportunities with enterprise customers.\nNetwork Edge also had a strong quarter, with a notable increase in large multi-instance deployments from enterprise customers. Both Metal and Network Edge are also driving attractive revenue pull-through to Equinix Fabric.\nDigital services wins this quarter included Protocol Labs, an open-source R&D lab, increasing its usage of Equinix Metal to support projects that decentralize the web and cloud storage, and a leading waste management services provider, leveraging Fortinet on Network Edge to connect their business units in Asia to their data centers in the U.S. across Equinix Fabric.\nOur strategy remains simple, to translate our unique and durable advantages into being the platform where buyers and sellers of digital services can come together, enabling them to deploy and interconnect the infrastructure that they need to transform their business. For service providers, demand remains robust as businesses around the world are planning major investments in digital technologies to support ambitious expansion plans following lessons learned from the pandemic.\nThis year, Gartner projects that global spending on public cloud services will reach nearly $500 billion. And we're seeing strong demand across multiple vectors with these key cloud and IT customers. In the quarter, we added 3 new cloud on-ramps in Paris and London and now have nearly 200 on-ramps to the major cloud service providers deployed on our platform, making Equinix the home of hybrid multicloud.\nWe also continue to see tremendous success supporting our hyperscale partners as they invest in subsea cables to facilitate the rapid growth of Internet traffic between continents. And in addition to being an integral part of hyperscale architectures, we continue to drive go-to-market alignment with these market-shaping players, partnering to meet end customer needs for hybrid cloud and making the hyperscalers some of our most productive channel partners.\nHyperscaler demand for our xScale offering also remains robust. We had high leasing activity in Q2, pre-leasing our entire Dublin 6 asset, the first phase of our Paris 13 asset and the second phase of our Frankfurt 11 asset, representing more than 38 megawatts of capacity. Looking across the various xScale JVs, we've seen strong demand, with over 170 megawatts now leased across our portfolio. And we currently have 11 xScale builds under development, of which more than 80% is pre-leased.\nOn the enterprise side, Gartner also continues to view digital transformation not as a 1- or 2-year trend, but as a systemic and long-term theme. Our pipeline strongly supports this thesis, and our enterprise activity this quarter was robust with Americas and EMEA regions driving record bookings, with particular strength in banking and health care.\nExpansions included a leading U.S. health care software vendor, creating an edge hosting environment on the West Coast, and the Hertz Corporation, one of the largest worldwide vehicle rental companies, who deployed on Platform Equinix to support its digital transformation journey, locating infrastructure proximate to cloud providers and tapping into our digital solutions.\nAnd once again, our channel program continued to thrive, delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of record bookings, including strong performances for our EMEA and APAC regions, accounting for more than 35% of bookings and nearly 60% of new logos. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and digital-first use cases, with hybrid multicloud as the clear architecture of choice.\nWe saw strength from strategic partners, like AT&T, Cisco, Dell, Google and Microsoft, and including a win with Orange Business Services for -- a security services technology company, to deploy their payment card encryption solution while interconnecting to our financial services and cloud ecosystems. We're also proud to have been named HPE GreenLake's Momentum Partner of the Year for 2022 as we together work to deliver a consistent hybrid and multicloud experience for our joint customers.\nNow let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter.\n\nKeith D. Taylor\n\nCFO, Equinix, Inc. (REIT)\n\nThanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. I hope you're all doing well and enjoying the summer months. Well, as you can see from our results, Q2 was one of our best quarters to date, if not our best. The go-to-market engine continues to convert our healthy pipeline into record bookings with attractive pricing, coupled with low churn dynamics. In fact, it was our eighth straight quarter of increasing net bookings activity, and our forward-looking pipeline remains robust.\nOur success and the momentum in the business are strong indications of the value customers place on our highly differentiated ecosystems or the breadth of our service offerings, the global scale and reach of our platform and of course, the quality of our operational delivery. With a great first half of 2022, we're again raising our underlying guidance across each of our core financial metrics.\nNow as you can see from our performance, we continue to manage an instrument in the business to perform across varying economic cycles, even ones like we're experiencing today. While all things macro remain within our focus, we do feel well positioned to address the volatility in the market, and here's why. We have low customer concentration, with no customer representing greater than 3% of our revenues, and our top 50 customers continue to diversify across our platform and as a percentage of revenues.\nWith regards to supply chain, our best-in-class design and construction and strategic sourcing teams are delivering projects consistent with our budget expectations with limited delays and have access greater than $300 million of inventory holds to mitigate future disruptions across a number of critical functions.\nOn inflation, we've largely been effective by protecting our customers and partners from the market fluctuations. But as we continue to assess the likely go-forward trends related to the cost of energy and construction, in addition to the broader inflationary increases affecting wages and other operating costs, we do expect to raise our prices. And with 60% of our revenues coming from outside the U.S., a strong dollar in Q2 has had a notable impact on our as-reported numbers and outlook, yet our sophisticated hedging program has meaningfully dampened the impact to our financial statements.\nNow let me cover the highlights for the quarter. All comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $1.817 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year and above the top end of our guidance range due to better-than-expected step-up in recurring revenues and strong xScale NRR fees. Full MRR per cabinet yield reached the new mark of $2,000 per cabinet. Q2 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $20 million impact when compared to our prior guidance rates due to broad dollar strength.\nGlobal Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $860 million or 47% of revenues, up 8% over the same quarter last year, above the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance. Q2 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included a $10 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates and $4 million of integration costs.\nGlobal Q2 AFFO was $691 million, above our expectations due to strong operating performance and included a $9 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q2 MRR churn was 2.1%, again at the lower end of our guidance range. Looking forward, we expect MRR churn to continue to trend favorably and remain at the lower end of our 2% to 2.5% per quarter range.\nTurning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. APAC was the fastest-growing region on a year-over-year normalized MRR basis at 14%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions at 11% and 9%, respectively. The Americas region had a record bookings quarter with great performance in our Canadian and Mexican businesses as well as our Denver and Silicon Valley markets and healthy new deal pricing.\nThe Americas go-to-market [edge then] continues to sell the platform with strong global exports. The Entel Chile assets are performing well against our initial expectations, and we look forward to adding Lima, Peru to our global footprint in August.\nOur EMEA region also delivered a record bookings performance, with broad-based strength across our cloud, enterprise, content and digital media verticals, led by our London and Paris markets as well as our emerging markets. In the quarter, we saw healthy retail activity with strong pricing across our varying deal sizes and solid adoption of our digital services products.\nThe integration of the MainOne assets into our platform is progressing well, and the business is tracking ahead of our expectations. We're seeing increased focus on sustainability across our European stakeholders, and thus, we're taking an active leadership role through the European Data Centre Association to address this growing and critical matter.\nAnd finally, the Asia Pacific region had a strong quarter with robust channel activity, led by our businesses in Australia and Singapore. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our Shanghai operations team for their dedication and effort during their very strict COVID lockdowns over the past quarter to deliver 100% uptime. Their efforts are a shining example of what we call the magic of Equinix as they put \"we\" before \"me\" to ensure our customers' critical infrastructure remained operational.\nAnd now, looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $1.9 billion, an increase over the prior quarter, largely due to our April green bond debt offering and strong operating cash flow created by the business, offset by our growth CapEx, the cash dividend and the acquisitions closed in the quarter.\nIn June, Fitch Ratings upgraded us to BBB+, given the strength of our business performance and its cash-generating capabilities as well as our balanced capital funding posture. We're very appreciative of the support received from Fitch.\nAdditionally, during the quarter, we executed some ATM for resale transactions, which will provide approximately $400 million of incremental equity funding when settled later this year. Looking forward, as stated previously, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to funding our growth opportunities with both debt and equity, while creating long-term value for our shareholders.\nTurning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $490 million, including a recurring CapEx of $35 million. In the quarter, we opened 4 retail projects in London, Mexico City, Milan and Tokyo and 2 xScale projects in Frankfurt and Sydney. We also purchased land for development in Bogota and Mumbai.\nRevenues from owned assets stepped up to 61% of our total revenues, reflecting our long-term strategy of both developing and purchasing land and IBXs. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 162 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 87% utilized and generate a 28% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested.\nAnd finally, please refer to slides 11 through 15 for an updated summary of 2022 guidance and bridges. Do note, our 2022 guidance now includes the anticipated financial results from the Entel Chile acquisition, which closed in May.\nFor the full year 2022, based on the momentum we're seeing in the organic business, we now expect our revenues to increase 10% to 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis over the prior year, trending above our Analyst Day revenue range, a reflection of the healthy digital infrastructure demands that are driving the momentum in our business. Relative to our prior guidance, we're increasing our revenues by $65 million, including $30 million of revenues from the Entel Chile.\nWe expect 2022 underlying adjusted EBITDA to increase by a net $33 million compared to our prior guidance, including $18 million from Entel Chile. We now expect to incur $30 million of integration costs in 2022. We're raising our underlying 2022 AFFO by $33 million to grow between 8% and 10% on a normalized and constant currency basis.\nAnd given the strength in our business, 2022 AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 8% and 9% on a normalized and constant currency basis, above the top end of our prior guide, with both the MainOne and Entel acquisition immediately accretive to our business. 2022 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion, including about $185 million of recurring CapEx and about $110 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend.\nSo let me stop here. I'm going to turn the call back to Charles.\n\nCharles J. Meyers\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Equinix, Inc. (REIT)\n\nThanks, Keith. In closing, we had an outstanding first half of 2022, and our business continues to deliver strong and consistent results. Despite a challenging macroeconomic and sociopolitical landscape, demand remains robust as customers continue to invest heavily in digital transformation. And as infrastructure needs evolve, Platform Equinix is increasingly relevant as a point of nexus in IT architectures that are more distributed, more hybrid and more cloud-connected, giving us a distinctive value proposition and meaningful pricing flexibility.\nThe emergence of the cloud continues to disrupt the multitrillion-dollar global IT market, fueling both our hyperscaler relationships and our broader service provider business as successful new entrants extend and expand their infrastructure to drive revenue growth and traditional technology leaders build out distributed delivery infrastructure as they transform to as a Service models.\nWe continue to invest behind this momentum, both in expanding the reach and scale of our data center platform and in accelerating the evolution of our digital services portfolio, which is seeing strong customer interest.\nIn that vein, we're pleased to welcome Jeetu Patel and Fidelma Russo to our Board of Directors. As veteran operating leaders at Cisco and HPE, they bring deep knowledge of both technology and go-to-market aspects of the evolving digital infrastructure landscape. And we're excited about their contributions as we continue to innovate our service offerings for the digital leaders of today and tomorrow.\nSo let me stop there and open it up for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Also, today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Chip Newcom, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nChip Newcom\n\nDirector, IR, Equinix, Inc. (REIT)\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that some of the statements that we will be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we've identified in today's press release and those identified in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 18, 2022. Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call.\nIn addition, in light of Regulation Fair Disclosure, it is Equinix's policy not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. In addition, we will provide non-GAAP measures on today's conference call. We provide a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a list of the reasons why the company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix Investor Relations page at www.equinix.com.\nWe have made available on the IR page of our website a presentation designed to accompany this discussion, along with certain supplemental financial information and other data. We would like to also remind you that we post important information about Equinix on the IR page from time to time and encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current information available.\nWith us today are Charles Meyers, Equinix's CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up under an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\n\nCharles J. Meyers\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Equinix, Inc. (REIT)\n\nThanks, Chip. Welcome to the call. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome also to all of you to our first quarter earnings call. We had a great start to 2022, delivering the best net booking performance in our history, fueled by strong demand across all 3 regions, robust net pricing actions and near-record low churn, resulting in our 77th consecutive quarter of top line growth, the longest such streak of any S&P 500 company. We executed more than 4,200 deals in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers, demonstrating both the scale and the consistency of our go-to-market machine.\nWhile there are a number of macroeconomic factors that we continue to proactively manage, including rising interest rates, inflation and geopolitical conflict, the business continues to perform exceptionally well. And underlying demand for digital infrastructure continues to rise as enterprises across the globe and in diverse sectors prioritize digital transformation and service providers continue to innovate, distribute and scale their infrastructure globally in response to that demand.\nUnfortunately, the war in Ukraine is still unfolding, and we continue to be part of the vigorous global response to that conflict. As stewards of key elements of the world's digital infrastructure, we're committed to doing our part in maintaining that infrastructure to support free and open communications and aid in humanitarian relief. While we do not have operations in Russia or Ukraine, our employees have shown incredible generosity supporting Ukrainian refugees, particularly our team in Poland.\nLooking more broadly at our responsibilities as a market leader. We continue to advance a bold future-first sustainability agenda that reflects our company's values across our environmental, social and governance initiatives. We recently published our 2021 corporate sustainability highlights, and I'm pleased to report continued progress, including a 3.6% increase in representation of women at leadership levels and a 20% increase in the number of employees leveraging our well-being and our mental health benefits. We also continue to develop pathways and partnerships to enhance our diversity and create opportunities for historically underrepresented groups both inside and outside of Equinix.\nAs we work to address the urgency of climate change, I'm also proud that Equinix is well on our way to meeting our science-based target commitments. In 2021, we achieved over 90% renewable energy coverage for our portfolio for the fourth consecutive year while also improving the energy efficiency of our facilities by over 5% as measured by average annual power usage effectiveness, or PUE. A focus on sustainability continues to be top of mind for customers and partners as they look to buy from and work with companies that have established ESG goals and commitments.\nAs the world's digital infrastructure leader, we have a responsibility to harness the power of technology to create a more accessible, equitable and sustainable future, and we will continue to focus on the important issues that impact our stakeholders and our business.\nNow turning to the results as depicted on Slide 3. Revenues for Q1 were $1.7 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 5% year-over-year, and AFFO was better than our expectations, again, due to strong operating performance. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our data center services portfolio continues to extend our differentiated scale and reach with 43 projects underway across 29 metros in 20 countries, including new projects in Atlanta, Mumbai, Sydney, Tokyo and Washington, D.C. as customers embrace our interconnected edge as a point of nexus for their hybrid and multi-cloud architectures and leverage our scaled digital ecosystems to enable and drive their digital agenda.\nAccording to IDC, by 2024, 65% of the Global 2000 will embed some sort of edge-first data stewardship, security and network practices into their organization's digital business processes, and we're already seeing the impact with an amazing 89% of recurring revenues now coming from customers deployed in more than one metro. In April, we closed our acquisition of MainOne, extending platform Equinix into Nigeria, Ghana and Ivory Coast, bringing our global coverage to 69 metros across 30 countries. Nigeria, in particular, is emerging as an innovative and dynamic player in the global digital economy, representing a significant opportunity for the expansion of digital services and a key first step in our long-term strategy to extend our carrier-neutral digital infrastructure platform across Africa.\nIn the quarter, we also announced our upcoming expansion into Chile through the planned acquisition of multiple data centers from Entel, a leading Chilean telecommunications provider. Chile is the fourth largest economy in South America with the highest GDP per capita in the region. And Santiago is emerging as a technology hub, serving both regional cloud and content demand as well as local enterprises. This transaction is expected to close in Q2 and will further solidify Equinix as the leading provider of digital infrastructure in Latin America.\nTurning to interconnection. Our industry-leading portfolio continues to outpace the broader business, growing 12% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by a healthy uptick in connections across our top ecosystem. We added an incremental 8,900 total interconnections in the quarter and now have over 428,000 total interconnections on the platform. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 7% quarter-over-quarter and 25% year-over-year to greater than 24 terabits per second. And we continue to see expanding customer demand and accelerated growth across our digital services portfolio. Equinix Fabric saw its highest ever virtual connection adds as customers employ an increasingly diverse set of end destinations and utilize Fabric for a variety of use cases across cloud networking and backbone connectivity.\nEquinix Metal and Network Edge also had strong quarters as enterprises leverage these services for a variety of virtual deployments, increasing agility and helping them to mitigate supply chain challenges. Metal has the most net customer adds to its service since its launch, with several key enterprise wins and a healthy backlog as our go-to-market partnerships with Dell, Pure Storage and Mirantis all gained momentum.\nShifting to our xScale initiative. In March, we closed our Australian JV with PGIM, which is expected to provide more than 55 megawatts of capacity in the Sydney market when closed and fully built out. And in April, we closed our South Korea JV with GIC, which is expected to provide more than 45 megawatts to the rapidly growing Seoul market. We currently have 9 xScale builds under development with over 80 megawatts of incremental capacity, of which nearly 2/3 are already pre-leased.\nSo now I'll cover some highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical had a great quarter, good momentum across all 3 regions and record channel activity with our key carrier partners. New wins and expansions included Excitel, one of the largest ISPs in India, establishing network hubs in our Mumbai 1 and 2 IBX, a high-speed satellite broadband service for military and commercial markets, supporting its expansion into Australia; and GlobalNet, a specialty network expanding its footprint and upgrading connectivity to support its growing user. And enterprise continues to be our fastest-growing vertical, with a strong bookings quarter led by EMEA in the manufacturing and public sector subsegments.\nNew wins and expansions included Technicolor, the creative services and technology company for the media and entertainment industry, establishing regional technology hubs utilizing the full suite of Equinix's digital infrastructure services. The Global [40] Bank choosing Equinix as their strategic partner, thanks to our robust digital offerings, connectivity to key financial institutions and our sustainability strategy. And Party City, a global leader in the celebrations industry using Network Edge to enable cloud connectivity and allow private interconnection between sites as they continue with their digital transformation.\nWe were also proud to work with a global money [sender] bank who leveraged our advanced ecosystems to enable a critical connection to the National Bank of Ukraine, so the UNICEF could distribute funds to those that need it most as part of their humanitarian efforts. Our cloud and IT services vertical had solid bookings in the quarter, led by the infrastructure subset, while adding new cloud on-ramps in Dubai, Rio de Janeiro and Stockholm. New wins and expansions included DigitalOcean, a rapidly scaling global cloud hosting provider, who is expanding its infrastructure footprint across multiple regions as they add customers and products. And a leading SaaS company, leveraging Equinix for its distributed data and cloud strategy and expanding service portfolio.\nThe broadcast and streaming subsegments anchored a solid quarter in content and digital media, including expansions of the Fortune 75 Media Conglomerates, expanding across Platform Equinix to support streaming services and content production. A multinational consumer credit reporting company, enabling direct connectivity via Equinix to their financial services customers. And Fastly, a global CDN expanding capacity and deploying network nodes in support of their edge compute strategy.\nAnd finally, our channel program again delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of record bookings, accounting for roughly 40% of bookings and 60% of new logos. Reseller and alliance partners accounted for over 75% of channel bookings as our partners continue to demonstrate tremendous leadership in helping customers quickly adopt new digital business models. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and digital-first use cases with hybrid multi-cloud featuring prominently as the architecture of choice. We saw continued strength with strategic partners like AWS, Microsoft, Dell and Telstra, including a significant win in France with AT&T, helping a security services company consolidate data centers and interconnect to their choice of cloud providers.\nWe'd also like to take a moment to recognize AT&T business as our partner of the year for 2021. Proud to have worked together to drive digital first outcomes on complex and transformational projects, including the Equinix and AT&T connected climate initiatives benefiting hundreds of customers across multiple industries.\nNow let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter.\n\nKeith D. Taylor\n\nCFO, Equinix, Inc. (REIT)\n\nThanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. I do hope you're doing well. At Equinix, the team delivered another great quarter. We did better than anticipated. We experienced robust growth in the Americas, had solid channel bookings, further expanding the universe of opportunity for our highly differentiated business and enjoyed meaningful inter and intra-region activity, a reflection that we're selling well across our ever-expanding footprint.\nInterconnection activity remains high both in the physical and the virtual level. Interconnection revenues represent 19% of our recurring revenues and are growing faster than the overall business. Our platform strategy continues to deliver outside its value, further separating us from others in our space. We had strong growth from our digital services products and continued momentum in the most recent acquisitions in Canada, India and Mexico. And our pipeline remains solid despite our record bookings. With a great start to 2022, we're raising our guidance across each of our core financial metrics.\nAs we've said previously, we believe the diversity and scale of our business across sectors, markets and customers puts us in a highly favorable position to capitalize on all trends digital as well as manage the macro factors and volatility. We have no meaningful near-term exposure to rising interest rates. Our balance sheet strength continues to provide us with a strategic advantage while allowing us to access the capital markets at times that are attractive to us. With regards to supply chain and inflation, we continue to deliver projects against our return expectations with limited delays given our ability to access and secure critical infrastructure components. And while the energy markets remain volatile, our hedging policies are helping us navigate this unusual period. These factors, when combined with the momentum we're seeing in our marketplace, enable us to remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver top line growth, strong and durable AFFO per share growth to our shareholders as well.\nNow let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q1 revenues were $1.734 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year and at the midpoint of our guidance due to better-than-expected MRR revenues, offset in part by the delayed timing of certain nonrecurring xScale fees. As we look forward, we expect a strong Q2 step-up in both recurring and nonrecurring revenues. As we've noted before, nonrecurring revenues attributed to customer installation work and xScale fee income are inherently lumpy and can move between quarters. Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $2 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates.\nGlobal Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $800 million or 46% of revenues, up 5% over the same quarter last year as a high end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance and timing of spend, although it was impacted by the lower xScale fees. Q1 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included a $1 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and also includes $5 million of integration costs. Total Q1 AFFO was $653 million, above our expectations due to strong operating performance. Q1 global MRR churn was 1.8%, the lowest level of churn in recent history, a reflection of our disciplined strategy of selling the platform to the right customer with the right application into the right asset. For 2022, we now expect MRR churn to average at the lower end of our 2% to 2.5% per quarter range.\nTurning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC was the fastest-growing region on a year-over-year normalized basis at 13%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions at 10% and 9%, respectively. The Americas region had another great quarter with strong broad-based bookings led by our Chicago, Dallas, New York and Washington D.C. markets. Enterprises represented over half the region's bookings and we saw record channel activity as businesses continue to leverage platform Equinix to maximize their digital infrastructures flexibility and agility in the hybrid multi-cloud world. The region also saw a robust interconnection activity, adding 4,000 total interconnection and significant Internet exchange capacity led by our Sao Paulo market.\nOur EMEA region delivered its highest net bookings performance in 3 years with strong pricing and a healthy mix of retail activity with solid exports led by our Dubai, Istanbul, London and Milan markets. In EMEA, sustainability is an ever-increasing focus for our customers and communities, and our local leadership team continues to work to position Equinix as the industry thought leader at both the local and regional levels.\nAnd finally, the Asia Pacific region had a solid quarter led by Australia, Japan and Singapore businesses, with traction increasing across the region for our digital services. India had another great quarter, and we're investing behind our momentum in the market with our newly announced Mumbai 3 IBX project as well as purchasing land for development in Chennai.\nAnd now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion of cash, an increase over the prior quarter, largely due to strong operating cash flow, offset by growth CapEx and our cash dividend. Shortly after the quarter end, we completed our fourth green bond offering raising $1.2 billion to further our commitment to sustainability leadership. With this latest financing, Equinix has issued approximately $4.9 billion of Green Bonds, making our company the fourth largest global issuer in the investment-grade green bond market.\nIn early April, we are also pleased to have Moody's upgrade Equinix to Baa2 in line with S&P and Fitch while expanding our leverage targets. We're very appreciative of the support we see from Moody's. And importantly, we're delighted with the increased financial flexibility we now have across all 3 rating agencies. Looking forward, as stated previously, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to funding our growth opportunities with both debt and equity, while creating long-term value for our shareholders.\nTurning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $413 million, including seasonally lower recurring CapEx of $24 million. Also in the quarter, we opened 3 new retail projects in 2 markets, Muscat and Singapore, have purchased land for development in Mexico City. Revenues from own assets increased to 60% of our total revenues. Our capital investments delivered strong returns, as shown on Slide 10. Our now 164 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Consistent with prior years, in Q1, we completed our annual refresh of IBX categorization. Our stabilized asset count increased by net 6 IBXs. These stabilized assets are collectively 87% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested.\nAnd please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2022 guidance and bridges. Do note our 2022 guidance includes the anticipated financial results from the MainOne acquisition, but does not include any results related to the pending Entel acquisition, which is expected to close in Q2.\nStarting with revenues for the full year 2022. We're very pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the organic business and excited to report that we now expect our revenues to increase on a normalized and constant currency basis by 10% over the prior year. Relative to our prior guidance, we're increasing our revenues by approximately $90 million, which includes our improved operating performance and $50 million of revenues from MainOne. We expect 2022 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 46%, excluding the integration costs, an increase of about $40 million compared to our prior guidance, which includes $20 million from MainOne. And we now expect to incur $25 million of integration costs in 2022.\nAnd given the operating momentum in the business, we're raising our underlying 2022 AFFO by $22 million to now grow between 8% and 10% on a normalized and constant currency basis compared to the previous year, offset by the increased debt financing costs from the MainOne and Entel acquisitions. Note the MainOne is expected to be immediately accretive, and we expect the Entel acquisition to be accretive when closed. 2022 AFFO per share is expected to grow between 7% and 8% on a normalized and constant currency basis. 2022 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, including approximately $170 million of recurring CapEx spend and about $60 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend.\nSo let me stop here. I'll turn the call back to Charles.\n\nCharles J. Meyers\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Equinix, Inc. (REIT)\n\nThanks, Keith. In closing, we had a tremendous start to the year. The demand backdrop for the business remains robust as enterprises across the globe continue to aggressively prioritize digital transformation and service providers expand their infrastructure globally in response to this demand. Data is being created, moved, manipulated, and stored at unprecedented levels. And the need to distribute infrastructure and position it in proximity to the broader digital ecosystem is fueling outsized demand for the distinctive value proposition and platform equities. Growth continues to outpace our Analyst Day expectations, thanks to strength across multiple simultaneous growth vectors for the business, expanding geographic reach, accelerating adoption of digital services, low churn, positive pricing trends and strong channel execution.\nWe continue to leverage our market-leading scale and expansive balance sheet to deliver new capacity, even in an increasingly challenging macro environment. And our bold future-first sustainability agenda guides and rallies our team as we collectively pursue our shared purpose to be the platform where the world comes together to create the innovations that enrich our work, our life and our planet. We are delighted with the ongoing performance in business, optimistic about the road ahead and remain keenly focused on delivering distinctive and durable value to our customers and to you, our shareholders.\nSo let me stop there and open it up for questions."

In the interest of wrapping this call up an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any following questions to just one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\n\nCharles J. Meyers\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Equinix, Inc. (REIT)\n\nThanks, Katrina. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We had a great finish to the year with our best bookings performance ever, driven by an exceptional demand backdrop for our business with continued strength across our platform, but more specifically in the Americas, low churn and continued momentum in our digital services portfolio.\nFor the full year, we achieved over $6.6 billion of revenue, marking our 76th consecutive quarter of top line increases, an amazing 19 years of continuous revenue growth while driving attractive AFFO per share to the bottom line. Amidst the dynamic and complex global landscape, we continue to deliver against our vision and our fiscal year results demonstrate both the increasing relevance of our platform and our uniquely differentiated value proposition.\nBusinesses globally continue to prioritize digital transformation as a foundational source of competitive advantage. And the secular drivers for our business have never been stronger as digital leaders demand infrastructure that is more distributed, more ecosystem powered, more flexible, more sustainable and more interconnected than ever before. Increasingly, Equinix represents a critical point of Nexus as customers implement hybrid and multicloud as the clear architecture of choice.\nAnd as the global market leader, we continue to innovate and expand our portfolio to respond to these evolving customer demands and capture the enormous opportunity ahead. As we look to 2022, the trajectory and underlying momentum in our business is exceptionally strong with a solid demand pipeline, stable churn and a rising price trend, resulting in a revenue outlook for the year that is at or above the high end of our long-term guidance range, and an AFFO per share outlook that is still within our long-term guidance range despite pressure at the gross margin line associated with power price volatility in Singapore.\nAbsent these specific dynamics, our underlying business performance would be producing AFFO per share growth towards the high end of our Analyst Day guidance, well ahead of our expectations. We have a robust global power hedging program, has been and we expect will continue to be highly effective at smoothing utility price volatility over the years, providing predictability and value across markets for Equinix and our customers. We believe the current dislocation in Singapore is transitory with power prices showing signs of moderating in the second half of the year.\nBottom line, the business is performing very well, and we remain on track to meeting or exceeding our Analyst Day objectives for both top line revenue and AFFO per share growth. And as we see the temporary headwinds moderate and continue to realize efficiency gains from prior year investments, we have a strong resolve and continued confidence in our ability to scale adjusted EBITDA margin to 50% by 2025.\nTurning to our results. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues for the full year were $6.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was also up 8% year-over-year, and AFFO per share grew 9% year-over-year. Interconnection revenues for the quarter grew 12% year-over-year with solid unit adds reflecting strong momentum with Equinix Fabric as expanding use cases drive connections to more locations and more counterparties. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis.\nOur global reach remains as important as ever. IEC predicts that by 2025, more than 50% of enterprise data will be generated at the edge and customers continue to see Equinix as the best manifestation of the digital edge. This competitive differentiation continues to drive our business with revenues from multi-region customers increasing 1% quarter-over-quarter to an impressive 75%. In December, we announced our long-awaited entry into Africa with our intended acquisition of [Main One], a leading West African data center and connectivity solution provider with a presence in Nigeria, Ghana and the Ivory Coast, set to close in early Q2.\nThis acquisition will mark the first step in Equinix's long-term strategy to become one of Africa's leading digital infrastructure providers and will position us well in the continent's largest economy. To fuel our ongoing global interconnection leadership, we're also targeting strategic Internet traffic flows by supporting and winning subsea cables, such as (inaudible) the first-ever subsea cable between Europe and Latin America, which recently went into operation with PoPs in our Sao Paolo 4, Lisbon 1 and [major 2] IVX and by entering new markets like our recently completed general Italy IBX and our newly announced IBX in (inaudible).\nOur data center services portfolio remains the bedrock of Platform Equinix, and we're excited about the recent appointment of John Lynn to the position of EVP and General Manager for data center services. John has delivered extraordinary results as the President of our Americas business and is a great choice to implement our strategy and extend our global market leadership in interconnected colocation. To that end, we continue to expand on our global footprint with 41 major projects underway across 28 metros in 19 countries, representing over 20,000 cabinets of retail and over 80 megawatts of xScale capacity.\nWe remain focused on simplifying, automating and digitizing our services, allowing us to scale our business and enhance operating leverage, and we're already seeing the results of these efforts. For example, we recently launched our new Secure Cab Express product, leveraging predeployed capacity to dramatically reduce cycle times and enable online quoting and ordering for our most commonly requested configurations. We expect to roll this new service out to customers in the coming quarters, driving increased customer responsiveness while simultaneously enhancing margins.\nOur global interconnection franchise continues to perform well and we now have over 419,000 interconnections on our industry-leading platform. In Q4, we added an incremental 7,500 organic interconnections as enterprises drive growth and further enhance our ecosystem density. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 6% quarter-over-quarter and 27% year-over-year with peak traffic in APAC surpassing 10 terabits per second for the first time as service providers increasingly look to IX with improved Internet traffic delivery.\nTurning to digital infrastructure services. Cloud computing has permanently reshaped customer expectations for speed and simplicity. Customers want to deploy infrastructure where they want it, when they want it, seamlessly integrating cloud-based workloads and private infrastructure and enabling agility and performance between the two. As a result, customers are embracing a broader set of our services combining fabric, metal and network edge to build virtual points of presence and our planned expansions will fully enable this capability across 30 markets by the end of 2022.\nFor the quarter, Equinix Fabric saw excellent growth, eclipsing $150 million in revenue run rate with 1/3 of our customers now using Fabric for a variety of use cases across a broad set of destinations. Our Equinix Metal business delivered strong results with a great mix of wins and new logos across verticals and a healthy backlog. And network edge saw continued traction with growth from new and existing customers as they use the service to implement WAN optimization and cloud-to-cloud routing.\nShifting to xScale. In January, we announced plans to expand xScale into South Korea with an agreement to establish a $525 million joint venture with GIC to develop 2 data centers in Seoul. Total investment in our various hyperscale joint ventures when closed and fully built out is now expected to be more than $8 billion across 36 facilities globally with more than 720 megawatts of power capacity.\nWe currently have 9 xScale builds under development. And during the quarter, we fully leased the first phase of our Frankfurt 11 asset and the first and second phases of our Sao Paulo 5 asset representing approximately 20 megawatts of capacity. Total xScale leasing is now over 130 megawatts, and our initial JV in EMEA is over 80% leased.\nNow let me cover some of the highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical had solid bookings quarter with healthy new logo activity led by the Americas as companies expand and optimize digital capabilities to support with the delivery and consumption of data at the edge. New wins and expansions included a Fortune 200 telecom company deploying infrastructure to support the U.S.'s first cloud-native, OPEN-RAND based 5G network.\nIndigo Networks, an Australian cable systems operator deploying digital infrastructure to support a new subsea cable across Southeast Asia, Australia and the U.S. and an African local telco deploying a network hub in Lisbon to improve peering and performance. Our enterprise vertical saw another quarter of record bookings as IDC predicts almost half of the global economy will be based on or influenced by digital in 2022, fueling strong demand for hybrid infrastructure. Q4 had particular strength in fintech, industrial services and energy subsegments, with wins and expansions, including NASDAQ, a Fortune 500 technology company scaling its cloud-enabled infrastructure to deliver ultra-low latency edge compute capabilities from our NY 11 data center in (inaudible). Avaya, a cloud communications and work stream collaboration company, implementing an edge data center strategy on Platform Equinix to streamline private connectivity for its customers. And ADT, U.S.'s leading smart home security provider embracing the cloud with an infrastructure modernization effort spanning multiple geographies.\nOur cloud and IT services vertical also had solid bookings this quarter, led by the software and infrastructure subsegments with good momentum in EMEA and APAC. Expansions included Zscaler, a leading Global 2000 security cloud provider, upgrading capacity for sustainable enterprise cloud transformation and growing network traffic at the edge. With technology, the Singaporean full suite IP service provider deploying on Equinix Metal and upgrading Fabric services to support quick and seamless business expansion.\nAnd Oracle, a top 5 global software provider deploying Fast Connect cloud on-ramps to support new regions in Singapore, Milan and Stockholm, bringing their total number of on-ramps available at Equinix to 24, more than any of their other partners. Our content and digital media vertical had strong lookings, led by the publishing and digital media subsegments and record channel activity. Expansions included Cloud Player, the U.S.-based global web infrastructure and security company upgrading and expanding their footprint in over 40 markets.\nIndex Exchange, a global ad tech marketplace, expanding compute nodes in APAC to manage traffic growth and a top 3 global credit agency deploying regional network and cloud hubs in APAC to support its operations. Our channel program delivered a record quarter to close the year, accounting for 40% of bookings and nearly 60% of new logos. And we have line of sight for channels to grow 50% of our bookings in the coming years as we enhance our systems and processes and leverage our diverse set of partners to scale our reach.\nWins were across a wide range of industry verticals and use cases with continued strength from strategic partners like Microsoft, Dell, Cisco, Google and BT, including a significant win with Wipro and AT&T, helping a utility company modernize its IT infrastructure in Europe and the U.S. So now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover results for the quarter.\n\nKeith D. Taylor\n\nCFO, Equinix, Inc. (REIT)\n\nThanks, Charles. Good afternoon to everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks by saying our business is performing exceedingly well, frankly, better than our expectations for both the quarter and year, and we're bringing our momentum into 2022.\nWe had a great end to the year, delivering record gross and net bookings with very strong channel activity while recording our highest ever recurring revenue step-up in the quarter. For the year, without any major acquisitions, revenues were up over $600 million, totaled over 17,500 deals in 2021, highlighting the tremendous scale and reach of our business and the velocity of our go-to-market engine. The Americas region continues to pick up steam growing 10% over the prior year, effectively double the rate approval from last year, benefiting from strong leadership and a distributed portfolio of highly interconnected IBX assets, resulting in record bookings and lower churn.\nFor the company, our churn settled at the lower end of our guided range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter for an average of 2.1% per quarter for the year, our lowest level since 2016, which is highly reflective of our strategy to put the right customer with the right application into the right IBX. Quite simply, the decisions we're making are strengthening and extending our leadership position as the world's digital infrastructure company.\nNow as previously discussed, perhaps top of mind for you, there are a number of macroeconomic factors that we continue to proactively manage such as supply chain, power costs, interest rates and inflation. As it relates to power costs, we're seeing approximately 130 basis points of end-year margin pressure due to the temporarily inflated power rates in Singapore and the lapping up the favorable BPPA settlements from Texas last February.\nFor 2022, we're predominantly hedged to meet our global car needs but intend to continue to layer in additional hedges for the remaining 22 exposure and to meet the demands for future periods as we navigate past this unusually volatile period. As Charles noted, we expect the market dislocation in Singapore to be transitory, largely given that current prices are significantly higher than any other markets that we operate in and the spot market rates that appear to be trending down, although they do remain volatile.\nAs reflected in our guidance, we expect second half margins to improve over the first half and we remain on our path to deliver against our Analyst Day adjusted EBITDA and AFFO margin expectations. As it relates to the rising interest rate environment, our balance sheet is very well positioned. We have minimal near-term exposure to rising interest rates with 95% of our debt fixed across a weighted average maturity period of over 9 years. And despite the recent increase in interest rates, the cost of oil remains at historically low levels, while we enjoy returns substantially higher than or multiples of our cost to borrow and WACC.\nOur financial strength continues to feel significant and our balance sheet, fueled by our strong cash generation capabilities, has great flexibility. With regards to supply chain and the inflationary pressures in the marketplace, we've invested heavily in a sophisticated and forward leaning procurement and strategic sourcing organization, allowing us to execute against a robust development pipeline across our platform, while continuing to deliver against our return expectations. This is not to say there isn't congestion in the supply chain, but we feel very well placed with our partners and suppliers, resulting in limited delays against our expectations.\nTo highlight that point, in the fourth quarter alone, we added 17 new projects to our IBX and xScale build program across 14 separate markets, while we completed 7 projects across 6 markets. Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter, note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $1.706 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year and above the top end of our guidance range due to strong business performance led by the Americas.\nConsistent with our expectation, nonrecurring revenue stepped down to 6% of total revenues in the quarter due to timing of large customer installations. Interconnection revenues were 19% of recurring revenues, but strong growth across all 3 regions reflecting the continued benefit of our global platform and diversified product portfolio. Q4 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $5 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates.\nGlobal Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $788 million or 46% of revenues, up 11% over the same quarter last year and above the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance and timing of spend. Q4 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included a $3 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and $5 million of integration costs. Global Q4 AFFO was $564 million, in line with our expectations while absorbing the anticipated and seasonally higher recurring CapEx investments similar to prior years. Q4 global MRR turn was 2% at the bottom end of our targeted 2% to 2.5% range.\nTurning to our regional highlights, whose full results were covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC and the Americas were the fastest MRR growing regions on a year-over-year normalized basis at 11% and 10%, respectively, followed by the EMEA region, which stepped back up to 9% year-over-year growth as expected. The Americas region had another outstanding quarter, delivering record bookings with robust channel activity, strong net positive pricing actions and lower churn.\nThe Americas momentum is broad-based with 24 of our 27 metros increasing gross bookings year-over-year, led by our Boston, Danbury, Mexico City, Los Angeles and Toronto markets. The former Bell Canada assets continue to perform better than expected, in part due to increasing carrier and cloud deployments in our key Canadian markets. Our EMEA region had a solid quarter with strong retail bookings by our U.K., dutch and German businesses. Interestingly, we're seeing growing customer interest in this region, given our sustainability efforts including the recently signed VPPA with a wind farm developer in Finland to cover over 30 megawatts of capacity.\nAnd finally, the Asia Pacific region had a solid quarter with strong pricing and new local activity. We're experiencing good momentum in India with the GPX assets performing well above plan. Although Singapore remains capacity constrained, we welcome the government's recent decision to lift the moratorium on new data center builds. Going forward, new construction will need to deliver strategic value and international connectivity for Singapore's digital economy, but also needs to be at the forefront of sustainability. We feel extremely well positioned to deliver against the government's criteria.\nNow looking at our capital structure. Please refer to Slide 8. At the year-end, we had unrestricted cash of approximately $1.5 billion, a step up from last quarter due to strong operating cash flow and approximately $400 million of ATM funding, offset by our investment and the dividend payment. In early January, we renegotiated our line of credit, providing us access to $4 billion of additional liquidity, while also increasing our financial flexibility under our new revised covenant package. Looking forward, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to funding our growth consistent with our investment-grade rating while staying focused on creating long-term value for our shareholders.\nTurning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $817 million, including a recurring CapEx of $86 million, a meaningful increase over the prior quarter as expected. We opened 7 major projects since our last call, including new IBXs in [Genoa,] Munich and Perth, and a new xScale asset in Osaka. We also purchased land for development in Dublin and Istanbul. Revenues from owned assets represent 59% of our recurring revenues.\nOur Kaplan methods delivered strong returns, as shown on Slide 10. Our now 158 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, the top end of our growth range as expected due to strong Americas growth. These stabilized assets are collectively 86% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested.\nAnd please refer to Slides 11 through 16 for our updated summary of 2022 guidance and bridges. To note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis, and our guidance does not include the anticipated results from the pending close of the Main One acquisition or any potential future capital market activities.\nStarting with revenues. For 2022, we expect top line growth of 9% to 10%, above the top end of our long-term range, reflecting the continued momentum in the business. MRR churn is expected to remain within our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter. We expect 2022 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 46%, excluding integration costs, the result of strong operating leverage and efficiency initiatives in the business, temporarily used by the higher utility expenses. We expect to incur $20 million of integration costs in 2022 for our various acquisitions.\n2022 AFFO is expected to grow 8% to 10% compared to the previous year, and the AFFO per share is expected to grow 7% to 8%. 2022 CapEx is expected to be approximately $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion, including approximately $100 million of on-balance sheet ex sales spend, which we expect to be reimbursed as we transfer these assets into the JV, and about $160 million of recurring CapEx spend.\nAnd finally, we expect our 2022 cash dividends to increase to slightly greater than $1.1 billion, a 10% increase over the prior year or an 8% increase on a per share basis. I'll stop here, and let me turn the call back to Charles.\n\nCharles J. Meyers\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Equinix, Inc. (REIT)\n\nThanks, Keith. In closing, we're immensely pleased with the underlying performance of our business and are as optimistic as ever about the opportunity in front of us. Although the transitory effects from power pricing impact elements of our 2022 guide. Our normalized results would indicate a business trajectory to put us meaningfully ahead of our Analyst Day expectations. We continue to work hard to further mitigate the in-year impacts of the Singapore power volatility and in parallel, intend to continue to strengthen our market-leading position as the world's digital infrastructure company by scaling and transforming our data center business, while also accelerating our digital services business to deliver on the promise of physical infrastructure at software speed.\nAnd we intend to continue to advance a bold ESG agenda, addressing the urgency of climate change with a commitment to climate neutrality by 2030 and fostering a culture and workplace where every person every day can confidently say, \"I'm safe, I belong and I matter.\" Of note, we were thrilled to recently receive a perfect score from the human rights campaign and be recognized as a best place to work for LGBTQ+ quality. And are proud to be ranked #1 in real estate in Just Capital's 2022 ranking of America's Most Just Companies.\nOver our nearly 25-year history, we have created and cultivated a foundational set of advantages, superior global reach, now spanning 66 metros in 27 countries. Advantaged access to the world's most powerful digital ecosystems with more than 10,000 customers and over half the Fortune 500, the world's most comprehensive and advanced interconnection platform and a track record of service excellence that gives our customers the peace of mind they deserve. These advantages are strongly aligned to market trends and nearly impossible to duplicate, a dynamic that continues to fuel strong growth in a rapidly expanding addressable market and we are confident will translate to compelling long-term value creation.\nAs we strive to fulfill our purpose to be the platform where the world comes together, enabling the innovations that enrich our work, our life and our plan. We will continue to show up every day remaining in service to our stakeholders, to each other, to our customers, to our communities and to you, our shareholders. So let me stop there and open it up for questions."

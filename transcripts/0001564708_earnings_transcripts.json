Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Florin\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal First Quarter 2026 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Lavanya Chandrashekar, Chief Financial Officer. [ We'll open with ] some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nThis call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, and adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\n\nRobert J. Thomson\n\nCEO & Director, News Corporation\n\nThank you, Mike. Following a sterling performance in fiscal 2025, one that marked a record year for profitability on a continuing operations basis, News Corp continued to increase both revenue and profitability in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 led by strength at Dow Jones and Digital Real Estate Services and bolstered by digital and AI related revenues. The positive signs came despite an uncharacteristically weak performance in book publishing, which has shown clear signs of improvement in recent weeks.\nThe book publishing results this quarter included a write-off related to the expected closure of a book distributor. But overall, our revenue for the period rose 2% versus the prior year to $2.14 billion, and total segment EBITDA increased by 5% to $340 million.\nNet income from continuing operations was $150 million, up from $149 million last year. And our adjusted EPS rose from $0.20 to $0.22 in the quarter. Clearly, our current cash position is robust, and we expect to generate strong free cash flow this fiscal year and have thus materially increased the rate of our share buybacks. We believe our shares are undervalued, given the sum of our valuable parts and our profit trajectory. So we will continue to focus on ways and means to maximize shareholder value.\nOne other notable misconception is the value of IP in the age of AI. Information and sophisticated data are the essence of AI. And without these essential ingredients, AI is but empty vacuous ignorant infrastructure, electricity without [ alacrity ], buildings without [ billings ], chips without [ jobs ]. Thankfully, we are seeing a positive trend with both enlightened companies and wise courts, deciding that creativity and content must not be stolen but purchased. Courtships and courts are both crucial components of our strategy. And I must salute Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI for being principal pioneers in understanding the inherent intrinsic value of actual intelligence.\nAs regards to other AI players, our [ woving and sewing ] continues at pace. But thankfully, the willing has gained traction, and we expect to announce further partnerships in the near future. We anticipate these deals will have a positive impact on our results. The courts are also increasingly in [ line ], and we and our authors certainly expect to benefit from the $1.5 billion award against Anthropic for its use of pirated books.\nIt is fair to say this will not be the last case of its kind, given the proliferation of piracy and increased scrutiny of shameless scraping by these epigonic enterprises. We would obviously prefer to partner and to limit lawyers' fees, but let me be absolutely clear to every large language model. However, large, however small, if you have received stolen goods, we intend to pursue you relentlessly. You may not have done the actual stealing, but receiving stolen property is an offense in legal jurisdictions around the world.\nContent crime does not and will not pay. As for our segments during the quarter, Dow Jones EBITDA rose 10% compared to a year earlier, following a solid 6% increase in revenue. Once again, we saw particularly strong revenue growth at Risk & Compliance, where revenues surged 16%, while Dow Jones Energy revenues were 7% higher. We expanded our offerings in the rapidly growing professional information business by acquiring Eco-Movement, which provides unique data sets that are sold to [ map ] providers and car manufacturers seeking to provide enhanced service for their customers.\nAt the Consumer business, total average subscriptions expanded 8% to [ 6.4 million ], including an 11% surge in digital-only subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal. Digital circulation revenues rose from 72% of total circulation revenues last year to 75%, and an increase in digital advertising revenue was offset by a marginal decline in print advertising. In total, digital accounted for 68% and of advertising revenues for the quarter, a new record.\nIn Digital Real Estate Services, we saw the beginnings of an expected renaissance in the U.S. real estate market as lower interest rates stimulated higher demand for housing. With the Federal Reserve cutting rates and the current 30-year mortgage rate approaching 6%, it is reasonable to conclude that we will be high-fiving when mortgage rates are in the high 5s.\nEven though the market was far from normalized in the first quarter, realtor.com, delivered a 9% revenue boost year-on-year. That result is a tribute to the concerted work of Damian Eales and his team. who have ensured that we are benefiting from more premium offerings and higher yields. The team has targeted 3 areas of growth: the sell side, new homes and rentals, which collectively comprised 22% of revenues this quarter, rising 3 percentage points over the prior year, and we see no reason to suggest the opportunities for growth will abate. We have been working to ensure that realtor.com provides a holistic real estate experience.\nOur moat is uniqueness and quality. So we have built in recent years, the largest publisher of original residential real estate news in the United States. as measured by visits per unique user by comScore, not by home brewed metrics. We are providing more reasons for potential buyers and sellers to come to our site, which is why our user metrics are patently superior to those of other sites. In September, we had the largest number of visits per user, clearly outstripping Zillow and other lesser sites. While revenue growth at realtor.com was superior to that at REA this quarter, we have seen increased signs of life in the Australian property market in recent weeks, with auction levels in Melbourne and Sydney on track for the most active October in recent years.\nFor the quarter, Revenue at REA Group rose 3% or 5% in constant currency, and yield grew by double digits. Overall, our margin in digital real estate rose from 30.6% a year ago to 33%. We welcomed a new Chief Executive to the business, Cameron McIntyre, who comes with a distinguished digital background and professional pedigree. There is no doubt that his predecessor, Owen Wilson, performed exceedingly well, and it is positive contribution will resonate at the company for many years to come. You will be able to welcome Cam and Lord Owen when REA formally delivers its results later today.\nBook Publishing faced blustery wins in the first quarter with orders slowing from both readers and retailers, and the write-off of a $13 million receivable due to the expected closure of a book distributor. The numbers last year were elevated by the dramatic resurgence of J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy after he was nominated as the vice presidential candidate. But it does appear that the sluggish market has turned in recent weeks. As orders have rebounded and our recent releases are thriving including that of R. F. Kuang, whose Katabasis has quickly become a bestseller. We are also seeing strong sales for the latest works by [ Mitch Albom ], Brett Bayer and [ Red Drummond ]. A collection of previously unreleased stories by [ Harper Lee ], author of The Killer Mockingbird has also become an instant hit. We look forward to the release later this month of Wicked for Good, which should bolster book sales through cross promotions and Movie Magic.\nIn religious books, we saw elevated interest in the Bible following the tragic assassination of Charlie Kirk. September Bible's sales revenue rose more than 65% compared to the prior year, with retailers reporting a significant influx of new and younger customers.\nAt News Media, revenues rose 1%, while EBITDA grew a resounding 67%. At the New York Post, preparations are underway for the launch of the California post early in the new year and the buzz around the project is already audible. We are taking advantage of the posts reach and influence, which expands with each passing day. One indication of the potency is the advertising revenue at the post, which lapped 19% year-over-year and nearly 90% of that advertising was digital.\nIt is also worth noting that our Rugby League team, the Brisbane Broncos, has just won the Australian version of the Super Bowl. That will provide a modest fill-up for our business in Australia and an immodest [ fillip to the mood ] in Queensland. Rebecca and the team in the U.K. oversaw continued growth at, The Times and Sunday Times, where digital subscribers rose from 600,000 to 640,000, while digital subscriptions at News Corp Australia expanded 3% to [ $1.162 ] million. Overall, our margin for the News Media business increased from 3.3% a year ago to 5.5%. The first quarter saw a positive start to fiscal 2026 even though there were temporary headwinds that obviously were not suspicion.\nThankfully, the wind direction has changed in recent weeks in the book business, and we look forward to building on that momentum through the second quarter and for the rest of the year. We are also confident in the outlook for digital real estate and Dow Jones and expect to continue aggressively pursuing our buyback in coming months. With that, I see to our insightful Chief Financial Officer, Lavanya Chandrashekar for further detail.\n\nLavanya Chandrashekar\n\nCFO & Director\n\nThank you, Robert, and good afternoon to everyone. I would like to start with an update on our capital allocation strategy. We are making strong progress in returning value to our shareholders through the accelerated and expanded share buyback program, which we announced in July 2025. Since we last reported earnings, we have repurchased at a rate of approximately $2.5 million per day over 4x the previous pace. We are confident in the company's growth potential and continue to believe the stock is trading at a significant discount to net asset value. As a reminder, we expect fiscal 2026 pacing to benefit from the repayment of approximately $380 million of Foxtel shareholder loans.\nThis quarter, our results demonstrate the continued strength and resilience of our digital businesses. particularly within Dow Jones and digital real estate services. Despite the backdrop of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and difficult prior year comparisons, especially in our book publishing business, our results underscore the benefits of our strategic diversification across recurring, high-margin content licensing and digital revenues. As a reminder, since fiscal 2018, the percentage of our business comprising digital revenues has almost doubled to 62% in fiscal 2025.\nDow Jones and Digital Real Estate, which together accounted for 29% of our revenue and 55% of our EBITDA in fiscal 2018 accounted for 49% of revenue and 84% of our EBITDA for fiscal 2025. On the other hand, our reliance on advertising revenue has reduced by almost 50% to just 16% of revenues for fiscal 2025.\nShareholder value accretive M&A in this decade has brought valuable assets such as Opus and CMA to our portfolio while divesting assets such as News America Marketing, and we have successfully exchanged Foxtel for a valuable stake in De zone, the Netflix of sports. There is always more to do on this front, and we remain committed to maximizing shareholder value.\nTurning to the results. News Corp reported fiscal first quarter revenues of over $2.1 billion, up 2% from the prior year and total segment EBITDA of $340 million, up 5% year-over-year. Total segment EBITDA was negatively impacted by a $13 million write-off of a receivable at HarperCollins related to the expected closure of 1 of its distributors. Margins improved from the prior year by 40 basis points to 15.9%.\nThis quarter, 89% of profits were from Dow Jones and Digital Real Estate Services, which we believe underscores the inherent value discount and the company's ability to drive long-term profit growth. First quarter adjusted revenues were up 2%, while adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 5% versus the prior year. Note that the adjusted result includes the [ $13 million ]write-off of the receivable at HarperCollins.\nFor the quarter, we reported earnings from continuing operations per share of $0.20 and compared to $0.21 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations per share were $0.22 in the quarter compared to $0.20 in the prior year.\nMoving to the individual segments, starting with Dow Jones. Dow Jones delivered another strong quarter with reported revenues of $586 million, up 6% versus the prior year period. Digital revenues accounted for 84% of Dow Jones segment revenue this quarter improving by 2 percentage points from last year. Professional Information business revenues, which reflect our B2B products and services, rose 10% year-over-year, repeating the Q4 fiscal 2025 growth rate.\nWithin that, risk and compliance revenues grew 16% to $94 million driven by new customers, new products and improved yield. We saw continued momentum from risk fees and API solutions and further penetration of advanced cleaning and monitoring products. At Dow Jones Energy revenue grew 7% to $73 million, with customer retention remaining very strong at approximately 90% and in addition to improving yields.\nAdmittedly, the rate of growth was lower than recent quarters, partially impacted by the timing of the World Chemical Forum event. In September, Dow Jones acquired Eco-Movement a leading global platform for EV charging station data, which collects and optimizes EV data across almost 2 million connectors across more than 80 countries. Eco-Movement strengthens Dow Jones Energy with best-in-class data and analytics and builds on Opus' energy transition activity in carbon markets, clean fuels, solar and hydrogen.\nFactiva returned to growth driven by lapping a customer contract dispute, which has now been settled and new customer acquisitions with a focus on GenAI. Within the Dow Jones consumer business, Circulation revenues increased 3% versus the previous year with digital circulation revenues up 8%. We recently raised the full price rate for, The Wall Street Journal digital subscription for new customers and to a portion of our tenured customers. Recognizing the value of our best-in-class journalism, we are actively reviewing our go-forward pricing strategy.\nDigital circulation revenues accounted for 75% of circulation revenues for the quarter, up from 72% in the prior year. Digital-only subscriptions improved by 10% year-over-year and by 159,000 sequentially, driven by enterprise customers. While ARPU dilutive, these are margin accretive. Wall Street Journal digital subscriptions increased 91,000 sequentially and were up 11% year-over-year. Advertising revenues were $85 million for the quarter, stable versus prior year, with digital up 2% and print down 4%.\nDigital represented 68% of advertising revenues up 1 point from the prior year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew a robust 10% to $144 million, with margins increasing to almost 25% and an increase of 90 basis points year-over-year. Moving on to digital real estate. Digital real estate had another solid quarter despite the uneven macro environment and softer listing volumes in Australia, driven by a tough prior year comparison. Segment revenues of $479 million were up 5% versus the prior year, an improvement to the growth rate in the prior quarter and up 7% on an adjusted basis.\nSegment EBITDA was $158 million, up 13% and up 16% on an adjusted basis. [indiscernible] , last year in this quarter, the EBITDA included $12 million of deal-related costs for the proposed offer to acquire Rightmove, which was subsequently withdrawn. REA revenues gained 3% year-on-year to $327 million and were up 5% on a constant currency basis. Growth was driven by a combination of residential yield increases and customer contract upgrades. Residential yield growth improved by 13%, driven by strong premium plus retention and the growth in extension products, including AMAX.\nNew buy listings in the quarter declined 8% with listings in Melbourne and Sydney down 4% and 6%, respectively, while home prices remained strong. Financial Services posted a strong improvement driven by higher settlements.\nIn September, the business divested PropTiger in India, and following recent regulatory changes impacting the commercial viability of the housing edge offering, REA India made the decision to discontinue this business in October. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call for more details. We are very pleased with the continued progress at realtor.com, which posted revenues of $152 million, up 9% compared to the prior year, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth and the highest quarterly growth rate in nearly 4 years.\nRevenue growth was driven by the continued strength of growth adjacencies, new homes, rentals and sellers which represented 22% of revenues in the quarter. Importantly, core real estate revenues also returned to growth this quarter as the strategic shift to higher intent and quality audiences is beginning to pay off. Strong penetration of Real Pro Select, a product targeted primarily at larger brokers led to higher annualized contract values. Lead volumes declined by just 1% with trends improving throughout the quarter, a notable improvement compared to the quarter 4 decline of 13%.\nAverage monthly unique users for the quarter fell 6% to 72 million. comScore data for the first quarter and the month of September highlighted that Realtor once again had the highest engagement amongst real estate portals at almost 5 visits per unique user. Realtor has also gained audience share with total visits reaching over double that of homes.com and that of Redfin, while narrowing the gap versus Zillow. The improvement reflects Realtor's focus on high-quality audiences and the benefits of the investments made to improve user experience and increase brand awareness.\nAt Book Publishing, as expected, very difficult prior year comparisons weighed on the results this quarter. The quarter was impacted by both timing of ordering and softer U.S. market conditions albeit trends improved in the recent weeks. Segment revenue of $534 million declined 2%, while segment EBITDA of $58 million declined $23 million or 28%, as mentioned earlier, EBITDA was negatively impacted by a $13 million receivable write-off relating to the expected closure of Baker & Taylor, a distributor focused predominantly on the library channel. While performance in the U.K. and Christian Publishing continue to be resilient, sales of general books were notably lower than the prior year. [ ReCollect ] this quarter last year benefited from a strong performance by J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy, the [ Bridgerton ] series and Wicked. Digital revenues at HarperCollins fell 9% with audio books down 11%, driven by the mix of titles compared to last year. In total, digital sales represented 23% of consumer revenues compared to 25% in the prior year. This quarter, the backlist contributed 65% of consumer revenues up from 64% last year. News Media had a very strong quarter, with revenues rising 1% to $545 million, led by higher cover and subscription prices in the U.K. and Australia.\nAdvertising trends were mixed but with notable strength at the New York Post. Segment EBITDA grew 67% to $30 million, driven by continued cost efficiencies. Turning to the outlook. Some of the themes across each of our segments. At Dow Jones, overall trends remain healthy, and we expect continued strong revenue growth in B2B, we also expect cost growth to be slightly higher in quarter 2, primarily due to the prior year comparisons.\nAt digital real estate, Australian residential new buy listing for October were down 3%, please refer to REA for more detailed outlook commentary. At Realtor, we hope that improving market conditions driven by a reduction in mortgage rates will lead to continued healthy revenue growth alongside growth in adjacencies.\nAt Book Publishing, October trends were encouraging, and we expect quarter 2 to benefit from the timing of ordering and a stronger front list. At News Media, despite difficult advertising trends, we are focused on continuing to drive cost efficiencies. We expect strong free cash flow in the current fiscal year despite anticipating capital spending to be up moderately from the prior year.\nThe increase in capital spending will be partially driven by an investment in new supply chain logistics facilities for HarperCollins, which should deliver additional cost savings and continued investment in technology. And as I mentioned at the start of my remarks, we expect to repurchase shares at an elevated rate reflecting our confidence in the company's growth potential, and we continue to believe the stock is trading at a significant discount to net asset value.\nWith that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Today's conference is being recorded. Media will be allowed on a listen-only basis. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Florin\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2025. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Lavanya Chandrashekar, Chief Financial Officer. We all have some prepared remarks, and we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nThis call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The -- the definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\n\nRobert J. Thomson\n\nCEO & Director, News Corporation\n\nThank you, Mike. We are honored to report a sterling performance sustained across the 4 quarters of fiscal 2025, which was a record year for profitability on a continuing operations basis. For the full year, revenues rose 2% to nearly $8.5 billion, and total segment EBITDA improved 14% to finish the year at just over $1.4 billion, a record for the company on a continuing operations basis. While our net income from continuing operations increased 71% to $648 million.\nProfit margins also increased by 170 basis points to 16.7%. For the fourth quarter, revenues rose 1% to $2.1 billion, while profitability grew 5% to $322 million, and net income from continuing operations rose a handsome 28% to $86 million. These robust record results have enhanced our financial position and thus our ability to return capital to shareholders. That potency was reflected in our free cash flow for fiscal 2025, which was $571 million compared to $540 million in the prior year, even though we expanded CapEx at Dow Jones including at its rapidly growing professional information business. Hence, the Board last month authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program. In addition to the approximately $300 million remaining from the previous $1 billion program authorized 4 years ago. As we indicated in our announcement, we expect to begin executing repurchases at an accelerated rate soon after the release of these results. In short, a significantly larger total and a significantly faster tempo.\nWe remain dedicated to driving value across our 3 pillars: Dow Jones, Digital Real Estate Services and Book Publishing, which accounted for the vast majority of our total segment EBITDA for the year. The recent sale of Foxtel Group to our partners at DAZN further focused our portfolio and bolstered our cash position, while the teams have made savvy acquisitions for all 3 of the core businesses over the past year. And it has also become big over the past year that discerning audiences crave content that is profound and purposeful empathy amidst a morass of mediocrity and mendacity. Our riders and journalists and creators of all kinds are conscious of both responsibility and the opportunity, cognizant that we are at a historic inflection point in the age of AI. That AI age must cherish the value of intellectual property if we are collectively to realize our potential. Much is made of the competition with China, but America's advantage is ingenuity and creativity, not bits and bytes, not watts, but with to undermine that comparative advantage by stripping away IP rights is to vandalize our virtuosity. We need to be more in line to unitize you now socially and commercially. Take the example of President Trump. He has written many successful books, in particular, the art of the deal, which is still reporting notable sales. Is it right that his books should be consumed by an AI engine, which then profits from his thoughts by cannibalizing his concepts, thus undermining future sales of his book.\nSuddenly, the art of the deal has become the art of the steel. Is it fair that creators are having their works per Lloyd? Is it just that the President of the United States is being ripped off. Companies are spending tens of billions on data centers, tens of billions on chips, tens of billions on energy generation. These same companies need to spend tens of millions or more on the content crucial for their success. And I need to ensure that the content ecosystem remains healthy that there is a vast range of varied and verifiable sources and that a deeply derivative work AI does not become the default pathway to digital decay. In the meantime, we will fight to protect the intellectual property of our authors and journalists and continue to win and to sue companies that violate the most basic property rights.\nTurning now to the segments. Dow Jones had another strong year, with revenue and EBITDA rising 4% and 8%, respectively. The business exited the year with strong momentum, reporting a healthy 7% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter to $604 million, significantly higher than the annual rate of 4%, while EBITDA for the fourth quarter rose 10% to $151 million. Our Professional Information business expanded revenues 10% overall for the fourth quarter, higher than the full year rate of 7%, supported by Risk & Compliance and Dow Jones Energy, where revenues increased by 21% and 12%, respectively, for the quarter. The addition of Dragonfly Intelligence and Oxford Analytica this quarter further solidified Risk & Compliance is a premier source for any business aiming to thoughtfully and legally navigate an increasingly complex global landscape.\nCompliance failures remain a serious issue for global financial institutions and sanctions regimes are a legal labyrinth. If no, your client is a priority, then you should strongly be a client of Dow Jones. At Dow Jones Energy, the team has created a portfolio of innovative products, including the global carbon market report and Rapro from Opus. This focus on our customers' emerging needs is a core factor behind our retention rates, which are north of 90% across Dow Jones Energy.\nFactiva showed improvement over the second half of the year, thanks to a new generative AI data product and a concentrated focus on courting new customers in sectors such as communications and public relations. On the consumer side of the business, we reported 10% growth in digital circulation revenues in the fourth quarter and saw increases in both print and digital advertising of 3% and 1%, respectively, as companies increasingly understood the power and the prestige of our platforms, including the Wall Street Journal, Barron's MarketWatch and investors business daily. Digital real estate revenues rose 9% for the year, while the segment posted increased EBITDA of 18%. At realtor.com, revenue grew for the third consecutive quarter in the fourth quarter despite the especially sluggish U.S. housing market. We are particularly pleased with the 3 growth areas targeted by Damian Eales and the team. Revenue across rentals, new homes and seller accounted for 24% of revenues for the quarter, a rise of 5 percentage points year-over-year. These trends provide evidence that realtor should thrive when the U.S. housing market ultimately nears normalcy after a period of punitively high mortgage rates and remarkably low turnover. Realtor's reach has extended despite the depressed markets with the share of visits significantly expanding in June when there were 256 million visits, 4x that of Homes.com and more than twice that of Redfin according to comScore. We are working to enhance our relationship with the National Association of Realtors to the benefit of both partners and crucially to the benefit of American seeking to buy or to sell a home.\nREA posted another healthy year in fiscal 2025, with 12% revenue growth or 13% on a constant currency basis to $1.25 billion, while audience reach saw continued improvement. For the year, realestate.com.au saw an average of 132 million visits per month, 4x that of the nearest competitor. In fact, 12.1 million people visited the site each month, of which 6.4 million were exclusive to REA. There is no question that REA's business thrives on competition. and we look forward to meeting the changes and the challenges ahead in the Australian market with our customary spirit of creativity and innovation. Book Publishing posted its second best revenue year on record in fiscal 2025, with a 3% increase to $2.1 billion, while segment EBITDA expanded by 10% to $296 million. Margins were nearly 14% for the year, an improvement of over 90 basis points compared to the prior year.\nPerformance was weighted in the first half, due in part to the impact of a strong frontlist schedule and the success of Hillbilly Allergy and Wicked. We have seen softness in the overall book market in more recent months. And that trend was reflected in some of our divisions, though our allergies and Children's Book divisions continue to perform well. Key titles scheduled for fiscal 2026 should portend positively for the full year with a new book from Daniel Silver last month and upcoming works from the Pioneer Woman re Drummond, Mitch Album and RF Kong. Sylvester Stallone's memoir, The Steps, will no doubt prove inspiring upon its release in November, and we are looking forward to the exclusive release of previously unpublished stories by Harper Lee, the author of Tickle Mockingbird. Our global reach was enhanced by the agreed acquisition of Crunchy Rolls Manga publishing operations in France and Germany. And that transaction is expected to close before the end of this calendar year. We already have a strong network of Manga contracts through our book business in Japan and believe that our team's collective expertise will enable us to prosper from one of the fastest-growing sections of the reading market.\nDigital revenues grew 5% for the year, supported by the partnership with Spotify, who last month announced plans to expand audio book offerings for premium customers in the U.K., Australia and parts of Europe. In News Media, profitability improved 15% for the year despite a challenging advertising environment, reflecting our editorial creativity and cost consciousness. There are also benefits to our mastheads from our digital partnerships with the principal platforms and subscription growth at News UK and News Corp Australia. The Times and Sunday Times in particular, again, built on their healthy circulation base, closing the year with 640,000 paying digital subscribers compared to 594,000 a year ago. The phenomenal expansion influence and the improvement in profitability over the past decade of the New York Post continued in the last year. The masthead plays a unique role in the New York area. But also far beyond and to reflect that prowess, we have just announced plans to expand in California, which surely needs the packaged profundity that characterizes the post. Soon, all will not be quiet on the Western front.\nTo conclude, the fiscal year with such impressive results against the backdrop of complex macro conditions and political dynamics is a testament to our transformation. That work simply would not be possible without the astute leadership of Lachlan Murdoch, the support of an enlightened Board and the enduring resonance of our Chairman Emeritus, Rupert Murdoch. We also salute the invaluable contributions of our employees around the world.\nAnd now I see to Lavanya Chandrashekar, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide granularity and sagacity.\n\nLavanya Chandrashekar\n\nCFO & Director\n\nThank you, Robert, and good afternoon. As Robert highlighted, fiscal 2025 marked a big step in the transformation of News Corp as we continue to expand into high-margin content licensing and increased recurring and digital revenues. We streamlined our asset base with the divestiture of Foxtel Group and have been relentless on cost management while continuing to invest in our core pillars of Dow Jones, digital real estate services and Book Publishing. We finished the fiscal year and the fourth quarter yet again delivering strong financial results, including improved year-over-year margins in each quarter, underscoring the durability of our brands and benefits of diversification.\nBefore discussing the financial results, I will discuss capital allocation, which is one of my key priorities. Bear announcement last month and to reiterate Robert's point, the Board authorized a new $1 billion buyback program in addition to the approximately $300 million remaining under the existing program, providing $1.3 billion of total capacity. We expect the pace of the program will meaningfully increase from the current rate and expect that fiscal 2026 pacing will benefit from the approximately $380 million of proceeds from repayment of Foxtel shareholder loans. We believe the stock is trading at a significant discount to net asset value and believe equity shrinkage is a lever to attack that discount. Importantly, we expect to maintain plenty of financial flexibility and continue reinvesting to drive further growth.\nFor today's discussion, I will focus on the fourth quarter performance. As a reminder, Foxtel's financial results are reflected as discontinued operations for fiscal 2025 and 2024. We closed the Foxtel transaction in early April and have disclosed recast financials in the previous 8-K filing. News Corp reported fiscal fourth quarter revenues of $2.1 billion, up 1% from the prior year and total segment EBITDA of $322 million, up 5% year-over-year. Margins improved by 60 basis points to 15.3%. This quarter, 94% of profits were from Dow Jones and digital real estate, which we believe underscores the inherent value discount and the company's ability to drive long-term profitable growth. Fourth quarter adjusted revenues were flat, while adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 6% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings from continuing operations per share of $0.09 compared to $0.08 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations per share were $0.19 in the quarter compared to $0.20 in the prior year.\nMoving to the individual segments, starting with Dow Jones. Dow Jones delivered another strong quarter with reported revenues of $604 million, up 7% versus the prior year period, marking the highest quarterly rate of growth this year and was again the largest segment contributor to overall company revenues. Digital revenue accounted for 83% of Dow Jones segment revenues this quarter, improving 2 percentage points from last year. Professional Information business revenues, which reflect our B2B products and services, rose 10% year-over-year, the highest quarterly year-over-year growth this fiscal year. Within that, risk and compliance revenues grew 21% to $92 million, driven by new customers, new products and improved yield. We continue to see strength in several products including advanced screening and monitoring and our financial instruments product.\nWe also benefited from the addition of Dragonfly Intelligence and Oxford Analytica, which contributed approximately $4 million to revenues. Integration of those assets is ahead of plan with joint editorial and product initiatives across both Risk and Compliance and Dow Jones Energy. At Dow Jones Energy, revenue grew a healthy 12% to $73 million with customer retention remaining very strong at over 90% in addition to improving yields. Newswires also saw modest growth due to new licensing deals, while Factiva continued to be negatively impacted by a customer dispute, albeit the decline rates have continued to moderate through the second half of the year. Across our B2B products, higher volumes, including new customers and new products accounted for 60% of revenue growth with higher yields accounting for the balance.\nWithin the Dow Jones consumer business, Circulation revenues increased 5% versus the prior year. Notably, digital circulation revenues grew by 10%, surpassing our expectations. This increase was driven by growth in digital-only subscriptions and the ongoing shift of customers from introductory and bundled promotions to higher pricing strategies. Digital circulation revenues accounted for 75% of circulation revenues for the quarter up from 71% in the prior year. Digital-only subscriptions improved 9% year-over-year and by 176,000 sequentially, including the benefit of our recent enterprise partnership with [indiscernible]. WSJ Digital subscription increased 213,000 sequentially and were up 9% year-over-year. Advertising revenues of $104 million rose 2%, with year-over-year trends improving each quarter. For the quarter, print advertising revenues increased 3%, while digital grew by 1%, both benefiting from the strength in finance and technology sectors. Digital represented 65% of advertising revenues compared to 66% in the prior year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 10% to $151 million with margins increasing to 25%.\nMoving on to Digital Real Estate. Digital Real Estate had another solid quarter despite the macro environment and softer listing volumes in Australia, driven by a tough prior year comparison. Segment revenues of $466 million were up 4% versus the prior year and up 6% on an adjusted basis. Segment EBITDA was $152 million, up 13% and up 16% on an adjusted basis. REA revenues gained 4% year-on-year to $318 million and were up 7% on a constant currency basis. Growth was driven by a combination of residential yield increases and customer contract upgrades. Residential yield growth improved by 14%. New by listings in the quarter declined 8% following a 16% increase in the same quarter last year. Listings in Melbourne and Sydney were down 11% and 10%, respectively, while home prices remained strong. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call for more details.\nRealtors revenue for the quarter of $148 million grew 3% compared to the prior year, marking the third consecutive quarter of revenue growth despite continued difficult macro conditions. At Realtor, revenue growth was driven by the continued strength of growth adjacencies, new homes, rentals and seller, which represented 24% of revenues in the quarter. Realtor continues to focus on higher-quality leads through the Real Pro Select offering, which once again drove an increase in revenue per lead in the quarter. Lead volumes declined 13% and an improvement compared to the quarter 3 decline of 17%. Average monthly unique users for the quarter fell 3% year-over-year to 72 million. That said, based on comScore, Realtor continues to maintain audience share and grow share of visits, benefiting from continued search engine optimization and the scale of New Corp's global audience. Expenses at realtor were modestly higher as expected, due to the launch of a new brand campaign. Realtor recently announced the acquisition of Zendlest, a mobile-first communication platform, which provides a unified search experience for agents and customers. The tool is being used by 35,000 plus agents and will be integrated as another enhancement to our products.\nAt Book Publishing, as expected, very difficult prior year comparisons weighed on the results this quarter. The quarter was also impacted by softer U.S. market conditions per AAP data. Segment revenues of $494 million declined 4%, while segment EBITDA of $50 million declined $7 million or 12%, while performance in Christian Publishing continued to be resilient, sales of general books were lower than the prior year. ReCollect this quarter last year had a dual benefit of a stronger front list and a stronger backlist from Bridgeton. Digital revenues at HarperCollins fell 3% to $116 million, lapping the start of the Spotify partnership last year and driven by a weaker front list. In total, digital sales represented 25% of consumer revenues compared to 24% in the prior year. This quarter, the backlist contributed 65% of consumer revenues up from 62% last year.\nTurning to News Media. Overall revenue performance was challenged with continued soft advertising conditions partially offset by increased cover prices and subscription pricing across mastheads. Revenue for the quarter were $545 million, down 4% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues fell 4%. Segment EBITDA declined $4 million or 13% year-over-year to $28 million. Lower advertising revenues were partially offset by ongoing cost reductions. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 18%.\nTurning to the outlook. Some of the themes across each of our segments. At Dow Jones, trends remain healthy, and we expect continued margin expansion as the business shifts to B2B. At digital real estate, Australian residential new buy listings for July were down 8%. Please refer to REA for more detailed outlook commentary.\nAt Realtor, we continue to focus on growth adjacencies, including the integration of Zenlist acquisition. We hope to see continued revenue improvement and much will depend on the broader housing market. At Book Publishing, July trends were soft and comparisons are difficult given the strong backlist performance last year due to Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance. At News Media, we expect recent trends to continue.\nWith that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Today's conference is being recorded. Media will be allowed on a listen-only basis.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor of Investor Relations.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nMichael Florin\n\nSenior Vice President & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, Operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com.\nOn the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Lavanya Chandrashekar, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks, and we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautious statements regarding forward-looking information.\nAdditionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings releases for the applicable periods posted on our website.\nWith that, I will pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\n\nRobert Thomson\n\nThank you, Mike. News Corp had yet another fruitful quarter qualitatively and quantitatively. Revenues on a continuing operations basis, which excludes Foxtel, grew 5% to $2.24 billion, while profitability rose 20% to $478 million as we made significant progress in our digital development.\nA few more metrics to highlight our performance. Net income from continuing operations surged to $306 million, a 58% increase compared to the same quarter in the previous year. That is correct, 58%. While our EPS from continuing operations was $0.40 compared to $0.28 in the prior quarter. And our overall margin rose from 18.7% to 21.4%.\nOur 3 pillars of growth, Digital Real Estate, Dow Jones, and Book Publishing continued to expand their segment EBITDA robustly, while we saw the positive impact of rigorous cost discipline and digital development in our News Media segment. With a keen eye on our innate strengths, we took a significant step towards simplification with the agreement to sell Foxtel to DAZN, a premier global sports streaming provider, for a total enterprise value of AUD 3.4 billion or approximately 7x Foxtel's fiscal 2024 EBITDA.\nThe agreement is a tangible recognition of Foxtel's successful digital transformation and should surely benefit our shareholders, our partners at DAZN and all Australian sports fans. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of the current fiscal year, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Hence, Foxtel financials are now reported as discontinued operations. The sale of Foxtel should have a meaningful impact on our balance sheet. Upon closing, Foxtel's outstanding shareholder loans will be repaid in full, including AUD 574 million to News Corp while its third-party debt will be transferred with the business. News Corp will also hold an approximate 6% stake in the fast-growing DAZN. We are proud to be long-term partners with the DAZN team and see material value upside potential in the growth of a company that is at the cutting edge of international sports development. I encourage all to download their app and delve into a vast range of sports.\nIn the wake of this important deal, we were delighted that both S&P Global and Moody's upgraded our credit rating to investment grade, reflecting the impact of our long-term strategy of focused investment and an emphasis on return of invested capital. We certainly lead the way in providing priceless content for generative AI and remain vigilant in our pursuit of degenerative AI and abuses of our intellectual property. We are pleased with our partnership with OpenAI and hope that other companies in the segment take a similarly enlightened approach.\nOur legal action against the perplexity is underway, and we look forward with relish to document discovery. We firmly believe that this discovery process will be an important phase, not just for us, but for all who cherish the sanctity of IP. The sudden rise of DeepSeek is itself a salutary lesson for all AI players. If they are unable to host fresh, trusted news, their version of AI will lack immediacy and relevance. Data centers and energy sources and [indiscernible] chips may well be essential AI infrastructure. But ultimately, we believe content will be king in the world of AI.\nOne rather general generic post-election observation. We are seeing a tangible increase in business confidence here in the U.S. since the election, the temporary turmoil of transactional tariffs aside. There is a confluence of economic optimism and a cultural awakening with the yoke of woke having been lifted. We believe these trends should lead to less superfluous gratuitous regulation, greater capital formation, increased opportunities for all Americans, and more candid creative, compelling conversations.\nHopefully, an era of censorship and self-censorship is receding into the distance. As for specific segments, Digital real estate revenue increased 13% to $473 million and segment EBITDA burgeoned 26% to $185 million. That strength came despite significant growth in the prior year quarter at REA and reflected renewed revenue growth at realtor.com despite the still hostile housing market conditions in the U.S. with the 30-year mortgage rates above 7% in recent weeks.\nClearly, realtor.com's efforts to strengthen adjacent revenue streams are paying off with accelerated growth in rental, seller and new homes revenues. Realtor continues to make significant progress in engagement as evidenced by the highest repeat visitation and most number of views per visit in the industry in December as per Comscore.\nAt REA, the success story continues as the company achieved a quarterly record in revenue while extending its audience leadership and reinforcing its position as Australia's preeminent property site. REA achieved 129 million average monthly visits during the quarter, nearly 4x more than the nearest competitor on average. Listing volumes rose 4% with yield growth at 14%, while our India division continued to post healthy revenue growth.\nAt Dow Jones, revenue grew 3% to $600 million. Segment EBITDA expanded 7% to $174 million and margins rose an impressive 110 basis points. While overall performance in the first half of the fiscal year has been strong, we expect year-over-year growth to increase in the second half of the year. In Q2, digital circulation revenue grew year-over-year at its fastest pace in 2 years as digital ARPU improved sequentially and the conversion from introductory promotions and digital bundle offers ran ahead of expectations.\nReaders derive significant value from our prestige portfolio of the Wall Street Journal, Barron's, IBD and MarketWatch. And we believe there is potential for revenue improvement as we emphasize the strength and the distinctiveness of individual titles. Risk and Compliance and Dow Jones Energy reported revenue growth of 11% and 10%, respectively. And the teams continue to benefit from new products such as advanced screening and monitoring and Analytics Pro that add meaningful value for our compliance-focused risk-averse clients.\nNew initiatives contributed about 1/3 of B2B revenue growth this quarter. Now more than ever, Dow Jones Risk and Compliance clients are navigating rapidly changing regulations and sanctions. This complex environment in the U.S. and globally boosts demand for risk and compliance products as organizations rely on our expert insights and comprehensive data to make informed decisions and to stay compliant. The uncertainty regarding the transactional tariffs is driving demand for Dow Jones Energy's insights and forecasting services as clients seek to understand the potential impact on global energy markets and investment opportunities.\nBook Publishing reported yet another exceptional quarter with revenue expanding 8% to $595 million and segment EBITDA surging 19% to $101 million. Growth in the quarter was powered by strong Bible sales, a sterling performance at HarperCollins U.K. and a healthy mix of titles. Margins improved thanks to buoyant sales of backlist books and a particularly noteworthy 13% increase in audio revenue. Among the best sellers, the Pumpkin Spice Cafe and the first volume of shares memos were standouts. The successful cinematic release of Wicked led to strong sales of Gregory Maguire's 4 book series, and we anticipate a further boost from the next installment in that series. The positive cycle should continue with the release of the hit film sequel later this calendar year.\nAt News Media, revenue fell a modest 2% to $570 million, but segment EBITDA grew an impressive 30% to $74 million. Success in the quarter was driven by the transition of Talk in the U.K. to streaming and our commercial printing partnership with DMG as well as reduced costs at News Australia. Overall ad trends moderated, while the Times posted its largest quarterly net additions of paid digital subscriptions in 2 years.\nDigital advertising grew by 13% at the New York Post, where profitability was also assisted by our OpenAI deal. News Media generally has clearly benefited from those OpenAI revenues, and we are pleased with the progress in our partnership with Sam Altman and his exceptional colleagues. Content is but one part of a broad deal. And for example, our legal and government affairs teams are swapping ideas and experiences as we negotiate the nuances of AI. As part of our partnership, News Corp content will be featured in OpenAI's new operator product, ensuring prominence for our journalism in the burgeoning world of agentic AI. Both companies are striving to ensure that the A in AI does not stand for any [indiscernible] alphabetic or absurdity. In a world in which so many media companies and mastheads are in terminal decline, our business is thriving, thanks certainly to the diligent and creative work of our talented teams and the savvy strategic guidance of Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch and our astute Board of Directors.\nSpeaking of talent, I am honored to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Lavanya Chandrashekar, who will eloquently expand on the exegesis.\n\nLavanya Chandrashekar\n\nCFO & Director, Diageo plc\n\nThank you, Robert, for the kind introduction. I am delighted to be with all of you today and look forward to meeting many of you in the coming months. I'm excited to join News Corp amid the company's continued impressive digital evolution. As Robert mentioned in December, we announced an agreement to sell Foxtel to DAZN, which for News Corp will allow for a greater focus on our core growth pillars, will meaningfully strengthen our balance sheet and should reduce our future capital intensity. Turning to the quarter. Foxtel's financial results are reflected as discontinued operations for fiscal 2025 and 2024 second quarter and year-to-date periods, and subscription video service is no longer a reportable segment.\nI will not speak to Foxtel's results on this call, and they are excluded from the numbers I will be discussing today, but more information will be available in the 10-Q to be filed tomorrow morning. We will also be filing an 8-K with recast historic financial information. News Corp reported fiscal second quarter revenues on a continuing operation basis of $2.2 billion, rising 5% year-over-year and total segment EBITDA of $478 million, increasing 20% year-over-year. Margins improved by nearly 270 basis points to 21.4%. The 3 core pillars, Dow Jones, Digital Real Estate and Book Publishing, collectively grew revenue by 7% and segment EBITDA by 16%.\nSecond quarter adjusted revenues rose 4% compared to the prior year, with the difference from reported primarily due to currency impact, while adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 20% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings from continuing operations per share of $0.40 compared to $0.28 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations per share were $0.33 in the quarter compared to $0.27 in the prior year. Moving to the individual segments, starting with Dow Jones. Dow Jones reported revenues of $600 million, up 3% year-over-year, similar to the first quarter and was again the largest segment contributor to overall company revenue. Digital revenue accounted for 81% of total Dow Jones segment revenue this quarter, improving 3 percentage points from last year.\nOverall, Professional Information business revenue, which reflects our B2B products, rose 4% year-over-year, notwithstanding an over 300 basis point adverse impact from Factiva, primarily due to the ongoing customer dispute that we mentioned last quarter, with the impact greater in the second quarter. This quarter, the growth came from new customers, new products and improved yield at Risk and Compliance, which grew 11% to $80 million, including a modest negative FX impact due to European exposure and Dow Jones Energy, which grew 10% to $68 million with customer retention remaining very strong at over 90%. During the quarter, Risk and Compliance enhanced its product offerings with the acquisition of WorldECR, a London-based provider of export control and trade sanction news.\nAnd in energy, we continue to see strong demand for newer products associated with carbon, retail fuels and liquefied petroleum gas and experienced robust pipelines and strong closing rates. Within the Dow Jones Consumer business, circulation revenues rose 3% versus the prior year, benefiting from improved digital circulation revenues of 8%, double the quarter 1 rate and the highest quarterly growth in 2 years. We have started to benefit from the conversion to higher pricing from our digital subscriptions added in the past year by introductory promotional offers.\nDigital ARPU also increased quarter-over-quarter. Digital circulation revenues accounted for 73% of circulation revenues for the quarter, up from 70% in the prior year. Digital-only subscriptions improved by 13% year-over-year and by 27,000 sequentially, negatively impacted by the phasing of marketing promotions and seasonality, particularly related to students and some industry headwinds from search algorithms. That said, we do expect stronger volumes in the third quarter. Bundling subscriptions for the quarter improved by 45% year-over-year to over 950,000 while also benefiting from improved yield with the focus on the 3-product bundle of Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch and Barron's.\nPrint volume declined by 16% year-over-year, but its sequential decline was the lowest since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Advertising revenue of $121 million moderated from the prior quarter to a decline of 4% year-over-year as print declined 10% with digital flat, an improvement from the first quarter. Digital represented 64% of advertising revenues, up from 62% last year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 7% to $174 million, with margins increasing to 29%. Moving on to Digital Real Estate. Digital Real Estate had another exceptional quarter with segment revenues of $473 million, up 13% versus the prior year and 12% on an adjusted basis. Segment EBITDA was $185 million, up 26%, driven by higher profit contribution from REA Group, the highest growth since 2021.\nAdjusted segment EBITDA grew 25%. REA had an outstanding quarter with revenues rising 17% year-on-year to $343 million, marking its highest-ever quarterly revenue on record. Growth was again driven by a combination of residential yield increases, continued strong growth in national listings, and customer contract upgrades. Residential yield growth improved by 14%. New buy listings rose approximately 4% with Sydney and Melbourne each up 2%. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call for more details.\nRealtor's revenue for the quarter of $130 million were up 2% compared to the prior year, marking the first year-over-year improvement since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. At Realtor, real estate revenues were essentially flat as lower referral and lead generation revenues were largely offset by accelerating growth from adjacencies. Lead volumes fell 2%, while average monthly unique users for the quarter fell 6% year-over-year to 62 million at realtor.com. However, Realtor continues to maintain strong audience share despite much higher competitive marketing spend, underscoring the strength and quality of their audience.\nRealtor also continued to show strong traction on new revenues as seller, new home and rentals represented 20% of revenues, and we anticipate continued strong growth in these adjacencies going forward this fiscal year. At Book Publishing, momentum from the prior year continued with the year-over-year growth improving from first quarter with revenues of $595 million, up 8%, while segment EBITDA improved by 19% to $101 million. Margins expanded by 150 basis points to 17% as positive operating leverage was underpinned by strong digital and backlist performance. We saw strong growth in Christian Publishing from higher Bible sales and very strong sales in the U.K., as Robert mentioned. Harper continued to benefit from strong physical book orders and continued robust audiobook growth across all regions.\nHarperCollins posted digital revenues of $120 million, increasing 9% from the prior year, driven by strong audiobook growth across all regions, including increased adoption at Spotify and increased performance from Audible. In total, digital sales represented 21% of consumer revenue, in line with the prior year. Audiobooks grew 13% year-over-year, a slower rate than quarter 1 as we began to lap the initial rollout from Spotify in the U.K., Australia and U.S. The backlist contributed 61% of consumer revenues, up from 60% last year. Turning to News Media. Overall revenue performance improved from the first quarter with advertising declines moderating and the segment benefited from increased cover prices and subscription pricing across mastheads.\nRevenues for the quarter were $570 million, down 2% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues fell 3%. Note that both periods were recast to include the contribution from Sky News Australia, which previously had been included in the subscription Video Service segment. Sky News contributed $17 million in revenues, flat compared to the prior year. Segment EBITDA showed strong improvement, rising 30% year-over-year, driven by cost savings initiatives, as we mentioned last quarter, most notably at the U.K. from the benefits of the commercial printing joint venture with DMG Media and lower top costs. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 28%.\nTurning to the outlook. Market trends remain mixed geographically. And given the current spot rates for the Australian dollar and pound sterling versus the U.S. dollar, we expect currency translation to be a headwind in the second half. Some of the themes across each of our segments. At Dow Jones, the team remains focused on B2B growth, including upselling and new products across Risk and Compliance and Dow Jones Energy. As Robert mentioned, for total Dow Jones, we expect to see improvement in growth in the second half. We expect expenses to be modestly higher year-over-year due to investment, notably in B2B. However, we will continue to focus on cost efficiencies to drive growth.\nAt Digital Real Estate, Australian residential new buy listings for January were up 3%. Refer to REA for more detailed outlook commentary. Realtor.com will continue to focus on technology improvements and enhanced content and product offerings with the goal to be best positioned to drive share when the housing market recovers. We hope to see some revenue improvement, notably from continued growth from adjacencies, but continue to monitor macro trends. We currently expect the rate of reinvestment to be modestly higher in the second half as we continue to focus on growth initiatives.\nAt Book Publishing, as mentioned last quarter, we hope to see further profit improvement in fiscal 2025, albeit likely at a much more modest rate due to difficult prior year comparisons and quarter 3 will be impacted by phasing of frontlist releases. At News Media, while we expect the segment to continue to benefit from lower Talk TV costs, together with savings associated with the new commercial printing joint venture with DMG in the U.K., advertising conditions remain difficult with limited visibility and coupled with ForEx headwinds, we anticipate a more challenging second half. As mentioned last quarter, we expect other segment costs to be higher than last year, including ongoing AI and related legal costs.\nWith that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Florin\n\nSenior Vice President & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. .\nOn the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nThis call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautious statements regarding forward-looking information.\nAdditionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website.\nWith that, I will pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\n\nRobert Thomson\n\nThank you, Mike. Before we begin the examination of our excellent fourth quarter results, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to all who contributed to the emancipation of Evan Gershkovich. His freedom was made possible by the concerted efforts of concerned, principled people who recognized that his incarceration was unjust and immoral. And so many thanks are due to our leaders at Dow Jones, Emma Tucker and Almar Latour and to all at News Corp who campaigned vigorously for Evan's release.\nWe also acknowledge the sterling work of the U.S. government, which I oversaw the handover and the role of several other enlightened governments whose divine interventions were crucial.\nAs for the fourth quarter, revenues grew 6% from the prior year to almost $2.6 billion, while profitability improved by a healthy 11% to $380 million, a fourth quarter record for News Corp.\nReported EPS and net income were also markedly higher. Moreover, despite the negative impact of high interest rates in some of our businesses, fiscal 2024 was the second best year on record with profitability rising 8% to $1.54 billion. Our core pillars of growth book publishing, Digital Real Estate Services and Dow Jones inspired that increasing profitability and revenue growth, and we believe their strength augurs well for fiscal '25.\nPrior to delving into the details, I would like to highlight several consequential matters for our company. We took a significant step to prepare for an [ e-book ], which we believe will be defined by the confluence of artificial intelligence and emotional intelligence.\nOur landmark agreement with OpenAI is not only expected to be lucrative but will enable us to work closely with a trusted preeminent partner to fashion a future for professional journalism and for provenance. That partnership is already fructifying. We have also begun to take legal steps against the Gen AI aggressive, the egregious aggregators who are less principled and more predatory in their confiscation of our content.\nSo-called Open source can never be a justification for open slather. We are also considering our legal options in confronting the blatant political bias of advertising industry bodies who have done serious damage and denied many advertisers access to a significant audience.\nWe applaud the work of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee in pursuing the misnomer that is the Global Alliance for Responsible Media or GAM, and its coordinated boycott of media platforms perceived to be unfashionable by iliberal liberals. GAM harm has been real, and there need to be commercial consequences.\nWe believe the company's prospects are patently propitious, and we are also continuing to review our portfolio with a view to maximizing returns for shareholders. That review has coincided recently with third-party interest in a potential transaction involving the Foxtel Group, which has been positively transformed in recent years with record numbers of streaming subscribers, low broadcast churn and rising and broadcast and streaming ARPU.\nWe had no imminent intent to sell Foxtel but are reviewing potential strategic and financial options for the business with our advisers and engaging with third parties in light of that external interest.\nThat process should not be interpreted as a sign that we are not reviewing the status of other segments. As I mentioned, we were not actively looking for purchases and we believe strongly in the potential of Foxtel, given its world-class technology and unique aggregation of sports and entertainment content.\nWith that context, let us analyze the laudable performance in the fourth quarter. Digital Real Estate had a particularly strong quarter as revenues rose 21% and segment EBITDA surged 25%. That resounding performance was mainly driven by REA, where listings flourished and Financial Services returned to growth, while revenues expanded substantially at REA India.\nListings growth continued into July as REA broadened its suite of successful premium products to improve results for clients and lift yields. In the United States, we enhanced both the technology and the offerings to sell and buy-side agents at realtor.com, as we prepare for an upturn in our property market that has been pummeled by high mortgage rates, limited inventory, lofty prices and historically low home sales.\nWhile prognostication is not our profession, we are hopeful that interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve are imminent and will have a positive impact on affordability and liquidity in this stagnant market.\nCertainly, the lesson of the Australian market is that when suppressed demand is emancipated, activity in the housing sector accelerates rapidly and listings prosper. We have already seen sequential improvement in revenue at realtor.com as the company has taken astute advantage of the complementarity of our media platforms to drive traffic and improve the content experience.\nThere was particular improvement on the sell side, which has become a priority for realtor.com and which is the core source of revenue for our thriving Australian business.\nThe progress at Dow Jones continues to pace with revenue growth in the quarter of 4% despite a mixed advertising market. At the heart of that growth is the continued strength of B2B, where revenues climbed 14% of Dow Jones Energy and 12% at Risk & Compliance. In fact, fiscal '24 was a pivotal moment in the history of the company. As it was the first year in which more than 50% of Dow Jones profitability was driven by the surging B2B segment. Indeed, it is difficult to overstate the impact of B2B growth on Dow Jones and News Corp over the past 4 years as B2B revenue has expanded at a compound annual rate of 17% and the margin at Dow Jones has broadened from 15% to 24% while segment EBITDA has more than doubled.\nCrucially, Digital accounted for 80% of fiscal 2024 segment revenue, up from 67% in 2020. And the core B2B products have renewal rates north of 90%. In that same 4-year span, total subscriptions in the consumer business have burgeoned early 55% with digital subs almost doubling.\nFor the fourth quarter, Dow Jones gained 158,000 digital subscribers sequentially and digital advertising expanded 14% year-over-year, more than offsetting the expected declines in print advertising. The quality of Wall Street Journal content continues to be a differentiator as our company signed a valuable multiyear content licensing agreement with the London Stock Exchange Group to provide WSJ news and analysis to its corporate clients, thus building our brand in the European marketplace.\nHarperCollins reported a notably strong quarter with a more than 250% increase in segment EBITDA to $57 million. As revenue rose 15% to $512 million, reflecting strength in Bible sales, in Amazon demand and in audiobooks, thanks in part to our successful partnership with Spotify. The HarperCollins back catalog continued to perform vibrantly with The Bridgerton collection benefiting from the latest streaming series, while new works like Lucy Foley, The Midnight Feast and Sarah A Parkers, When the Moon Hatched reached fresh audiences.\nOverall, digital sales grew 12%. And for the first time, audiobooks were a largest share of that segment than e-books, soaring by 28% in the quarter. That's right, 28%. There is much to cherish this quarter, including the latest works from best-selling authors, Daniel Silva, Tessa Bailey, Lisa Turkish and Jeffrey Archer among others.\nOne interesting sales phenomenon is the resurgence of interest in J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy, which sold 150,000 copies in various formats within 24 hours after his selection as Donald Trump's running mate was announced.\nIn July alone, Hillbilly Elegy sold 877,000 units which will have a positive impact on our Q1 results for fiscal 2025. At Subscription Video Services revenue in the quarter grew on both a reported and constant currency basis and streaming strength more than offset broadcast declines. Audiences are continuing to transition from traditional broadcast to over-the-top consumption. We believe Foxtel is particularly well positioned for both subscriber and advertising growth. As Kayo and BINGE have gained traction given their unique strengths in sports and entertainment programming.\nThose 2 services added almost 200,000 paying subscribers in the quarter and digital advertising now represents more than 40% of Foxtel's total advertising, with Kayo growing 42% compared to the prior year and the recently rolled out ad offering at BINGE growing fourfold. We will keep you updated on the advertising renaissance as the quarters unfold.\nOur launch of the Hubbl service is still in its early days, but encouragingly, more than 30% of Hubbl customers are new to Foxtel, which is significant given our existing presence and profile in the Australian marketplace. About 75% of customers of the Hubbl aggregation service purchased an additional Foxtel product along with their device and subscription.\nOn the broadcast side, ARPU grew 6% and churn was a pleasingly low 11.7% for the quarter. Foxtel continued to generate strong cash flow as we were able to monetize our long-term sports rights across multiple platforms.\nIn News Media, our profile and impact have only grown over the past year when many news organizations lost the plot editorially and commercially. The collapse of old and new media titles is in stark contrast to our mastheads and our journalists. The quality of our journalism was a prime motivator for Sam Altman and his talented team at OpenAI with whom we are genuinely proud to partner.\nLeaders from both companies have already begun working together to improve the flow of trustworthy information and develop contemporary distribution channels. Those learnings will be deployed in newsrooms around the world to strengthen our journalists understanding of how the digital reading experience is evolving and how we need to adapt to that changed content consciousness.\nMeanwhile, we are far from complacent and continuing to develop and reform our News Media operations. We are in the midst of a restructuring in Australia designed to enhance our digital progress.\nWhile the New York Post was once again profitable this year after decades of chronic losses, and we will look to expand its audience and influence and profitability in the coming year. It is worth highlighting that the post reached a monthly digital audience of 117 million unique visitors in June and that News Corp owns 2 of the top 3 best-selling print mastheads in the U.S. with the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post.\nNews U.K. under Rebekah Brooks leadership saw an improved profit contribution for the quarter and the full year. As we benefited from lower newsprint costs, increased digital subscriptions, cover price rises and lower television expenses. Our strong results for the year and record returns for the quarter would not have been possible without the leadership of Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch, the support of our Board and the admirable efforts of our employees around the world. The company's enduring success is built on an honorable tradition of creativity and curiosity and integrity.\nOur success would also be impossible without the support of our shareholders and we are acutely conscious of our responsibility to generate value and provide robust returns to those who have invested both money and faith in News Corporation. And we are certainly not beholden to pass structures as we confront the future.\nI now hand you to our CFO, the Sage, Susan Panuccio.\n\nSusan Panuccio\n\nThank you, Robert, and good afternoon to everyone. As Robert highlighted, our transformation of News Corp continues a pace. We have materially grown recurring and digital revenues, added incremental high-margin licensing revenues, and focused our reinvestment plans primarily around the core pillars of Book Publishing, Digital Real Estate Services and Dow Jones, where we expect the highest rate of returns and shareholder value creation.\nWe continue to deliver cost efficiencies to mitigate inflationary pressures, but more importantly, to allow for investment in growth initiatives across our businesses.\nThis disciplined approach has allowed us to deliver our second best year on record and our strongest ever fiscal fourth quarter profitability. For today's discussion, I will focus on the fourth quarter performance. Fourth quarter total revenues were almost $2.6 billion, up 6% year-over-year, and total segment EBITDA was $380 million, up 11% year-over-year. Margins improved by 70 basis points to 14.7% our core pillars accounted for 87% of News Corp's profits and grew at a robust 28%. Fourth quarter adjusted revenues rose 6% compared to the prior year, while adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 13% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.09 compared to a $0.01 loss in the prior year.\nAdjusted earnings per share was $0.17 in the quarter compared to $0.14 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $448 million, up 21% versus the prior year on both a reported and adjusted basis. Segment EBITDA was $135 million, up 25% as higher profit contribution from the REA Group was partly offset by approximately $11 million of higher costs at Move, a similar increase to the third quarter.\nAdjusted segment EBITDA grew 28%. REA had another outstanding quarter with revenues rising 37% year-on-year. Growth was driven by a combination of residential yield increases and improved growth in national listings favorable geographic mix and customer contract upgrades. New buy listings rose approximately 16% with Sydney up 26% and Melbourne, up 32%. In addition, REA saw strong growth at Financial Services, which benefited from the absence of a negative valuation adjustment in the prior year and some improvement in settlements, together with higher revenue at REA India. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call for more details.\nMove's revenues for the quarter of $143 million were down just 2% compared to the prior year as declines continued to moderate from last year. For the quarter, real estate revenues fell 2%, driven by lower referral and lead generation revenues, reflective of the broader macro trends and lower transaction volumes.\nLead volume was flat, still constrained by higher mortgage rates, while average monthly unique users for the quarter were also flat versus the prior year at $74 million, but up sequentially 3%. And -- it is worth noting that we have been able to maintain market share according to the MACOM score data.\nEncouragingly, we are continuing to have notable success diversifying our revenue base with accelerating performance from our sell-side offerings, rentals, which includes our newly formed partnership with Zillow and new homes. Collectively, those businesses accounted for 19% of revenues in the quarter and grew substantially versus the prior year.\nAs we communicated last quarter, we are focused on best positioning realtor.com for a housing recovery. Our key strategic focus areas remain the same as we head into the new financial year and include modernizing our technology stack, investing in content for our product offerings, which most recently included the release of a new dynamic mapping feature and leveraging News Corp's network to drive audience share.\nTurning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $506 million, up 1% compared to the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 2% versus the prior year. Streaming revenues accounted for 32% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 29% in the prior year.\nTotal closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group were nearly $4.7 million at quarter end, up 1% from the prior year. Total paid streaming subscribers reached a record $3.2 million, increasing 5% versus the prior year and accounting for nearly 70% of the total paying subscriber base. With Kayo adding 108,000 subscribers and BINGE adding 76,000 compared to the prior quarter. This speaks to the success of our winter sports codes and strong entertainment content.\nFoxtel ended the quarter with over 1.2 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 10% year-over-year. Broadcast churn was 11.7% versus 11.1% in the prior year, but down from over 13% last quarter, while broadcast ARPU rose 6% to AUD 90, benefiting from new pricing and packaging plans implemented in March.\nAs a result, broadcast revenues declined at the lowest rate in constant currency in over 5 years. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $74 million was down only $4 million or 5% versus the prior year, despite including approximately $28 million of costs related to Hubbl for devices and marketing. Excluding the Hubbl investment, Foxtel's profitability would have been higher for the quarter. For the quarter, adjusted segment EBITDA fell 4%.\nMoving on to Dow Jones. Fourth quarter results were again strong at Dow Jones with revenues of $566 million, up 4% year-over-year with digital revenue accounting for 81% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented 79% of total revenues, again reinforcing the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. We continue to see strong growth at PIB with revenues rising 8% year-over-year, including 12% growth at Risk & Compliance to $76 million and 14% growth at Dow Jones Energy to $65 million.\nAt Risk & Compliance, demand remains strong from new and existing customers with notable success in new products, including advanced media screening and financial instruments. From a customer mix perspective, corporate customers remain the fastest growth segment, growing over 20% and accounting for 45% of our customer base.\nAt Dow Jones Energy, revenue in the quarter continued to benefit from the pricing review together with the launch of a number of new products and benchmarks.\nOverall, retention remains strong at approximately 90%. Within the Dow Jones consumer business, Circulation revenues rose 1% versus the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions improving by 16% year-over-year and higher by 158,000 sequentially.\nBundling accounted for approximately 40% of the sequential digital-only volume growth in Q4. ARPU was stable sequentially as the introductory pricing is starting to rise and the subscribers acquired over the past year have started to migrate to higher pricing.\nAdvertising revenues increased 2% to $102 million, marking the first quarter of year-over-year growth since the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Digital advertising improved 12%, and that marked the strongest growth since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, principally due to a rebound in the technology category.\nPrint remained challenged down 13% and broadly consistent with recent quarters. Digital represented 66% of advertising revenues, up from 60% last year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 3% to $137 million and was again the largest segment EBITDA contributor across the company.\nAs expected, expenses were higher this quarter, reflective of the phasing of marketing and higher employee costs, which includes a retro payment related to the ratification of a new union agreement.\nThe Dow Jones segment finished as the highest contributor to full year company revenue in financial year '24 for the first time and the highest contributor to total segment EBITDA for the second consecutive year.\nAt Book Publishing, the fourth quarter delivered very strong results and kept a robust turnaround for the full year at HarperCollins, which benefited from normalization of customer demand, strong Amazon sales, moderating inflationary pressure and upswing in digital revenues and much lower return rates. Revenues were $512 million, up 15%, while segment EBITDA improved over 250% to $57 million driven by strong top line growth, coupled with easy comparisons in the prior year.\nThat said, HarperCollins nearly matched its highest fourth quarter revenue on record and achieved its highest fourth quarter profitability since 2018 underscoring that the performance clearly wasn't just a function of easy comparisons.\nThe backlist contributed 62% of consumer revenues, up from 59% last year, while digital sales rose 12%, reaching 24% of consumer sales. Audiobooks rose 28% in part helped by the recent Spotify partnership at increased promotions from Audible, which led to audiobooks exceeding e-books for the first time this quarter.\nTurning to News Media, Performance was mixed with News U.K. posting an improved performance for the quarter, which was more than offset by challenging conditions at News Corp Australia. Revenues for the quarter were $545 million, down 5% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues fell 4%. Circulation and subscription revenue fell 3% on a reported and constant currency basis due to lower print volumes in the absence of [ measure ] revenues in Australia, which more than offset cover price increases and digital subscriber growth.\nAdvertising was down 5% on a reported basis and 4% in constant currency, with U.K. digital advertising more challenged due to the continued impact from platform algorithm changes. As our News Media businesses face ongoing print challenges, they continue to focus on their transition to digital revenues and ongoing cost efficiencies.\nSegment EBITDA of $28 million declined $17 million or 38%, which was attributed to challenges at News Australia, including higher newsprint prices. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 38%.\nTurning to the outlook. Market trends remain mixed geographically. However, we exited the fiscal fourth quarter with total segment EBITDA growth, and we hope to see improvements going in fiscal 2025. Some themes across each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate, Australian residential new buy listings for July are up 12%, although the listing volume increase benefited from 2 additional working days. REA should benefit from an average 10% price increase in Premier Plus that has been successfully implemented. Year-over-year growth rates for fiscal 2025 will reflect strong prior period listing volumes, particularly for Melbourne and Sydney.\nMove plans to continue with their investment strategy focused on technology improvements and enhanced content and product offerings. We hope to see some revenue improvements given expected interest rate cuts and continued growth from adjacencies.\nWe will be closely monitoring the impact from the implementation of the new buyer agent rules, but we believe we are well placed to benefit from the expected market recovery given the scale of our audience, the quality of our leads and expansion of our adjacencies.\nAt Subscription Video Services, we plan to continue to scale streaming products while retaining high-value broadcast customers through improved ARPU and churn measures. While we anticipate the rate of investment at Hubbl to be lower in fiscal 2025, we do expect modestly higher programming costs related to sports rights escalators. At Dow Jones, we will remain focused on B2B growth, including upselling and new products across Risk & Compliance and Dow Jones Energy. We expect to see improved circulation revenue growth through digital subscription step-up pricing, and we'll be monitoring those trends very closely. While we expect the rate of expenses to be moderately higher year-over-year due to investment, notably in B2B, we will continue to focus on cost efficiencies to drive growth.\nAt Book Publishing, we have seen strong momentum from the backlist in July, including a resurgence from J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy, and are very pleased with the partnership with Spotify, which is driving increased competition in audiobooks.\nWe hope to see further profit improvements in 2025, albeit likely at a much more modest rate given more normalized prior year comparisons. At News Media, the advertising market remains challenging, and the businesses will continue to focus on enhancing first-party data offerings with an emphasis on video to drive higher-quality advertising.\nWe expect the segment to benefit from lower talkTV costs together with savings associated with the new commercial printing joint venture in the U.K. and ongoing operational efficiencies will remain a focus.\nWe will see new revenue from our OpenAI partnerships in fiscal 2025 reflected in the Dow Jones and News Media segments. We expect CapEx in fiscal 2025 to be moderately higher than in fiscal 2024, primarily due to digital reinvestment in our growth pillars.\nWith that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Florin\n\nSenior Vice President & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, Operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com.\nOn the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nThis call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information.\nAdditionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\n\nRobert Thomson\n\nThank you, Mike. News Corp has again made substantial progress on our strategic imperative to transform the company and increase value for all shareholders. Our profitability rose slightly in the third quarter as compared to the prior year, continuing our growth this fiscal year and that increase follows the 3 most profitable years since the company was reincarnated in 2013.\nThat improvement, which gathered pace in April, came despite certain macroeconomic circumstances that were far from auspicious, whether a strong dollar that devalued our revenues outside the U.S., particularly in Australia, or the punitively high mortgage rates that obviously undermined activity in the U.S. housing market.\nThe U.S. housing market contrasts starkly with that of Australia, where strong performance underpinned robust revenue growth at Digital Real Estate Services. While at Dow Jones, the professional information business continued to prosper and the segment's profit margin expanded from 20.6% to 21.7%.\nWe remain well on track for the full year of strong results at News Corp. It is, by the way, worth highlighting that our free cash flow in the first 3 quarters was $491 million, a 53% increase on the $320 million for the same period last year. It is also worth noting that for more than a year, digital revenue has accounted for over half of our total revenues, and we believe that trend is destined to continue.\nWe are in the midst of an exponential digital revolution, and our own company has continued to change significantly and profitably. Importantly, we are working to promote our quality journalism in the age of generative AI and are gratified that the most enlightened leaders in the industry appreciate the commercial and social value of that content.\nSeparately to that end, we have this week extended our existing partnership with Google. As mentioned previously, we have been reviewing our company's structure and that work is intense and ongoing, and we have made underlying changes to provide maximum flexibility.\nThrough 3 quarters of fiscal '24, circulation and subscriptions accounted for 45% of revenues, with advertising at a modest 16%. 10 years ago, we were dependent on advertising for almost half our revenues. Most tellingly, advertising at News Media, then our largest source of revenue now accounts for only 8% of total revenue. I should repeat that number, 8%, and half of that figure is now digital advertising. So the character of the company has fundamentally changed.\nDow Jones continue to increase both revenue and profitability this quarter. The professional information business at Dow Jones is an increasingly powerful earnings engine with yet another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. It remains on track to be the largest contributor to the segment's profitability by the end of this fiscal year, and we believe far into the future, given its high margins and 90-plus percent retention rate.\nDow Jones Energy, where revenues rose 15%, has just launched the APAC Carbon Market Report, which provides data and insights into emissions trading in Australia, China, New Zealand and South Korea. This important new offering complements OPIS's carbon price coverage for North America and other international markets.\nAt Risk & Compliance, where revenues also rose 15%, the team debuted its first Gen AI-powered product, Integrity Check, a fully automated research platform that rapidly produces due diligence reports on businesses and individuals from our unique database. Created in partnership with SAPIEN, Integrity Check will help companies ensure they are compliant in a fiendishly complicated and legally fraud regulatory environment.\nDigital subscriptions at Dow Jones increased 17% year-over-year and experienced the highest sequential quarterly net growth, with 322,000 added in the third quarter. Average daily digital subscriptions to Dow Jones brands, including The Wall Sheet Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch, Investor's Business Daily crossed 5 million for the first time during Q3. That total is approximately double the number 4 years ago.\nGiven the access to a bundle of premium products with The Wall Street Journal at the heart, the Dow Jones team is confident we should see a reduction in churn and an increase in circulation revenues in quarters to come.\nAs for advertising, the market for print remains somewhat soft, though digital advertising rose 4% compared to the prior year, and advertising trends overall improved on the preceding quarter.\nIn digital real estate, REA continued to show robust growth, with revenues surging 15% year-over-year, a 6% increase in listings across Australia helped spur that success. And I should note that listing growth has again improved in April compared to March, which we believe augurs well for the fourth quarter. REA also remains by far the #1 digital real estate platform in Australia, with 4.1x more monthly visits on average than its nearest competitor.\nThat strength and enhanced product mix for its customers enabled REA to introduce 10% average price increases. That new pricing schedule will apply from July, and we look forward to the benefits in the next fiscal year.\nMeanwhile, we are pleased with the continuing progress at REA India, with a 31% advance in revenues in the quarter. Outside, Housing.com is the leading digital real estate platform in the most populous country in the world. Given that country's economic growth, widely forecast to be around 7% this year and the prospect of ongoing political continuity, we are confident that we have a world-class asset with much potential for expansion.\nAt Move, we are obviously subject to abnormal aberrant conditions in a U.S. housing market, buffeted by high interest rates. However, revenue declines moderated this quarter and lead volume has turned positive for the first time in 2 years. The results this quarter are broadly consistent with our expectations, and we are improving the product and user experience to position ourselves to take advantage when the market trends change from headwind to tailwind.\nIn the wake of legal developments involving the National Association of Realtors, I would echo Move's CEO, Damian Eales' recent perspicacious comments about the importance of buy-side agents for those seeking professional guidance when purchasing a home, which is surely the most significant investment decision for many families.\nWe continue to closely monitor industry developments, but believe realtor.com is well positioned to capitalize on its relationship with homebuyers and with buyers and sell-side agents in this evolving landscape. We expect that interest rates will ultimately ease, and our experience in Australia suggests that the market will surge dramatically after an extended period of suppressed activity.\nIt is worth noting, our landmark rental agreement between realtor.com and Zillow. This deal upgrades the rental experience for consumers and allows landlords and property managers to benefit from the combined audience of both the realtor.com and Zillow platforms. There is also a clear financial benefit for realtor.com, which will allow us to focus on our core buy and sell-side offerings.\nFinally, I would point out that in March, according to Comscore, a verified third-party source, REALTOR's unique users grew 5% month-over-month, comparing very favorably to Homes.com, which experienced a decline in the same period. Moreover, realtor.com is 1.4x bigger in terms of monthly unique users and has approximately 3x the page views and minutes per visit.\nIndependent verification ensures statistical sumpsimus, not metrics mumpsimus. Our media platforms from The Wall Street Journal to the New York Post and MarketWatch and Bible Gateway give us a distinct advantage in expanding reach and building brands.\nSpeaking of Bible Gateway, at HarperCollins, while revenues for the quarter were slightly behind the record Q3 results in the prior year, segment EBITDA rose 2%. And for the year-to-date period, EBITDA was 40% higher. In April, we saw a stronger performance and hope that will continue for the fourth quarter.\nWe continue to believe the audio book market holds much promise, especially given our unique partnership with Spotify, which has already broadened the book audience. We hope to benefit from Spotify's recent expansion of its audio offerings to Canada, Ireland and New Zealand. And by the way, fueled by the growth of audio books, HarperCollins digital revenues hit 25% of total consumer revenues in Q3. We believe there is little doubt that the audio segment will continue its expeditious expansion.\nBestsellers in Q3 included Shelby Van Pelt's novel, Remarkably Bright Creatures. While Savannah Guthrie's Mostly What God Does continues to thrive, as does Peter Schweizer's Blood Money and Fangirl Down by Tessa Bailey. Pope Francis' memoir, Life: My Story through History, which we published in 8 languages, is selling well and will surely have an enduring [ people ] presence in libraries.\nWe anticipate a strong performance in Q4 with Lucy Foley's, The Midnight Feast; The War on Warriors by Pete Hegseth and Day Trading Attention by Gary Vaynerchuk.\nAt subscription video services, the Hubbl streaming aggregation product, launched in March, and we are working with our partners at Comcast to shepherd its adoption throughout Australia. The intent is to reduce churn by increasing engagement and improving the customer experience. Excluding ForEx fluctuations, adjusted segment EBITDA overall improved by 1% in the segment.\nKayo is benefiting from the impact of a fascinating season of both Aussie Rules Football and Rugby League, and had its highest sequential quarterly net additions since inception, powered by both new customer growth and reactivations. We anticipate that recent price increases at Kayo and expected strong subscriber growth will continue to benefit the bottom line as both leading sports codes are drawing record audiences.\nFoxtel continued to grow its streaming revenues in Q3, which now account for 29% of circulation and subscription revenues, up from 26% last year, which is helping to drive overall margins, which rose from 14.3% and to 14.5%.\nIn News Media, our brands continue to increase their digital penetration across the globe and we were vigilant on costs, which were 5% lower than a year earlier. We anticipate further significant savings as a result of our transition of TalkTV to focus on streaming and original video content for our established British brands. And we also expect tangible cost benefits following the regulatory approval for the joint printing agreement between News U.K. and the Daily Mail Group.\nThe Times of London will expand digitally and gradually into the U.S. during Q4, inspired by the success of the U.S. Sun in reaching new audiences and enhancing digital revenues. Much journalism is unfortunately [ joined us ], but our imperative is for reporters to have the objective of being objective and for our economists to have the objective of being subjective.\nAs of the end of March, The Times and Sunday Times closing digital subscribers, including The Times literary supplement, were at 582,000, up 5% year-over-year. Meanwhile, digital subscribers at News Corp Australia as of the end of March were over 1.1 million, up 7% compared to the prior year.\nIn the first 3 quarters of fiscal year 2024, News Corp delivered strong profit growth, and we fervently believe that the company is firmly on a pathway to continued success. Our trusted premium intellectual property resonates in an era of polarization and amidst a rising tide of AI field falsehoods and fuss. For us, AI stands for authentic and authenticated intelligence, not artificial intelligence or the artifice of intelligence.\nAs always, we remain sincerely grateful for the astute leadership of Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch, and for the sage support of our Board, investors and customers and for the sterling efforts of all of our employees.\nOne final note. For more than a year, our colleague, Evan Gershkovich, has been falsely and cruelly imprisoned in Moscow. In public and not so public ways, we are actively seeking his release. We deeply appreciate those who have assisted the cause and we sincerely look forward to his emancipation.\nI now turn to Susan Panuccio for additional details of our performance in Q3.\n\nSusan Panuccio\n\nThank you, Robert, and good afternoon to everyone. As Robert highlighted, we remain focused on the execution of our strategy to transform News Corp with an increased mix of recurring and digital revenues as we continue to expand our information services businesses. This has been balanced with reinvestment in key growth initiatives and cost efficiencies as we navigate ongoing inflationary pressures in our markets.\nOur third quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion, down 1% compared to the prior year, while adjusted revenues were flat compared to the prior year.\nTotal segment EBITDA was $322 million for the quarter, up 1% compared to the prior year on a reported and adjusted basis, and ranked as the second most profitable Q3 since the company's separation in 2013.\nFor the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.05 compared to $0.09 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.11 in the quarter compared to $0.09 in the prior year.\nMoving on to the results of the individual segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $388 million, up 7% versus the prior year and up 9% on an adjusted basis. Segment EBITDA was $104 million, up 2% as higher profit contribution from the REA Group was partly offset by lower revenues and approximately $11 million of higher costs at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA grew 7%.\nREA had another very strong quarter with revenues rising 15% year-on-year on a reported basis to $256 million and up 20% in constant currency. Growth was again driven by a combination of residential yield increases and improved growth in national listings, favorable geographic mix and customer contract upgrades.\nNew buyer listings rose approximately 6%, with Sydney up 20% and Melbourne up 18% despite an early Easter, which negatively impacted March volumes. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call for more details.\nMove's revenues of $132 million were down 6% compared to the prior year, with declines continuing to moderate from recent quarters. For the quarter, real estate revenues fell 5%, driven by lower referral and lead gen revenues, reflective of the broader industry trends and lower transaction volumes.\nWe saw an improvement in lead volumes for the first time in over 2 years, growing 4% year-over-year, benefiting from product enhancements and some stabilization in the housing market. Average monthly unique users for the quarter were flat versus the prior year at 72 million, but improving 9% from the second quarter.\nAs Robert mentioned, we announced a rentals partnership with Zillow to syndicate large multifamily rental listings, which went live May 1. The agreement, financially beneficial, allows us to materially expand and improve our rental content offerings and to reallocate investment to marketing and our core buy and sell-side offerings.\nAs we communicated last quarter, we are focused on best positioning realtor.com for a housing recovery, and as a result, are increasing the rate of reinvestment in the second half of fiscal 2024. To reiterate, some of the key strategic focuses include modernizing the technology stack, ensuring we have the best content for our product offerings and leveraging News Corp's network to drive audience share.\nDamian has been very focal about the ongoing benefits of buyer agents. And while we will closely monitor the impact of the proposed NAR settlement, we continue to believe in the long-term opportunity for realtor.com and have not altered our strategic direction, which already includes diversifying revenues and expanding our seller offerings, which continue to scale.\nTurning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $455 million, down 5% compared to the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues were down 1% versus the prior year. Streaming revenues accounted for over 29% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 26% in the prior year.\nTotal closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group were over 4.5 million at quarter end, down 1% from the prior year, but up 5% versus the second quarter as Foxtel transitions into the winter sports season.\nTotal paid streaming subscribers were nearly 3.1 million, increasing 3% versus the prior year, benefiting from a strong start to the AFL and NRL seasons.\nKayo added 269,000 paying subscribers this quarter, the highest sequential quarterly net addition since its launch in fiscal 2019, which is consistent with recent trends of customers returning post summer.\nFoxtel ended the quarter with over 1.2 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn was 13.3% versus 12.3% in the prior year, while broadcast ARPU rose 2% to AUD 85 benefiting modestly from new pricing and packaging plans implemented in March.\nSegment EBITDA in the quarter of $66 million was down only 3% versus the prior year despite the inclusion of $13 million of costs related to Hubbl, which launched in early March, and a 4% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 1%.\nMoving on to Dow Jones. Third quarter results were again strong at Dow Jones with revenues of $544 million, up 3% year-over-year with digital revenue accounting for 81% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented 82% of total revenues, again, reinforcing the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base.\nWe saw strong growth at PIB, with revenues rising 10% year-over-year, including a 15% growth at Risk & Compliance to $76 million and 15% growth at DJ Energy to $63 million. Total PIB retention rates remained strong at over 90%.\nAcross the B2B portfolio this quarter, over 2/3 of the growth is coming from new customers, new products or upsells with the balance coming from annual price increases. At Dow Jones Energy, the mix between pricing and volume is more balanced this year due to the benefit of a pricing review, which led to above-average increases.\nWithin the Dow Jones Consumer business, circulation revenues were flat versus the prior year, with digital-only subscription growth accelerating from the Q2 rate to 17% year-over-year and higher by 322,000 subscriptions sequentially, helped by increased penetration of the Dow Jones bundling offer as they look to better leverage subscription acquisition costs across multiple products, capitalize on minimal overlap between products and drive greater engagement.\nBundling accounted for approximately 45% of the incremental digital only volume growth in Q3 and now represents about 14% of total subscriptions. We have taken price rises this quarter, increasing monthly rates by nearly 20% to a cohort of tenured print subscribers.\nAdvertising revenues declined 2% to $86 million, with year-over-year declines moderating slightly from the first half with digital improving, up 4%, driven by a rebound in technology spend. WSJ.com grew 12%, underscoring the strength of the platform and its valuable audience. Print advertising declined 11% due to weakness in the financial sector. Digital represented 63% of advertising revenues, up from 59% last year.\nDow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 8% to $118 million and was again the largest segment EBITDA contributor across the company. Margins improved year-over-year by 110 basis points to 21.7%, driven by the strong B2B performance, which remains on track to be the largest contributor to Dow Jones profitability in fiscal 2024.\nCosts, as expected, rose modestly, partly due to the phasing of sales and marketing expenses as we mentioned last quarter. At Book Publishing, strong growth in our Christian business was not enough to offset some softness in our romance general books and children's divisions. Consumer softness and headwinds in the mass merchandiser accounts such as Costco and Walmart were greater than we expected in March.\nRevenues were $506 million, down 2%, but that compares with a record third quarter last year, while segment EBITDA improved 2% to $62 million compared to the prior year, largely due to the easing of supply chain pressures and the cost efficiencies driven by the HarperCollins team over the past 12 months. Margin improved slightly to over 12%.\nWe continue to see improvements in supply chain-related costs with freight distribution and manufacturing costs all down versus the prior year. Return rates again improved compared to last year, while inventory levels appear to have normalized across our distribution network. The backlist contributed 63% of consumer revenues, up from 60% last year, while digital sales rose 5% this quarter, reaching 25% of consumer sales. Downloadable audio rose mid-teens helped by the recent Spotify partnership.\nTurning to News Media, performance continued to be challenged in the quarter with print advertising declines returning to more historic levels. Revenues were $530 million, down 6% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues also declined 6%.\nCirculation and subscription revenues were flat and down 1% in constant currency as cover price increases and digital subscriber growth were offset by lower print volumes.\nAdvertising remained challenging, down 13%, both on a reported basis and in local currency with print advertising trends notably weak across all markets.\nAs our News Media businesses face ongoing print challenges, they continue to work hard on their transition to digital and ongoing cost efficiencies. Segment EBITDA of $26 million declined $8 million, which was due to the lower revenue, partly offset by lower print volume and newsprint expenses. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 26%.\nAs for the outlook, similar to our comments last quarter, it is challenging to forecast in the short term, albeit economic indicators vary across markets.\nLooking at each of our segments, at Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for April grew 32% due to the timing of Easter as well as easier comparisons to the prior year. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary.\nAt Move, we hope to see continued moderation in revenue declines. Like the third quarter, we expect continued reinvestment in marketing and product development, which will be partially offset by cost reductions elsewhere and the new rental agreement with Zillow.\nIn Subscription Video Services, consistent with our message last quarter, we continue to expect modestly higher expenses for the full year and some softness in streaming revenues due to the first half, which may impact full year profitability in local currency.\nAt Dow Jones, while we continue to expect strong revenue and profitability performance for the full year, underpinned by our B2B offerings, we expect modestly higher overall expenses for the fourth quarter and full year.\nAt Book Publishing, overall industry revenue trends appear relatively stable, albeit third quarter was a bit softer than the first half for physical sales, but we are encouraged by the strength in downloadable audio. We continue to expect margins to improve versus the prior year and expect strong performance in Q4, partly due to the prior year comparison.\nAt News Media, advertising revenue trends remain challenging, particularly in Australia, and we will continue to focus on ongoing cost efficiencies in our digital product offerings.\nFor the other segment, we expect costs for the fourth quarter to be in line with the previous 3 quarters. We now expect CapEx to be relatively stable to last year, slightly lower than our initial expectations.\nWith that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Today's conference is being recorded. Media will be allowed on a listen-only basis.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Florin\n\nSenior Vice President & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com.\nOn the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nThis call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information.\nAdditionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings releases for the applicable periods posted on our website.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\n\nRobert Thomson\n\nFor the second quarter in succession, News Corp has achieved growth in both revenue and profitability. And we believe there are strong prospects for further growth as difficult, inauspicious macroeconomic conditions ease in some of our markets. We saw particularly robust results across the 3 core pillars of our company: Dow Jones, Book Publishing and Digital Real Estate Services, where there was a resounding improvement in Australia in Q2. And there are early signs of recovery in the U.S. residential sector after the most sluggish market conditions in almost 3 decades. Given the potential of our world-leading brands, we remain intent on creating long-term value for investors. And as part of our commitment, our diligent, concerted review of the company's structure continues apace.\nLooking at the top line results. News Corp's second quarter revenues rose 3% to $2.6 billion, and profitability surged 16%, marking the third consecutive quarter of profit growth in testing economic times. Our net income for the quarter rose to $183 million from $94 million in the same quarter last year, while our reported EPS was $0.27 against $0.12 for the same period last year.\nThe company's digital progress and prowess are increasingly evident. Halfway through fiscal 2024, digital now comprises approximately 52% of all revenues. That is more than an e-evolution. It is an e-revolution, one that has touched and transformed every element of every business, and we are far from satisfied, far from complacent, far from completion.\nWe are seeing the collective benefit of our conscious strategic shift away from potentially volatile advertising revenues to growth in circulation and subscription revenues. In fiscal 2014, nearly half of News Corp revenues were from advertising, with 31% from circulation and subscriptions. There has been a fundamental metamorphosis.\nIn the first half of the fiscal year, advertising had preceded to 16%, with circulation of subscriptions surging to 44%. Overall, News Corp as of Q2 had over 7 million subscriptions to our news brands, including The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, The Times and Sunday Times, The Australian and other publications. And we have an additional 4.3 million paid subscribers at Foxtel in Australia, which includes our popular streaming services Kayo and Binge. And those figures don't include the growing number of loyal subscribers at our professional information business at Dow Jones, where the average retention rate is comfortably above 90%.\nArtificial intelligence, with all its permutations and perturbations, will play an increasingly important role at most businesses. We expect to be a core content provider for generative AI companies who need the highest quality, timely content to ensure the relevance of their products. The [ corny kilo ] cliche is that AI companies are selling the picks and shovels during the seeming gold rush. Well, we are selectively reselling gold nuggets and those crucial negotiations are at an advanced stage.\nIt is reassuring that certain digital companies appreciate the value of integrity, quality and creativity. And while certain other media companies prefer litigation, we prefer consultation as the former is merely creating a gold rush for lawyers. Courtship is preferable to courtrooms. We are wooing, not suing. But let's be clear, in my view, those who are repurposing our content without approval are stealing. They are undermining creativity. Counterfeiting is not creating, and the AI world is replete with content counterfeiters.\nI would like to compliment Sam Altman of OpenAI, who has shown a clear understanding of the social importance of journalism. He also appears to have emerged unscathed from his first visit to Davos, where there is always attitude at altitude. We are hopeful that, again, News Corp will be able to set meaningful global precedence with digital companies that will assist journalists and journalism and ensure that gen AI is not fueled by digital drops.\nWe speak of the AI hallucinating, yet we, as a society, are hallucinating if we don't focus firmly on provenance at a time when even the very words misinformation and disinformation have themselves become sources of misinformation and disinformation. Too many media companies are scanning the landscape and presuming that they have a glimpse of the future and yet they cannot distinguish between trendiness and actual trends. Too many media companies, for too long, have been guilty of the Abilene Paradox.\nBefore I turn to the results in detail, I must mention once again our colleague, Evan Gershkovich, who continues to be unjustly detained in a Moscow prison. He has been incarcerated for almost a year solely for being a highly professional journalist. We, at News Corp, and of course, Evan's family and many friends, hope that justice will prevail and that he will be released immediately. I would like to personally thank all those who publicly and not so publicly have been working diligently to secure his emancipation.\nTurning now to Dow Jones, which yet again achieved its highest level of quarterly revenues and profitability since News Corp's acquisition. That result is thanks to solid performance across the business, most notably in the increasingly successful professional information business, which remains on track to be the largest contributor to profitability at Dow Jones this fiscal year.\nThe Professional Information Business is seeing robust growth due to the integration of Opus, which was completed ahead of schedule, and CMA, which is near complete. I would like to compliment, in particular, the News Corp Finance team for masterminding executing and delivering the Opus and Base Chemicals deals, which have been so critical to Dow Jones burgeoning growth.\nExecutives at Dow Jones are far from smug and are building a bevy of new and compelling products. For example, Opus' Analytics Pro utilizes our database of more than 130,000 fuel stations to track visits and help customers assess their pricing strategies and market trends as well as compile customer loyalty rates and demographics, among other valuable, actionable data points.\nMeanwhile, Risk and Compliance's financial instruments product in partnership with BigTXN provides a fleet of R&C-sanctioned profiles mapped to commonly used financial instruments, which is crucial compliance cartography in a heavily regulated world. And DJ Integrity Check, our partnership with [ Sapien ], provides generative AI-driven insight into companies and relevant potentially problematic individuals.\nSubscriptions at the news business are continuing to grow. And during the month of January, average daily digital subscriptions to Dow Jones portfolio, including The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch and Investor's Business Daily, reached over 4.9 million, which represents more than double the pre-COVID average level of 2.4 million digital subscriptions in Q2 fiscal '20.\nThe acceleration of digital subscription growth has been driven in part by the team's bundling of products, which is designed to increase reader engagement and reduce long-term churn. While we have purposely shifted emphasis to recurring revenues at Dow Jones, we are happy to report that although we faced some challenges in print advertising, digital advertising grew year-over-year for the first time since the first quarter of fiscal 2023. This positive result has been driven primarily by growth in the tech and automotive sectors and most notably at wsj.com.\nDigital Real Estate Services had a strong quarter, thanks largely to the prospering of REA, where there was 22% revenue growth year-over-year, fueled by an 8% increase in listings with heightened activity in the core Melbourne and Sydney markets and higher pricing. REA India continues to expand rapidly and reported over 19 million monthly average unique visitors in December, solidifying its lead as the foremost digital housing platform in the world's most populous country, where strong economic growth and political stability have created a platform for further expansion.\nAt Move, realtor.com, continued to be affected by the high U.S. interest rates that have undermined activity in the market. But mortgage rates are beginning to moderate. And in recent weeks, there have been early signs of an increase in all important leads.\nThe National Association of Realtors announced that the index for pending home sales increased just over 8% in December versus the prior year, the largest increase since June 2020. realtor.com's latest housing report revealed that January marked the third consecutive month of year-over-year inventory growth, with a 2.8% increase in newly listed homes for sale compared to January 2023. Unique users at REALTOR have also stabilized, with December comScore data signaling a return to growth.\nDuring the downturn, the realtor.com team has been assiduously improving the user experience, broadening the portfolio of products for our customers and bolstering the back-end technology, so we are poised to take full advantage of the incipient recovery in the U.S. housing market.\nHarperCollins had stellar results for the second successive quarter. This was thanks to strength in both the front list and the back list, notably in the blossoming audio books category. We saw 15% digital revenue growth in the quarter, fueled by a 29% audio books sales increase due to a flourishing market and our new partnership with Spotify. Spotify appears to be expanding demand for audio books and opening the category up to new consumers. I would like to commend our thoughtful partner, Daniel Ek, for his commitment to creativity.\nIn Q2, we saw success with bestsellers like The Pioneer Woman Cooks—, Dinner's Ready! by Ree Drummond; The Little Liar by Mitch Albom; Ann Patchett's Tom Lake; and Barbara Kingsolver's Demon Copperhead. We also saw strong sales for Christian books, including The Great Disappearance by Dr. David Jeremiah, who is rapture ready, and The Bible itself. Looking ahead to Q3, we have great expectations for, among others, A.J. Finn's End of Story and I Am More Than by LeBron James.\nAt Subscription Video Services, our new streaming aggregation product, Hubbl, is expected to launch next month and improve the search experience for our cherished customers seeking entertainment and sports. We believe Hubbl will be the most effective conduit between consumer and content and add to the Foxtel success story. In a volatile world, Foxtel has achieved 8 consecutive quarters of revenue growth in constant currency, while being acutely and astutely cost conscious in managing the transition to streaming. At Kayo, we are looking forward to the upcoming winter sports season for Australian rules football and Rugby League, the 2 dominant sports. And at Binge, there has been early success with advertising at the basic tier while continuing ad-free service for premium customers.\nIn News Media, our news brands have seen improvement in traffic in recent weeks, a turnaround after convulsions in the first half, where there were algorithmic aberrations. Gratifyingly, we experienced digital subscription growth during the quarter. Rebekah Brooks and her team at News U.K., have overseen continuing progress at The Times and Sunday Times, which set a new record for the quarter in digital subscriptions, at 575,000, and saw significant digital ad growth, up 21% on a reported basis and over 15% in local currency.\nWe expect the success of The Times to continue beyond Britain's borders with the imminent digital launch of The Times in the U.S. We are confident that it will resonate with discerning readers hungry for objective news coverage in a market saturated with narrative non-journalism.\nAt News Corp Australia, news.com.au was again the country's leading news web with nearly 13 million monthly uniques in December according to metrics from Ipsos. And The New York Post is again on course to be profitable and has expanded its positive political influence in these vexed and vexing times.\nWith the strong results in Q2 and Q1, we are off to a sterling start in fiscal year 2024, which follows the 3 most profitable years for the new News Corp. We can sense that investors are beginning to appreciate keenly the value of our brands and the potential of our portfolio.\nOn behalf of all our investors, we have transformed free cash flow generation, bolstered our balance sheet, initiated a dividend and are continuing our $1 billion buyback plan. For that transformative success, I would like to pay tribute to the strategic support of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and to our highly engaged directors and to the commitment of our employees around the world.\nI am now pleased to turn to my talented colleague, Susan Panuccio, who will elaborate on these bouyant results.\n\nSusan Panuccio\n\nThank you, Robert, and good afternoon to everyone. As Robert mentioned, we had a strong second quarter, resulting in first half year-over-year improvements in both profitability and revenues. We continue to transform the company and move towards higher recurring and digital revenues, together with exercising strong capital allocation discipline and balancing reinvestment across the portfolio with ongoing fixed cost reductions.\nOur second quarter total revenues were $2.6 billion, up 3% compared to the prior year, an increase from the 1% growth delivered in the first quarter. Adjusted revenues grew 2% compared to the prior year. Total segment EBITDA was $473 million for the quarter, up 16% compared to the prior year, driven by strong performances across our 3 key growth pillars: Book Publishing, Digital Real Estate Services and Dow Jones, which all posted double-digit profit gains. In fact, in the aggregate, those key segments delivered 24% profitability growth this quarter.\nOur second quarter total segment EBITDA was also the highest in 2 years adjusted total segment EBITDA grew 14% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.27 compared to $0.12 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.26 in the quarter compared to $0.14 in the prior year.\nMoving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were for $419 million, up 9%, a notable improvement from the first quarter rate and a return to revenue growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of financial year 2022. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues rose 8%. Segment EBITDA rose an impressive 15% to $147 million due to a higher contribution from the REA Group, partially offset by revenue headwinds at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA rose a healthy 16%.\nREA had another very strong quarter with revenues rising 22% year-on-year on a reported basis to a quarterly record of $292 million with minimal impact from foreign exchange. Growth was again primarily driven by residential yield increases, improved growth in national listings favorable geographic mix and customer contract upgrades. Overall, new buy listings rose approximately 8%, with Melbourne up 24% and Sydney up 22%. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call, which will commence directly after hours for more details.\nMove's revenues of $127 million were down 13% compared to the prior year, with declines moderating from recent quarters. For the quarter, real estate revenues fell 14%, driven by lower lead and transaction volume, reflective of the broader industry trends. Lead volumes fell 7% year-over-year with December improving to down just 2%, benefiting from a combination of easier comparisons as well as recent declines in mortgage rates. Average monthly unique users for the quarter were flat compared to the prior year, at 66 million.\nThe U.S. housing environment remains tough, with existing home sales hitting 30-year lows, although we are hopeful the market will start to show improvement in the second half given recent declines in mortgage rates. That said, irrespective of any market considerations, we are determined to strengthen realtor.com's product and content offering so it's best positioned for success when the housing market moves.\nTo that end, the realtor.com team is focused on executing several key strategic priorities, which include modernizing the technology platform to help with unifying the customer experience across all platforms; creating unique and scaled data for proprietary content to assist with increased personalization; leveraging News Corp's network in relation to AI initiatives and capturing audience share; and accelerating the diversification of revenues with a greater focus on the sell-side offering.\nTurning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $470 million, up 2% compared to the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 3% versus the prior year. Streaming revenues accounted for 29% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 26% in the prior year. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group were over 4.3 million a quarter and flat with the prior year. Total paid streaming subscribers were 2.8 million, increasing 4% versus the prior year, although declining sequentially due to seasonality at Kayo, tougher financial conditions caused by the inflationary environment for consumers and a weaker sports cycle.\nFoxtel ended the quarter with 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers, dowant to 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn was flat at 12.9% despite the final migration of cable in October. While broadcast ARPU rose 3% to approximately AUD 86, helped in part by a price rise for non-platinum subscribers implemented in July.\nSegment EBITDA in the quarter of $77 million was down 14% versus the prior year, driven by contractual price escalators in Foxtel sports rights agreements and $10 million related to the upcoming launch of Hubbl, partially offset by higher revenues and lower technology and marketing costs. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 13%.\nMoving on to Dow Jones. As Robert mentioned, the second quarter results delivered the highest quarterly revenue and segment EBITDA performance since the acquisition of Dow Jones over 15 years ago. Dow Jones delivered revenues of $584 million, up 4% year-over-year, which made Dow Jones the highest segment revenue contributor for the quarter for the first time since it was resegmented.\nDigital revenues accounted for 78% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented almost 76% of total revenues, up approximately 2 percentage points from the prior year, reinforcing the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues grew 3%.\nWe had very strong growth at PIB with revenues rising 13% year-over-year, including 16% growth at Risk and Compliance to $72 million and 15% growth at Dow Jones Energy to $62 million. Factiva again posted growth, benefiting from a new licensing deal. Total [ pretension ] rates remain very strong at over 90%. We are continuing to review our disclosures with the primary focus on increasing transparency to help the market appropriately value Dow Jones. To that end, we are now providing revenues for both Risk and Compliance and Dow Jones Energy in the 10-Q.\nWithin the Dow Jones consumer business, circulation revenues were flat versus the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 15% year-over-year or by 135,000 sequentially, driven by an increased focus on the Dow Jones bundling offer as they look to better leverage subscription acquisition costs across multiple products, capitalize on minimal overlapping between products and drive greater engagement. Bundling accounted for over 70% of the incremental digital-only volume growth in quarter 2.\nAdvertising revenues declined 4% to $126 million, relatively stable with the first quarter rate, although digital returned to year-over-year revenue growth for the first time since the first quarter of financial year '23, rising 1%, driven by strength in the technology and auto categories. Print declined 11% due to weaknesses in financial services. Digital represented 62% of advertising revenues, up 59% last year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 17% to $163 million and was the largest segment EBITDA contributor with margins improving 320 basis points to 27.9%, driven by the strong B2B performance, which remains on track to be the largest contributor to Dow Jones profitability in fiscal 2024. Cost declined about 1%, driven by head count reductions and lower newsprint production and distribution costs, in addition to phasing of sales and marketing miniature.\nAt Book Publishing, financial performance, again, meaningfully exceeded our expectations, particularly in profitability. Revenues were $550 million, up 4%, while segment EBITDA improved 67% to $85 million compared to the prior year. Margins increased by almost 600 basis points to 15.5%. The strong performance this quarter benefited from the success of some key front-list titles, as Robert mentioned, and saw improvement in backlist sales, including a notable increase from Christian publishing. Churn rates again improved materially due to better sell-through compared to last year, while inventory levels appear to have normalized across our distribution network.\nInflationary costs moderated with lower manufacturing costs, helped by product mix and lower freight and distribution costs this quarter. The backlist contributed 60% of revenues, up from 57% last year, while digital sales rose 15% this quarter and accounted for 21% of consumer sales. Downloadable audio accounted for nearly 50% of digital sales, a record high, and we are pleased with the early positive signs from our partnership with Spotify, which generated incremental digital revenues and EBITDA this quarter. As way of background, Spotify is a usage-based model, not a pooled model. On an adjusted basis, revenues gained 2% and segment EBITDA rose 65%.\nTurning to News Media. Performance in this segment was more challenged. Revenues were $563 million, down 3% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues declined 5%. Advertising declined 9% and were down 11% in constant currency, while circulation and subscription rose 5% and was up 2% in constant currency, benefiting from cover price increases. Advertising remained particularly challenged, with digital advertising trends again negatively impacted by the lower traffic at several mastheads related to changes in algorithms at the large platforms. That said, as Robert noted, encouraging me, we are seeing some recovery in recent weeks, particularly at The Sun in the U.S.\nSegment EBITDA of $52 million, declined $7 million, which was due to the lower revenue, partly offset by lower print volume and newsprint and lower spend at talkTV. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 15%.\nAs for the outlook, similar to our comments last quarter, it is challenging to forecast in the short term, albeit economic conditions vary across markets.\nLooking at each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for January grew 12%. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. At Move, we hope to see continued improvements in lead volumes, with January up 1% year-over-year, given recent declines in borrowing costs, albeit off low prior year comparisons. As we mentioned last quarter, we are expecting some reinvestment in marketing and product development in the second half, increasing from depressed levels last year, which will be partially offset by cost reductions elsewhere.\nIn Subscription Video Services, as mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect modestly higher expenses for the full year, ongoing inflationary pressures, fewer new releases across entertainment due to the writers and actors' strike and a weaker summer sports schedule has created softness in streaming revenues, which may impact full year profitability in local currency.\nAt Dow Jones, we expect strong revenue and profitability performance, underpinned by the transformation of our B2B offerings, and as mentioned previously, continue to expect modestly higher overall expenses for the full year.\nAt Book Publishing, overall industry revenue trends remain relatively stable, and we are encouraged by the strength in the downloadable audio. We continue to expect margins to improve versus the prior year.\nAt News Media, advertising revenue trends remain challenging, particularly in Australia, and we will continue to focus on ongoing cost efficiencies. Finally, given the current spot rate for the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar, we do expect some negative translation in the third quarter.\nWith that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Today's conference is being recorded. Media will be allowed on a listen-only basis. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Florin\n\nSenior Vice President & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks, and we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nThis call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\n\nRobert Thomson\n\nThank you, Mike. In a world replete with uncertainty, News Corp is proud to report rising revenues and increased profitability in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. These distinctly positive results come despite inauspicious macroeconomic conditions, including steep interest rates and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations. The potential for even profitability should be even more pronounced when we return to economic equilibrium.\nThese results follow the 3 most profitable years since the creation of the new News Corp and our digital transformation has continued apace. And in our view, these results certainly highlight the disparity between the value of our company and our share price, which we believe does not reflect our present profitability yet to lower the potential of our incomparable growing businesses. We are acutely focused on enhancing long-term value for all of our investors, and in that quest, have the patent advantage of prized assets whose value we believe is increasing. We are also assiduously reviewing our structure in the quest to optimize that value.\nOur first quarter revenues rose modestly to $2.5 billion, while profitability rose 4%, marking the second consecutive quarter of profit growth in these challenging conditions. We believe these positive results are a harbinger of our potential in the medium and long term. We expect to continue to drive our digital growth, the scale of which has been transformative over the past decade. It is worth noting a couple of metrics for context and to highlight the intrinsic value of our company.\nIn 2014, print-related advertising accounted for 39% of our revenue, and now it is trending at less than 5%, while digital revenues exceeded 50% of revenues last year, up almost 300%. Our loyal investors understand the inherent value of our assets and the scale of our dramatic transition, but we believe the market has yet to fully comprehend the magnitude of the metamorphosis or the future potential of our platform. We have been and expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow this fiscal year. And we have a $1 billion buyback plan well underway, and ample opportunity to be opportunistic.\nThat opportunistic efficacy we've shown in our purchases of OPIS and CMA for Dow Jones, 2 high-margin digital businesses with recurring revenues, which have added much profitable prowess. Their impact means that we are at a pivotal point at our Dow Jones business. The B2B segment at Dow Jones is now outpacing the B2C segment in contributing to profit and at a far higher margin.\nThe net result is that we expect both Dow Jones and News Corporation are becoming more profitable, more digital, and even less dependent on the ebb and flow of advertising. That is why we are highlighting the Dow Jones results today and expect to be providing increasing visibility over the coming year so that potential investors can appreciate the full glory of our valuable assets, while we intensify our institutional introspection on structure.\nAs a reminder, Dow Jones profitability has more than doubled since we resegmented in fiscal 2020, generating close to $500 million in segment EBITDA last year with strong growth prospects ahead. And the EBITDA margin has been utterly transformed. In Q1 fiscal '18, it was approximately 9%. In Q1 fiscal '20, it was 12.8%. And in Q1 this fiscal year, 23.1%. We certainly agree with the perceptive commentators and analysts who suggest that News Corp is undervalued and its asset quality underappreciated. Our Board, our leaders, and our teams deserve much credit for skillfully navigating the turbulent media waters of the past decade, waters, which have proven treacherous for many media companies.\nAs always, we remain focused on maximizing that value to the benefit of all shareholders. We are also looking to the future in maximizing the value of our premium content for AI. We are in advanced discussions with a range of digital companies that we anticipate will bring significant revenue in return for the use of our unmatched content sets. Generative AI engines are only sophisticated as their inputs and need constant replenishing to remain relevant, and we are proud to partner with responsible purveyors of AI products and their prescient leaders.\nOne observation about generative AI, we often hear about misinformation and disinformation to the point where the very words have become politicized and polluted. The potential for the [indiscernible] of the perverse will become ever more real with the inevitable inexorable rise of artificial intelligence. But however, artful the artificial intelligence, it is no match for great reporting and for genuine journalistic [indiscernible].\nOn the subject of journalism, I would like to pay tribute to our reporters in the Middle East and in Ukraine, who are each day taking calculated risks to bring insight and intelligence to readers around the world, during a period of unpredictable turbulence. And I would like to highlight the fate of Evan Gerskovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter who has been unjustly incarcerated in Russia for more than 7 months merely for doing his job as a journalist.\nLet me begin the more detailed exegesis with the increasingly valuable POS Dow Jones, where revenues rose 4% in Q1 despite the volatility of the ad market, while segment EBITDA was lifted by an impressive 10% as revenue and profit contribution continued to expand in the professional information business. Dow Jones offers a unique set of services and products for global business users and readers. As a result, many of our customers encounter Dow Jones products several times each day, not just the Wall Street Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch and Dow Jones Newswires, but also risk and compliance, Dow Jones Energy and Factiva. Risk and Compliance revenues surged 23%, thanks to increased demand from the financial and corporate sectors seeking to minimize risk and compliance. I trust all of the institutions on the call today aspire to those 2 worthy goals. R&C has expanded revenues by over 600%. Let me repeat that number, over 600% since we relaunched news in 2013.\nIt's worth emphasizing that the business is fully digital and has retention rates of over 90%. Dow Jones Energy, which includes both OPIS and CMA continues to see excellent double-digit revenue growth driven in part by higher pricing and is exceeding our initial expectations, thanks to the global energy transition and opportunities emerging in renewable energy, along with continued reinvestment. Our customer base is growing as we launch compelling products and create critical pricing benchmarks. We are genuinely impressed by the vitality and drive an initiative among our new colleagues at both OPIS and CMA.\nFactiva is benefiting from its innovative partnership with Cision. And Factiva should be an important building block in the AI future given that it has a database of 33,000 sources in 32 languages from more than 200 countries and territories. That impressive content collection complements our contemporaneous news offerings as we seek to serve corporate, professional, and consumer audiences. Across Dow Jones, subscription volume remained strong with digital subscriptions reaching 4.6 million, up 12%, while total subscriptions reached 5.3 million, up 8%. Our teams are focused on reducing churn and maximizing the lifetime value of each and every subscriber.\nAs for advertising, we saw a particular improvement in trends with the declines of past quarters abating and digital advertising down only 2%. In digital real estate, it was a tale of 2 markets during the quarter with the Australian property market improving and the U.S. market still bearing the burden of particularly high mortgage rates, which obviously suppressed demand.\nBut it is fair to say that the revenue rebound in the Australian market certainly surpassed the sluggishness in the U.S. market. REA reported strong growth in listing volumes in the 2 key markets of Sydney and Melbourne, and our valued clients were keen to subscribe to premium products, thus improving yield.\nWe also saw resounding top line performance and volumes remained strong in October. REA India is the #1 property portal in a country with a rapidly expanding middle class and both its audience and revenue continued to surge during the quarter. As REA has disclosed, the total audience in India in the quarter was up 16% year-over-year, while revenue during the quarter was 25% higher than a year ago. Given a relative political stability in India and ongoing economic growth, REA India is a jewel in the crown.\nIn the U.S., Realtor.com, like the industry at large, was affected by the unusually high interest rates, which do appear to plateau and are expected to ease over the coming year. But these short-term conditions do not change our long-term optimism for Realtor to capitalize on the increasing digitization of the world's largest property market. It is easier by transient traffic in the short term, but that is merely a sugar high that leads to digital diabetes.\nWe have a long-term commitment to all Americans who are buying and selling a home and to real estate professionals. We also have the ability to leverage our unique media platform from wsj.com to the New York Post, among many others, who had a combined monthly audience of over 200 million uniques in September. These are verified authenticated numbers, not an cocktail of cockamamie. Under Damian Eales' energetic decisive leadership, Realtor is building on the gains of his predecessors and focusing on developing core markets, core clients, and core profitability. The Realtor team is working ever more closely with REA executives in ways that are benefiting both businesses with the sharing of software, marketing mechanics, and AI insights.\nThe script for our publishing business was completely rewritten in the first quarter. After a few difficult quarters, segment EBITDA at HarperCollins lipped 67%. Revenues posted a healthy 8% increase, and that growth, combined with cost initiatives undertaken over the past year and an easing of supply chain inflationary impacts recalibrated the performance at HarperCollins. The logistical upheaval at Amazon has passed, returned nets are far lower, and both the frontlist and backlist notch gains during the quarter.\nAmong the many and varied strong sellers were Tom Lake by Ann Patchett, Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsover, The Collector by Daniel Silva, and Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby VanPelt. We saw particular strength in our Christian books business, including Rebar McEntire's Not That Fancy. Rebar was clearly not describing the HarperCollins performance. And speaking of Christian Books, we look forward to publishing a new book by His Holiness Pope Francis next spring. I would like to highlight our new partnership with Spotify to broaden the reach of audio books. This is a project we have discussed for some time with the Arsenal -- Daniel Ek, with whom I share a passion for books and for the Arsenal Football Club.\nThe new partnership has begun with the U.K. and Australia and in the U.S. announced yesterday. And we are genuinely confident that it will be positive for both companies for authors and for those who love to read and to listen to books. This market has needed a strong new entrant and Daniel and his team are among the most skillful players on the pitch.\nAt Subscription Video Services, revenues were up in constant currency for the seventh consecutive quarter. As expected, the decline in EBITDA was mainly due to sports right costs and ForEx fluctuations. But we have no doubt that our streaming strategy has been successful at a time when other companies in other markets are struggling. Overall, paid streaming subscriptions rose 8% on the same quarter last year, while broadcast churn was down from 14.2% to 11.4%, showing that the 2 products are undoubtedly complementary.\nBut the team at Foxtel is far from complacent. And so we are on the cusp of launching our new streaming aggregation product, Hubbl, which will greatly simplify the search for fascinating entertainment and sports from our own companies and from those of our cherished partners to the benefit of all in particular, to the benefit of viewers.\nThe News Media segment faced macroeconomic headwinds and volatility caused by algorithmic changes at the large platform, but these trends are more ephemeral than eternal. Subscriptions continue to increase at The Times and Sunday Times, which reported an 8% rise and at News Corp Australia, where we saw a 4% increase in digital subs. As I mentioned earlier, we are increasingly less reliant on advertising, which is now a smaller fraction of our overall revenue focused on digital recurring revenue streams. We saw strong performance at Wireless in the U.K., which had a record 45 million listening hours over the April to September period, up 17% from the prior year, according to RAJAR, led by sports and news.\nOur teams in the U.K. and Australia were also acutely cost conscious, and we are retooling the infrastructure to reflect the contemporary and future initiatives, including printing operations, advertising networks, and back office expenses. Rebekah and her teams in the U.K. have been leaders in creating programmatic ad partnerships, which enable all to increase yield and harvest valuable data.\nThis was in another way and historic quarter. Our Executive Chair, Rupert Murdoch, announced that he will be transitioning to Chairman Emeritus next week at our AGM. I can personally assure you that there has been no change in his heightened levels of curiosity and energy since the announcement and his vast experience will be an important ongoing resource for the company. All of us at News Corp stand on the shoulders of a giant.\nAnd I genuinely look forward to Lachlan becoming sole chair next week. His thoughtful engagement with our teams already enhances the business each working day. And his passion for principal journalism is obvious to all who work with him. There is no doubt that Lachlan's multidisciplinary expertise and his philosophical integrity will be invaluable as we continue the next phase of our crucial journey.\nAnd now our team CFO, Susan Panuccio, will provide more financial granularity.\n\nSusan Panuccio\n\nThank you, Robert, and good afternoon, everyone. As Robert mentioned, we are pleased with the positive start to the new fiscal year, returning to revenue growth and posting the second consecutive quarter of profit growth despite the macroeconomic conditions. We have been diligently executing on our long-term plan to drive greater value for our shareholders and believe this is yet to be reflected in our current market value.\nOur first quarter total revenues were $2.5 billion, up 1% compared to the prior year, marking the first year-over-year revenue growth since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Adjusted revenues also grew 1% compared to the prior year. Total segment EBITDA was $364 million, up 4% compared to the prior year. HarperCollins was the largest contributor to the profit improvement, which is encouraging on the back of last year's challenging results. Adjusted total segment EBITDA grew 5% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.05 compared to $0.07 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.16 in the quarter compared to $0.12 in the prior year.\nMoving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $403 million, down 4% compared to the prior year, a notable improvement from the fourth quarter rate. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues declined just 2%. Despite the revenue decline, segment EBITDA rose 3% to $122 million due to higher contribution from the REA Group and cost-saving initiatives that move that were partially offset by revenue headwinds. Adjusted segment EBITDA rose a healthy 8%.\nREA had a very strong quarter, with revenues rising 4% year-on-year on a reported basis to $261 million, which included an $11 million or 4% negative impact from foreign exchange. Growth was driven by residential yield increases and growth in national listings, along with 25% revenue growth at REA India. Results were partially offset by modest decline in Financial Services revenues due to lower settlement activity. Overall, new buy listings rose 1%, with Sydney and Melbourne up 16% and 14%, respectively, enabling upward pressure on yields. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details.\nMove's revenues of $142 million were down 16% compared to the prior year, relatively similar to the fourth quarter trend, absent the 53rd week impact. For the quarter, real estate revenues fell 20%, driven by lower lead and transaction volumes reflective of the broader industry trends. Lead volumes fell 11% year-over-year, while Realtor's average monthly unique users declined 12% from the prior year to 76 million in the first quarter based on internal metrics, but improved from 74 million in the fourth quarter.\nAs Robert mentioned, despite challenging market and competitive conditions, we've made solid progress in Q1 across a number of strategic areas, including SEO improvements, expanding our sell-side offerings into the launch of a listing agent tool kit, deepening our collaboration with News Corp's powerful global platform to drive further reach, and the recent launch of a new brand campaign.\nTurning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $486 million, down approximately 3% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. Importantly, on an adjusted basis, revenues rose 1% versus the prior year, the seventh consecutive quarter of growth. Streaming revenues accounted for 30% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 25% in the prior year, and again, more than offset broadcast revenue declines, benefiting from both a year-over-year increase in subscribers and price rises at Kayo and BINGE.\nTotal closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group reached almost $4.6 million at quarter end, up 2% year-over-year. Total paid streaming subscribers were 3 million, increasing 8% versus the prior year, although declining sequentially impacted by less output at bids related to the strikes in Hollywood, as well as typical seasonality at Kayo due to the end of the winter sports codes in September.\nFoxtel ended the quarter with 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 9% year-over-year broadcast churn continued to improve, down 280 basis points year-over-year to 11.4%, while broadcast ARPU rose 3% to over AUD 85 helped in part by a price rise for non-platinum subscribers implemented in July. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $93 million was down 16% versus the prior year driven by contractual price escalators in Foxtel sports rights agreements. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 13%. We completed the debt refinancing in the first quarter, which included securing a new AUD 1.2 billion credit facility. As we said last quarter, given the improved performance and the completion of the refinancing, this provides a pathway for repayment of our shareholder loans.\nMoving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones had a strong quarter with revenues of $537 million, up 4% year-over-year despite fully lapping recent acquisitions. Digital revenues accounted for 12% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented over 81% of total revenues, up approximately 1 percentage point from the prior year, underscoring the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues grew 3%. We are continuing to see very strong growth in our professional information business with revenues rising 14% year-over-year driven by risk and compliance and strong gains at Dow Jones Energy.\nFactiva posted modest growth benefiting from a new licensing deal. Retention across B2B offerings remains at over 90% with nearly all of the revenues recurring. Risk and compliance revenues rose 23% with consistent growth between financials and corporates. Europe remained the largest territory at over 50% of revenues and also the fastest source of growth. Secular trends remain very favorable with global corporations navigating complex sanctions and trade guidance, particularly as it relates to Russia and China.\nWe were really pleased with the 20% growth at Dow Jones Energy, which benefited from price escalators, the rollout of new products, and new customers. The results also benefited mid-single digits from onetime items and the World Chemical Forum, a new annual event this quarter, which leveraged the wider Dow Jones experience in corporate events. Circulation revenues gained 1% in the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 12% year-over-year or 101,000 sequentially, which was principally driven by an increased focus on Dow Jones bundling offer as they look to better leverage subscription acquisition costs across multiple products, capitalize on minimal overlap between products, and drive greater engagement from customers. We believe that in the medium term, bundling will drive higher ARPU per subscriber and reduce long-term churn.\nAdvertising revenues declined 3% to $91 million due to 6% and 2% declines in print and digital advertising revenues, respectively, with trends improving from the fourth quarter. Advertising accounted for 17% of total revenue was 66% being digital, up 100 basis points from last year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 10% to $124 million, with margins improving 120 basis points to 23.1%, the highest first quarter margin since News Corp's acquisition of Dow Jones, driven by the strong B2B performance, which is on track to be the largest contributor to Dow Jones profitability in fiscal 2024.\nAt Book Publishing, we saw a big recovery from fiscal 2023 results. Revenues were $525 million, up 8%, while segment EBITDA improved 67% to $65 million compared to the prior year. Margins improved over 400 basis points to 12.4%. You will recall the results a year ago were significantly impacted by the Amazon reset of inventory levels and rightsizing of its warehouse footprint. The strong performance this quarter benefited from the success of some key front-list titles, as Robert mentioned, and also saw improvement in backlist sales, including a notable increase from Christian Publishing.\nReturn rates improved materially, while inventory levels appear to have normalized. Inflationary costs are beginning to moderate with lower manufacturing costs helped by product mix and lower freight and distribution costs this quarter. The backlist contributed 61% of revenues, down from 65% last year, while digital sales rose 3% this quarter and accounted for 22% of consumer sales. Within the 22%, downloadable audio accounted for 45% of digital revenues. On an adjusted basis, revenues gained 6%, and segment EBITDA rose 59%.\nTurning to News Media. Overall trends continue to be mixed geographically. Revenues were $548 million, down 1% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues declined 2%. Advertising declined 5% and was down 6% in constant currency. While circulation and subscription rose 2% and was flat in constant currency. At News Australia, advertising saw some improvement compared to the fourth quarter, while the U.K. weakened, notably in digital. As Robert mentioned, we did see declines in our traffic at several mastheads related to changes in algorithms at the large platforms which we are monitoring closely and have been felt across the wider publishing industry.\nSegment EBITDA of $14 million declined $4 million results included approximately $3 million related to onetime costs as a result of the proposed combination of printing operations in the U.K. with DMG. This initiative demonstrates the continued focus on driving cost efficiencies across our news media businesses.\nBefore we look at the outlook for the next quarter, I would like to touch on free cash flow. First quarter free cash flow is typically lower due to the timing of working capital payments, including sports rights payments at Foxtel, and this year, it was also impacted from the lower HarperCollin sales in Q4 of the prior year. We anticipate generating strong and positive free cash flow for the year weighted to the second half, consistent with prior years.\nAs for the outlook, similar to our comments last quarter, we are continuing to operate in a difficult environment that remains unpredictable in the short term. That said, we expect the second quarter to continue to show an improvement in revenues and profitability.\nLooking at each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for October grew 16%. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. At Move, U.S. housing conditions remain challenging, and we are expecting some reinvestment in marketing to improve share of voice levels, including the recently launched advertising campaign, and also in product development to ensure we are best positioned to take advantage of market conditions when they improve.\nIn Subscription Video Services, as mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect modestly higher expenses for the full year, driven by sports rights and some costs related to the launch of Foxtel streaming aggregation service, Hubbl, but remain on track to deliver relatively stable results for the year in local currency. At Dow Jones, we hope to see continued improvements in advertising declines, but as typical, visibility is limited. We continue to expect modestly higher overall expenses for the full year and strong revenue growth in B2B revenues.\nAt Book Publishing, while we expect year-over-year improvements versus the prior year, revenue and profit growth is expected to be more modest than the first quarter given overall industry trends and the normalization of return rates. At News Media, revenue trends remain mixed geographically, and we will continue to focus on ongoing cost efficiencies.\nWith that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Todays conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Florin\n\nSenior Vice President & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com.\nOn the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer.\nWe will open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information.\nAdditionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website. With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\n\nRobert Thomson\n\nThank you, Mike. Before we discuss the results for the fourth quarter and the full year of fiscal 2023, I'd like to acknowledge that we have now completed a decade of the new News Corp's existence. So this is surely an appropriate moment to reflect on our profound transformation, a transformation faithful to the company's founding principles. Consider the then and now. Our revenue base has changed fundamentally and expanded dramatically. News and Information Services, accounted for 72% of total revenues in fiscal 2014, which included News America Marketing and Dow Jones. By fiscal 2023, News Media was 23%, and revitalized Dow Jones segment was 22%. And Digital real estate comprised 5% of total revenues 10 years ago, and that has tripled to over 15% this past year, which includes the acquisition of Move, where revenues have more than doubled.\nSubscription Video services revenues increased from 6% of News Corp's total to 20%, bolstered by the consolidation and control of Foxtel, a business renewed and Foxtel's imminent completion of a refinancing is expected to facilitate repayments of our outstanding shareholder loans beginning this fiscal year. Candidly, since our reincarnation, we have increasingly digital recurring revenues, higher margins, significantly more free cash flow, robust finances and bright prospects for long-term growth and value creation for all our shareholders.\nA few facts to demonstrate our digital scale today. Based on our June metrics, we had 79 million unique visitors at Dow Jones, 159 million at the Sun, 74 million at realtor.com, 21 million at Housing.com in India and 145 million at the increasingly influential New York Post. And that digital momentum is surely gathering pace in the age of generative AI.\nAlong with this relentless focus on digitization, we have been intent on simplifying the company and heightening our cost consciousness. That cost discipline was clearly evident during a year that had a complicated plot line for books, while digital real estate was naturally inevitably affected by the interest rate hikes, which appear to be plateauing in the U.S. I would like to pay sincere tribute to Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and our directors who have been steadfast in their strategic support and all our employees and our loyal insightful investors. Thanks to their collective committed efforts, News Corp achieved its 3 strongest fiscal years ever in the last 3 fiscal years, 2021, 2022 and 2023. In fact, fiscal '23 was our second most profitable year following fiscal '22 despite the difficult macro conditions in a couple of core segments. And our fourth quarter profitability was significantly higher than last year.\nThere have certainly been fundamental changes in the media landscape. We have led the quest for appropriate compensation for content from the big digital platforms. And that quest begun publicly in 2007 when I testified before the House of Lords about the challenges for publishers and society in the Internet age has entered a new fascinating phase with the rise of generative AI.\nClearly, negotiations are well underway with the relevant companies. And once again, News Corp hopes to set precedents that benefit creators, publishers and journalists around the globe. It is crucial for our societies that AI is replete with EI. That recomposition does not lead to the decomposition of creativity and integrity.\nWe have been characteristically candid about the AI challenge to publishers and to intellectual property. It is essentially a triptych. In the first instance, our content is being harvested and scraped and otherwise ingested to train AI engines. Ingestion should not lead to indigestion.\nSecondly, individual stories are being serviced in specific searches.\nAnd thirdly, original content can be synthesized and presented as distinct when it is actually an extracting of our editorial essence. These super snippets, distilling the effort and insight of great journalism are potentially designed so the reader will never visit a new site, thus, fatally undermining journalism and damaging our societies.\nIt is reassuring that the prescient executives at the largest digital companies can see these complexities and understand that our shared responsibilities extend far beyond the commercial that generative AI cannot be degenerative. That we are paving a platform for future generations and that we will be collectively held to account and not just by accountants.\nFrom the philosophical to the functional, there is no doubt that AI articulations will affect most sections of most companies, whether it be customer service, subscription management, chatbots, chit-chat bots, text to audio and audio to video. Experiences, efficiencies will be exponential. And we are absolutely clear in our company, there must be a confluence of the technological, the commercial and the culture.\nLast earnings, I mentioned the plight of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, unjustly incarcerated by Russia for being a journalist, seeking facts, seeking the truth both the journal and the U.S. government vehemently deny the allegations against it. Evan has now spent almost 5 months in prison, and we thank the many thoughtful people from all around the globe who have rallied to his course and sought his release. And we thank those who are continuing to press determinedly for his emancipation and providing support to his courageous family.\nTurning now to our results for Q4 and fiscal year 2023. The aforementioned macroeconomic factors, that is inflation, supply chain complications and volting interest rates, along with volatile foreign exchange rates patently presented challenges, some of which are more ephemeral than internal. Nonetheless, we still saw significant progress across several segments. And thanks to our digital and international strategic focus and acute cost consciousness including the announced 5% headcount reduction, which we expect to yield more than $160 million in annual gross savings. Not only was this fiscal year, the second best ever in terms of profits, we believe we are poised for greater growth in the years ahead. As for the fourth quarter, revenues were over $2.43 billion, 9% lower year-over-year.\nThough a majority of that decline is attributable to foreign exchange rates and an extra week last year, a 53rd week to balance out the multiyear calendar. Mathematically, that 1 extra week accounts for almost half of the difference and will obviously not be a factor in the current year.\nProfitability in the quarter rose 8%, which is especially notable in that it comes after a 50% rise a year earlier. We are building on our positive performances even when the headwinds are blustery. Full year revenues were $ 9.879 billion, down 5% on our record prior year. And total segment EBITDA was over $1.4 billion, 15% lower, though still the second highest profits recorded for the new News Corp.\nDow Jones posted its highest profitability for both the quarter and the full year since we acquired the company, helped by impressive results in the professional information business. In fact, taking a step back Dow Jones has doubled it's profitability in the past 4 years. And for the first time, Dow Jones was the highest contributor of profits across all of News Corp in fiscal 2023 as we continue to develop the higher-margin B2B offerings.\nWe are focused on Dow Jones as a pillar of News Corp's future growth with significant value appreciation for shareholders. Dow Jones is nearing an important threshold, with the lucrative B2B business expected to be the highest contributor to profitability in fiscal 2024 and a key driver for future margin expansion.\nDow Jones has been bolstered over the past year by the acquisitions of OPIS and Chemical market analytics and by continuing double-digit growth of risk and compliance. It is worth noting that risk and compliance revenues have risen sixfold over the past decade. We believe prospects remain decidedly bright as the corporate imperative to minimize risk and maximize compliance, grows in an ever more complex regulatory regime. We believe the energy transition is an enormous global opportunity for Opus, and we will capitalize on it through new products, the establishment of compelling benchmarks and the generation of must-have data, pricing and analytics, whether it be for fossil fuels, hydrogen, solar, lithium, cobalt, EVs or carbon credits and offsets. The industry relies on Opus for pricing transparency which is critical to day-by-day decision-making in a market that is undergoing massive transformation.\nDow Jones digital subscription growth accelerated in the second half. partly helped by bundling of our products to capitalize on our clients' needs for a sophisticated market analysis and analytics. We want to channel market watch readers to WSJ, then to Barron's and Investors Business Daily and from there to our specialist business products. That is a pathway to profits for the company. Moreover, we are increasing our international digital focus for the Wall Street Journal, which currently has only 12% of subscriptions outside the U.S., where there is much untapped potential.\nSubscription Video Services reported adjusted revenue and profit growth, which excludes currency impact for the second straight year and also for the fourth quarter, a remarkable turnaround from the recent past. We have long-term rights to the key Australian sports and the prime international sports for Australians and have created a model that streamers around the world are now trying to emulate. Our streaming revenue growth again outpaced broadcast declines in both Q4 and the full year, with paid subscribers scaling at a double-digit rate to nearly 3.1 million. So we are particularly confident about Foxtel's future and our optionality given the imminent completion of our refinancing. We were asked frequently in the past how much more capital we would need to commit to Foxtel. But the question now is how much cash we will receive in coming years. REA continued to be impacted by macroeconomic challenges in the Australian housing market. So we do see an easing of those challenges as the interest rate cycle peaks. Home prices have again started to increase, and the auction completion rate crossed 70% in June, up from 55% in the prior year.\nREA's audience share against its nearest competitor continued to expand to north of 3.5x in June. While visits to the site have expanded year-over-year for 4 consecutive months. REA did benefit from product price increases linked to improvements in the quality of those products while India remains a source of ongoing potential, given that Housing.com is already the market leader in a country on a positive economic trajectory with a rapidly expanding middle class.\nIn the U.S., we have new leadership at Move, operator realtor.com. Move experienced much success under David Doctorow and broadened its offerings with the acquisitions of Opcity, UpNest and Avail. We sincerely thank David for his positive contribution, which will resonate for years to come, Damian Eales brings vast digital experience, a fiercely competitive spirit and much knowledge of how to leverage News Corp's powerful U.S. platforms. Whether that be the New York Post or the Wall Street Journal or Barron's to build the brand and expand market share. Damian has just returned from Australia, where the Realtor team spent time at REA and the creative collaboration between the 2 companies will certainly intensify. Scale is crucial. And to put our scale in perspective, based on June Comscore data, Realtors valuable and engaged audience is well over 2x of that of Homes.com. Not only do we have scale in residential sales, we believe that we can continue to monetize that audience successfully. For HarperCollins and for other book publishers, Q4 and fiscal '23 generally was a challenging period with the post-COVID market resetting, logistical issues at Amazon and acute inflationary pressures. Some particular signs of success were Joanna Gaines Magnolia Table Volume 3 and Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt, and we have reason for optimism in the near future with books like Tom Lake by Ann Patchett, The Collector by Daniel Silva. And in the U.K., TV, Big Adventures on the Small Screen by Peter Kay.\nIn Q2, we are looking forward to the next Pioneer Woman Cooks by Ree Drummond and The Little Liar by Mitch Albom. In News Media, advertising trends vary distinctly by geography, with the U.K. and the U.S. performing best in the quarter. In the U.K., the Sun had a successful year with digital outpacing print ads again in the fourth quarter and for the full year. This strength was accentuated by the year-over-year growth of the Sun in the U.S. which reported a substantial surge in page views and even higher yields than the successful U.K. side. The Times and Sunday Times also hit 565,000 digital subscriptions at the end of June, an 11% increase, underscoring the strength of their journalism and the global potential of the brand.\nNews Corp Australia achieved almost 1.1 million digital subscriptions, an increase of 10%. News.com.au was the leading news website in Australia according to the Ipsos rankings, while the Australian was also in the top 10.\nIn the U.S., the New York Post reported another year of strong profits after decades, if not centuries, of endless losses. As I mentioned, the Papers improved commercial fortunes have been accompanied by growing influence in New York, Washington and beyond. As the papers Founder, Alexander Hamilton, safely observed those who stand for nothing fall for everything.\nIn a fiscal year affected by the reverberations of war, inflation, interest rate hikes, supply chain disruption and other macroeconomic challenges and in a business inevitably impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations News Corp is proud to report its second most profitable year since its reincarnation a decade ago. Our teams have been tested and have clearly passed that exacting test. We ended the year on an upswing with the company returning to profit growth in the quarter with inflation showing signs of abating, interest rates plateauing and incipient signs of stability in the housing market, we have sound reasons for optimism.\nAll specious macro conditions will surely work to the benefit of a company that has become more digital, more global and with more recurring revenues in higher-margin segments. We have navigated the sometimes perilous media waters adroitly and are particularly proud of our providence, a providence based on commitment, curiosity and integrity. We look forward with a sense of genuine of tangible excitement in the potential of our people and our businesses, and we remain utterly determined to deliver positive results for our customers, our employees and most certainly for our shareholders.\nI will now pass you to our erudite CFO, Susan Panuccio, who will provide more insight into our financial coordinates.\n\nSusan Panuccio\n\nThank you, Robert. Our second half results show marked improvement from the first half of the year, with fourth quarter profitability up year-over-year, highlighting the diversity and durability of our revenue streams and our ongoing cost efficiencies as we navigated the ever-changing macro conditions, supply chain pressures and currency headwinds. As the company continues to transition to digital. Digital revenues now comprise over half of the company's fiscal 2023 revenues. We have also transformed the revenue base away from cyclical advertising revenues to one that is much more recurring and subscription base with strong growth prospects. We have made strategic acquisitions that we believe have fundamentally strengthened the company. The acquisitions of OPIS, CMA, HMH, Mortgage Choice and IBD during fiscal 2021 and 2022 have essentially replaced the revenues from News America Marketing, providing a much stronger base for long-term growth. The company has changed and evolved since 2013 and is well positioned for future success. We have maintained a very healthy balance sheet while we strengthened the asset base, transform digitally generated healthy free cash flow and continue to improve our operating efficiencies.\nTurning to our financials. I will focus on the fourth quarter performance. Fourth quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion, down 9% year-over-year, which was heavily impacted by the $110 million or 4% negative impact related to the extra week last year and the $72 million or 3% impact from foreign currency fluctuations.\nImpressively, total segment EBITDA was $341 million, up 8% year-over-year despite very difficult year-over-year comparisons and weak trading conditions at HarperCollins. Margins improved by over 2 percentage points to 14%.\nFourth quarter adjusted revenues declined 7% compared to the prior year, while adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 2% versus the prior year. Both revenues and total segment EBITDA were also negatively impacted by the extra week last year. Adjusted revenue and total segment EBITDA did not exclude that impact.\nEarnings per share in the quarter were a loss of $0.01 compared to income of $0.19 in the prior year. The current quarter reflects $85 million of restructuring and impairment charges, mostly related to our company-wide headcount reduction that we communicated on the last earnings call and an $81 million noncash write-down in equity losses of affiliates related to REA's investment in Property Guru. The prior year income of $0.19 benefited from $149 million tax benefit. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.14 in the quarter compared to $0.37 in the prior year.\nMoving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services.\nSegment revenues were $369 million, down 17% compared to the prior year, impacted by the ongoing macroeconomic pressures, a negative impact of $15 million or 4% from foreign currency fluctuations, and $14 million or 3% of negative impact from the extra week last year.\nOn an adjusted basis, segment revenues decreased 14%. Segment EBITDA declined 11% to $108 million, impacted by lower revenues, partially offset by the lower discretionary costs, compensation and broker commissions. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 5%. REA revenues were $223 million, which declined 11% on a reported basis or down 5% on a constant currency basis.\nThe revenue decline was due to the impact of lower national listings and a decrease in financial services revenue driven by lower settlement activity. New buy listings for the fourth quarter were down 18% year-over-year with the higher-yielding metro areas of Sydney and Melbourne showing improvement each month of the quarter, yet ended down 17% and 16%, respectively. Those declines were partially offset by the annual price increases in the residential and commercial businesses increased uptake in premium products, including Premier Plus, favorable death penetration and continued strong performance from REA India, which maintained its audience leadership. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details.\nAt Move, revenues were $146 million, down 24% compared to the prior year, which reflects the $14 million or 7% negative impact related to the absence of the extra week. Excluding the extra week impact, revenue declined 17%, similar to the third quarter results with yield optimization in the lead generation products, partially offsetting lower lead and transaction volume.\nLead volumes moderated to down 14% year-over-year compared to a decline of 30% in the third quarter while Realtor's average monthly unique users declined 20% from the prior year to $74 million in the fourth quarter based on internal metrics yet up from $72 million in the third quarter.\nWe remain focused on driving both usage and Engagement through continued product enhancements And improvements to SEO while expanding our core adjacencies of seller, rentals and new homes.\nTurning to the switch and Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $501 million, down 4% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis, revenues rose 3% versus the prior year, the sixth consecutive quarter of growth in constant currency. Streaming revenues accounted for 29% of circulation and subscription revenues compared to 23% in the prior year. OTT revenue growth again more than offset broadcast revenue declines, benefiting from both increased subscribers and price increases at Kayo and BINGE. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group improved to over $4.6 million at quarter end, up 5% year-over-year.\nTotal paid streaming subscribers approached $3.1 million, increasing 14% versus the prior year and accounted for approximately 66% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base. Binge continued to expand advertising inventory on the basic product generating both modest incremental revenues and some upgrade activity to the higher tiered subscription offerings.\nFoxtel ended the quarter with over 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers, down only 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn continued to improve, down more than 260 basis points year-over-year to 11.1%, the lowest level since fiscal 2016, while broadcast ARPU rose 2% to over AUD 84 Foxtel announced a price rise beginning in July across some of the broadcast tiers, the first since fiscal 2019, which will benefit the fiscal 2024 results. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $78 million was down 4% versus the prior year, but was up 4% on an adjusted basis despite higher programming costs, mostly related to contractual escalators across key sports rights. On the product front, following the successful growth in streaming, the business will be launching a streaming aggregation device leveraging the Sky glass technology. Expectation is for a commercial launch later in fiscal 2024 and we will keep you updated on our progress.\nMoving to Dow Jones, Dow Jones had another strong quarter with revenues of $546 million, down 3%, which includes the negative impact of $40 million or 7% related to the absence of the extra week from last year. We lapped the Opus acquisition in March and CMA in June. Digital revenues accounted for 79% of total revenues this quarter, up 3 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represent over 79% of total revenues, up over 2 percentage points from the prior year, underscoring the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 6% but would have delivered a modest improvement, excluding the extra week. We are continuing to see strong momentum in our professional information business with revenues rising 10% year-over-year, benefiting from the continued integration of Opus and CMA coupled with strong revenues from risk and compliance. Results were partly offset by the extra week last year, which led to a $14 million or 8% negative impact on the performance. Excluding the extra week, PIB revenues grew 18%. PIB revenues this quarter accounted for 37% of segment revenues. And while we don't disclose specific margins, PIB margins are higher than the overall Dow Jones margin and are contributing strongly to segment EBITDA. Underscoring the uniqueness and durability of the Dow Jones asset mix. Risk & Compliance revenues rose 10% despite the extra week in the prior year and continued to grow at a high teens rate on a like-for-like basis. While 60% of the customers are in the financial services sector, the fastest growth is now coming from corporates with demand driven by the anti-money laundering financial corruption and ESG screening and monitoring products. Retention remains over 90%.\nOpus and CMA's revenue performance remained robust, benefiting from price escalators, new products and new customers. Retention rates for Opus and CMA subscription products remain in the mid-90s, which is underpinning the transformation of Dow Jones revenue base. Circulation revenues declined 6% due to the absence of the extra week lower print volume and weakness at IBD, as we noted in the third quarter. Excluding the extra week impact of $17 million or 7%, circulation revenues were up 1% year-over-year, which is slightly higher than the third quarter rate. Total Dow Jones digital-only subscriptions grew 12% year-over-year or by $163,000 sequentially, with the year-over-year rate improving from last quarter. Advertising revenues declined 14% to $100 million and accounted for 18% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter, with digital down 10% and print down 18%. Excluding the negative impact from the absence of the extra week of $9 million or 8%, the decline rate moderated from the third quarter to down 6%. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 25% to $133 million as cost growth moderated from the first half. Margins improved to 24%, up from 19% last year. Adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter increased 17%, a notable improvement over the third quarter and the full year performance.\nAt Book Publishing, both HarperCollins and the industry more broadly faced challenging headwinds in the quarter, revenues fell 13% to $446 million, which included approximately $20 million or 4% of negative impact from the absence of the extra week. Consumer demand slowed in the fourth quarter more than we initially expected, leading to lower frontlist sales and higher returns, particularly in Christian Publishing and General books. Most of the weakness was in North America.\nSegment EBITDA declined 66% year-over-year to $16 million, a 4% segment EBITDA margin. Segment EBITDA was impacted by the weak top line performance as well as higher-than-normal levels of royalty write-offs due to the underperformance of certain titles further compressing profit margins. Despite some unusual headwinds, we are seeing moderation in freight and manufacturing costs, while headcount reduction initiatives are expected to exceed the 5% target. The backlist represented 59% of revenues for the quarter, up 3 points from last year but down slightly from Q3. Digital sales declined 10% this quarter, mostly driven by lower e-book sales and accounted for 25% of consumer sales, up from 24% last year. On an adjusted basis, revenues fell 13% and segment EBITDA fell 17%. Turning to News Media. Revenues were $571 million, down 9%, primarily due to the absence of the extra week, which negatively impacted revenues by $36 million or 6% and the impact from foreign currency of $18 million or 3%. Adjusted revenues declined 7%. And Advertising declined around 15%, reflecting a $15 million or 6% negative impact related to the absence of the extra week and a $6 million or 2% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact from the extra week in currency, advertising revenues declined approximately 7% due to weaknesses at News Australia, which was impacted by last year's federal election and some softness in real estate and retail. News U.K. and New York Post were relatively stable versus the prior year. Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 7% due to the absence of the extra week negatively impacting revenues by $19 million or 6% and at a $9 million or 3% negative impact from foreign currency. Excluding the extra week and currency impact, circulation and subscription revenues rose 2% and with growth driven by cover price increases in the U.K. and Australia and double-digit subscriber growth across News Australia and, The Times, and The Sunday Times. Segment EBITDA of $45 million rose 36% due to a 12% decline in cost driven by ongoing cost saving initiatives and lower costs related to Talk TV and other digital investments. Adjustment segment EBITDA rose 42%.\nTurning to the outlook. Market trends remain mixed geographically. That said, we have taken aggressive action over the years to improve our asset base including a shift to more recurring and digital revenues, coupled with strong cost initiatives and focused reinvestment in our core pillars. We still expect some inflationary pressures, but are hopeful that they will be at a more modest rate. We exited the fiscal fourth quarter with a return to total segment EBITDA growth, and we hope to see improvements in fiscal 2024.\nLooking at each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for July declined 5%.\nREA should benefit from double-digit residential yield growth as price increases have been successfully implemented. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary.\nAt Move, while we anticipate improvements in lead volume and transactions across the full year, they will likely remain challenging in the short term. We also expect higher marketing spend compared to the fourth quarter, together with ongoing investment in adjacencies, which we will balance with cost reductions.\nIn Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the performance of the streaming products and the ongoing focus on broadcast ARPU and churn as we complete the migration of customers from cable in the first half. We expect modestly higher expenses for the full year driven by sports rights and product investment, which will be more weighted to the first half. We expect full year CapEx and profitability will be relatively stable in local currency. At Dow Jones, we hope to see improvement in advertising declines, but as is typical, visibility is limited. We also expect to see continued strong growth from PIB. We expect modestly higher overall expenses in the first quarter and for the full year in contrast to the fourth quarter.\nIn Book Publishing, HarperCollins in the industry exhibited more volatility last year than normal. That said, July was encouraging, with a return to revenue growth, EBITDA margins lifting from the fourth quarter lows, and prior year comparisons are easing.\nAt News Media, July advertising trends remain mixed geographically. We expect Talk TV costs will be similar, if not lower than the prior year in local currency. We have also seen moderating newsprint cost pressures in the U.K. We expect CapEx in fiscal 2024 to be moderately higher than in fiscal 2023, primarily due to digital reinvestment.\nThat being said, our CapEx came in notably lower than we expected this fiscal year, and we will be monitoring it closely with respect to macro and business conditions as we did during the current year.\nWe expect to generate strong cash flows and expect to return a high percentage of shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Florin\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nThis call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain caution statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\n\nRobert J. Thomson\n\nCEO & Director, News Corporation\n\nThank you, Mike. Before discussing our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, it is particularly important to begin by noting that today marks the 44th day in captivity for Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was wrongfully, willfully detained in Russia. I would like to express our thanks and that of Almar Latour, Emma Tucker and all at Dow Jones for the [ outstanding ] support shown for Evan and his family by the U.S. and many other governments, media companies, journalism organizations and concerned principled people around the world. We trust that justice and common sense will prevail, and that Evan will soon be released.\nTurning now to the third quarter results. We began to see meaningful improvements compared to the prior quarter with certain macro and sectoral trends more positive and our cost-cutting program beginning to gain traction. For context, these earnings follow record revenues and profitability in fiscal 2022, and we have been confronting the challenges of foreign exchange volatility, a surge in interest rates, persistent inflation and ongoing supply chain disruptions. Our results demonstrate the fundamental differences in the character of News Corp compared with other media companies. In a period in which advertising activity was clearly insipid in certain parts of the world, our core nonadvertising revenue was particularly robust, highlighted by a 38% increase in revenues at the Dow Jones Professional Information business.\nFor the quarter, total revenues were over $2.4 billion, down only 2% year-over-year as compared to the 7% decline in Q2. Adjusted revenues, excluding our acquisitions and distinctly unfavorable ForEx movements, equaled those of last year. Meanwhile, profitability was $320 million, down 11% despite a tough prior year comparison and the just articulated external pressures. As for the company-wide cost reduction drive, we are well advanced in taking the difficult but necessary step of reducing headcount by 5%, which is now expected to yield more than $160 million in annualized savings by the end of this calendar year. In addition, we are strictly scrutinizing spending across all categories and expect further savings as we strive for efficiency and efficacy.\nThere has been much discussion, some of it enlightened, some not so, about the potential impact of generative AI, and there is no doubt that it will profoundly affect the media business. Candidly, generative AI may pose a challenge to our intellectual property and to the future of journalism. As those who've experimented with ChatGPT will be aware, the answers are only as insightful and factual as the source material and are more retrospective than contemporary. Given those precepts, we see 3 areas in which our content will be used by generative AI creators whose products will be enhanced by our IP for which we should be compensated.\nFirstly, our content will inevitably be used as has already been exploited to train AI engines. Secondly, specific examples of our content will be surfaced in response to users' AI queries. And thirdly and crucially, our content will certainly be aggregated and synthesized and those answers monetized by other parties. We expect our fair share of that monetization.\nGenerative AI cannot be degenerative AI. The digital debate over content and journalism has evolved significantly in the past few years. And we appreciate the social and commercial commitment of our partners at Google, Apple, Microsoft and Meta. The A in AI cannot be ambiguity nor can the I represent ignorance. Integrity would be more apt, which brings us to Dow Jones, among the world's foremost and most trusted purveyors of business news, data and analysis.\nThe third quarter reflected its robust revenue generation even in testing economic times. And as I mentioned, was highlighted by the burgeoning of our professional information business, which reported a 38% surge in revenues, including a 16% rise at our Risk & Compliance business, and that number was negatively affected by ForEx fluctuations. Dow Jones has certainly benefited from the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA, which continued their high margin growth in recent months. We will be expanding their product offerings over the next year with particular emphasis on renewables and carbon metrics, and we are confident of many years of strong growth ahead.\nDigital revenues accounted for 79% of all revenues at Dow Jones, a significant increase from the 60% level during fiscal 2018. Aside from the professional information business, digital subscriptions continue to grow up 9% to 3.3 million at The Wall Street Journal and up 10% to 4.3 million at Dow Jones as a whole, with total subscriptions now at 5.1 million despite print subscriptions, obviously being under some pressure. The strong performance overall came despite an insipid ad market in the U.S. with continued weakness in tech advertising, so we did see an improvement in demand in April. So the auguries have improved. Dare I say, the failure of Silicon Valley Bank has been a catalyst for other U.S. financial institutions to try to reassure customers and highlight their own solidity. And The Wall Street Journal, Barron's and MarketWatch are vital platforms for any financial firm aspiring to bolster its credentials.\nIn Australia, Foxtel Group continues to build on its streaming success. Streaming now accounts for 2/3 of the total Foxtel subscription base. And that revenue growth is more than offsetting the decline in broadcast. Fears that our world-class streaming products would be a catalyst for cannibalization have been unfounded. Broadcast churn is at near record low levels with Foxtel retail churn in March under 10%. That success is also a tribute to our marketing and customer service teams at Foxtel and to the leadership of Patrick Delany and Siobhan McKenna. As at the end of March, Binge, our entertainment streaming product, launched advertising on its basic service, adding a new lucrative revenue stream. Interest from advertisers has been ardent as the initial phase of packages were sold out. We have demand and seemingly some flexibility on pricing in the months and years ahead.\nAfter a couple of tough quarters, fortunes have certainly improved at HarperCollins with a bevy of bestsellers and some moderation of supply chain snafus. Margins were higher in the third quarter compared to the first half. We also have an attractive roster of books in this in upcoming quarters. So we believe we are on a journey to the sunlit uplands. Amazon's orders improved in the quarter, and our titles prospered in particular, Ron DeSantis', The Courage to be Free; Barbara Kingsolver's, Demon Copperhead; as well as Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher's, Never Never; and Ben Halls, Saved. In the fourth quarter, Kat Timpf is already topping bestseller list with You Can't Joke About That. If I could make a self-interested recommendation, it is worth a read or a listen. Last week, we also published the latest incarnation of the Magnolia Table cookbook. We are justifiably optimistic about prospects for the Bridgerton prequel Queen Charlotte by Julia Quinn and Shonda Rhimes, which went on sale this week, coinciding with the launch of the new Netflix series.\nThe News Media segment reported a substantial improvement over the second quarter with advertising in constant currency increasing 2%, though down 5% in U.S. dollars. This increase was a vastly different outcome to that of most media companies in most countries. We are confident that our teams are more skilled in sharing advertising insights across borders and platforms, and that innate intelligence is reflected in our revenue numbers.\nOne success story is the sun.com, where total page views in the quarter surged 94% year-over-year, reaching close to 1 billion views. The site, which has benefited from the partnership with the New York Post and our other U.S. properties, has triumphed in tough times, and notably, The Sun's U.S. digital advertising revenues now exceed those of the British platform. In the U.K., connected listing hours at wireless hit an all-time high, reaching an average of 8.4 million per week in the quarter, a 10% increase from the prior year and reflective of our superb coverage of the Premier League, which reaches its seasonal crescendo in coming days, hopefully with an against-the-odds triumph by Arsenal. And as for the New York Post, the previously perennial lossmaker continue to be profitable in the third quarter and to build on its important influence on the national debate. Engagement at The Post digital properties rose 4% over the prior year to 690 million page views in March, providing a powerful platform for its compelling content.\nAt Digital Real Estate Services, obviously enough, the interest rate surged and accompanying uncertainty in the housing market have had an impact in the U.S. and Australia, but these are not permanent conditions and the digitization of the property market is far from complete. There were signs of improvement in the market this quarter, but we understand that the increase in rates has had an impact on affordability and created uncertainty for potential house sellers and buyers. When that uncertainty evaporates, we'll be primed to take full advantage of the opportunity. In the midst of the challenges, realtor is focusing on adjacencies, particularly on the sell side and rental segments, and we are continuing to see benefits from the use of our media platforms, among others, the wsj.com, New York Post and the U.S. edition of The Sun to drive brand recognition and generate traffic. The result of that campaign was seen in the past quarter, and we expect they will continue to be seen in coming quarters. Since the campaign began in February, the project has generated more than 0.5 billion impressions, and showing the unique power we have to bolster brands and turbocharge traffic.\nRealtor.com also further integrated UpNest into its seller experiences in Q3, and is seeing significantly higher conversion rates. At REA, revenues were softer in Q3 compared to the prior year due to the lower listing volume that we are seeing encouraging signs with realestate.com.au, reaching almost 132 million visits in March, the highest total in 16 months and the fifth highest on record. With indications that prices and demand are again strengthening in Australia, we believe we are poised to prosper.\nAnd that is also true in India, where housing.com is the leading digital property platform and saw 21% year-over-year growth in average site visits in the quarter. It is worth noting this metric as India has just passed China as the most populous country and continues to have relative political stability and enormous economic potential.\nAs I said at the outset, there has been much tangible progress in the third quarter. And the auguries are certainly positive for coming quarters. We will absolutely focus on our core engines of growth and prioritize simplification, cost reductions and thoughtful capital stewardship. We remain committed to constantly reviewing our structure and to creating enduring value for our shareholders. And now to provide more insight into third quarter developments, I turn to Susan Panuccio.\n\nSusan Lee Panuccio\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Robert. Our financial results this quarter demonstrated tangible improvements from the first half, which combined with the implementation of our aggressive cost actions, should position News Corp well for fiscal 2024. We Third quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion, down just 2% year-over-year, which was a significant improvement from the second quarter rate and included a $98 million or 4% negative impact from foreign currency headwinds. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, third quarter adjusted revenues were flat compared to the prior year with improving trends at the News Media subscription video services and Book Publishing segments, offset by the decline at Digital Real Estate Services segment. Advertising trends were mixed across our geographies. Total segment EBITDA was $320 million, 11% lower compared to the prior year's record Q3 profits. Results included $7 million of professional fees related to the proposed merger with Fox and the potential sale of Move. Adjusted total segment EBITDA declined 15% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.09 compared to $0.14 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were also $0.09 in the quarter compared to $0.16 in the prior year.\nBefore I discuss the quarter, I wanted to provide an update on our headcount reduction program. Reductions across the business units will vary given the differing nature of our businesses and cost work done to date. We currently expect the annualized growth cost savings to exceed $160 million, up from our initial estimate of at least $130 million with the majority of the savings to be reflected in fiscal 2024. We also expect to incur approximately $90 million to $100 million of cash restructuring charges related to the headcount reductions in the second half of fiscal 2023.\nMoving on to the results of the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $363 million, down 13% compared to the prior year, impacted by the ongoing macroeconomic pressures on both the U.S. and the Australian housing markets. The results include a negative impact of $13 million or 3% from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues decreased 10%. Segment EBITDA declined 26% to $102 million, impacted by lower revenues, the negative impact related to currency headwinds and higher costs related to REA India, partially offset by lower costs at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 24%. REA revenues were $222 million, which declined 10% on a reported basis or down 4% on a constant currency basis. The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower residential revenues and to a lesser extent, softness in financial services. In the quarter, Australia national residential buy listings were down 12%, with Sydney and Melbourne down 20% and 18%, respectively. Those declines were partially offset by the annual price increases in the residential and commercial businesses increased uptake in premium products, including Premier Plus, favorable depth penetration and another robust performance from REA India, which maintained its audience leadership. Like our other businesses at News Corp, REA is taking steps to reduce expenses with a focus on discretionary operational spend and marketing costs. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details.\nAt Move, revenues were $141 million, down 17% compared to the prior year. Real estate revenues were down 23%, driven by lower lead and transaction volumes, reflecting broader housing market challenges. Lead volume fell 30%, while Realtor's average monthly unique users declined 24% to $72 million in the third quarter based on internal metrics, yet up from the $66 million in the second quarter. Realtor has been focusing on optimizing revenues via a prioritized set of initiatives while managing operating expenses as the business weathers ongoing market headwinds. Initiatives include enhancing media advertising placements, including implementing a broader partnership with the businesses across News Corp; optimizing lead allocation across markets; accelerating our go direct path for new homes; and building out the rentals vertical.\nTurning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $477 million, down 3% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis, revenues rose 2% versus the prior year, the fifth consecutive quarter of growth in constant currency. Streaming revenues accounted for 26% of circulation and subscription revenues compared to 20% in the prior year and again, more than offset broadcast revenue declines, benefiting from both volume growth and higher pricing at Kayo and Binge. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group improved to nearly 4.6 million at quarter end, up 6% year-over-year. Total paid streaming subscribers were approximately 3 million, increasing 16% versus the prior year and accounted for approximately 65% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base. Paid subscribers for Kayo reached a record of over 1.3 million, up 14% year-over-year. Net adds from the prior quarter improved to 183,000, the largest sequential increase in 7 quarters with the start of the popular winter sports codes in March. Revenues also benefited from a price rise implemented in February. Binge paid subscribers grew 22% year-over-year or 109,000 net adds from the last quarter to nearly 1.5 million subscribers, benefiting from the successful release of the Last of Us. As Robert mentioned, on March 30, Foxtel introduced advertising within the Binge Basic product. The product accounts for approximately 30% of all Binge subscribers. We expect a modest revenue contribution from advertising beginning in the fourth quarter.\nFoxtel ended the quarter with over 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers. Broadcast churn continued to improve, down 200 basis points year-over-year to 12.3%. In fact, Foxtel retail churn was just under 10% for March 2023. Broadcast ARPU rose 2% to over AUD 84. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $68 million was down 14% versus the prior year. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 9%, reflecting higher sports costs due to contractual escalators and enhancements.\nMoving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones posted healthy top line growth in the third quarter with revenues of $529 million, up 9% compared to the prior year. Digital revenues accounted for 79% of total revenues this quarter, up 3 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented over 80% of total revenues, up 3 percentage points from the prior year, underscoring the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat, impacted by weaker advertising revenues compared to the prior year. We are continuing to see very strong momentum in our professional information business with revenues rising 38% year-over-year, reflecting the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA, coupled with strong revenues from Risk & Compliance. PIB revenues accounted for 37% of segment revenues. Risk & Compliance revenues rose 16% despite a 3 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency, led by an increase in demand for screening and monitoring and financial crime search products. The pipeline remains robust, most notably in EMEA. OPIS and CMA's strong revenue performance is helping reshape Dow Jones revenues to be more recurring as we have increased pricing across our customer base. As Robert mentioned, its carbon index offering continues to expand, and we expect will lead to the creation of new products for current and new customers. Retention rates for OPIS and CMA's products remained well over 90% in the quarter. Circulation revenues declined 1%. The modest decline was driven by lower print volumes and some softness in IBD. Total Dow Jones digital-only subscriptions grew 10% year-over-year or by 208,000 sequentially, the highest net adds since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The focus this year has been on the launch of bundles, which expanded to include IBD in the third quarter.\nAdvertising revenues declined 14% to $88 million and accounted for 17% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter. Within advertising, digital fell 17% and print was down 8%, with notable impacts from the technology and finance categories, as we mentioned last quarter. While the advertising market remains challenged, we are seeing encouraging signs with the rate of decline abating. After hitting a low in December, each successive month showed an improvement, with March notably down mid-single digits, and we saw further improvements in April. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 24% to $109 million as cost growth moderated from the first half, albeit the business is still experiencing the impact of inflationary pressures. The results also reflect the lapping of transaction costs related to the OPIS acquisition last year. Segment EBITDA margins rose to over 20%. Adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter declined 11%.\nAt Book Publishing, revenues were flat at $515 million, driven by higher Christian book sales offset by foreign currency fluctuations. After a challenging first half of the year, we saw some positive trends with stability in Amazon orders in North America following the reset in the first half as well as stronger performance from several recent titles. Segment EBITDA declined 9% to $61 million. Costs rose approximately 1%, reflecting ongoing supply chain issues in North America, specifically in manufacturing, distribution and freight costs, which are now showing signs of moderation.\nThe headcount initiative is well underway, which should result in lower employee costs in the fourth quarter. In the quarter, HarperCollins also settled a 3-month-long strike with the UAW. The backlist represents 60% of revenues for the quarter, up slightly from last year. Digital sales declined 3% this quarter and accounted for 23% of consumer sales, in line with the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 2%, and segment EBITDA fell over 7%.\nTurning to News Media. Revenues were $563 million, down 3% and included a $42 million or 7% negative impact on revenues from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted revenues rose 4%, improving from the prior quarter rate. Circulation and subscription revenues declined 4% but rose 4% in constant currency. Growth on a constant currency basis was driven by cover price increases in the U.K. and Australia and double-digit digital subscriber growth across News Australia and The Times and The Sunday Times. Advertising trends improved this quarter as advertising revenues were down 5%, but gained 2% in constant currency. Advertising revenues at News U.K. rose 8% in constant currency, led by strong digital advertising performance which is continuing to benefit from the growing scale of the sun.com in the U.S. and an improved performance at The Times and Sunday Times. Advertising was flat at News Australia in constant currency and notably, both Australia and the New York Post benefited from an improvement in print advertising this quarter. Segment EBITDA of $34 million declined 13%, reflecting a much more modest decline from the first half rate as incremental year-over-year investments related to the Talk TV initiative in the U.K. and other digital initiatives in Australia slowed to approximately $13 million. Newsprint costs remain a challenge, having $40 million of negative impact this quarter from higher prices. Those pressures were partially offset by ongoing cost saving initiatives across the businesses. Adjusted segment EBITDA fell 5%.\nTurning to the outlook. As a reminder, last year's fourth quarter included an extra week, which contributed $110 million to revenues or about 4% to revenue growth and will impact prior year compares. We continue to face some supply chain and inflationary pressures and advertising conditions remain uncertain. However, it is important to note that the company's exposure to advertising has materially declined as a result of the reshaping of our portfolio, including the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA. In fact, advertising revenues represented only 16% of total revenues in the third quarter. Despite the extra week, a difficult prior year comparison and ongoing foreign exchange headwinds, given current spot rates, we expect to see improvements in profitability in the fourth quarter as we continue to implement aggressive cost initiatives.\nLooking at each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for April declined 24%. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. At Move, like the third quarter, we expect lead volumes to remain challenged in the near term, and we will continue to balance marketing spend and reinvestment in adjacencies with necessary cost reductions elsewhere.\nIn Subscription Video Services, we continue to expect the Foxtel Group's profitability in local currency for the full year to be relatively stable to the prior year despite a step-up in sports rights costs in the second half related to annual contractual escalators. At Dow Jones, we saw an improvement in advertising in April, albeit visibility remains limited as the prior year compares will be further impacted by the extra week in fiscal 2022. We expect the rate of investment spending to slow, which should lead to improved profitability in the fourth quarter. We have now fully lapped the OPIS acquisitions in the third quarter and will lap CMA in June.\nIn Book Publishing, April revenue trends were soft, consistent with industry data, but we expect cost pressures to start to moderate and are optimistic about our release slate, which as Robert noted, includes Magnolia Table Volume 3 from Joanna Gaines, and Queen Charlotte, a prequel to Bridgerton from Julia Quinn and Shonda Rhimes.\nAt News Media, advertising trends remain volatile with limited visibility. We expect total segment cost decline, in part, due to lower incremental costs related to the TalkTV investment, which launched in April 2022, and we hope to see improved profitability for the segment. We have also seen moderating newsprint cost pressures in the U.K.\nWith that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Florin\n\nSenior VP & Head of IR, News Corporation\n\nThank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. .\nOn the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information.\nAdditionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments. .\n\nRobert J. Thomson\n\nCEO & Director, News Corporation\n\nThank you, Mike. The second quarter produced challenges for some of our businesses and highlighted the progress made in other segments that had been challenged. Obviously, a surge in interest rates and persistent inflation had an impact on all of our businesses, but in particular, Digital Real Estate and Book Publishing, which remains a majority of physical business and continues to be subject to logistical exigencies. But we believe these challenges are more ephemeral than eternal. And just as our company passed the stress test of the pandemic with record profits, the reform is now underway at our businesses should create a solid platform for future profitability.\nCrucially, we will be reducing headcount across the company by 5%. That is a necessary response given these macro conditions. There are other broader trends that will inevitably be auspicious such as our evolving partnerships with major tech platforms and the incipient changes to the digital advertising market, which should enable us to improve yields for our valuable inventory and have more oversight of permission data.\nAt the same time, we are absolutely focused on reducing costs across our businesses and making price adjustments where prudent. And we are continuing to work on the integration of our recent acquisitions, OPIS and CMA, which are already enhancing revenue and profits at Dow Jones. As for our discussions over the potential sale of Move, we will provide an update at the appropriate moment. Obviously, any potential deal would be designed to maximize value for our shareholders in the short and long term.\nLooking now at the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. We generated over $2.5 billion in revenues, representing a decline of 7% year-over-year, though most of that was due to foreign currency. Adjusted revenues were down only 3%. Profitability was $409 million compared to $586 million in the prior year, reflecting the challenges of interest rates and inflation noted earlier and the impact of fickle ForEx movements, which have shown signs of abating in recent weeks.\nEven in the midst of the obvious global challenges I've described, Dow Jones had a solid quarter, and the Professional Information Business displayed particular promise with revenues surging 45% year-over-year. The result highlights the value of our opportunistic acquisition of OPIS and CMA, where we have recently launched products, including carbon credit indices and are working on more sophisticated analytics for our growing customer base.\nRisk and Compliance again reported strong revenue growth, increasing 13% despite capricious currency trends, with the demand for New York customer tools expanding as governments globally continue to tighten regulations and wheeled sanctions. The imperative for an authoritative audit trial has expanded far beyond financial institutions and the credibility that Dow Jones brings is in itself an important factor for many companies. Is there anyone on this call who does not want to minimize risk and maximize compliance?\nDow Jones has begun to roll out a new user interface for the Aladdin's cave of content that is Factiva, which is an essential tool for serious businesses. The truth is that the interface was in need of simplifying, and the Dow Jones team have addressed that issue. The easier Factiva is to use, the more it will be used.\nOverall, at Dow Jones, digital revenues now comprise 76% of total revenues, a 4 percentage point rise over the past year. Some of that expansion is due to continuing strength in digital subscriptions. Digital-only subscriptions increased 10%, while total Dow Jones consumer subscriptions rose 5%. In fact, just in recent weeks, total Dow Jones subscriptions sold past the 5 million mark for the first time. Almar Latour and the team are increasing the emphasis on upselling subscriptions with the bundling of MarketWatch, the WSJ, IBD and Barron's. The basic strategy is to provide an ever more premium service for our readers as we leverage valuable audiences across platforms.\nI am particularly proud to highlight the continuing revival of Foxtel's fortune under the sage leadership of Patrick and Siobhan and the team, we have increased profitability and thus optionality.\nReported segment revenues were down 7%, while segment EBITDA rose a healthy 5%. Even more impressively, adjusted revenues, which excludes the impact of ForEx volatility, rose 3%, while adjusted segment EBITDA rose a handsome 16%.\nStreaming continues to be a core strength of Foxtel, as we have added well over 0.5 million paying OTT subscribers in the past year. BINGE reached nearly 1.4 million paying subscribers in the quarter, and we'll be launching an advertising tier later this fiscal year as we seek to maximize Foxtel's revenue potential. Total paying subscriptions at Foxtel were up 10% year-over-year, and we also saw the benefits of modest price increases at Kayo and BINGE.\nOur sports programming portfolio has been enhanced with the renewal of Australian cricket rights to 2031. We are now on the cusp of the peak selling season for Kayo as the Australian Football and Rugby League seasons will start imminently, and we solidified our entertainment offerings with an expanded multiyear content deal with NBCU. Overall, Foxtel's continuing success and positive trajectory have certainly increased our optionality for that business.\nHarperCollins experienced another difficult quarter, reflecting sluggish spending on books after the pandemic inspired surge, difficult front-list comparisons as well as the continuing impact of Amazon's logistics issues. Under the prevailing circumstances, it is absolutely necessary to confront the cost base as we seek to bolster long-term profitability in the post-pandemic marketplace. Some of our key titles this quarter include Fox News host Harris Faulkner's Faith Still Moves Mountains and joined games, the stories we tell. While best-selling authors, Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher's work Never Never will be released later this month.\nThe News Media segment showed signs of real resilience in the midst of a volatile advertising market and ForEx headwinds. The standout masthead was the sun.com in the U.S., which reported 127% year-over-year increase in quarterly page views.\nMeanwhile, The Times and Sunday Times reached nearly 490,000 digital subscriptions in the quarter. And at News Corp Australia, total digital subs exceeded 1 million, representing an 11% rise year-over-year. Wireless had a solid quarter in connected listening, which was assisted by interest in the World Cup on talkSPORT, while TalkTV revitalized its lineup, and the New York Post remains on target for another profitable year despite the ad market.\nAs for Digital Real Estate Services, the patent complexities of the current housing market in both the U.S. and Australia are well known and have had an effect on REA and Move. The property market inevitably has interest rate-related cycles. But with rates nearing a peak in both the U.S. and Australia, we believe the next phase of the cycle is not far away. We have this week launched a new campaign to use our media inventory to drive traffic at realtor.com and the positive effect should be seen in coming months.\nREA continued to maintain its #1 market share in Australia this quarter with over 3.3x the audience of its nearest competitor. And our business in India, now the market leader in audience, is showing much potential. While leads were down at realtor.com in the quarter, the business saw a year-over-year improvement in revenue per lead as the team is focused on pricing, sell-through and close rights.\nWe now are increasing our emphasis on the monetization of sell-side listings as inventory time on the market has increased significantly in recent months, and we will be able to provide realtors and vendors with improved service.\nIn closing, while we expect the macro trends to have a continuing effect on our businesses and are committed to a 5% reduction in our workforce, we are confident that the combination of prudent cost management, sound capital stewardship, commitment to digital expansion and simplification should provide a firm foundation for future growth. And we will remain acutely focused on the creation of value for our shareholders as the possible sale of Move eloquently testifies. We also remain firmly committed to our $1 billion share buyback and dividend program.\nAnd now for more granular account of our second quarter, I give you over to Susan Panuccio.\n\nSusan Lee Panuccio\n\nCFO, News Corporation\n\nThanks, Robert. Before we discuss the quarterly results, I want to expand on Robert's opening comments. As we noted in our recent SEC filing, we have been engaged in discussions with CoStar about a potential sale of Move. Any potential transaction would need to not only maximize shareholder value, but also strengthen realtor.com's competitive position. We do not plan on making additional comments on this call regarding the potential transaction, and we'll update the market when appropriate.\nTurning to our fiscal 2023 second quarter results. The macro environment weighed heavily on the financial results and conditions worsened as the quarter progressed, most notably in December. Second quarter total revenues were over $2.5 billion, down 7% year-over-year, which included a $171 million or 6% negative impact from foreign currency headwinds. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, second quarter adjusted revenues fell 3% compared to the prior year. The revenue decline was primarily driven by the Book Publishing and Digital Real Estate Services segment. On a constant currency basis, we saw continued growth in circulation and subscription revenues, which was partially offset by a modest decline in advertising revenues.\nTotal segment EBITDA was $409 million, 30% lower compared to the prior year's record profits. The results included $6 million of onetime costs incurred by the special committee and the company regarding the proposal from the Murdoch Family Trust, which has now been withdrawn and the special committee has been dissolved. Adjusted total segment EBITDA declined 28% versus the prior year period. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.12 compared to $0.40 in the prior year due to lower total segment EBITDA and higher losses from equity affiliates. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.14 in the quarter compared to $0.44 in the prior year.\nMoving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $386 million, down 15% compared to the prior year, impacted by the ongoing macroeconomic pressures on both the Australian and U.S. housing markets. The results include a negative impact of $26 million or 5% from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues decreased 10%. Segment EBITDA declined 28% to $128 million, impacted by lower revenues and a negative impact related to currency headwinds, partially offset by lower broker commissions REA. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 22%.\nREA revenues were $240 million, down 16% on a reported basis, including a 9% negative impact from foreign exchange. Revenues were impacted by the weakness in financial services due to fewer settlements amid rising interest rates and a decline in residential revenues driven by lower new buy listings. In the quarter, Australia national residential buy listings were down 21% with Sydney and Melbourne down 34% and 31%, respectively. Those declines were partially offset by price increases in the residential and commercial businesses, higher contribution from Premiere Plus and favorable depth penetration as well as continued momentum at REA India, which is scaling in both traffic and revenues. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details.\nAt Move, revenues were $146 million, down 14% compared to the prior year, with real estate revenues down 17% driven by lower lead and transaction volumes, reflective of the broader housing market challenges. Unique lead volumes fell 37%, while Realtor's average monthly unique users were $66 million in the second quarter based on internal metrics.\nTurning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $462 million, down 7% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis, revenues rose 3% versus the prior year, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in constant currency, underscoring the improved stability of the business.\nStreaming revenues accounted for 26% of circulation and subscription revenues compared to 19% in the prior year and again, more than offset broadcast revenue declines, benefiting from both volume growth and higher pricing at Kayo and BINGE. We also benefited this quarter from growth in commercial revenues as the prior year results were impacted by the pandemic-related lockdown.\nTotal closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group reached over 4.3 million at quarter end, up 10% year-over-year. Total paid streaming subscribers were approximately 2.7 million, increasing 25% versus the prior year and represented 62% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base.\nKayo paying subscribers reached over 1.1 million, up 11% year-over-year, but declined sequentially from the first quarter as it exhibited typical seasonal patterns with the end of the AFL and NRL seasons in September. Given its enhanced and expanded content offerings, Foxtel has rolled out a price rise to its Kayo customers effective this month on its basic 2 stream tier.\nBINGE paying subscribers grew a robust 48% year-over-year to almost 1.4 million subscribers, benefiting from a strong release slate, which included the second season of White Lotus and carryover demand from House of the Dragon. As Robert mentioned, we are looking forward to the introduction of advertising within BINGE later this fiscal year and have begun selling launch packages.\nFoxtel ended the quarter with 1.4 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 10% year-over-year. Broadcast churn improved sequentially and year-over-year to 12.9% despite the migration of cable subscribers to streaming or satellite. At quarter end, less than 80,000 subscribers remained on cable as Foxtel continues to migrate subscribers from cable by fiscal year-end. Broadcast ARPU rose 2% to AUD 83.\nSegment EBITDA in the quarter of $90 million was 5% higher versus the prior year, which reflects an 11% negative impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 16% despite higher sports and entertainment costs.\nMoving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones posted a strong top line performance in the second quarter with revenues of $563 million, up 11% compared to the prior year. Digital revenues accounted for 76% of total revenues this quarter, up 4 percentage points from last year. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 1%, impacted by a weaker advertising marketplace compared to the prior year. Circulation revenues grew 3%, driven by strong year-over-year volume gains, including bundled offerings with total Dow Jones digital-only subscriptions up approximately 10% to over $4.1 million.\nWe are particularly pleased with the performance in our Professional Information Business, which saw revenue growth accelerate from the prior quarter to 45%. PIB revenues accounted for 33% of segment revenues. The integration of OPIS and CMA are progressing in line with our expectations as the businesses benefit from the strong demand across numerous industries, including metals, carbon plastics, sustainability, biofuels and renewables, while yields continue to rise and retention remains strong.\nRisk and Compliance revenue growth accelerated from the prior quarter, up 13% despite a 7 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency. We saw improved growth in all regions, underpinned by a healthy new business pipeline most notably in EMEA, led by demand for screening and monitoring and financial crime search products. Retention remains strong at above 90%.\nAdvertising revenues declined 7% to $131 million, with digital advertising revenues down 3% in the quarter and print down 13%, which was mostly due to weakness in December, with October and November reasonably stable versus the prior year. Digital advertising accounted for 59% of total advertising revenues, which improved 3 percentage points from last year. The technology and financial categories, which are typically our 2 largest advertising categories, were both impacted by the macro conditions. We saw digital advertising growth at the wallstreetjournal.com, underscoring its premium audience. However, this was more than offset by the declines at MarketWatch, which face more headwinds as its audience and advertising demand tend to be more stock market-sensitive.\nDow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter declined 3% to $139 million, reflecting a higher spending rate compared to both the prior year and first quarter, driven by costs related to the OPIS and CMA acquisitions, higher compensation costs and phasing of marketing expenses. Adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter was down 16%. We expect cost growth to moderate in the second half, and I will provide more detail on this later in my commentary about the outlook for the upcoming quarter.\nAt Book Publishing, while we saw some impacts from the logistic constraints at Amazon. The results were mostly hampered by significant softness in consumer demand across the industry, notably in North America. On the cost side, lower cost due to volume declines were partially offset by ongoing supply chain inventory and inflationary pressures, further contracting margins. For the quarter, revenues declined 14% to $531 million and segment EBITDA declined 52% to $51 million. The backlist represented 57% of revenues, up slightly from last year, partly driven by weaker frontlist performance with the mix being more weighted towards physical copies rather than digital, which had an adverse impact on margins.\nDigital sales declined 7% this quarter and accounted for 19% of consumer sales. On an adjusted basis, revenues fell 11%, and segment EBITDA declined 51%. To mitigate the recent challenges, HarperCollins has already implemented price increases and has been actively reviewing its cost structure, including the recently announced 5% company-wide headcount reduction.\nTurning to News Media. Revenues were $579 million, down 9%, which included a $65 million or 10% negative impact on revenues from foreign currency. Adjusted revenues rose 1%. Circulation and subscription revenues declined 7%, but were up 4% in constant currency. Growth on a constant currency basis was driven by cover price increases in the U.K. and Australia and double-digit subscriber growth across News Australia and The Times and The Sunday Times. We saw advertising conditions worsened from the prior quarter, albeit with variance across our markets. Advertising revenues were down 13%, but down 3% in constant currency. Advertising at News U.K. was down modestly in constant currency as lower print advertising revenues were partially offset by strong growth in digital advertising at The Sun, which has seen very strong momentum in both page views and yields from its U.S. site.\nAdvertising trends were notably weaker in Australia and at the New York Post. During the quarter, we saw that December was the weakest month for both the U.K. and the New York Post, while in Australia, November was the most challenging with December showing modest improvements month-over-month.\nSegment EBITDA of $59 million declined 47%, which was driven by approximately $22 million of higher costs related to the talkTV initiative in the U.K. and other digital investments, notably in Australia as well as nearly $21 million negative impact from higher newsprint pricing.\nNew York Post remained a positive contributor to segment EBITDA. Adjusted segment EBITDA fell 43%. Free cash flow for the 6 months ending December 31 was lower than the prior year due to lower total segment EBITDA as well as the timing of working capital payments, which included the payment for sports rights in the second quarter. We remain focused on driving strong and positive free cash flow generation for the year.\nTurning to the outlook. We continue to expect a higher cost due to supply chain and inflationary pressures, advertising conditions remain challenging and visibility is limited. We expect ongoing foreign exchange headwinds, albeit at a more modest impact given recent sport rights. We remain committed to reducing costs where we can, driven by headcount reductions across our business units, prioritized marketing spending and lower discretionary costs, while balancing investment spend.\nLooking at each of our segments. Our digital real estate services, Australian residential new buy listings for January declined 9%. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. At Move, we expect lead volumes to remain challenged in the near term, due to macro conditions, albeit moderating mortgage rates have led to early signs of improving trends in the housing market.\nIn Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the performance of the streaming products and the ongoing focus on broadcast ARPU and churn as we continue to migrate customers off cable. We are very encouraged by the year-to-date performance and continue to expect the Foxtel Group's profitability in local currency for the full year to be relatively stable. Profitability will be skewed to the fourth quarter as we expect third quarter cost to be higher in local currency compared to the prior year given the contractual escalators and expanded content from the AFL and NRL.\nAt Dow Jones, we remain focused on the integration of OPIS and CMA. January advertising trends were similar to December with revenues down versus the prior year, and we expect trends to remain challenged, especially given the ongoing pressures within the technology category, noting that visibility is limited as usual. As I mentioned earlier, we expect the rate of investment spending growth in the second half to be more modest than the first half rate, which should aid profitability.\nIn Book Publishing, we are optimistic about our new release site, which should help with the performance in the second half, although near-term industry trading conditions have remained challenged.\nAt News Media, similar to the second quarter, we expect ongoing inflationary cost pressures, especially on newsprint prices, which will be balanced by targeted cost initiatives. We will continue to see incremental costs in relation to product investments, albeit at a lower rate than the second quarter.\nAnd finally, in relation to the potential sale of Move and the special committee's work on the now withdrawn proposal, we expect to see some additional onetime transaction costs in the third quarter.\nWith that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Florin\n\nSenior VP & Head of IR, News Corporation\n\nThank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com.\nOn the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nThis call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information.\nAdditionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\n\nRobert J. Thomson\n\nCEO & Director, News Corporation\n\nThank you, Mike. While the macro environment is patently more volatile, we believe the resilient foundations of the reincarnated News Corp give us a platform for sustained growth and increased profitability. That clearly is evident in our revenue performance this quarter. While revenues were down 1% to $2.5 billion, that decline was obviously a consequence of foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, our revenues grew a healthy 3%, building on the robust results from last year. Profitability for the quarter was $350 million, down 15%. Although that reflects the ForEx headwinds and a reset by Amazon of its book inventory levels and warehouse footprint.\nWe view neither factors reflective of core business conditions or of our long-term potential. Our results follow 2 successive years of record profits at News Corp. It is important to keep that unprecedented success in mind, especially as we encounter what we expect to be a femoral challenges. Our company has changed the digital terms of trade, and we expect the current situation to be transitory. We see positive prospects across all our segments and our mix of revenues and geographies is obviously advantageous in a complicated perplexing world.\nTurning first to Dow Jones. Q1 was the best first quarter on record since acquisition for revenue, profitability and margin, affirming the wisdom of our acquisition of Opus and CMA, which have bolstered the Dow Jones professional information business. Revenues grew a resounding 16% and advertising was up 4%, which compares rather favorably to a number of competitors. In particular, digital advertising at Dow Jones rose 11%, a noteworthy achievement in this complex environment.\nIn fact, Q1 represents the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year digital ad growth at Dow Jones. In the past year, Dow Jones added 473,000 digital-only subscriptions. And as of the end of Q1, 83% of subscriptions at Dow Jones were digital only. At Wall Street Journal, despite the tough market, paid digital subscriptions increased by over 350,000 year-over-year. During the quarter, Investor's Business Daily launched a paid newsletter Market TM to attract younger investors and commissioned an options information app that will present new analytics for options trading, a complex but potentially lucrative sector.\nWith its panoplia premium products, Dow Jones has renewed focus on bundling our premium content, including the Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch and Barron's. These valuable combinations have already exceeded 200,000 subscriptions, and we have begun to roll out a bundle featuring WSJ, Barron's and IBD. Revenues at the Professional Information business rose 40% year-over-year. We continue to clearly see the benefit of risking compliance in an environment of intensifying scrutiny by regulators who are insisting that companies to minimize risk and maximize compliance. The integration of Opus and CMA has been proceeding successfully, and they joined a burgeon in Dow Jones Data and Intelligence business, providing an impressive $52 million in combined revenues in Q1 and contributing materially to profitability this quarter.\nOpus and CMA continue to leverage their proprietary data and analytics with new offerings, including carbon industries and are assisting companies in making sense of dynamic market for capital. Overall, we are delighted with the tangible progress in our professional information business, which is providing an existing flow of high-yield, low churn digital plan.\nAt Digital Real Estate Services this quarter, we saw resiliency even though housing market conditions have patently become more volatile, especially in the U.S. REA Group achieved substantial revenue growth in constant currency on the back of higher prices, increased penetration of its new Premier Plus enhancement and strong listing value while maintaining its more than 3 forward-leading traffic over the competition.\nThere was also a notable audience of revenue growth at REA, India, which further consolidated its position as the #1 property portal in that massive and growing market. At Move, Realtor.com, revenues were down 6%, reflecting relatively similar trends to the fourth quarter. Realtor's unique users have risen 21% since the first quarter of financial '20. Thanks to product enhancements and increased marketing. The position and equip the business to take full advantage of the inevitable upswing in the market, we are expanding our offerings in rentals and in developing sell-side expertise, which we expect will drive profits far into the future.\nRealtor is also taking decisive steps to streamline and optimize the business while enhancing reinvestment capacity and capitalizing on long-term growth opportunities. Our focus on seller leads, which are the source of most revenue in the Australian market is building on our recently acquired UpNest. The UpNest experience has been integrated into key seller placements across the site, providing sellers the ability to get proposals from multiple agents and offering consumers significantly more choice.\nMeanwhile, even in a challenging housing environment with higher mortgage rates, tight inventory and inflation, home prices have remained elevated, and we note that active listings at Realtor improved by 29% in the quarter compared to the prior year period.\nRealtor remains focused on the long-term opportunities in what is an estimated $200 billion addressable market. As mentioned earlier, the Amazon reset affected many publishers in Q1, including HarperCollins. This reset relates to Amazon's decision to reduce inventory levels and shutter warehouses and accounted for almost the entirety of HarperCollins revenue contraction and the vast majority of its profit decline this quarter. Notably, consumer appetite, which expanded during the pandemic, continue to be robust and provides us with increasing confidence going forward. And we are absolutely focused on cost control with HarperCollins and the imperative to improve margins in these challenging conditions.\nKey frontlist titles in the quarter included Portrait of an Unknown Woman by Daniel Silva, Live Wire by Kelly Ripa and Breaking History by Jared Kushner. We are prospering from our global ownership rights to the Lord of the Rings trilogy given the popularity of the Amazon series, and we are looking forward to the release of the stories we tell by Joanna Gaines and Collin Hoover's next work.\nFinally, we noted HarperCollins focused last month acquired (inaudible) publishers, an independent publisher of quality gift books. Cider Mill specialized in cooking, wine and spirits and humor books, and includes Apple source press at children's brand. Its deep backlist should provide an ongoing source of incremental revenue. Our subscription video services, Foxtel had another stronghold, streaming subscriber penetration to expand and costs have been thoughtfully on. Foxtel has recently renewed or signed valuable long-term sports rights and content agreements, including the AFL, WWE and NBC University.\nWe have obvious optionality at Foxtel where the conversation is no longer about how much capital we plan to invest but the potential for capital return. Foxtel streaming services obtained 2.8 million paying subscribers as of the end of September, surging 34% versus the prior year and accounting to 63% of the total subscriber bank. Kayo and BINGE added nearly [0.75 million] subscribers in the past year alone, underscoring the potential of Foxtel in a still expanding Australian market.\nFoxtel Group delivered record audiences for the recent AFL and Minera finals. Meanwhile, Motorsport, the Regal World Cup and T20 Worldcup cricket are bolstering subscriber loyalty as we hear streamline directors. The News Media segment experienced a revenue decline of 4%, but it rose a healthy 6% on an adjusted basis when taking into account ForEx fluctuations and others.\nIn constant currency, we saw a healthy growth in advertising, circulation and subscription revenue. Our News Corp Australia circulation revenues improved in constant currency and digital subscriptions exceeded the $1 million mark for the first time, up 13% year-over-year. News.com.au asserted its leadership in the free media environment with an audience of 13 million in the month of September. Meanwhile, in New York Post continued to improve profitability, thanks in part to a strong increase in digital advertising revenues.\nThe Post digital network also flexed its muscles with a 24% increase in page views, reaching an average of 129 million per week in Q1 and 151 million average monthly in September. At News UK, the Suns digital advertising exceeded print for the fourth consecutive quarter and accelerated its growth. And we're delighted by the success of the Sun.com, which continued to increase its already sizable audience, particularly in the United States.\nAt the time, Sunday Times also saw a 23% increase in digital paid subscriptions, reaching 468,000, marking its second best-ever quarter of digital growth. News broadcasting, the new name for the radio and television brands of News U.K. reported an increase in both reach and listening hours according to the latest (inaudible) report. Forksport reached 2.9 million listeners. We've tuned in for more than 18 million hours, up 10% quarter-on-quarter, and we expect the imminent World Cup to be a source of audiences and of advertiser.\nNews Corp is building on a base that has grown stronger, more global and more digital in recent years. We have seen record profitability in each of the last 2 fiscal years. By many key measures, our resounding progress has continued, digital advertising on the rise, streaming, surging and subscriptions storing.\nDespite the macroeconomic uncertainty, having streamlined and digitized our businesses and reached substantial agreements with the big tech platforms to compensate us for our premium journalism, we are better equipped to generate increasing value to our investments. And our strong cash position means that we have been able to return capital to shareholders and invest shortly in future growth while hornoring our proud problems.\nOne last point. As we announced last month, following the receipt of letters from Rupert Murdoch and the Murdoch family trust, the News Corp Board of Directors has formed a special committee of independent board members to begin exploring a potential combination with Fox Corporation. There can be no certainty that the company will engage in such a transaction. We do not enter comment further at this time. And for that reason, we will not be taking questions on this topic today.\nWe are, of course, happy to answer your questions about the performance of and prospects for our business, particularly as it relates to the first quarter of this fiscal year. As always, we thank our investors for their faith and confidence in us. and all our employees, advertisers, readers and audiences for their valuable contributions and enduring support.\nNow I turn to Susan and expand on these results.\n\nSusan Lee Panuccio\n\nCFO, News Corporation\n\nThank you, Robert. We have entered fiscal 2023 with a different macro environment, including volatility in foreign currency impacting our headline results from our Australian and U.K. businesses. Throughout fiscal 2022, we successfully navigated the company to be in a position of strength, guided by our ongoing cost transformation work, which we have balanced with investment and innovation to drive digital expansion.\nThe first quarter of fiscal 2023 presented some challenges, particularly at HarperCollins, but most of the businesses performed well in constant currency and suffice to say that News Corp remains well positioned given the strength of our asset mix, healthy balance sheet and the continued diversification of our revenue base. First quarter total revenues were approximately $2.5 billion, down 1%, which included a $153 million or 6% negative impact from foreign currency headwinds. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, first quarter adjusted revenues grew 3% compared to the prior year.\nTotal segment EBITDA was $350 million, down 15% compared to the prior year, which saw a record profit with 53% growth. That being said, total segment EBITDA this quarter was still up 31% over fiscal 2021, underscoring the material changes in recent years. Also noteworthy is that the majority of the profit line in this quarter was driven by lower sales from Amazon due to the reset of its inventory levels and the rightsizing of its warehouse footprint as well as foreign currency fluctuations neither of which we believe are reflective of underlying performance. Adjusted EBITDA declined 13% versus the prior year period.\nFor the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.07 compared to $0.33 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.12 in the quarter compared to $0.23 in the prior year.\nMoving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $421 million, down 1% compared to the prior year. The results include a negative impact of $20 million or 5% from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues increased 3%. Segment EBITDA declined 14% to $119 million impacted by higher employee costs and increased operating costs driven by strategic investment activities of both Move and REA together with negative impact related to currency headwinds. The increase in investment costs at Move was due to the expansion into adjacencies, including salaries, rentals and new homes as we focus on the longer-term opportunity.\nAdjusted segment EBITDA declined 7%. Move revenues were $169 million, down 6%, following 30% growth in the prior year period. For the quarter, real estate revenues fell 9% driven by lower lead and transaction volumes, reflective of the broader industry trends. Consumer affordability constraints impacted uniquely volumes, which declined 32% in the quarter, although that was a slight improvement from the fourth quarter rate.\nBoth trends were partially offset by price optimization within the traditional lead gen business, higher sell-through of our hybrid offering, market VIP, home price appreciation and continued advertising gains. We also had revenue growth from our adjacencies, including the acquisition of UpNest, albeit these revenue streams are still in the early stages of development.\nReferral offerings accounted for approximately 30% of total revenues, down from 32% last year, impacted by lower transaction volumes, partially offset by higher home prices. Based on our internal metrics, Foxtel's average monthly unique users were 86 million in the first quarter. REA had another strong quarter, with revenues rising 2% year-on-year on a reported basis to $252 million, which included a $20 million or 9% negative impact from foreign exchange.\nGrowth was driven by price increases, contribution from Premier Plus favorable debt penetration and growth in national listings, partially offset by a modest decline in financial services revenues due to lower settlement activity. Overall, new buy listings rose 5% with Sydney and Melbourne up 5% and 12%, respectively. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details.\nTurning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $502 million, down approximately 2% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. Importantly, on an adjusted basis, revenue grew 6% versus the prior year, accelerating from the prior quarter rate of 4% growth. Streaming revenues accounted for 25% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 19% in the prior year and again, more than offset broadcast revenue declines.\nTotal closing paid subscribers across Foxtel Group reached almost 4.5 million at quarter end, up 16% year-over-year with the growth rate improving 3 percentage points from the fourth quarter. Total subscribers, including trial has reached over 4.6 million. Total paid stream subscribers reached over 2.8 million, increasing 34% versus the prior year and adding 117,000 sequentially with streaming subscribers now representing 63% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base.\nKayo paying subscribers reached almost $1.3 million, up nearly 19% year-over-year, slightly down from the fourth quarter levels due to typical seasonal patterns at the end of the AFL and NRL seasons in September. BINGE paying subscribers grew a robust 67% year-over-year to over 1.3 million subscribers benefiting from the release of the House of the Dragon and the popularity of the Foxtel Origin series, The 12. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.4 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 10% year-over-year, similar to the fourth quarter rate.\nBroadcast churn was 14.2% compared to 14% in the prior year, partly reflecting the acceleration of migrating subscribers of cable. Broadcast ARPU rose over 1% to approximately AUD 83. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $111 million fell 3% versus the prior year, significantly impacted by currency, with adjusted segment EBITDA increasing 5%.\nMoving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones continued to post strong performance in the first quarter with revenues of $515 million, up 16% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting 79% of total revenues this quarter, up 4 percentage points from last year. Results included a full quarter from both the Opus and Chemical market analytics acquisitions. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose approximately 6%.\nCirculation revenue grew 5%, driven by strong year-over-year volume gains with the Wall Street Journal digital-only subscriptions, up 13% to over $3.1 million and total Dow Jones digital-only subscriptions also up 13%. Professional information business revenues rose 40% and accounted for approximately 35% of segment revenues driven by the acquisitions of Opus and CMA. Revenues from the acquisitions are progressing in line with our expectations as the businesses benefited from strong demand across numerous industries, including metals, carbon, plastics, sustainability, biofuels and renewables, while yields continue to rise and retention remains strong. Risk and Compliance revenues grew 6%, although currency had a 10 percentage point negative impact on revenue growth given the business' higher exposure to Europe and APAC.\nAdvertising revenues grew a healthy 4% to $94 million despite lapping 29% growth in the prior year. Digital advertising revenues rose 11% in the quarter as we continue to see very strong yield improvement and saw growth in all categories, especially in B2B this quarter. Digital advertising accounted for approximately 65% of total advertising revenues, which improved 4 percentage points from last year.\nPrint advertising revenues were down 6%. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 19% to $113 million as margins continued to improve with 50 basis points of expansion year-over-year to nearly 22%, helped by the inclusion of Opus and CMA. Adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter was down 1%, reflecting higher employee costs. At Book Publishing, as we fared during the quarter, results were materially hampered by Amazon's reset of inventory levels and rightsizing of its warehouse footprint resulting in significantly lower orders and higher returns. Supply chain pressures continue to impact freight and manufacturing costs but are showing some signs of easing from recent quarters.\nAs it relates to Amazon, we have not seen similar inventory level adjustments from other book distributors or retailers. And as Robert noted, consumer demand has remained healthy, and consumer sales data remained consistent with prior quarters. For the quarter, revenues declined 11% to $487 million and segment EBITDA declined 54% to $39 million.\nWe estimate Amazon accounted for almost the entire year-over-year revenue decline and the majority of the year-over-year segment EBITDA shortfall. Our backlist contributed 65% of revenues, up slightly from last year, benefiting from the demand of token titles helped by the premier of the Rings of Power on Amazon. Digital sales rose 1% this quarter and accounted for 23% of consumer sales. On an adjusted basis, revenues fell 7% and segment EBITDA declined 51%.\nTurning to News Media. We continue to see relatively strong advertising trends, particularly at News Australia. Revenues were $553 million, down 4% versus the prior year, largely due to currency, which had a $62 million or a 11% negative impact on revenue. Importantly, despite macro uncertainty, adjusted revenues for the segment increased a healthy 6% compared to the prior year due to strength in circulation and subscription and advertising revenues in constant currency.\nCirculation and subscription revenues declined 6%, but that included a 12% or $32 million negative impact from currency fluctuations. Growth in constant currency was driven by cover price increases in the U.K. and Australia, and increase in content licensing revenues and double-digit subscriber gains across News Australia and The Time and the Sunday Times.\nAdvertising revenues declined 4% compared to the prior year, which included a 9% or $22 million negative impact from currency fluctuations. Growth in constant currency was driven by an increase in digital advertising revenues, primarily of the sun where digital revenue yet again equals print revenue, while Australia benefited from strong preperformance led by a recovery in retail and travel, which were impacted by the lockdowns in the prior year.\nThe New York Post also posted strong digital games. Segment EBITDA of $18 million declined 47%, driven by over $20 million of higher costs related to Talk TV and other digital investments, together with higher news production and distribution costs across the businesses, which are being impacted by the current inflationary and supply chain challenges. Adjusted segment EBITDA fell 44%.\nBefore we look at the outlook for the next quarter, I would like to touch on free cash flow. First quarter free cash flow is typically lower due to the timing of working capital payments, and we remain focused on driving strong and positive free cash flow generation for the year.\nTurning to the upcoming quarter. We continue to expect higher costs due to supply chain and inflationary pressures. Advertising conditions are mixed and visibility remains limited across the businesses. We also expect ongoing foreign exchange headwinds, given the current spot rate for the Australian dollar and pound sterling compared to the prior year. Looking at each of our segments, at Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for October declined 18% as we lapped tougher prior year comparisons.\nPlease refer to REA for more specific outlook commentary. At Move, we expect lead and transaction volumes will be challenged in the short term, and we will continue to take steps to mitigate those pressures while balancing ongoing investments with cost discipline. In Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the performance of the streaming products and the ongoing focus of broadcast ARPU and churn as we continue to migrate customers from cable to streaming.\nAt Dow Jones, we remain focused on the integration of Opus and CMA. Advertising visibility remains short term. However, we are expecting a more challenging second quarter. We also expect the rate of investment in the second quarter to be higher than the prior year as we continue to focus on driving consumer subscription and enhancing our PIB offerings.\nInput publishing supply chain and inflationary pressures continue to persist, albeit by showing signs of easing. We still expect headwinds from Amazon in the second quarter, although with strong customer demand, we expect any issues to be short term in nature. At News Media, like the first quarter, we expect incremental costs in relation to price investments across the businesses, including top TV and other digital initiatives, together with ongoing inflationary pressures, including newsprint prices.\nBefore we open for questions, I would like to remind everyone that we will not be addressing any questions related to the special committee and/or a potential combination with FOX Corporation, as Robert stated earlier. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Florin\n\nSenior VP & Head of IR, News Corporation\n\nThank you very much, Sarah. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2002 (sic) [2022] Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com.\nOn the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nThis call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information.\nAdditionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total Segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\n\nRobert J. Thomson\n\nCEO & Director, News Corporation\n\nThank you, Mike. The overuse of superlatives really is unbecoming. But the past quarter and the full year have created so many unprecedented records that reflect well on all of News Corp and we believe have created a platform for future performance and enduring returns for our investors. These accomplishments, which necessarily demand the use of superlatives, follow intense digital transformation by the businesses and focused acquisitions that we expect will provide increased revenue and healthy profits far into the future.\nProfitability for the full year rose 31% to a record $1.67 billion, and that followed a 26% surge in the previous year, which itself was a record. Revenues rose a robust 11% despite incipient economic uncertainty and unfavorable forex fluctuations that outweighed the benefit of an extra week. In total, the favorable results were reflected in our reported EPS of $1.05 compared to $0.56 in the prior year.\nIt is worth noting that we saw enhanced success in each and every business segment last year, and we are confident of our prospects in fiscal 2023. Our core pillars, Dow Jones, Digital Real Estate Services and Book Publishing, all notched record results that exceeded the sterling performance of the previous fiscal year when new benchmarks were set across most of the company.\nAnd it's worth noting that our net cash from operating activities was a record $1.35 billion, topping the previous year's record of $1.24 billion. That extra cash has enabled us to return capital to shareholders and to be pointedly poised for opportunistic investments of the kind that have already transformed the Dow Jones business, making it more digital, more premium and more profitable.\nThe successful journey of our media properties is unlike any in the world as has been the principal pursuit of change in terms of trade with the big digital players. We believe the profoundly positive commercial and social impact of those changes will be felt for many years to come. None of that would have been possible without a strong corporate culture created by and curated by Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, the support of an engaged, enlightened Board and passionate, committed and creative employees around the world.\nSo we have a sturdy balance sheet, potent cash generation, profitable and growing businesses and the resources to take advantage of emerging opportunities. That muscularity was also reflected in the past year by the termination of our shareholder rights plan, or as it is referred to colloquially, the \"poison pill.\"\nOver the past 8 years, our reported revenue has grown by $1.8 billion, even though our advertising revenue, print newspaper-dependent as it was, declined by $2.2 billion. That is a $4 billion swing. Over the same period, our total segment EBITDA has more than doubled, and our free cash flow available has increased by over 80%.\nDow Jones has prospered, more than doubling its segment EBITDA, to $433 million in just the past 3 years. Our faith in its prospects has been shown by the acquisitions of Investor's Business Daily, OPIS and Base Chemicals, all of which we expect will contribute to revenue and profitability in the years ahead.\nMeanwhile, Digital Real Estate Services has expanded rapidly, from 5% of our revenues in 2014, to 17% in fiscal '22. To be precise, we have seen growth in every quarter of this past year despite the recent increases in interest rates and the home supply challenges. We are confident the digital runway for real estate is long and lucrative.\nIt is certainly worth recognizing that News Corp's profits have expanded prodigiously compared to 8 years ago, rising from a reported $770 million in total segment EBITDA, to nearly $1.7 billion this year. Our teams have made this successful journey despite the upheaval in the advertising market, despite the significant challenges to print media and despite the pandemic. We are more digital, more mobile, more global, acutely cost-conscious and astutely tracking trends, in the quest for more revenues, increased profitability and enhanced returns for our investors.\nTo be specific about the segments, Dow Jones is already seeing the tangible benefits of OPIS and Base Chemicals, which we have rebranded, Chemical Market Analytics, or CMA to the (inaudible). These 2 businesses complement each other, and they certainly complement Dow Jones. We were fortunate to acquire them at a favorable price as their sale was required by regulators for approval of the S&P Global-IHS Markit merger. We thank those companies and the regulators for the opportunity bequeathed to us.\nNot only are OPIS and CMA starting to benefit us financially, but they have contributed to the depth and breadth of Dow Jones' overall expertise in commodities, in traditional fuel sources, in essential chemical products and in renewables and more. The analysis and analytics fit perfectly into our Professional Information Business, where we have seen sustained growth, particularly from Risk and Compliance, which reported an 18% surge in full year annual revenues, with the fourth quarter seeing another double-digit increase. That means we have reported 28, that is correct, 28 successive quarters of double-digit growth.\nAdvertising at Dow Jones remained strong in the fourth quarter and was a significant contributor to the segment throughout the year. Total advertising at Dow Jones achieved year-over-year growth of 20% for the full year, the highest on record. Dow Jones also made progress in expanding its high-yielding subscriber base, which rose 9% to almost 4.9 million, including over 4 million digital-only subscribers.\nAs a point of comparison, digital advertising at Dow Jones rose 16% in the most recent quarter, while it shrank, it contracted, it diminished at the New York Times. In what was a resounding performance for News Corp, Dow Jones really is worthy of note. Dow Jones profitability saw 54% in the quarter, to $106 million. And as noted earlier, for the year, segment EBITDA was $433 million, up 30%, while revenues rose to over $2 billion, an 18% increase.\nThe imperative at Dow Jones is to provide a premium service and premium value to a premium audience and is remembering that this is a premium audience at scale, with more than 100 million visitors each month to Dow Jones sites and thousands of the world's largest companies as enterprise clients. Our task, our opportunity, is to offer more of the information, the intelligence demanded by discerning professionals. These are fertile fields for the future.\nAt Digital Real Estate Services, revenues for the full year surged 25% to more than $1.7 billion, while segment EBITDA grew 12% to $574 million as we continue to build brands and products for future success.\nIn Australia, REA continued its expansion into intelligent adjacencies, most notably with the Mortgage Choice acquisition, and residential listing volume improved by 11% in fiscal '22 to the highest level since 2016. We also now have the #1 digital property company in India in terms of audience share, with Housing.com expanding its lead in an expanding market. Monthly visitors rose in June by 52% to $15.7 million.\nIn the U.S., Move, operator of realtor.com, reported revenue growth for the year of 11%, while we invested in expanding our expertise in rentals and acquired UpNest, an agent marketplace that focuses on monetizing seller leads.\nThe broader thing is that we see a confluence of trends in the U.S. and Australian marketplaces. The U.S. market has traditionally derived revenue from buyer leads, but the future will bring opportunity to harvest seller revenue, which is the basis for REA's emphatic success in Australia.\nAs for the U.S. housing market, obviously, the hiking of interest rates has influenced market trends. For example, mortgage refinancing has imploded, which plays to our strength as a source of mortgage origination leads, which mortgage companies were ignoring somewhat because it was easier to refinance an existing, a known customer.\nThe rate of price increases that put homes out of reach is generally expected to continue to decline, and inventories have at last started to improve, with active inventory in June up 19% year-over-year, according to realtor.com.\nNews Media, which in recent years has faced severe challenges, did particularly well, both in Q4 and throughout the fiscal year. To be precise, News Media was the single largest contributor to profit improvement across the company this fiscal year. Let's be candid. This spectacular result came as many other newspaper companies around the world struggled and is a true tribute to the efforts of our executives and teams in Australia, the U.K. and the U.S.\nIn fiscal 2022, revenues were up 10%, and the segment delivered $217 million of segment EBITDA, expanding 317% year-over-year. I should repeat that stunning number for clarity, 317%. At News UK, The Sun reported a historic shift, with digital advertising outpacing print in fiscal '22 as its online audience surged 33% in Q4 to 165 million monthly average uniques globally, including 173% growth for the sun.com driven by the successful launch of The Sun US. Overall, News UK, thanks to Rebekah Brooks and her team, increased its profit contribution by $54 million.\nNews Corp Australia, under Michael Miller and his team, increased its profit contribution by $109 million, its highest since separation as digital subscribers to News Corp Australia properties rose by 12%, to $964,000, and advertising revenues remained robust.\nThe New York Post posted a historic result. It formally reported a profit, possibly the first since Alexander Hamilton founded the paper, and we are now on a pathway to increasing profit contribution. The Post has distinguished itself with brave journalism that has seen it so far above the media mediocrity. That is a tribute to the intrepid editor, Keith Poole, his journalists and to Sean Giancola, the Chief Executive, and all on the team.\nWe also transitioned from the Bronx printing site and are working towards completion of that facility's sale.\nAt Subscription Video Services, the Foxtel Group's renaissance continued, with adjusted revenues, which excludes currency impact, rising 4% in the fourth quarter, while adjusted segment EBITDA rose 32% in the fourth quarter. And importantly, excluding currency, full year revenues for the segment rose for the first time in 5 years.\nAgain, the Foxtel Group is a company transformed and one generating record metrics. Total streaming subscribers at the end of the fiscal year soared 31% from a year ago, to $2.8 million, while broadcast churn fell to 13.8% in the fourth quarter, sharply lower than the prior year.\nOur sports streaming service, Kayo, is particularly successful, with ARPU rising, partially attributable to the recent price increase and given the quality of our teams, productions and the quantity of quality sports.\nHarperCollins grew full year revenue and segment EBITDA despite higher freight and manufacturing costs and a challenging prior year comparison given that the pandemic created a captive audience and record revenues in many countries. We can clearly see the virtue of acquiring Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books & Media as the value of that priceless backlist is being realized.\nThat efficacy should be obvious in coming months as HMH includes the U.S. rights to the Lord of the Rings collection, and we have seen increased orders ahead of the Rings of Power series on Amazon Prime, scheduled to be launched next month.\nSpeaking of superlatives, we have the best-selling book in the U.S. with the new Daniel Silva novel, Portrait of an Unknown Woman, and we are pleased by the lingering melody of Where the Crawdads Sing, the first movie that was just released in partnership with our friends at Sony Pictures.\nThe News Corporation of 9 years ago is not the News Corporation of now. The provenance and the principle endure, but the business is fundamentally transformed. It is vastly more profitable and with the potential for even greater growth. Our teams are rightly proud of the way they have influenced the digital landscape, changing the terms of trade for media businesses, bringing clarity to an opaque advertising market and increasing transparency to hit the 2 uncountable algorithms.\nThe commercial changes are integral to our ongoing success, but the social consequences are also profound and enduring. Almost a decade after our reincarnation, thanks to the efforts of our employees and the faith of our investors, News Corp is set fair for the future.\nOur CFO, Susan Panuccio, will now provide a concise account of what has transpired and a glimpse of the shining light that is the future.\n\nSusan Lee Panuccio\n\nCFO, News Corporation\n\nThank you, Robert. Fiscal 2022 was another record year for News Corp. We have taken significant steps over the years to reshape and strengthen the portfolio, reduce fixed costs, transition to become more digital and generate incremental high-margin revenues. I will come back to some thoughts about our fiscal 2023 outlook, but suffice to say, that News Corp is well positioned as we move into fiscal 2023, given the strength of our asset mix and balance sheet and the continued diversification of our revenue base.\nFiscal 2022 fourth quarter total revenues were almost $2.7 billion, up 7%. The fourth quarter includes an extra week, which positively impacted revenues by $110 million. That impact was more than offset by foreign exchange headwinds of $139 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, fourth quarter adjusted revenues grew 9% compared to the prior year, including the extra week.\nTotal segment EBITDA was $315 million, up 50% versus the prior year, primarily due to higher overall revenues and lower costs in the Other segment, partially offset by higher costs from recent acquisitions and the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The current quarter results include a onetime $20 million legal settlement charge for Insignia.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew a healthy 34% versus the prior period. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.19 compared to a loss of $0.02 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.37 in the quarter compared to $0.16 in the prior year. Our free cash flow generation remains strong and remains a key area of focus.\nMoving on to the results for the individual reporting segment for the fourth quarter, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $443 million, an increase of 7% compared to 74% revenue growth in the prior year. The results include a negative impact of $22 million from a valuation adjustment of future trail commissions at REA's financial services business and a negative impact of $20 million or 5% from foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by the $21 million contribution from Mortgage Choice and the benefit from the extra week, which added $14 million to Move's revenues.\nOn an adjusted basis, segment revenues increased 7%, which does not exclude the benefit from the extra week. Segment EBITDA declined 11% to $121 million driven by the $14 million negative impact at REA related to the revaluation of trail commissions and an $8 million or 6% negative impact related to currency headwinds as well as higher employee costs at both REA and Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 1%.\nMove's revenues were $193 million, up 4% following 68% growth in the prior year. For the quarter, real estate revenues grew 3% and accounted for 84% of total revenues. Price optimization within the core lead-gen business, higher penetration of our hybrid offering, Market VIP, and continued home price appreciation, coupled with higher advertising revenues, helped to offset the impact from lower lead volumes and transaction volumes.\nMove's revenues also benefited by $40 million from the extra week. Referral offerings accounted for approximately 31% of total revenues, up from 30% last year. Based on our internal metrics, REALTOR's average monthly unique users were $93 million in the fourth quarter.\nLead volumes in the quarter fell 39% compared to the prior year, impacted by continued lack of supply and home price appreciation as well as the recent rising mortgage rates. Home prices remain high, growing in mid-teens in June, underscoring the continued supply and demand imbalance.\nDuring the quarter, Move acquired UpNest, advancing REALTOR's seller and listing agent strategy, and continued to make investments in rentals and new homes as they build out those adjacencies. In the last 2 years, REALTOR's focus was not only to take advantage of the strong market dynamics during the pandemic, but also to position itself for long-term growth while focusing on core competencies and improving the product to deliver deeper and richer information for consumers and customers.\nThis is evidenced by the shift to the data-rich referral base model with the integration of Opcity, which enabled the launch and expansion of Market VIP, the hybrid product, and Seller's Marketplace to allow customers to explore seller leads without risking our own capital to enter iBuying. These investments, together with the UpNest acquisition, have allowed us to expand our scale compared to 2 years ago and capture other elements of the transaction life cycle.\nREA had another strong quarter, with revenues rising 10% year-on-year on a reported basis to $250 million as growth in residential depth revenues and the contribution from the Mortgage Choice acquisition more than offset the negative impacts from currency fluctuations and the revaluation of trail commissions.\nREA continued to benefit from the favorable market backdrop, which saw Australian residential new-buy listings rise 2% despite comparing against 54% growth in listing volumes in the prior year and expected uncertainty around the federal election in May. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more detail.\nTurning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $524 million, sequentially higher than the third quarter and down approximately 3% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. Importantly, on an adjusted basis, revenues rose 4%, accelerating from the prior quarter rate of 1%. Streaming revenues accounted for 23% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 16% in the prior year and more than offset broadcast revenue decline this quarter.\nWe believe this is a key inflection point for the business and has helped underpin the recent stability in Foxtel Group's revenue. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group reached over 4.4 million at quarter end, up 13% year-over-year. Total subscribers, including trial, has reached over 4.5 million. Total paid streaming subscribers reached 2.7 million, increasing 34% versus the prior year and adding 114,000 sequentially, with streaming subscribers now representing 61% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base.\nKayo benefited from strong winter sports content, very high retention from the initial repricing of the legacy Live Pass customers and the successful implementation of the price rise in May. Kayo paying subscribers reached almost 1.3 million, up nearly 23% year-over-year.\nBinge paying subscribers grew 63% year-over-year to 1.2 million subscribers, which is relatively stable with the third quarter as the net adds were impacted by the timing of content availability and the record adds in the third quarter. In July, we announced a AUD 2 price rise for Binge's standard offering.\nFoxtel ended the quarter with approximately 1.5 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 10% year-over-year, with the rate of decline modestly improving from the third quarter rate. Foxtel continues to focus on managing broadcast churn, which reduced by over 3 percentage points year-over-year in the quarter to 13.8%, even though cable customers are being actively migrated to the iQ5. This reflects 11 consecutive months of year-over-year churn reduction.\nThe focus on retaining high-value subscribers for broadcast ARPU steadily rise by 2% to AUD 83. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $81 million rose 23% versus the prior year and 32% on an adjusted basis. Foxtel continues to exhibit healthy cash generation and used existing facilities to pay its AUD 306 million of July USPP maturities.\nFor the full year, the business showed stability in revenue and segment EBITDA. And as Robert mentioned, full year adjusted revenues improved for the first time in 5 years, which is a great result for the business given the challenges of recent years. As expected, total costs were relatively stable in local currency.\nMoving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones continued its strong performance in the fourth quarter, with revenues of $565 million, up 26% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for 76% of total revenues this quarter, up 4 percentage points from last year. Results include a full quarter from the OPIS acquisition and 1 month from the Chemical Market Analytics acquisition, which closed in early June. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose an impressive 16%, with the extra week contributing $40 million.\nCirculation revenues grew 17%, reflecting an additional $17 million for the extra week as well as strong volume gains in digital-only subscriptions. Total Dow Jones digital-only subscriptions were over 4 million, up 14%, including 88,000 net adds in the fourth quarter. Professional Information Business revenues rose 47% and accounted for 32% of segment revenues driven by recent acquisitions and growth across all product lines, partly due to $14 million of additional revenues from the extra week.\nWe are focused on further expansion of PIB, which was significantly enhanced with the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA. These acquisitions continue to move Dow Jones to a more recurring and digital revenue base, with very high retention rates, strong margins, premium products and optionality into new market verticals. While we don't break out margins specifically for PIB, it is fair to assume that the products in the business have attractive margins, which we expect to be enhanced by our recent acquisitions.\nRevenue from Risk and Compliance increased 19% driven by higher sales activity, including strong growth across all regions, most notably in Europe, and we have a very strong pipeline of new business activity. OPIS generated $37 million of revenues in the quarter, with the business benefiting from price rises, high customer retention and strong demand in existing verticals. CMA contributed approximately $6 million of revenues in the quarter.\nAdvertising revenues grew 13% to $116 million despite lapping 45% growth in the prior year. The extra week contributed $9 million to revenues. Digital advertising revenues rose 16% in the quarter despite facing a record 53% growth comparable from the prior year. Digital accounted for 58% of total advertising revenues, which improved 2 percentage points from last year.\nWe continue to see very strong yield improvement and full strength in the B2B, B2C and finance categories this quarter. It is also noteworthy that the vast majority of our digital advertising comes from direct sales rather than via third-party programmatic exchanges, which has been helpful to our yield improvement. Print advertising rose 9%.\nDow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 54% to $106 million. Excluding the contribution from the acquisitions, currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in the release, adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter rose an impressive 30% despite higher employee costs and higher sales and marketing costs.\nAt Book Publishing, HarperCollins posted 4% revenue growth to $513 million and segment EBITDA declined 2% to $47 million as we continue to navigate supply chain and inflationary pressures as communicated during the fiscal year. To that effect, margins were down slightly from the prior year.\nWe saw revenue growth driven by a strong frontlist performance in general books and a $20 million benefit from the extra week. Our backlist contributed 56% of revenues, down slightly from last year, impacted by lower sales of the Bridgerton series compared to last year. Digital sales rose 9% this quarter and accounted for 24% of consumer sales. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 4% and segment EBITDA declined 6%.\nTurning to News Media, where the momentum continued in the fourth quarter. Revenues were $629 million, up 6% versus the prior year and included $53 million or 9% of negative impact due to currency headwinds, that more than offset the additional $36 million from the extra week.\nAdjusted revenues for the segment increased 14% compared to the prior year. We again saw a very strong performance in advertising as well as continued growth in circulation and subscription revenues, which was driven by the contribution from our recent content licensing deals, higher digital subscriptions and cover prices.\nDigital revenues continued to expand, increasing to 35% of segment revenues from 32%, primarily driven by the strength of digital advertising, which we expect will soon be the largest source of the segment's advertising revenues. Within the segment, revenues at News Corp Australia increased 6% and revenues at News UK were flat as both were materially impacted by currency headwinds. The New York Post also continued to show strong top line growth, up 23%.\nCirculation and subscription revenues rose 3%, including double-digit digital subscriber growth across News Australia and The Times and Sunday Times. Currency headwinds had a $26 million or 9% negative impact, which more than offset the $19 million benefit from the extra week.\nAdvertising revenues increased 8% compared to the prior year, with strength in digital across all our key mastheads, most notably at The Sun, where digital exceeded print advertising for the third consecutive quarter, benefiting from significantly high yields and its successful launch in the U.S. Currency negatively impacted advertising revenues by $21 million or 9%, partially offset by the additional $15 million from the extra week.\nSegment EBITDA of $33 million increased also by that amount, reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by incremental investments of over $20 million related to talkTV in the U.K., which launched in April, and other digital initiatives. News Corp Australia and News UK contributed $23 million and $16 million, respectively, to the segment EBITDA growth. And the New York Post and Wireless Group were also again positive contributors.\nNews Corp finishes fiscal 2022 more dependent on recurring and circulation-based revenue, less dependent on advertising revenue and with greater cost discipline across the company as a consequence of navigating the past couple of years.\nAs for fiscal 2023, we expect to see an improvement in top line revenue growth, partially driven by the integration of OPIS and CMA, but also by continued digital gains across the company, albeit much will depend on macro conditions and the volatility of foreign currencies. We expect CapEx to be modestly higher in fiscal 2023 and anticipate strong levels of free cash flow.\nFor the upcoming quarter, I would like to discuss a few things. We expect cost impacts from continued supply chain and inflationary pressures, together with wage inflation challenges, to continue. We will take necessary action to address those pressures, including pricing adjustments, together with our ongoing focus on cost management. Visibility on advertising remains limited across the businesses, and we continue to expect foreign exchange headwinds given the current spot rate for the Australian dollar and pound sterling compared to the prior year.\nLooking at each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new-buy listings for July rose 7%. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. As Robert mentioned, across the industry in the U.S., inventory and active listings improved in June as we begin to cycle into more normalized year-over-year comparisons. We still assume lead volumes at Move will be challenged in the short term, and we'll look to mitigate that through yield optimization, new or enhanced products as well as balancing ongoing investment with cost discipline.\nIn Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the performance of the streaming products and the ongoing focus on broadcast ARPU and churn as we continue to migrate customers from cable. We look forward to the launch of House of the Dragon on Binge later this month, which we will expect will drive an improvement in net subscriber additions, and we continue to expect to see stability in earnings in local currency across the year.\nAt Dow Jones, we remain focused on the integration of OPIS and CMA. We expect the rate of investment in the first quarter to be higher than the prior year as we continue to invest to drive consumer subscriptions and enhance our PIB offerings. As a reminder, over 75% of Dow Jones revenues are recurring or subscription-based, the majority digital, with a strong margin, and we feel confident of its growth trajectory leading into 2023.\nIn Book Publishing, supply chain and inflationary pressures continue to persist. We look to capitalize on our global English language rights for J.R.R. Tolkien's work in our backlist as we look forward to the release of The Rings of Power on Amazon Prime in early September.\nAt News Media, we still expect higher content licensing revenue from our platform deals as we implement elements of the broader Google partnership, such as Subscribe with Google, and also benefit from our expanded Apple relationship. We expect incremental costs in relation to product investments across the businesses, including talkTV and our other digital initiatives, together with pressure on newsprint prices. As a reminder, we have recently raised cover prices in both the U.K. and Australia this calendar year.\nWith that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, please go ahead.\n\nMichael Florin\n\nSenior VP & Head of IR, News Corporation\n\nThank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com.\nOn the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nThis call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties and that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\n\nRobert J. Thomson\n\nCEO & Director, News Corporation\n\nThank you, Mike. I'm delighted to report that revenues and profitability were at a new record for the third quarter since the company's rebirth in 2013, building comprehensively on the momentum of our record performance in preceding quarters. News Corp delivered $2.5 billion of revenues, up 7% despite the vicissitudes of currency volatility, while profitability improved by 20%, and that was despite the onetime transaction costs for our OPIS acquisition. The tangible benefits to revenue and profitability of that transaction should be obvious in coming quarters.\nTo put the results in a broader context, we attained more in profitability at over $1.3 billion through the first 3 quarters of fiscal '22 than we did in any entire fiscal year since our rebirth in 2013 and there is certainly more to come in the fourth quarter.\nGiven the impact of the pandemic and not so transitional inflation, both exogenous in the extreme, these sterling results are testament to the strength of the company's culture created and curated by Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, and the commitment, creativity and passion of all our employees.\nWe are investing as well as returning capital to shareholders and have focused our investment on bolstering our growth pillars. The results of that productive investment should be felt for years to come. Our core product suite has expanded as has our reach, and we expect that auspicious combination will (inaudible) our long-term growth.\nFollowing a strong fiscal '21 and first half of fiscal '22, Dow Jones continued to power ahead with revenues and segment EBITDA, both sharply rising. Though the latter was impacted by the onetime costs related to the OPIS transaction. Segment EBITDA was up 7%, even including the OPIS costs, adjusted segment EBITDA actually rose 16%. OPIS, along with Base Chemicals, which we expect will close by the end of next month, represents an exciting opportunity for Dow Jones, extending the depth and reach of our news and information capabilities in the commodities sector.\nThe appetite for data analysis and insight in the energy, renewables, chemicals and related fields is strong and growing. And we believe Dow Jones is ideally positioned to capitalize for many years to come.\nNot only did we acquire OPIS at a rather favorable price, but the recent surge in global commodity prices highlights the profound importance of this sector for Dow Jones. The need for trusted and accurate information has never been more imperative, and we expect to capitalize on that opportunity. OPIS has healthy subscriber growth with robust margins and extremely high retention rates. Given the lack of overlap between the customer bases of Dow Jones and OPIS, we see very strong cross-sell and upsell potential using the vast WSJ, IBD and MarketWatch audiences as a premium pool for customer leads.\nSubscriber growth at Dow Jones remained robust with WSJ digital-only subscribers crossing 3 million this quarter, expanding at a robust 16% rate. Digital-only subscriptions across all Dow Jones consumer sites increased by 19%, which also reflects the consolidation of IBD and early success in new bundled offerings. Digital advertising, Virgin, 21%, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit percent growth. Notably, print advertising has actually expanded for 4 consecutive quarters in double digits. While the conflict in Ukraine had a short-term impact on advertising, given that certain advertisers did not want (inaudible) with war coverage. Overall trends remained favorable.\nThe imposition of sanctions and expansion of watch list underscore the value of the Dow Jones' Risk and Compliance business, which continued its unbroken streak of rapid growth in Q3 when it recorded the 27th straight quarter of double-digit increases.\nAnd on Ukraine. We are deeply appreciative of the professionalism of our journalists and their support teams in covering the tragic conflict and bringing understanding to readers around the world. Our Digital Real Estate Services, both revenues and segment EBITDA continued to expand at a healthy rate. Revenues at REA grew a robust 30% following a surge in listing value and also benefited from the integration of Mortgage Choice, which obviously provides another means of monetizing our valuable leads. In the U.S., the real estate market is in the midst of flux with historically low inventories and rising interest rates. Home prices generally have continued to rise. There is much variation depending on the location, while rents are increasing at a double-digit rate. Affordability and supply, which are obviously related remain issues for first-time buyers, who also face an escalation in mortgage rates, though by historical standards, rates remain relatively low.\nThe ebb and flow of market forces is not unusual. And we believe the opportunity for realtor.com and News Corp has never been greater, as the digitization of the property market continues at pace, and current trends are likely to evolution. Our product innovation has accelerated. Our scale has increased, and we are in the early days of venturing into relevant adjacencies with large addressable markets.\nDespite the shifting market conditions, Move posted revenue growth in the third quarter and our aim to be the digital marketplace for consumers and the industries is clearly paying dividends, as our average monthly unique users exceeded $100 million in March. Over the past 2 years, third quarter revenues of the Digital Real Estate Services segment have increased by 59%, which gives a measure of both the growth and the opportunity. The past 2 years have been remarkable for Book Publishing, with third quarter revenues rising 5% this year which means that there has been a 25% increase since the third quarter of fiscal 2020. And this, in an industry that some observers had presumed to be mature. We expect sales to continue at significantly higher levels than before the pandemic.\nUnsurprisingly, EBITDA for the segment was challenged, including by supply chain cost increases for paper, printing and distribution. We expect these near-term disruptions to abate over time. We also expect continuing success from both new releases and our bolstered backlist, which was enhanced by the acquisition of the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books & Media division. Successful releases included the best-selling memoir by former Attorney General, Bill Barr, One Damn Thing After Another, Red Handed by Peter Schweizer and The Paris Apartment by Lucy Foley.\nGiven the public's abiding appetite for reading, HarperCollins is certainly well positioned for future success. We're excited about Finding Me, the new book by Viola Davis released late last month. And we anticipate a surge in interest in the Lord of Rings franchise for which we now have global English language rights given the launch of Amazon's landmark series later this calendar year.\nIt is worth noting that according to Amazon, the teaser trailer for that series broke a global record for the most watched entertainment trailer to debut during the Super Bowl. Within 24 hours of the trailers release, it had 257 million views. News Media was the biggest contributor to News Corp's growth in profitability in Q3, with segment EBITDA of approximately 388% higher in the quarter. We saw continued strong performance in digital advertising across the segment, alongside a notable rebound in print advertising at News U.K.\nNews Australia had a strong quarter with substantial improvement in profit contribution, thanks in part to our deals with the tech platforms, our continuing cost discipline and the development of our digital platforms. The New York Post renaissance continues with its massive audience, strong advertising growth and improved profit contribution. The New York Post digital network now ranks among the top new sites in the U.S. and has grown nearly eightfold since fiscal '14 to over 172 million average monthly unique users in the third quarter.\nNews U.K. also had a healthy profit contribution with significant revenue improvement of the Sun, where digital advertising outpaced print. It is also notable that the sun.com, the brand extension of the Sun in the U.S. market, increased page views in Q3 by over 260% year-over-year to $500 million, with yields significantly improving. Piers Morgan's much anticipated program launched on April 25, and it more than exceeded expectations in reach across the U.K., the U.S. and Australia. Thanks to the power of our platforms, the pivotal partnership with Fox News and the quality of the programming.\nNot only does Talk TV plan to be a broad church of diverse views and lively discussion, it offers a new opportunity to leverage our strong brands, talented people and premium video content in the U.K. and around the world.\nIn Subscription Video Services, the third quarter saw continued progress in reshaping the Foxtel Group as a growth-oriented subscription business with continued success in streaming, stable revenues and solid cash generation. Notably, Kayo and Binge, both surged in the quarter and are now reaching record numbers of subscribers. Kayo plans to implement a price increase as it benefits from its Kayo platform and high-quality production, which is driving record ratings at the start of the season for both the NRL and the AFL.\nOverall, total paying streaming subs reached nearly $2.6 million, up 62%. We remain pleased with Foxtel's turnaround and have a great optimism about its near- and long-term future. we are continuing to explore all options for Foxtel to maximize its value, while watching closely all relevant developments in the financial markets. Through the first 3 quarters of fiscal year 2022, News Corp is well on track for its most profitable year since separation, clearly besting last year's record results.\nSuccess is building on success. We will relentlessly continue to drive our performance in the quest for enhanced returns for our investors. Complacency, smugness and hubris are not words in our vocabulary. News Corp is a company transformed. More intensely digital, more intelligently global with strong growth in our core markets and much unrealized potential.\nMacroeconomic challenges affect all businesses whether that be the supply chain, corrosive inflation or febrile currency markets. But our resilience, adaptability and ingenuity were stress tested by the pandemic and led to record revenues and profits. We understandably are optimistic about the years ahead. For more granularity about our quarterly performance, I now hand you over to the adroit, Susan Panuccio.\n\nSusan Lee Panuccio\n\nCFO, News Corporation\n\nThank you, Robert. Fiscal 2022 third quarter total revenues were approximately $2.5 billion, up 7%, reflecting strong growth across our core pillars led by Digital Real Estate Services and Dow Jones, which includes the benefits from our recent acquisitions and our continuing shift to digital across the company.\nTotal segment EBITDA was $358 million, higher than the prior year by 20%. And as Robert mentioned, marked the highest third quarter total segment EBITDA on record since separation, reflecting our ongoing focus on costs. Those results came despite approximately $15 million of onetime costs related to the OPIS transaction, which closed on February 28 and a $16 million negative impact from currency headwinds.\nExcluding acquisitions, currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in the release, adjusted revenues and adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 6% and 25%, respectively. Reported EPS were $0.14 compared to $0.13 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was $0.16 compared to $0.09 in the prior year.\nMoving on to the results of the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $415 million, an increase of 19% compared to the prior year. The results include the contribution from the acquisition of Mortgage Choice as well as the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues increased 14%. Segment EBITDA rose 17% to $137 million or up 18% on an adjusted basis. Like the second quarter, the driver of segment EBITDA improvement was REA, while segment EBITDA contribution from Move was flat compared to the prior year.\nMove's revenues were $170 million, similar to last quarter and up 5% year-over-year. This followed 37% revenue growth in the prior year and is now approximately 44% higher than pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. For the quarter, real estate revenues grew 7% and accounted for 85% of total revenues. Price optimization within the core lead gen business, home price appreciation and the resulting flow-through to commissions within the referral model together with higher advertising helped to offset limited inventory impacting both lead volumes and transaction volumes.\nReferral offerings accounted for approximately 28% of total revenues, up 3 percentage points compared to the prior year and was the biggest driver of year-over-year revenue growth this quarter. Based on our internal metrics, REALTOR average monthly unique users were 95 million in Q3, reaching 100 million in March. While unique users were down 3% year-over-year, they are still 40% above pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of fiscal 2020.\nLike the second quarter, revenue growth was partially offset by the divestiture of top producer in March, which negatively impacted revenues by approximately 2 percentage points.\nLead volumes in the quarter were sequentially higher than the second quarter; however, they declined 22% compared to the prior year, impacted by lower new listings and the recent rise in mortgage rates. The team remains focused on driving audience growth, scaling the core real estate business and investing in and growing adjacent businesses while keeping a watchful eye on the macro environment.\nREA had another very strong quarter, with revenues rising 30% year-on-year on a reported basis to $246 million, which includes a $38 million contribution from the Mortgage Choice acquisition. REA enjoyed another quarter of favorable trends, including an 11% increase in Australian residential new buy listings with Sydney up 14% and Melbourne up 8% despite lapping tough comparisons.\nREA also better from higher yields, increased penetration and favorable product mix. Financial Services benefited from an increase in settlements as well as the integration of Mortgage Choice and the team continues to innovate with the launch of Premier Plus in March, an enhanced offering that delivers additional marketing features to listing. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details.\nTurning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $494 million, relatively stable from the second quarter and down approximately 6% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 1%, a strong improvement from the second quarter rate of minus 3%.\nStreaming revenues now account for 20% of circulation and subscription revenues saw a notable acceleration in the growth rate from the second quarter. Total closes in paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group reached 4.3 million at quarter end, up 23% year-over-year. Total subscribers, including trialists, were over 4.5 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher Binge and Kayo subscribers, partially offset by the expected decline in residential broadcast subscribers. Commercial subscriptions rose modestly over the prior year, helped by the easing of lockdown restrictions. Total streaming subscribers reached over 2.7 million with paying subscribers up 62% from the prior year and 421,000 sequentially to approximately 2.6 million.\nStreaming subscribers reached 59% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base. Kayo benefited from the return of the winter sports codes and saw record early ratings with total subscribers over 1.2 million. 138,000 paid subscribers were added in the quarter, a notable acceleration from the second quarter, taking paid subscribers to over 1.1 million.\nSimilar to Kayo, Binge had a strong quarter, increasing its total subscribers to over 1.3 million. Paying subscribers increased to over 1.2 million, up 135% from the prior year. Binge added 284,000 paid subscribers in the quarter, the most quarterly additions since the launch of the service in 2020. Binge's growth continued to be driven by the depth and diversity of its content library and the popularity of new shows such as Love Me and Binge Original, Euphoria and The Walking Dead.\nFoxtel ended the quarter with over 1.5 million residential broadcast subscribers, down approximately 11% with the rate of decline stable versus the second quarter. Commercial subscribers ended the quarter at 240,000, an improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. Retaining high-value customers remains the focus for broadcast subscribers, which has led to churn improvements with churn reducing almost 6 percentage points year-over-year in the quarter to 14.3%, which reflects 8 consecutive months of year-over-year churn reduction.\nBroadcast ARPU rose by 2% to AUD 82. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $79 million was down 13% versus the prior year, driven by higher programming costs, partly due to increased availability of entertainment content as well as modestly high marketing investment in streaming. Cost control remains a key focus of Foxtel, and we continue to expect full year cost to be flat versus the prior year in local currency, which is helping to underpin strong cash generation. The fourth quarter segment EBITDA will face more favorable prior-year comparisons.\nMoving on to Dow Jones, Dow Jones continued its strong performance in the quarter with revenues of $487 million, up 16% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for 76% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Results for the quarter include IBD and one month of the recently acquired OPIS. Circulation and subscription revenues increased 15%, including 16% circulation revenue growth, primarily reflecting the acquisition of IBD and continued strong volume gains in digital-only subscriptions.\nDigital-only net adds at Dow Jones were 167,000 subscribers, including 118,000 at The Wall Street Journal, the highest quarterly addition this fiscal year. Professional Information business revenues rose 13% and accounted for 29% of revenue. Revenue growth from risk and compliance increased 12% despite a 3% negative foreign exchange impact, driven by the higher entry rate at the beginning of the year and strong growth across the Americas, Europe and Asia.\nOPIS accounted for approximately $10 million of revenues in the quarter. As a reminder, the business did $129 million of revenues in its last full year with very strong margins and with revenues almost all recurring and digital. Advertising revenues, which accounted for 21% of revenues this quarter, remained very strong, growing 20% to $102 million despite difficult prior-year comparisons. Digital advertising revenues rose 21% in the quarter on top of 30% growth in the third quarter of the prior year and accounted for 62% of total advertising revenues. We continue to see strong yield improvement led by direct display and for particular strength in the finance and technology categories.\nPrint advertising continued to surprise on the upside with 18% growth year-over-year, partly due to easy prior year compares, but also due to strength in the technology category. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 7% to $88 million following growth of 61% in the third quarter of the prior year. As mentioned earlier, included in the quarter is approximately $15 million of onetime transaction costs related to the OPIS acquisition. Excluding the contribution from IBD and OPIS, currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in the release, adjusted revenues and adjusted segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 9% and 16%, respectively.\nOver the last few weeks, we have received questions from investors about our exposure to the war in Ukraine. Across the company, our exposure to the region is at Dow Jones. The region accounts for a de minimis amount of Dow Jones' gross revenues, almost entirely and so far, the impact from closed accounts and/or canceled contract is immaterial.\nWe are also beginning to see opportunities in Risk and Compliance emerge due to increased sanctions and regulatory requirements. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins posted 5% revenue growth to $515 million and segment EBITDA fell 16% to $67 million. However, consumption levels continue to remain materially above pre-pandemic levels.\nCurrent quarter results were impacted by the ongoing global supply chain and inflationary pressures on freight and manufacturing costs as well as very difficult comparisons with the prior year, which benefited from a higher backlist performance driven by the Bridgertons Series by Julia Quinn. The Bridgertons Series still performed well this quarter, but revenue contribution was down approximately $14 million versus the prior year.\nAs flagged during our last earnings call, we saw an increase in manufacturing costs, partly due to supply chain issues, including higher inbound international freight and fuel prices. Digital sales declined 6% this quarter and accounted for 23% of consumer sales, which was almost entirely explained by the lower Bridgertons sales, which did particularly well in the e-book format last year and also contributed to the strong margin performance in the prior year.\nHMH continued to perform according to plan. For the Quarter, HMH contributed $35 million in revenues and $3 million in segment EBITDA and remains on track to deliver $20 million in annualized cost synergies. Turning to News Media. The momentum in this segment continued during the quarter. Revenues were $580 million, up 5% versus the prior year, which included $25 million or approximately 5 percentage points of negative impact due to currency headwinds. The underlying growth rate in local currency was similar to the second quarter. We again saw improvement in advertising as well as strong growth in circulation and subscription revenues, benefited by the contribution from our recent content licensing revenues.\nWithin the segment, revenues at News Corp Australia and News U.K. increased 2% and 4%, respectively. Wireless Group and the New York Post also continued to show strong top line growth. Adjusted revenues for the segment increased 10% compared to the prior year. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 5%, benefiting from strong digital subscriber growth, incremental revenues from the platform agreements and cover price increases.\nCurrency headwinds negatively impacted circulation and subscription revenues by $12 million or 4 percentage points. Advertising revenues increased 9% compared to the prior year, with strength in digital across all our key markets, most notably at the Sun, which more than doubled digital advertising revenues versus the prior year. Currency negatively impacted advertising revenues by $10 million or 5 percentage points. Segment EBITDA of $39 million increased $31 million compared to the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues. Margins improved to almost 7% from 1% last year. Results were partially impacted by higher investment related to talkTV and marketing support for new digital product offerings at News Corp Australia.\nI would now like to talk about some themes for the upcoming quarter. We remain encouraged with our strong year-to-date results and that we have already delivered record profitability since separation for the company at the end of Q3. But we are clearly mindful of the lack of visibility from the ongoing impacts of the pandemic. The broader macroeconomic impacts from the war in Ukraine and the cost impacts from continued supply chain and inflationary pressures, particularly in Book Publishing and our market heads together with wage inflation and talent retention across the company.\nWe expect these challenges to continue in the short term. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for April declined 8%, impacted by the timing of the Easter and Anzac Day holidays. REA anticipates growth rate to slow as it cycled strong prior period listing volumes, which grew 54% in the fourth quarter of last year and potential impacts around the upcoming federal election in May. Please refer to REA for more specific outlook commentary.\nAt Move, despite tougher comparisons and the macro environment, we continue to see strong yields. We expect to continue to reinvest in Move as we drive the core business and expand into relevant adjacencies, particularly in loans and rentals. Similar to last year, we expect investments in the second half. In Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the performance of the streaming products and the ongoing focus on broadcast ARPU and churn.\nAs mentioned earlier, we expect full year costs in local currency to be relatively flat versus the prior year, and we expect improvement in profitability in the fourth quarter against the prior year. At Dow Jones, overall revenue trends across the business remain strong. We do expect the rate of advertising growth to be impacted next quarter by a more difficult prior year comparison, which saw advertising grow by 5%.\nExcluding the impact from acquisitions, we expect the rate of cost growth to be higher than the third quarter as we continue to invest to drive consumer subscriptions and enhance our Professional Information business offerings. And as Robert mentioned, we expect to close the Base Chemicals acquisition in June. In Book Publishing, we expect another quarter of strong front list releases and supply chain and inflationary pressures to persist.\nAt News Media, overall advertising trends remain favorable, albeit recognizing that visibility is limited. We continue to expect incremental annual revenues from the recent platform agreements with the majority of that allocated to News Media. We expect incremental costs of at least $20 million in relation to product investments across the businesses, including talkTV in the fourth quarter.\nOn the other segment, we expect costs in the second half to be slightly higher than the first half due to the phasing of costs, but lower than the prior year. Finally, note that this fiscal year is on a 53-week basis and will include an extra week of financial results. I would also like to note that similar to the third quarter, we do expect foreign exchange headwinds to continue given the current spot rates to the Australian dollar and pound sterling compared to the prior year. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMichael Florin\n\nSenior VP & Head of IR, News Corporation\n\nThank you very much, Jess. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer.\nWe've all been with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy.\nActual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS.\nThe definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release. With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\n\nRobert J. Thomson\n\nCEO & Director, News Corporation\n\nThank you, Mike. We are delighted that the considerable momentum shown over the past 2 years has continued unabated in the most recent quarter. While the first quarter was the most profitable first quarter since our rebirth in 2013. The second quarter was the most profitable of any quarter with record revenues and record profitability. Products are certainly deserved by our employees for their collective and unstinting effort, energy and creativity.\nWe are all proud to be furthering a tradition of purpose in principle created by and curated by Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch. Credit [too] must go to a Board that has provided thoughtful prescient guidance during a particularly challenging period for most media companies in most countries.\nRevenues for the quarter exceeded $2.7 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year, while profitability rose 18% to $586 million and net income reached $262 million. In the first half of this fiscal year, News Corp amassed nearly $1 billion of total segment EBITDA, a 30% surge while reported net income was $529 million compared to $308 million in the previous year.\nThe platform agreements with Big Tech continued to benefit our bottom line. In addition to our substantial deals with Google and Facebook, we have extended and expanded our multiyear global agreement with Apple, which is expected to be an important source of subscriptions and of advertising revenue for our new sites around the world. There is no doubt that Tim Cook and Eddy Cue have a visceral enlightened understanding of the importance of professional journalism, and we genuinely appreciate their personal and corporate commitment.\nOur businesses are flourishing. There was again strong performance at Digital Real Estate Services, Dow Jones and Book Publishing and a rapid expansion of profitability at our News Media segment. We are delighted that agreement has been reached to acquire the Opus and Base Chemicals businesses after their required sale for antitrust reasons. They will surely add to the luster of the already lucrative Dow Jones professional information business.\nThose acquisitions should formally close in the first half of calendar 2022. We had indicated that the strength of our cash position and our robust growth would enable us to make opportunistic purchases, and that has come to fruition and at reasonable prices that we believe will benefit all our shareholders.\nThat studied strategic expansion has been complemented by a $1 billion share buyback program already well underway and which we expect will provide ongoing value to our investors. Turning first to Digital Real Estate Services. It is manifest that there is a global shift in the housing market, with families wanting more space, a higher quality of life and the opportunity to work from home, which is simply not feasible without a home.\nUnsurprisingly, there were 6.12 million existing home sales in the U.S. last year, the highest figure in 15 years, and that total came despite the disruption of COVID in viewing and reviewing homes. We see much macro strength ahead in a market that is still far from being fully digitized and should benefit from rising employment and from interest rates that while on an incline, remain close to historic lows.\nIn the second quarter, Digital Real Estate Services reported 35% revenue growth and 25% segment EBITDA growth. Listing volume improved noticeably at REA. While realtor.com reinvested in valuable adjacencies and continue to generate strong revenue growth despite relatively low U.S. housing inventory levels.\nAs of December, according to comScore, realtor traffic growth exceeded that of Zillow Trulia for 23 straight months, which is vindication of our resolute focus on our core mission and customers. We were not mired in the capricious caldera (inaudible) of House flipping. In Australia, REA reported revenue growth of 56%, which includes the integration of Mortgage Choice.\nThe tapering of rapid house price rises has been accompanied by a flurry of new listings, even though the COVID situation remained somewhat unpredictable. And 1 state, Western Australia has chosen not-so-splended isolation. The Australian government is expecting an economic renaissance over the next year or so, and that should benefit REA and all of our businesses in that country.\nDow Jones had a superb quarter with 14% revenue growth and a 32% increase in segment EBITDA at $144 million. Bear in mind that these outstanding numbers come on top of a particularly strong quarter a year ago, underscoring the scale of Dow Jones achievements. We are successfully building upon success. Subscriptions expanded across the Dow Jones portfolio, and there was 23% advertising revenue growth in the quarter.\nRisk and Compliance reported a revenue increase of 17%, the 26th successive quarter of double-digit revenue growth to emphasize, 26 successive quarters of double-digit revenue growth. Total Dow Jones subscriptions, including IBD, rose 17% in the quarter, reaching approximately $4.7 million. And the Wall Street Journal's total subs exceeded $3.6 million with nearly 3 million of them being digital-only, an increase of 19% year-over-year.\nTo be clear, these are core subscribers who are signing up to a premium product at a premium retail price. Our ability to offer high-margin professional products will certainly be enhanced by the integration of Opus and Base Chemicals, both of which have still growing traditional businesses and rapidly expanding offerings in renewables.\nWe plan to use Dow Jones expertise to create truly verifiable carbon products and prices in a market that is patently immature and lacking in transparency and veracity. And we expect the pressure for credible disclosure to be an additional source of revenue for our Risk and Compliance business.\nFor clarity, these 2 new businesses have revenue bases that are close to 100% digital and recurring. They are highly profitable with healthy revenue growth and modest CapEx requirements. We expect that investors will be able to see clearly the positive impact in coming quarters. That these deals were done at rather attractive multiples is self-evidently a bonus for our investors. Book Publishing posted record numbers a year ago and the growth continued inexorably in Q2.\nThis continuing success is thanks to the diverse front list and deep backlist at HarperCollins, augmented over the past year by the opportunistic acquisition of the Horton Mifflin Harcourt Books & Media segment. Notable success was seen with Re drummers the Pioneer Woman Cooks Super easy and Dave Grolls, the storyteller.\nLooking ahead, we have high hopes for the Paris apartment by Lucy Foley, another David Williams installment in is superlative best-selling WorldsWorsh series and what may well be the most telling book of the Trump administration, One Damn Thing After Another by Bill Barr, who was attorney general and had a remarkable career before that service.\nHaving read the text, I can report that this is a brilliantly written, profoundly important work, which will share thoughtful light on a turbulent period in the country's history. Also note in the second quarter, Harlequin launched Harlequin Plus, a direct-to-consumer digital subscription service that will appeal to romantics around the world. The app and website will give subscribers an opportunity to have a literally liaison with book bundles, e-books, movies and games. This multimedia offering is yet another example of the clever contemporary leveraging of our world-class content.\nNews Media had a particularly strong quarter with segment EBITDA up 68%. That outstanding performance reflected growth in advertising, the benefits of the deals with the Big Tech platforms, sensible sustained cost discipline and the benefit of savvy product and technology investments made in recent years. The robust advertising results up 17% in the quarter, were evident at all major mastheads across both print and digital.\nOur digital trends are particularly pleasing, which speaks to the value of our global network and improvements in our understanding of permission data. It also reflects the Sage leadership of Michael Miller in Australia, Rebecca Brooks in the U.K. and both Shawn Kohler and Keith Pool at the New York Post.\nNews Corp Australia showed a highly noteworthy improvement in profit contribution with digital paid subscriptions scaling to nearly 910,000 and the intelligent expansion into digital adjacencies. The New York Post had an especially successful Q2 with an appreciable contribution to segment EBITDA, thanks to a resounding advertising performance and its vast and growing digital audience.\nWe recorded 160 million unique users in the month of December. The post increase in profit contribution has, it is fair to say, it exceeded even our demanding expectations. News U.K. had its highest second quarter profit contribution since fiscal 2011, helped by an acceleration in digital paid subscriber growth. In addition, the Sun's traffic has surged with global monthly uniques for December, up 25% to $163 million, and our fledgling U.S. Sun site growing rapidly.\nIt's worth reiterating and pondering for a moment, some of those astounding numbers. Based on internal metrics, as of December, we had 160 million uniques for the New York Post, 163 million uniques for the Sun, over 80 million uniques for realtor.com and 123 million uniques with Dow Jones. That is certainly a firm foundation for network growth.\nIn the U.K., Wireless made a positive contribution to News Media's revenue and segment EBITDA growth. We're also looking forward to the launch of Talk TV, which will be available on platforms, including linear TV and OTT. The channel will take full advantage of our talent and content in the U.K. and via the global deal with PearsMorgan, our platforms in the U.S. and Australia. It will be high quality, low cost and certainly impactful.\nSubscription Video services benefit from increasing subscriptions and decreasing churn. Thanks to the ongoing appeal of our streaming platforms, the high quality of our technology, our increasingly sophisticated understanding of audience data and the depth and broad appeal of our unparalleled entertainment, sports and news offerings.\nSports seasonality is always a factor in Australia, but our total streaming subscribers expanded by 66% year-over-year, with Binge exceeding 1 million subscribers and Flash, our news aggregation service in its infancy. In toto, as of December, we had almost 2.3 million streaming subs, representing 56% of Foxtel's total subscriber base, which was 4.1 million.\nIt's worth noting that in addition to the increase in streaming subs, broadcast churn was at a 3-year note. The team, led by Siobhan McKenna and Patrick Delaney is executing successfully on our strategy to scale streaming, having developed world-class technology and compelling user interface. We are increasingly confident in Foxtel's future and thus actively looking at ways to maximize its value and ensure that we can build on that success. We are delighted with the patent progress at News Corp, but certainly not complacent as we contemplate the exciting potential in our company, which we will relentlessly realize for our investors.\nThat -- our trajectory has been transformed despite the vicissitudes of the virus is a testament to the inherent potential of the businesses and the enduring culture of the company. There is no doubt that we will thoughtfully review our current structure and be institutionally introspective on behalf of shareholders. We have made many timely disposals and self-evidently successful purchases and are committed to maximizing value for those who have invested in our company.\nWhile our profits and revenues are at record levels, we are certainly far from stated and will never be complacent. We firmly believe the best quarters and years are yet to come. Now for more details about the most profitable quarter since our reincarnation in 2013, Susan Panuccio.\n\nSusan Lee Panuccio\n\nCFO, News Corporation\n\nThank you, Robert. As Robert mentioned, we are delighted with our second quarter and first half results, marked by strong revenue growth, further margin expansion and record high total segment EBITDA.\nFiscal 2022 second quarter total revenues were over $2.7 billion, up 13%, reflecting strong revenue growth across the company with our 3 core pillars, Digital Real Estate Services, Dow Jones and Book Publishing growing 19%. Total segment EBITDA was $586 million, higher than the prior year by 18% and a record high total segment EBITDA for the company since separation.\nExcluding acquisitions, currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in the release, adjusted revenues and adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 8% and 16%, respectively. Reported EPS were $0.40 as compared to $0.39 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.44 in the quarter compared to $0.34 in the prior year.\nDuring the quarter, we commenced our share buyback and announced the acquisition of Base Chemicals. As Robert mentioned, we anticipate both the Opus and Base Chemicals acquisitions to close in the first half of calendar 2022. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $456 million, an increase of 35% compared to the prior year.\nThe results include the acquisition of Mortgage Choice and the consolidation of REA India, formerly Elara at REA. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues increased 22%. Segment EBITDA rose 25% to $178 million or 29% on an adjusted basis. We continue to see higher investment spending at Move and at REA, but at a more moderated rate than the first quarter, notably at Move.\nMove's revenues were $169 million or up 9% year-over-year off the back of 28% revenue growth in the prior year, primarily driven by the historically high lead volumes, which rose over 30% last year. Real estate revenues improved by 13% and accounted for 86% of total revenues. We saw higher revenues from the traditional lead generation business, fueled by higher yields and increased penetration from market VIP moves hybrid product.\nReferral offerings accounted for approximately 32% of total revenues and continued to benefit from record high home prices and higher referral fees despite lower transaction volume. Encouragingly, close rates also improved. Average monthly unique users for the second quarter were $85 million, up 6% over the prior year.\nLike the first quarter, revenue growth was partially offset by the divestiture of top producer in March, negatively impacting revenues by approximately 3 percentage points. Overall, as anticipated, lead volume declines moderated from the first quarter, down 9%, and we are now seeing the emergence of more typical seasonal patterns.\nImportantly, lead volume is up 18% to -- compared to pre-pandemic levels. Yields remain robust given strong agent demand, which is more than offsetting the impact from lower lead volume. Expanding into adjacencies, including new homes and rentals and establishing partnerships like the recently announced Open Door and Orchard Life partnerships in the seller's marketplace remain a key focus in the second half.\nREA had another outstanding quarter with revenues rising 56% year-on-year on a reported basis to $287 million, which includes the $41 million contribution from the Mortgage Choice acquisition and $10 million from REA India. As a reminder, financial service revenues are reflected on a gross basis in the revenue line in our financial disclosures and broker commissions are reflected in costs. REA enjoyed very favorable trends this quarter, including a 22% increase in Australian residential new buy listings double the first quarter rate with Sydney, up 39%; and Melbourne, up 25%, aided by easing of lockdown restrictions.\nREA also continued to benefit from higher yields, increased depth penetration and product mix. Financial services not only benefited from the integration of Mortgage Choice that also saw record levels of applications and settlements. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details.\nTurning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $498 million, down approximately 3% on both a reported and adjusted basis and relatively stable from the prior quarter, as the declines in Foxtel residential broadcast revenue and continued COVID impacts on commercial venues were partially offset by strong growth in streaming revenues, which now account for 19% of circulation and subscription revenues.\nTotal closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group reached over 3.9 million at quarter end, up 19% year-over-year, improving from the prior quarter rate by 2 percentage points. Total subscribers, including trialists, were approximately 4.1 million, the highest on record. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher Binge and Kayo subscribers, partially offset by the expected decline in residential broadcast subscribers, albeit at a more moderated rate than the first quarter.\nIn aggregate, total streaming subscribers rose 66% from the prior year to almost $2.3 million, of which approximately $2.2 million were paying subscribers. Streaming products in the aggregate reached 56% of Foxtel's total subscriber base. Binge had an outstanding quarter, increasing its total subscribers to over 1 million similar to Kayo. Paying subscribers more than doubled from the prior year to 928,000.\nBinge added 126,000 paid subscribers in the quarter, almost double the net adds of the first quarter. Binge's growth continued to be driven by the depth of its content library and the popularity of new shows, including a Binge original show, Love Me. Kayo subscribers followed seasonal patterns with total subscribers slightly down from the first quarter, consistent with the prior 2 years.\nThe winter codes of AFL and NRL remain key acquisition drivers for Kayo with cricket and motorsports providing essential viewing over the spring and summer months to satisfy the year-round sports fans. Australia's winter sports codes will resume in the third quarter with the return of AFL, NRL, Netball and Supercars.\nBroadcast churn declined to 13%, the lowest level since the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and down 4.5 percentage points versus last year. The Foxtel team continued to focus on product enhancements and higher ARPU subscribers, resulting in broadcast ARPU increasing almost 3% from the prior year to AUD 82 and helping to mitigate subscriber volume declines.\nFoxtel ended the quarter with 1.6 million residential broadcast subscribers with the sequential decline being the lowest since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Commercial subscribers increased from the first quarter as parts of Australia opened up and were flat versus the prior year at 218,000.\nSegment EBITDA in the quarter of $86 million was down 31%, driven by one-off events such as the Ashes and the phasing of certain sports rights costs together with investments in marketing and technology. Costs were consistent with our outlook commentary, and we continue to expect full year total cost to be relatively flat if not down slightly in local currency, helping to deliver strong cash generation at Foxtel.\nMoving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones continued its strong performance in the quarter with revenues of $508 million, up 14% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for 72% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Adjusted revenues, which notably excludes the impact of IBD, rose 10%.\nCirculation and subscription revenues increased 12%, including 13% circulation revenue growth, primarily reflecting the acquisition of IBD and continued strong volume gains in digital-only subscriptions. Digital net adds improved from the first quarter with Dow Jones adding 148,000 digital-only subscribers, including 115,000 at the Wall Street channel.\nProfessional information business revenues rose 9% and accounted for 25% of revenues. Revenue growth from Risk and Compliance increased 17%, driven by a higher entry rate and strong growth across the Americas, Europe and Asia, and we continue to see modest revenue growth in Newswires. Advertising revenues, which accounted for 28% of revenues this quarter grew 23% to $141 million, the highest quarterly advertising revenue in the last 5 years.\nDigital advertising revenues remained robust, up 18% on top of 29% growth in the second quarter of the prior year and accounted for 56% of total advertising revenues. We continue to see strong yield improvement led by direct display. Print advertising continued to surprise on the upside with 29% growth year-over-year, partly due to easy prior year compares but also due to the strength in technology and B2C categories.\nDow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 32% to $144 million despite the 43% growth last year, with EBITDA margins expanding by almost 4 percentage points to over 28%. That reference represents the highest margin since News Corp's acquisition in 2007. Total costs increased 8% with approximately half due to the consolidation of IBD.\nOn an adjusted basis, revenues and segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 10% and 29%, respectively. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins posted 13% revenue growth to $617 million and segment EBITDA rose 3% to $107 million. Adjusted revenues rose 4% versus the prior year, while adjusted segment EBITDA declined 7%. We are particularly pleased with these results given the global supply chain pressures, which impacted manufacturing and freight costs during the quarter and the tough prior year compare, which saw 65% segment EBITDA growth last year.\nResults this quarter benefited from the acquisition of HMH, strong frontlist performance and healthy industry dynamics with consumption levels still significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Digital sales rose 8% this quarter and accounted for 17% of consumer sales with growth driven by downloadable audio books.\nHMH continued to perform according to plan. For the quarter, HMH contributed $50 million in revenues and $10 million in segment EBITDA. Turning to News Media. The momentum in this segment continued during the quarter, revenues were $638 million, up 11% versus the prior year. The biggest driver to the growth was the continued rebound in the advertising market as well as the strong growth in circulation and subscription revenues helped by the contribution from our recent content licensing revenues.\nWithin the segment, revenues at News Corp Australia and News U.K. increased 14% and 7%, respectively. Wireless Group and the New York Post also continued to show strong top line growth. Adjusted revenues for the segment increased 10% compared to the prior year.\nCirculation and subscription revenues rose 9%, benefiting from strong digital subscriber growth, incremental revenues from the platform agreements and cover price increases. Advertising revenues increased 17% compared to the prior year with notable strength in digital and a recovery in print advertising across all our key mastheads.\nAdvertising revenues in Australia with the easing of lockdown conditions rose 11% in both reported and local currency. News U.K. advertising revenues rose 23% or 21% in local currency with impressive digital advertising growth. In fact, at the sum, digital advertising surpassed print for the first time, driven by improved number of page views and higher yields.\nIn the U.S., the trends at the New York Post remained strong with higher yields helping to drive advertising revenue performance 19% higher year-over-year. Segment EBITDA of $111 million increased $45 million or 68% compared to the prior year, reflecting the higher revenues. News Corp Australia contributed $35 million to the segment EBITDA growth, and both News UK and the New York Post were positive contributors to the growth.\nSegment margins topped 17%, the highest since we have separated in 2013. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 65%. I would now like to talk about some themes for the upcoming quarter. While we remain very encouraged with our strong year-to-date results and our trajectory thus far, we are clearly mindful of the uncertainty and lack of visibility from the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, including the potential cost impact from continued supply chain pressures, particularly in Book Publishing and our mastheads as well as wage inflation and talent retention across the company.\nAt Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for January rose 14%. REA anticipates growth rates to slow in the second half as it cycled strong prior period listing volumes and potential impacts around the upcoming federal election.\nPlease refer to REA for more specific outlook commentary. At Move, we continue to see strong yields despite lower inventory. We expect to continue to reinvest in Move as we drive the core business and expand into relevant adjacencies, particularly in new homes and rentals. We expect the year-over-year growth rate of investment at Move in the second half to be relatively similar to the second quarter, but notably lower than the first quarter rate.\nIn Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the ongoing performance of the streaming products and the efforts to improve broadcast ARPU and churn. We continue to expect full year costs in local currency to be relatively flat versus the prior year, and we continue to monitor commercial venue trends given the recent spike in COVID cases in the region.\nAt Dow Jones, overall trends across the business remains strong with advertising and subscription growth continuing to perform well. We expect to continue to reinvest in digital to drive consumer subscriptions and to further enhance our professional information business offerings. And to reiterate, we expect both the Opus and Base Chemicals acquisitions to close in the first half of calendar 2022, and we will incur onetime transaction costs related to these acquisitions.\nIn Book Publishing, similar to the first half, overall trends remain favorable despite lapping the benefits from COVID-19 and strong growth from the sales of the Bridgeton series in the third quarter last year and the ongoing supply chain pressures.\nAt News Media, overall advertising trends remain favorable, and we remain cautiously optimistic about the second half, albeit recognizing that visibility is limited. We continue to expect incremental revenues into 9 figures from the recent platform agreements with the majority of that allocated to News Media. We do expect some reinvestment to the segment in the second half given the strong year-to-date performance focused on new product initiatives, marketing and the News U.K. TV project.\nOn other, we expect costs in the second half to be slightly higher than the first half due to the phasing of certain costs. And lastly, we continue to expect full year CapEx to be up $100 million versus the prior year, albeit we are trending lower than that in the first half.\nWith that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

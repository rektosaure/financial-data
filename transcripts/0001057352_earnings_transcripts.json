Welcome to the Q3 2025 CoStar Group Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Rich Simonelli, Head of Investor Relations.\n\nRichard Simonelli\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, operator, and hello, and thank you all for joining us to discuss the third quarter 2025 results of CoStar Group. Before I turn the call over to Andy Florance, CoStar's CEO and Founder; and Chris Lown, our Chief Financial Officer, I'd like to review our safe harbor statement. Certain portions of the discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook and expectations for the fourth quarter and the rest of 2025 based on current beliefs and assumptions. .\nForward-looking statements involve many risks, uncertainties, assumptions, estimates and other factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those stated in CoStar Group's press release issued earlier today and in our filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q included under the heading Risk Factors in these filings as well as other filings with the SEC available on the SEC's website.\nAll forward-looking statements are based on the information available to with CoStar on the date of this call. CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are shown in detail in our press release issued today, along with the definitions for these terms. Press release is available on our website located at costargroup.com under Press Room. So please refer to today's press release on how to access the replay of this call. And remember one question during the Q&A session, so make it a good one.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance. Andy?\n\nAndrew C. Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you for joining CoStar Group's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. We achieved another excellent quarter for CoStar Group with third quarter 2025 revenue reaching $834 million, a 20% year-over-year increase. This is our 58th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and we're 1 quarter closer to potentially 100 sequential quarters of revenue, double-digit revenue growth. Stay tuned. .\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter rose to $115 million, up 51% over Q3 '24. Profit margin in our Commercial Information and Marketplace businesses increased to 47% for Q3 2025. Net new bookings totaled [ $84 million ], up 92% year-over-year. CoStar Group's residential real estate portals include Apartments.com, homes.com on the market and domain. These are all sites that help people find or market a residence. Assuming we own domain for the full third quarter, the revenue for the residential portals would now be $411 million in the quarter or $1.644 billion annualized.\nOur residential portals revenues grew 22.7% quarter-over-quarter and 31.3% year-over-year. We expect synergies across these residential portals will continue to drive improvement in our margin profile and believe that long-term margins can operate at more than 40% adjusted EBITDA margins. Apartments.com delivered another strong quarter, surpassing $1.2 billion in annual run rate revenue and generating $303 million in Q3 revenue, an 11% increase year-over-year.\nApartments.com remains the preferred source for property managers and owners as reflected by a 99% monthly renewal rate, 99% monthly renewal rate and a 93 NPS score. Our high-quality proprietary content remains central to attracting consumers. Net new bookings rose 37% year-over-year in Q3. We added 4,200 new apartment communities in Q3. Our sales force has now grown to over 500 representatives, achieving our 2025 sales hiring target ahead of schedule.\nIn Q3, the team conducted 200,000 client and prospect interactions, with nearly half of them occurring in person, a 66% year-over-year increase in Q3. Our total multifamily property count now exceeds 87,000, an increase of 12,000 in 2025. Apartments.com network site visits totaled 223 million for the quarter, leads for specific models and units increased 64%, and our highest converting apply now leads rose 70% year-over-year in Q3.\nIn the single-family rental segment, we had 1.4 million availabilities and 260,000 paid rentals, up 51% year-over-year. Homes.com rental traffic grew 55%, underscoring the synergy between Apartments.com and Homes.com. Advertisers benefit from increased exposure across both platforms at no additional cost.\nTurning to Homes.com. Homes.com is showing steadily accelerating revenue growth from an increasing number of revenue streams. Annualized net new bookings of Homes.com subscriptions rose to [ $16 million ] in the third quarter, up 53% year-over-year from [ $10 million ] in the second quarter of '25. That's actually quarter-over-quarter, up 53% quarter-over-quarter from [ $10 million ] in the second quarter of 2025, not year-over-year. Much more impressive what is Q-over-Q.\nThe net new annualized bookings in the third quarter represent 1,225% year-over-year increase. Revenue in Q3 increased 20% year-over-year. The number of net new subscribers add in the third quarter was 7,035, up 12% over the 6,280 net new subscribers added in the second quarter. In Q3, net new subscriber growth was 1,000% year-over-year. We now have over 26,000 subscribing agents. Just one of the many ways in which our business models appear to competing portals is our ability to provide service to a much larger number of agents than they can.\nCompeting portals in the United States business models of lead diversion limits them to selling to about roughly 5% of agents because they need to take leads from the other 95% of agents who are not clients so that they have something to sell to the 5% that our clients. In contrast, we can sell to well more than 50% of agents because we're not taking away leads from any agent. With LoopNet, CoStar and Apartments, we have shown that in many markets we're selling to well more than half of the players in that market. This is the advantage of creating a bigger TAM, but also creating more goodwill among agents.\nIn competing portal models, 95% of the agents are losing business because of the portal and 5% are gaining business. In our model, almost every agent can gain business because of our portal and that creates goodwill. Alignment with your clients build stronger and more durable brands. Sales of our Homes.com Boost product rose 136% quarter-over-quarter to $617,000 in the third quarter.\nHomeowners are the primary buyers of Boost, paying on average $386 on a onetime basis to give their home for sale more exposure. At this point -- at this price point, the U.S. TAM for Boost sold to homeowners alone is already approximately $2 billion. When agents do buy a Boost for one of their listings, we see 25% of those agents convert to full Homes.com membership subscriptions.\nWe began selling enhanced exposure on Homes.com to new homebuilders on August 25. In the month of September alone, we sold net new annualized bookings for new homes of 498,000. In total, we've already sold 743,000 annualized buildings since August 25.\nAs Homes.com approaches our seventh quarter since launch, it is now the fastest-growing revenue product we've ever launched. So Apartments.com and CoStar now have more than $1 billion in revenue. They grew revenue at a much slower pace than Homes has in their first 7 quarters. Homes.com has now grown 50% more incremental revenue in its first 7 quarters than did Apartments.com in the same time period. We're continuing to increase the size of our Homes.com sales team. We now have 500 sales reps in production with another 150 in preproduction.\nWe've now added field sales, new home sales specialists and major accounts reps. We believe the highest and best function of a portal is to market real estate and that, that is the future of the industry. I do not believe that future revenue models for successful real estate portals will be based on either [ iBuying ] or lead diversion to buyer agents. Currently, as I mentioned, we have 26,000 subscribing agents and Boost clients, promoting 130,000 active listings on Homes.com, representing 6% of the active 2.2 million properties for sale in the U.S.\nA recent analyst report from Citi say that they believe that a core product for Zillow going forward will be its showcase listing product and estimated in September '25 that Zillow had only 24,500 listings or approximately 1.1% of the active market. So we have 5x the number of listings marketed or Boosted on our site.\nCiti further estimated that Zillow will have [ $13 million ] of revenue in the third quarter for showcase listings. So Homes.com is well ahead of Zillow in both revenue and listing count, which -- in what we believe is the primary sustainable revenue driver for successful residential real estate portals around the world. Our strategy is to grow the share of real estate agents and homeowners relying on us to bring more exposure to their homes for sale, and these numbers show that we're on the way to achieving that goal.\nOur marketing campaign continues to build out audience and brand awareness. In August, unaided awareness was 42% and unaided intent was 28% that unaided awareness is up from about 4% we started. And as we -- and we are showing continued long-term upward trend in both categories. In the third quarter, the Homes.com network achieved 115 million unique monthly visitors. This led to 560 million total visits to the Homes.com network in Q3, up 7% compared to Q2.\nAccording to comScore, unique visitor traffic to Homes.com rose 8.3% compared to a 6.5% decline at Zillow and a 0.7% decline at realtor.com. I'll just call that last part flat. comScore continues to rank the unique monthly visitors to the Homes.com network above either Realtor or Redfin. Our organic traffic in Q3 climbed 87% year-over-year. We continue to improve the quality and engagement of traffic to Homes.com achieving a low 24% bounce rate in Q3, which is a 64% year-over-year reduction in bounce rate.\nOur average session duration increased to 4 minutes and 29 seconds in Q3, which is a 93% year-over-year increase. I believe that our efforts to put more than 70,000 Matterports on the sites is driving this deeper home, shopper engagement on our site. We are optimizing for quality of traffic from our [ SEM ] generating $112 million listing detailed page views from SEM in Q3 for a 374% year-over-year improvement. We achieved this improvement with essentially the same but a more efficient SEM spend. I believe we are about to see our products hyper accelerated by some of the most exciting facilitating AI technologies I could have ever imagined.\nWhile we're already using AI throughout our organization, I am excited about the launch of AI SmartSearch on Homes.com and the future innovations at [ Four Shadows ]. Consumers can ask coms.com precisely what they're looking for in their own words. This allows for reasonably complex queries such as long conversational phrases with multiple geographies such as show me waterfront properties with a pool, with a balcony and a great view in Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale starting at $1 million. This does away with having to deal with traditional filters and forms that are limiting.\nIf you're a coder, this is like giving people with no coding skills access to the power of full deep [indiscernible] queries against 10x the number of fields with just simple plain English questions. As a result, Smart Search is highly customizable, intuitive, fun and easy and more powerful. This is our own artificial intelligence capability we're engineering in, and we're doing it in partnership with Microsoft. In the third quarter, AI Smart Search has produced improved user engagement. So this new AI Smart Search is producing significant improvement in user engagement.\nUsers of AI Smart Search use 69% more search filters, viewed 37% more listing pages per session are 5x more likely return to the site within the following week. That's amazing and submitted 51% more leads after viewing a listing page. It's a more effective way to look -- find what you're looking for. We are now investing 50% of our Homes.com software development efforts in the fourth quarter and beyond towards building a range of AI-empowered features into Homes.com.\nThis is our single biggest commitment by far to any software development effort. This is an incredibly exciting time for Homes.com. All of our products have boundless new opportunities opened up by the enormous potential of generative AI. In the 4 decades that I've led CoStar product vision, a core principle of our success is leaning into new facilitating technologies to unlock their value for real estate. We were among the first to digitize real estate information, put real estate on a digital map, present digital real estate photos.\nWe're the first to incorporate DIGITAL twins at a scale. And we were actually the first to leverage the Internet for real estate. In fact, we actually bought CBRE, Cushman & Wakefield JLL, their first Internet accounts before there was even a Netscape or a Google around. AI offers transformative opportunities to unlock tremendous value in real estate. I believe few products are better positioned to cohesively capitalize on this opportunity than is Homes.com Apartments.com, LoopNet and CoStar. We have massive and proprietary real estate data resources. We have unmatched expertise in organizing and quality control in that information. We have leading expertise in how to make that information useful and relevant to real estate industry participants.\nWe believe that it will bring tremendous dislocation generally and open up huge new value opportunities, which we plan to exploit. While Homes.com is our initial priority for AI enhancement, we will apply the lessons learned to Apartments.com and all of our other products as quickly as possible. AI will impact top-of-funnel traffic acquisition. Real estate portals built on SEO foundations need to build strategies to acquire traffic from AEO, answer engine optimization and GEO generative engine optimization.\nSEO remains the foundation of AEO and GEO though a portal's brand content context remain the key building blocks for success. Today, GEO is sub-1% of top-of-funnel acquisition. For example, 1 large U.S. real estate portal in the U.S. only draws 0.45% of its top-of-funnel traffic from ChatGPT. And another large portal in Australia only captures 0.15% of its top of funnel from ChatGPT. So brand traffic brand, direct traffic SEM, display, social e-mail, SEO and AEO remain 99.5% of top of funnel source.\nThese traffic sources remain important in generative AI future for sure and likely the majority, but GEO will become much bigger top of funnel traffic feed, and we will position our portals to capture that traffic. Many believe that traffic from GEO may be monetized the way Google monetized SEO with SEM. There's some huge AI GPU and energy bills to pay out there. I just spent a few days at the online marketplace conference in Madrid with dozens of real estate portal CEOs and digital real estate experts. All felt the competitive urgency to integrate the range of capabilities of generative AI into their portals.\nBut I did not find one person who thought that generative AI solutions would effectively meet the specialized needs of the real estate world. To be successful, there's a need to build specialized AI models around buyer personalization and profiles, data capture listing evaluation, computer vision, digital twin, searching, area valuation, lead management, advertising optimization, valuation and many other algorithms.\nThat is exactly the exciting work we are leaning into and embracing. There was a time when AOL, Yahoo! or eBay were ascendant and uniquely dominant and Microsoft and Google are still dominant though, perhaps, passed their zenith of dominance. All of these impressive general-purpose transformative technology innovations enthusiastically built real estate portals and tried to dominate digital real estate, all failed. They've now exited the space. Only eBay has anything left, and it's not much, which is a very [ physical ] thing.\nSpecialized solutions often leveraging these companies' capabilities repeatedly ultimately dominate the real estate vertical. I believe the past is prologue here. There are a number of incredible generative AI companies that are building in valuable tools. Those tools will be leveraged by specialized digital real estate companies to create specialized value. A specialized digital real estate company that does it best among them will unlock huge value for its investors.\nCoStar Group is the largest digital real estate company in the world by market cap, is well positioned to win in an AI future. It's just a brief comment on AI. The Homes.com subscriber Net Promoter Score rose to 36 in the third quarter, rising 84% over Q2 '25. October to date, that NPS score continues to rise and is now at an outstanding 43. We're not done there. We'd like to get it up to apartments 93, but the progress is amazing.\nIt took less than 2 years for Homes.com to reach an MPS level that took CoStar about a decade or so to reach. As our NPS increases, so does our subscriber retention rate. In Q3 '25, our retention rate of subscribers we sold 6 months prior from Q1 to 2025 rose to 86%. The Q3 retention rate rose 7.5% from 81% retention in Q2 '25 and rose 39% year-over-year from 62% retention in Q3 '24 .\nWe are offering Homes.com subscribers the benefits of Matterports for their listings and agents tell us in focused groups that they really value that benefit. Member listings with Matterports captured nearly 40x listing detailed views of nonmember listings without matterports. That should be the objective of any real estate agent selling a home, get 40x as many people to inspect that home. In the quarter, subscribers who had a Matterport on a listing had a 37% higher renewal rate than those that did not.\nIt's working. We are enhancing our Matterport benefit to subscribers by offering a photorealistic 3D view with exterior of the house to complement the digital twin of the interior. This exciting new technology is called gaussian splatt and we capture it with a short drone flight around the house where legal. I would encourage you to view one live by looking up a home for sale at 5471 Country Club Parkway in San Jose, California, on Homes.com and view that Matterport 3D exterior. Eventually, the house will sell, and it won't be there anymore.\nIn recent focused groups, we are seeing success in raising real estate agent awareness that Homes.com is the only \"your listing, your lead\" portal. 51% of agents surveyed recognize \"your listing, your lead\" and overwhelmingly connected to the Homes.com brand. Agents dislike lead diversion expressed a strong preference for portal operating with \"your listing, your lead\" principle. As we continue to build that awareness, we believe that Homes.com will become the portal agents trust and most recommend to their clients.\nNow I need to turn to an uncomfortable but important matter. Zillow is under siege facing an unprecedented wave of lawsuits. I'm not sure that the market grasps the sheer magnitude of the risk bearing down on Zillow from all sides. These lawsuits are not isolated instants, they collectively target the heart of Zillow's operations exposing alleged antitrust violations, widespread copyright theft and blatant consumer deception. With private plaintiffs and government regulators now alert to Zillow's misconduct, I predict even more aggressive legal and regulatory action in the months ahead.\nThere are 5 federal lawsuits filed against Zillow since June of 2025. First, Zillow threatened to permanently [indiscernible] that was publicly marketed but not put on the MLS within 24 hours. So if you put a sign for sale -- for sale sign in front yard and didn't put it on Zillow, within 24 hours, you're banned. You have a Facebook post, and don't put it in the Zillow in 24 hours, you're banned, pretty aggressive. It appeared that Zillow was targeting Compass. Zillow followed through and banned Compass listings that were not put on Zillow in 24 hours. On June 23, 2025, Compass sued Zillow exposing Zillow so-called Zillow ban for what it truly is a ruthless scheme to strangle competition, trap homesellers inside of Zillow's walled garden.\nIf Compass prevails and home sellers choose to -- where to list -- where and when to list their homes, Zillow could lose massive swaths of its inventory calling into question its lead diversion model. I believe that Zillow's actions pushed Compass in a defensively merging with Anywhere. When the Compass Anywhere merger is completed, the combined company will be, by far, the largest real estate brokerage in the U.S. as I understand, as many as 300,000 plus agents.\nI'm pretty sure that Zillow just picked a fight it cannot win. Compass will have the most important listing content in real estate, and Zillow will need them a lot more than Compass need Zillow. We filed our lawsuit against Zillow on July 30, 2025 to put an end to Zillow's brazen theft and monetization of CoStar's intellectual property. Zillow undoubtedly has used content stolen from Apartments.com to unfairly build their rental business. The scale of this infringement is staggering. For context, in 2019, Xceligent was caught with 38,489 CoStar copyrighted photographs and the Federal Court awarded $0.5 billion in damages to us.\nZillow's conduct is even more egregious and we're determined to hold them fully accountable. Then in September, the Zillow was sued in a class action suite by a group of plaintiffs who allege that they were being deceived into overpaying hidden fees through Zillow's notorious Contact Agent Button. Don't push it. This case tears straight to the heart of Zillow's business model, laying bare a system built on deception. The complaint exposes Zillow's tactics saying Zillow actually directs the buyer away from the listing agent and directs the buyer to an unrelated buyer agent who lacks any specialized knowledge about the subject property.\nAnd the [ follow-up ] isn't just limited to duped buyers, Zillow's lead diversion racket is bleeding home sellers by diverting their potential homebuyers to agents that may compete with their listing. Most recently, we're not done, hang with me, most recently, September 30, 2025, the United States Federal Trade Commission filed suit against Zillow Group and Redfin over a legal agreement to suppress competition. They state that the illegal deal stuns multifamily rental, advertising competition, harming American renters and property managers.\nThe FTC went on to say that the Zillow partnership with Redfin was nothing more than an [ end run ] around competition that insulates Zillow from head-to-head competition on the merits with Redfin for customers advertising multifamily buildings. The FTC is seeking injunctive relief meaning a potential unwinding of the deal. The lawsuit was followed up the next day by another lawsuit on behalf of bipartisan coalition of attorney generals from Virginia, Arizona, Connecticut, New York and Washington State.\nYou might assume that CoStar Group sees deals like this when they come up like the Redfin deal, my immediate and clear reaction would have been that, obviously, the FTC would not allow such an illegal deal in any effort to end run the FTC regulatory process would necessarily bring unnecessarily excruciating pain and damage to anyone foolish enough to try it. So we never would have pursued it. If Zillow is ordered by federal courts, the FTC or Attorney Generals of states [indiscernible] illegally gained apartment revenue and content, I believe, will seriously damage Zillow's reputation in the apartment industry.\nThese lawsuits will take years to resolve. The full extent of Zillow's contact as alleged in these complaints and the various remedies from these lawsuits is yet to be seen.\nMoving to the United Kingdom. It was a strong quarter for -- on the market, our U.K. residential marketplace, with leads up 21% year-over-year in Q3 '25, we delivered significant ROI to our 16,000 subscribing customers there, bringing some Homes.com inspired features to on the market has resulted in positive changes to the site that are generating more consumer engagement. We are building an audience of serious property seekers with total page views up 24% year-over-year in Q3.\nAverage time on site per active user is up 79% year-over-year and lead to conversion -- lead to visit conversions are up 31% year-over-year. Net new bookings increased for the 17 months in a row and has delivered nearly $11 million of annualized net new bookings since its acquisition. We closed the acquisition of Domain in August. I'm excited to work with the Domain team and their customers to bring Homes.com, CoStar and LoopNet platforms to Australia. Domain's residential marketplace and commercial marketplace -- well, Domain's residential marketplace is very successful and generates more than 50% direct contribution margin.\nIts commercial marketplace generates a 40% direct margin. Both marketplaces have long-term growth potential under the CoStar umbrella. The Domain brand is very well known in Australia, and there's significant potential to expand market share there, where homeowners invest significantly in digital real estate advertising. Domain has an excellent management team led by Jason Pellegrino, who knows the Australian market well, he used to be the MD for Google there and his vision for the business aligns with ours.\nWe have made fast progress since taking ownership of the Domain business on August 20, delivering 7.4 million unique users in September on Domain's residential platforms which was the largest number of unique users on Domain's owned platforms in its history. The quality of this increased audience was retained, delivering the highest consumer reviews per listing in Domain's history. We're on track to significantly beat those records in October. We have already delivered a 24% year-over-year increase in audiences on our commercial real estate platforms in Australia.\nThese strong audience results were driven by a mix of greater marketing investments supported by an improved mix of marketing investment across every step of the consumer journey, and rapid product improvement supported by a refocused product team and access to CoStar platforms, relationships and talent. Examples of product improvements already executed and planned with the first 60 days of ownership include improvements in platform speeds and latency, removal of all advertising interrupting the consumer experience and improvements in image quality.\nA key highlight was the growth achieved in our audience metrics, where we saw domain apps average 138% increase year-over-year in downloads across iOS and Android allowing us to successfully overtake our main competitor in App Store rankings. Domain was previously constrained under its former media company owner. It received limited management focus, limited expertise and scarce resources, limited expertise in real estate marketplaces. It was operated with short-term EBITDA strategy, keeping it from competing effectively with a market leader, [ REA ].\nWe believe that with CoStar Group's technology and resources, Domain will compete more effectively and will achieve stronger, long-term profitability. A dozen members of my management team and I recently spent 2 weeks in Sydney for a deep dive into the Domain business and believe there are clear opportunities to make changes that will create value for our shareholders. Most of the significant software resources and products we offer, we believe, are compatible with the Australian market, and we can migrate Domain into them to create competitive advantage and cost efficiencies.\nWe hope to improve Domain's focus and profitability by rationalizing some of its product portfolio. Under prior ownership, Domain allocates significant resources to about 10 noncore initiatives at the expense of the highly profitable residential and commercial portals. I believe that most of the software development resources were allocated to products generating less than 20% of its revenue. We will refocus Domain's resources towards its successful scalable core and competing against its main competitor.\nWe expect to offer LoopNet Homes and CoStar in Australia within 18 months. There's currently, we believe, no equivalent to CoStar in Australia while Domain and REA Group offers products similar to LoopNet, I do not believe that they're on par with what LoopNet offers. This presents a significant opportunity for us to quickly establish a leading presence. The more I live with Matterport, the more impressed I am with this technology, how well it works and how useful it is to real estate.\nMatterport creates a strategic advantage in both our residential and commercial product portfolios. Matterport Digital twins unlock value by bringing a new and important dimension of digitizing real estate in every product we offer. As part of CoStar Group, we see Matterport set on 2 pillars. On one pillar, Matterport is a stand-alone solution for industries such as insurance, construction, public safety, facilities management and similar, which we believe is by itself a multibillion-dollar revenue opportunity. In the second pillar, Matterport is brought to market as an integrated solution within our marketplaces and information solutions through our existing sales forces of 2,000-some people.\nWe believe that in the second pillar, Matterport can help CoStar compete and achieve more than $1 billion in incremental value. Integration of Matterport and the second pillar is well underway, and you can see deeper than ever integration of Matterport within our products. I believe that prior to merging with CoStar, Matterport was a world-class transformative technology held back by lack of focus on go-to-market strategy with an underscaled sales and marketing effort.\nMatterport had fewer than 30 sales representatives globally, leaving many huge revenue opportunities untapped. We plan to expand the sales force by 200 by the end of '26 and drive accelerated revenue growth. Matterports Q3 revenue was 12% higher than our expectations, $44 million versus $40 million and our Q3 '25 net bookings were up 194% over Q3 last year. We emphasize new customer acquisition, which resulted in a 94% increase year-over-year in incremental new customer logos.\nOur Matterport Max rollout for Apartments.com began at the NAA conference in June of this year. We've already sold over 530 Matterport Max subscriptions, which are adding upwards of 5,000 per year in annual subscription revenue per unit. We just completed a successful developer Summit and Hackathon with the Matterport team. Coming out of that, I'm very confident that we have an outstanding and innovative product road map that will delight our customers and for you all more importantly, our shareholders.\nTurning to CoStar, CoStar generated $277 million in Q3 of '25 revenue, reflecting 8% year-over-year growth. Revenue growth has slightly improved in '25 as net new bookings remain strong. Per rep productivity in Q3 was at its highest since Q3 '23. Cancellation rates have declined over the past 2 quarters, and our renewal rate reached 93.3%, the highest since '23. Our subscriber count rose to 284,000 in the third quarter, up 20% year-over-year. Our lender business achieved a record quarter, closing $4.3 million annual net new bookings, with nearly almost just there $100 million in revenue and over 450 clients, including banks, credit unions, private lenders, regulators, insurers, CoStar for lenders has demonstrated strong success and has significant potential. Costar Lender has already uploaded over $1 trillion of loans into CoStar.\nClients' loan portfolios are securely upload to our SOC 2 compliant platform, unavailable to any AI scraper and integrated with CoStar's proprietary data analytics and credit modeling informed by our research and marketplace solutions. This comprehensive ecosystem delivers unmatched value for regulatory examines, asset examinations, asset allocation and responsible growth.\nIn '26, we plan to launch our benchmarking product and have begun developing a loan origination system, expanding our total addressable market. One of our core goals for all of our emerging businesses is to cross that so important $100 million revenue milestone. So congratulations to John Vecchione, [indiscernible] and the entire lender team, well done and dinner is on me.\nLoopNet remains the world's largest and most active real estate marketplace, capturing 8.5x more searches than our nearest competitor. In the third quarter of '25, LoopNet achieved 10% revenue growth. Based on net new bookings from the last 3 quarters of '25, we expect the platform to deliver low double-digit growth next year. I firmly believe that LoopNet should and can return to 20%-plus growth -- annual growth rate soon. Our strategic focus has been on offering LoopNet advertising packages that enable clients to promote their entire property portfolios rather than just select assets.\nThe silver ads, their portfolio comprehensive design -- are designed to drive higher renewal rates, deliver strong ROI for clients, expand listing coverage and enhance both the consumer and customer experience. We are also continuing to roll out asset-based pricing for renewals aligning our service pricing with the value delivered to clients. International expansion remains a key pillar of LoopNet's growth. Many of the largest multinational companies in the world are heavy users of LoopNet, and we could provide them even more value if we are carried listings in more countries.\nIn August of '25, we integrated all French listings from Vera Loco into LoopNet, bringing the total number of European listings to 100,000 across France, Spain and the U.K. We could see major tenants like Amazon and many others, searching LoopNet for commercial real estate, not only in the U.S. but also in Canada, France, the U.K. and Spain. So they -- wherever we're going, they're searching. We will soon add Australia, as I mentioned, through our Domain acquisition, further growing our global reach. We believe that LoopNet can deliver more value to local advertisers if we're delivering a unique and valuable global audience with high buying power.\nOur data consistently shows that properties listed on LoopNet sell and lease faster. For properties listed in January '24, 30% of those on LoopNet transacted while only 22% of those not listed on LoopNet transacted. For firms listing 90% to 100% of their listings on LoopNet, their 24-month close rate was 36%, while those not listed on LoopNet only had a 20% close rate. If a few hundred dollars invested in the LoopNet could increase your chance of transacting a commercial property by 80%, I believe that's a no-brainer.\nTurning to CoStar Real Estate Manager and Visual Lease now support real estate lease management accounting, project management needs for 2,000 corporate clients, including more than half of the Fortune 500. Third quarter '25 revenue climbed 63% year-over-year to $30.6 million. The business is very profitable with growing margins. We are making good progress integrating CoStar Real Estate Manager with Visual lease and CoStar into one extremely valuable corporate real estate solution. We expect to launch lease benchmarking capabilities in mid-'26 creating a new level of transparency, helping investors, brokers, corporates and lenders gain a more accurate and timely understanding of CRE rents and potential income.\nWe expect to release an integrated product with real estate management CoStar Suite in '26, late '26, clients will be able to access comprehensive market data and gain visibility into previously unseen opportunities to optimize their real estate portfolios. This will allow them for a detailed analysis to make the most informed decisions that we believe will significantly drive significant ROI and cost savings for these clients. We shared our new product road map in our recent customer advisory meeting with major clients, which include real estate finance and accounting leaders, and we received very extremely positive feedback on the new product direction.\nCoStar Group's European business continues to deliver record net new bookings reaching $5.7 million in Q3 '25 and $16.9 million year-to-date, representing a 51% year-over-year growth. The U.K. business achieved another record quarter with year-to-date net new bookings up 125% and revenue up 17% year-over-year. In France, our research team has curated over 260,000 buildings, 50,000 availabilities, 140,000 tenants and 60,000 sale and lease comps.\nBusiness [indiscernible] now fully integrated into CoStar News reaches over 100,000 French CRE professionals monthly, and we're confident that CoStar will soon become the leading source for CRE data in France, connecting global and French investors. In closing, I believe that our results this quarter demonstrate that my colleagues here at CoStar Group are making great progress, continue to successfully grow our existing businesses while effectively investing into new real estate segments and new global markets.\nWith $350 trillion of real estate in the world, we believe we are creating value digitizing it with leading marketplaces and information solutions that can result in a $1 trillion addressable market with a deep moat, and we're busy building it one brick at a time. At this point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Chris.\n\nChristian M. Lown\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Navient Corporation\n\nThank you, Andy. Good evening. I'm happy to report that CoStar has now posted its 58th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth coming in at 20%. We achieved an impressive commercial information and Marketplaces brand margin of 47% in the third quarter versus 43% in 3Q '24. Net new bookings for the third quarter were $84 million representing a 92% increase year-over-year. Every major product contributed to this record as our growing dedicated sales force of over 2,000 people is delivering for CoStar. .\nRevenue for the third quarter was $834 million, which included a $25 million contribution from the Domain acquisition. Revenue, excluding Domain of $808 million exceeded the high end of our guidance. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA came in at $115 million, also exceeding the high end of our guidance at a 14% margin. The outperformance in adjusted EBITDA was a result of continued expense discipline and better-than-expected revenue. Our CoStar products saw revenue grew 8% in the third quarter, ahead of our guidance. We are excited about this product's renewed growth, especially given continued volatility in the commercial real estate sector.\nNet new bookings have steadily increased throughout 2025 and are now at the highest level seen since 2022. With this increasing momentum, we expect to see the CoStar product grow between 8% and 9% in the fourth quarter with full year growth firmly in the 7% range from our original guidance of 6% to 7%. Residential revenue was $55 million in the third quarter with $23 million coming from the Domain acquisition. The $32 million in organic revenue was consistent with last quarter's guidance.\nWith the addition of revenue from Domain, we now expect fourth quarter revenue of $100 million to $105 million with Domain contributing around $67 million. For full year 2025, we expect residential revenue to more than double to $210 million to $215 million from $101 million in 2024. Apartments.com's third quarter revenue growth came in at 11% year-over-year. Our Apartments.com sales reps are consistently the most productive of our large brands, and we have increased the size of this team by 20% year-to-date.\nWe now have more than 500 Apartments.com sales reps for the first time in its history. These reps will take time to ramp up their productivity but this investment puts us in a great position for longer-term growth. For 4Q '25, we expect 11% to 12% revenue growth, resulting in full year 2025 revenue growth of 11% to 12%. LoopNet revenue grew 12% in the third quarter with a 2 percentage point lift from the Domain acquisition.\nLoopNet's organic performance was in line with last quarter's guidance. Our sales team is consistently outperforming prior productivity levels. And in conjunction with the demand contribution, we now expect 4Q revenue growth of between 15% to 17% and full year revenue growth of 10% to 11%. On an organic basis, 4Q revenue growth is expected to be 11%, its highest growth rate since 2023.\nThis acceleration throughout 2025 sets us up nicely for 2026. Revenue from information services was $41 million in the third quarter. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be consistent with the third quarter and full year revenue growth of between 18% to 20%. We are excited about launching our new rent analytics product in the first half of 2026 and our new lease platform in the fourth quarter of 2026. Other revenue was $78 million in the third quarter with Matterport contributing $44 million. For the fourth quarter, we expect other revenue to range between $70 million and $72 million. The fourth quarter is expected to be slightly impacted by revenue recognition timing for 10x and lower [ camera ] sales at Matterport as we sunset the Pro 2 camera.\nAs previously stated, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $115 million, meaningfully above the high end of our $75 million to $85 million guidance. The favorable performance came from higher-than-projected revenue, higher-than-anticipated professional service -- I'm sorry, lower than anticipated professional service costs and greater-than-expected headcount savings as we remain laser focused on expenses.\nOur contract renewal rate was 89% for the third quarter, with a renewal rate for customers who have been subscribers for 5 years or longer holding steady at 94%. Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 75% for the third quarter, the acquisitions of Matterport and Domain are the driving factors for the change in our subscription revenue metric.\nOur September 30 balance sheet included $2 billion in cash, which earned net interest income of $26 million in the third quarter, a 4% rate of return. We repurchased 576,000 shares in the third quarter for $51 million, bringing our year-to-date total to 1.4 million shares repurchased for $115 million. We expect to purchase approximately $50 million of additional shares in the fourth quarter, bringing our 2025 total to approximately $165 million of the $500 million share repurchase authorization.\nWe closed on the Domain Group acquisition on August 27. The total consideration was USD 1.9 billion. Domain contributed $25 million of revenue for the stub period from August 28 to September 30. For context, around 90% of Domain's revenues is residential, while the remaining 10% is split between commercial marketplaces and information services.\nWith 9 months of 2025 in the books and with the closing of Domain, we now expect full year revenue of between $3.23 billion to $3.24 billion, broadly in line with our guidance, excluding Domain. Fourth quarter revenue is now expected to be between $885 million and $895 million. Full year adjusted EBITDA is now expected to range between $415 million and $425 million, with Domain contributing approximately $15 million. This $25 million increase in our guidance, excluding the impact from Domain is indicative of our strong third quarter performance. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $150 million and $160 million. And with that, I will now turn the call back to our call operator to open the lines for questions."

And now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance. Andy?\n\nAndrew C. Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nWell, I'd have to say between the operator and Rich, you guys have set a very high bar for radio personality voices. So I'm going to try to live up to that.\nThank you for joining CoStar Group's earnings call for the second quarter of 2025. I am very pleased to report another exceptional quarter, CoStar achieved CoStar Group achieved revenue of $781 million, a strong 15% increase compared to last year. This marks our 57th quarter -- consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA rose significantly to $85 million, representing an impressive 108% increase compared to Q2 of 2024. Both revenue and adjusted EBITDA exceeded consensus estimates and were above the high end of our guidance range. Our commercial information and marketplace businesses also delivered an outstanding profit margin of 43% this quarter. Net new bookings totaled $93 million, a remarkable 65% increase over the previous quarter. This sets a new record as the highest quarterly net new bookings in CoStar Group's history.\nWe're seeing strong performance across all our business segments, driven by strategic investments in expanding our sales force and innovative product development. Throughout 2025, we're growing our core sales team by 20% and tripling our homes.com sales force from 230 representatives at the end of 2024 to about 750 by the end of 2025, all this to capture additional growth opportunities. Apartments.com had another excellent quarter with revenue up 11% from Q2 2024, reaching $292 million, our sales team achieved $45 million in net new bookings, the fourth highest quarter ever, representing a 20% increase year-over-year. Apartments.com is approaching an annual revenue run rate of $1.2 billion and maintains a very strong EBITDA margin. I did have a percentage in there, but Chris had me take it out.\nDuring the second quarter, our sales team had over 171,000 quality interactions with clients and prospects, maintaining an outstanding Net Promoter Score of 94%. These interactions resulted in a 99% monthly renewal rate, the addition of 3,263 new rooftops for nearly 83,000 multifamily communities advertising on our platform. In the first half of 2025, we've already added 7,600 new apartment communities more than we added throughout all of 2024, and we did it without steep discounting or paying hundreds of millions of dollars for inorganic revenue as our main competitor did. To address the multibillion dollar addressable market apartments, we're growing our Apartments.com sales team to 500 representatives in 2025.\nSo far, this year, we've added 65 new sales reps with large training classes scheduled for July and August. In Q2, Apartments.com launched a marketing campaign generating over 4.8 billion media impressions. The campaign reached renters across their favorite media channels and targeted landlords with new commercials featuring Brad Bellflower. We significantly increased our investment across key media channels, streaming video grew by 25%, paid social by 13% and digital by 130% compared to Q2 '24. Apartments.com was prominently featured during live sports events, including the NFL Draft, College World Series, PGA Tour, NBA and MLB regular seasons and across popular programming on Bravo, E, CBS, Netflix, Paramount+ and Hulu.\nWe also made our Canadian broadcast to Viu during game 6 of the NHL playoffs. With the launch of our New York City specific search experience on Apartments.com, we ran targeted out-of-home advertising across all 5 bureaus in New York City and partnered with local influencers. The Apartments.com network averaged 42 million monthly unique visitors and 234 million network visits during this quarter, according to Google Analytics. The latest comScore data shows that all of the rental portals traffic declined Q2 '25 over Q2 '24, but with Apartments.com network doing the best with a business only down 11%, while Zillow rental network was down 13%, and apartment guide was down 21% and Rent.com was down dramatically, down 39%. A Market research indicates that our unaided awareness among apartment seekers remain best-in-class at 68%, significantly higher than all competitors combined, all primary competitors combined.\nOur closest competitor trails by 30 percentage points and the next closest by 58 points. realtor.com's unaided awareness for apartment stood at only 4% in June. Apartments.com continues to deliver more leads in nearly twice as many leases as our 2 closest competitors combined according to Entrada data. We believe the Apartments.com network holds the industry's most comprehensive inventory with a record $2.2 million rental availabilities in June of 2025. To further enhance exposure, we also feature Apartments.com listings on the Homes.com rental area, where traffic increased 26% year-over-year due to Homes.com's robust marketing efforts. Canadian Apartments.com also continues to perform well with visits up 31% and leads up 62% year-over-year. Since Q2 last year, we've grown our Canadian business by 300%, ending June with over 1,500 paying properties.\nOur presence at this year's National Apartment Association of Pardiamentalized Convention in Las Vegas was highly successful. We hosted 1,500 clients at our kickoff party featuring Kenny Chesney, attracted 3,100 booth visitors and generated over $500,000 in monthly net new bookings translating to $6 million in annualized net new bookings. We showcased our latest AI-powered technology, including Matterport 3D tours and AI Voice Search, an incredible interactive life-size department exhibit called the Brad. We rolled out our new Matterport Max packages with great success. Clients and prospects who experienced the power matter port our booth were impressed and convinced of its value in accelerating the leasing process. These packages come with a Matterport Pro 3 camera and allow clients to create a virtual to other units, all their units, common areas and the entire building.\nHaving a Matterport Digital Twin is becoming essential of apartment seekers look for communities in different cities and 41% are willing to rent site unseen and provide high-quality imagery. Significantly, 53% they'll say they will stop considering a rental unit without detailed imagery. Consumers love the Matterport experience on Apartments.com. In Q2, they viewed Matterports 67 million times, up 193% over the same period last year, spending 71% more time on listing detailed pages with the Matterport 3D tour. Listings with the Matterport 3D tour received 23x more leads than those without. Later this year, Apartments.com and homes will introduce an AI-powered voice search, allowing consumers to find properties by speaking natural or typing free-form phrases, no more filtering required. We have also been working with the largest property management firms in the country to provide greater fee transparency for the market.\nLast week in one of the top property managers in the country, we launched disclosure of their onetime and monthly fees associated with renting an apartment creating complete fee transparencies for consumers on Apartments.com. Homes.com delivered a strong second quarter, achieving solidly positive sales growth after overcoming Q1 churn from the initial sales last year. Residential annualized net new bookings totaled $12 million for the quarter. Our expanding sales force drove consistent monthly growth with May sales increasing 5% over April and June sales increasing 15% over May. Revenue for Q2 compared -- grew by 8% compared to Q2 of 2024. We signed 6,300 net new members representing a 56% increase in membership during the quarter. Our Dedicated Homes.com sales team significantly increased product demos rising more than sixfold from March last year to June.\nOur B2B marketing efforts generated the highest lead volume since launch with over 3,600 leads to our sales team in June alone, resulting in more than 5,400 product demos with a conversion rate exceeding 50%. The Homes.com network attracted an average of 111 million unique monthly visitors in Q2 according to Google Analytics, putting us well ahead of our third and fourth ranked competitors. Our marketing campaign has successfully boosted unaided awareness intent among users. One awareness has grown dramatically from 4% at the launch in 2024 and to over 36% today or in Q2. On aid intent has risen 6 points since April to reach 25%, signaling a major breakthrough in user engagement. Member agents listings on Homes.com achieved 22x greater reach compared to nonmembers, significantly enhancing consumer engagement.\nListings from members received 7x more detailed views, 4x more favorites and 6x more shares, resulting in faster sales and higher selling prices. Leveraging these marketing advantages, Homes.com members secured 62% more listings than nonmembers with an outstanding return on investment. Especially given the average new listing commission value of $15,000 against a monthly membership fee under $500. Our growing dedicated sales team is doing an increasingly effective job at educating agents about the value proposition of homes.com. We have observed significant improvement in client satisfaction reflected in rising Net Promoter Scores. Our NPS grew from a modest 3% in Q4 of 2024 to 9 in Q1 of '25. And then it jumped substantially to 38% in Q2, marking a 340% quarter-over-quarter increase.\nAdditionally, our early cancellation or failed payment rate on 12-month contracts remained well below 1% throughout most of Q2. The newly launched Boost product has been successful Boost provides sellers and their agents with a flexible marketing option, allowing single property listings to be boosted on Homes.com to benefit from membership level marketing. Since Q2 launch, we sold 1,270 boosts. Boosted listings reach over 14,000 homebuyers with an average of 32 views per buyer making boosted listings 25% more likely to go under contract within 10 days. I can't pass that up. Nearly 25% of Boost users have converted to full homes.com memberships. So the Boost program is a great lead pipeline for our sales force. This month, we launched a new advertising campaign for Homes.com celebrating our success building an audience of over 100 million monthly unique visitors to the Homes.com network. In the spot Dan Levy and Heidi Gartner draw attention to Home.com's massive audience to reinforce the real estate agents the value of marketing their properties and listings on this valuable -- to this valuable audience cost effectively on homes.com.\nThe spots also tell home shoppers that 100 million-plus people have chosen to use Homes.com so perhaps they should check it out too. We believe that the majority of home buyers once they try homes.com, preferhomes.com. We strategically placed ads across popular networks, including CBS, FOX, ESPN and contextually relevant shows such as Girl Meats Farm and American Pickers, and major sporting events like the Stanley Cup Plays, MBA Finals PJ Championship, MLB and WNBA regular seasons. Additionally, we expanded digital and streaming sponsorships with DraftKings and Roku and audio and podcasting partnerships with Spotify and Amazon Music, collectively generating over $4 billion targeted paid media impressions.\nWe launched a highly customized direct mail member agent appreciation campaign aimed at nearly 100,000 home sellers represented by Homes.com members. This personalized 20-page brochure delivered shortly after a listing goes live, highlights the seller's home, their agent and the marketing advantages provided by homes.com. The campaign has received extremely positive feedback, reinforcing seller confidence encouraging agent renewals. I believe that this campaign will further increase our NPS scores. This month, Zillow began questionably leveraging its market power by forcing agents to market listing on its platform within 24 hours of the listing being marketed or risk the listing being permanently banned. This tactic we believe, raises serious antitrust concerns. Indeed, Compass has already filed a lawsuit against Zillow for such practices. Zillow band its first listing despite complying with bright MLS and NAR regulations.\nZillow fastly labeled the property as off-market on their website misleading buyers. Zillow demands agents listenings immediately to avoid losing the opportunity to divert and sell leads from those listings. Given the recent relaxations and clear cooperation no co-mingling rules, Zillow appears concerned that agents may opt for more agent-friendly platforms like Homes.com which do not divert leads. By demanding immediate listings and simultaneously offering Zillow exclusive listing, Zillow risks weakening the relative value of the MLSs a major brokerage has informed us that Zillow now seeks direct feeds from brokers, bypassing MLSs suggesting MLSs may soon recognize Zillow as an existentialist threat -- or an existential threat, not an existentialist.\nHomes.com is offering free boost to any home for sale at Zillow bands, the first home band that we're aware of is in [indiscernible] when the Homes.com boost, we've been able to serve it up to buyers 155,000 times in the first 12 days, it was on the market. 205 buyers have favored listing on Homes.com and 43 have shared it with a friend or family member. I visited that open house on that listing this weekend to support the agent and there was good traffic. The agent told me they've already had 30 showings. Homes.com provides a compelling agent-friendly alternative to Zillow's aggressive tactics. Agents are liking what we are doing, our impressions on Homes.com social media channels targeted agents have increased 1,247% in Q2 '25 compared to Q1 '25. We're seeing considerable social listening growth with our net sentiment score up 58% since last quarter.\nFrom April to June '25, our social media engagement has increased by 48% with a 30% growth in positive sentiment. The reason is simple. Homes.com benefits all parties involved, home buyers, sellers and agents and MLSs. We eliminate friction by providing a professional online presentation of every home and community without distracting ads or span, and we're connecting buyers honestly, directly with a seller's agent. Member listings and boost reach more buyers more frequently. Members build the brand by being prominently featured across our site and retarget across thousands of websites. No other U.S. portal offers this level of exposure for agents and listings. In August, we plan to launch a robust new home section on Homes.com. This is a vital segment as approximately 60% of homebuyers prefer new construction according to the National Association of Homebuilders. I'm glad they're that confident.\nWe have already secured 200 agreements with leading builders, positioning this new feature as a significant future revenue stream, enabling us to capitalize on a substantial market opportunity. It was another strong quarter for our U.K. residential marketplace on the market. Our inventory continues to grow with over 800,000 listings now on site up 20% year-over-year and a new record for the business. We're delivering a significant ROI to over 16,300 subscribing customers with leads up 12% in the quarter year-over-year, and total page views on the site up 28% for the same period. We're building an audience of serious property seekers with average time on site per active user up 85% year-over-year. and lead to visit conversions that we believe are beating Rightmove's conversion rate.\nNet new bookings reached a record of 100,000 in June, which was the 14th consecutive month of net new revenue growth equivalent to an impressive $9.4 million of annualized revenue. We're continuing to develop the product using the Homes.com playbook as we further differentiate from our competitors. We are in the final stages of acquiring Domain Holdings, 1 of Australia's 2 largest real estate portals and among the top 10 real estate marketplaces globally. We anticipate the transaction will close in the third quarter of this year, and we're very excited about combining CoStar's capabilities with domain. Recently, a new dynamic has emerged in the Australian market the country's antitrust regulator, the ACCC, has announced an investigation in the REA Group, which is Domain's primary competitor.\nIn July, numerous real stages in Australia reported that REA Group increased their monthly subscription fees by up to 78%, likely prompting that investigation. We believe the situation creates an excellent opportunity for Domain to position itself as the more reasonable and stable service provider. It's worth knowing that REA Group in Australia and realtor.com in the U.S. share common ownership under News Corp and the Murdoch family. Media reports speculate that realtor.com's CEO might return to Australia to replace REA Group's current CEO. If that were to occur, it would mean 2 disruptive leadership changes in our favor in 1 move.\nOur CoStar product achieved $271 million in revenue in Q2 '25 and Revenue growth accelerated sequentially from Q1, increasing 7% year-over-year in Q2. Net new bookings from our CoStar product accelerated from last quarter as we achieved our highest quarter of cost or net new bookings since Q3 2023. STR had its best quarter for net new bookings, up 24% year-over-year as compared to Q2 '24. This is the third consecutive quarter of increasing net new bookings for CoStar as we generate strong sales with banks, institutional investors and owners. I'm happy to see net new bookings for brokers trending upward each quarter this year. We remain on track to increase the CoStar product sales force by 20% in 2025, and reaching a total of 400 sales representatives to position us to capture the substantial and growing total addressable market there.\nOur lender sales continue to exhibit strong growth as our expanded sales team meets the increasing demand for our product. With over 400 clients and revenue approaching $100 million, we've established a strong foundation pretty quickly that we'll continue to build on as we roll out additional capabilities and expand our sales force to target the larger $1 billion TAM in the lender space. Our quarterly CoStar renewal rate increased to 93%. Our Net Promoter Score for the U.S. sales team reached an outstanding 70%. That was a major first for us and been a solid progression for a couple of years there. Our Canadian team's NPS grew to 63%, again, an all-time high for both teams. In addition, gross productivity per rep has improved in each of the last 6 months. The number of subscribers for CoStar grew to 275,000, up 19% year-over-year driven predominantly by the ongoing migration of STR users into CoStar and the addition of new STR subscribers to the CoStar platform.\nI'm very pleased with our continued growth in a challenging market. The CRE market continues to face difficulties, particularly in the office segment with persistently high vacancy rates, though moderating and slightly worsening negative net absorption rates. We're seeing a sharp decline in new deliveries, which should help stabilize the office market in the near future. Transaction volumes have maintained a positive seasonal trend with Q2 up 43% year-over-year. The increase in deal flow was consistent across the 5 main property types with office transaction volume spiking 71%, retail increasing 46% and multifamily rising 42%, industrial growing 29% and hospitality up 18% for the same period. Our international businesses have achieved 4 consecutive quarters of all-time high net new bookings with an impressive 90% year-over-year growth in Q2 '25 compared to Q2 '24.\nIn the U.K., we're solidifying our market-leading positioning, leading -- boosting our year-to-date net new bookings by 257% compared to the first half of last year and accelerating year-over-year revenue growth to 14% in Q2 '25 versus Q2 '24. Concurrently, we've streamlined our cost structure, realizing $40 million in cost savings this year which represents 19% of our 2024 expense base in Europe. Our European sales initiatives are led by Alexa Maria Rathbone Barker who was recently promoted to lead the CoStar business in Europe. Alexa joined CoStar Group as Head of European sales 3 years ago following a long -- a decade-long tenure at Bloomberg. Where she held senior leadership roles focused on international growth and led the European analytics team. In our new capacity, Alexa will drive the continued expansion of our U.K. business and oversee the broader growth of CoStar across Europe.\nWe're positioning our European business to take advantage of the substantial international growth opportunity. In Europe, over 50% of the value of CRE transactions are cross-border, yet there are no comprehensive pan-European CRE solutions. We have been methodically expanding our European research and marketplace capabilities. We anticipate launching CoStar in France by the end of the year. LoopNet delivered an outstanding performance in the second quarter. It generated more net new business in the first half of 2025 than the entirety of 2024. Net new bookings in the first half of 2025 surged by 45% compared to the same period last year. Consequently, revenue growth accelerated sequentially from Q1 and increased by 8% year-over-year. we expect LoopNet's revenue growth to exceed 10% in the second half of 2025, moving to double-digit growth.\nDespite ongoing challenges and volatility in the commercial real estate market, we've implemented significant changes to unlock LoopNet's full potential. As previously discussed, our focus on selling LoopNet packages that enable advertisers to promote their entire portfolio rather than a selected few properties. This approach delivers a high return on investment for our clients, increases listing coverage on LoopNet and enhances both the consumer and customer experience. Furthermore, the rollout of asset-based pricing continues to yield positive outcomes. With each passing month, our service is increasingly priced relative to the value we deliver to clients. resulting in year-over-year increase in monetization per listing. LoopNet is the world's most active commercial real estate marketplace. Tenants and investors begin their search online and loop as their preferred destination. Properties listed on LoopNet sell and lease faster.\nFor instance, one of the largest global brokerage terms and long-time client of CoStar recently significantly increased their investment in LoopNet marketing after we quantitatively demonstrate that listings on LoopNet were 60% more likely to close in a given time period than those not listed on the platform. We built the largest audience of commercial real estate shoppers globally with hundreds of thousands of properties available for sale and lease. In 2024, $120 billion worth of transactions occurred on LoopNet, where tenants or buyers view listings on our site before pursuing the deals they ultimately closed. Our effort to expand LoopNet's global footprint are progressing well. We launched LoopNet in Spain, and we expect to launch Luban France in Q4. This will bring our total listings across Europe to over 100,000 and with significant potential for further expansion as we address the evident market need for a pan-European and global commercial real estate marketplace.\nWith the expected close on the domain acquisition in Q3 2025 Australia will soon become part of the LoopNet network. That will be a good day. Land.com achieved the highest quarter of net new bookings since Q3 2022. This was a result of improved segmentation and servicing of clients. Clients elected to migrate their marketing exposure from the lower and middle advertising plans to the highest plan. Signature ads increased by 49% and land professionals will benefit from a tremendous increase in reach and value because of the promotion of Land's paid listings on Homes.com and the integration of our recently acquired ACRE value. CoStar Real Estate Management continues to grow revenue and drive centers between visual lease and real estate manager. Subscription revenue grew 9% in Q2 '25 compared to Q2 '24. I recently had the opportunity to spend some time in Atlanta working with the product teams and the integration of CoStar between Visual lease and real estate manager, along with Matterport and LoopNet.\nI'm confident this will be an amazing solution for anyone that leases commercial space. This buy sell revenue reached $8.8 million in the second quarter, a 9% increase year-over-year. Business for sale net new bookings increased 200% from Q2 2024 and driven by strong growth in both business owner and broker subscriptions. Subscription revenue from sell Edge, which offers entrepreneurs advanced tools and marketing insights grew 50% year-over-year. Buyer demand continued to strengthen with lead volume increasing 23% Q2 year-over-year. Business owners are increasingly turning to business by cell for valuation estimates, educational content and other resources over 25,000 new business owners registered on BizBuySell during the quarter with 5,000 creating detailed business profiles that shared location, industry revenue and profit. Importantly, thousands of these owners also turned to BizBuy [indiscernible] to connect with our network of business brokers subscribers for expert guidance and listing representation.\nIn Q2, brokers reported 2,342 sold business transactions on the platform, totaling nearly $2 billion in enterprise value. Brokers are rapidly adopting our recently released deal accelerator feature which streamlines dealmaking by automating buyer qualification and information sharing processes, helping brokers close more deals and earn higher commissions. Finally, turning to Matterport, Saving the best for last. Matterport is clearly the world's leading provider of digital twin solutions technology. Its primary competition comes from the hundreds of billions of traditional 2-dimensional images used to market real estate and manage facilities. However, these 2D photos fall significantly short of Matterports immersive capabilities, which intuitively transport remote viewers into a space providing experience second only to physically being there, hence, porting matter.\nWhile Matterport offers an exceptional product, the business has not yet achieved profitability and its growth rate has slowed. We strongly believe that integrating Matterport with CoStar Group will help the company thrive accelerate growth and achieve strong profit margins. an integrated Matterport solution will significantly enhance the value of CoStar's marketplaces and information platforms. Currently, Matterport has a very small sales force. I believe, fewer than 30 quota-carrying salespeople globally, not quite 1 per major country, which means many of Matterports most promising revenue opportunities have never been contacted by a Matterport salesperson. That will change. We plan to significantly expand Matterport sales force and market its integrated solutions through the thousands of CoStar sales representatives at Homes.com LoopNet Domain Real Estate Manager Land, Apartments.com and other platforms.\nHistorically, Matterport has operated as a product-led company with a strong business consumer focus, which resulted in less emphasis on sales efforts or field sales efforts and less focus on its most powerful technology the matter for 3 camera. We intend to shift Matterport towards a business-to-business or B2B approach. The Matterport Pro 3 camera delivers a superior capture experience and a very superior display experience compared to mobile devices. Customers using the Pro 3 camera have an 85% renewal rate for our SaaS services while those using an Android phone only have a 40% renewal rate. We plan to invest time and capital in developing even more advanced cameras appropriately named the Matterport Pro 4 and the Pro 4 Ultra expects to be revealed 1 day. We will work to maintain our highest end cameras more -- make our highest end cameras more price accessible to the hundreds of thousands of potential users around the world.\nRight now, the first matter port taken with the Pro 3 effectively costs a photograph or 6,500, the first picture costs you 6,500. The second cost $3, the third, the fourth or fifth, each cost $3. As a result, many potential users never get to the second matter for the first matter port. This is easy enough to profitably change and solve for. We're integrating Matterports amazing capabilities more deeply into all of our portals and information solutions. I think that in combination, we can bring properties to life like never before. We're relaunching the Matterport brand, adding the signature CoStar Group, Star Wheel logo to the front of the Matterport name, and we're going to co-brand Matterport with our portal brands appropriately to the property types. While we invest in profitable growth initiatives at Matterport, we have a sharp eye on getting to profitability so that we ultimately are positioned to achieve our goal of digitizing the world's real estate.\nYesterday, we began winding down operations of Matterports photography business VHT. Matterport acquired VHT in June of 2022, but has not realized its strategic potential. VHT primarily operates as a loss-making real estate photography service, largely focused in the Chicago market. Approximately 75% of HT's photography services do not include a Matterport tour and none of their contractors are using the high-quality Pro 3 camera. BHT generated roughly $14 million in annual revenue, but incurred losses exceeding $10 million. It's a nonstrategic asset, so we're going to reallocate resources to more productive areas.\nIn conclusion, I'm thrilled with our strong financial results and CoStar record annualized net new bookings quarter of $93 million, a remarkable 65% increase over the prior quarter. again, $93 million in net new bookings in the quarter. With a $100 billion total addressable market in the world's largest asset class, we remain committed to our mission of digitizing global real estate. At this point, I will finally turn the call over to our CFO, Chris Lown.\n\nChristian M. Lown\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Navient Corporation\n\nThank you, Andy. Good evening. I'm happy to report that CoStar has now reached its 57th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, coming in at 15%. We also achieved a commercial information and Marketplace Brands margin of 43% in the second quarter. As a reminder, this margin excludes Homes.com on the market and the recently acquired Matterport. Net new bookings for the second quarter were a record $93 million representing a 65% sequential increase from the first quarter and a 38% increase year-over-year. Apartments.com, CoStar and LoopNet all contributed strong bookings growth as our growing dedicated sales forces are delivering.\nRevenue for the second quarter was $781 million, exceeding the high end of guidance. Matterport revenue was $44 million in the second quarter beating our guidance estimate and contributing to our outperformance in the second quarter. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA came in at $85 million, an 11% margin, also exceeding the high end of our guidance range. The outperformance in adjusted EBITDA was a result of timing of investment spend and our revenue beat this quarter. CoStar revenue grew 7% in the second quarter, ahead of guidance. Sales rep productivity has steadily improved over the past 6 quarters and second quarter productivity was the highest since Q3 2023. The strong second quarter performance, combined with internal leading indicators compels us to increase our full year revenue growth guidance to 7%. We expect growth in the third quarter to also be 7%. Residential revenue was $28 million in the second quarter.\nWe expect third quarter residential revenue to increase $3 million to $4 million sequentially and we now expect residential revenue growth of over 20% in 2025. Apartments.com's second quarter revenue growth came in at 11% year-over-year, ahead of the 10% guidance we provided last quarter, Sales rep productivity improved to its highest level in 2 years, an impressive feat considering we are also at our highest number of sales reps. Our first half of 2025 results are broadly in line with expectations. -- and we remain on track to achieve the 11% to 12% full year revenue growth guidance we provided last quarter. Third quarter revenue growth is also expected to be 11% to 12%. LoopNet revenue grew 8% in the second quarter, 1 percentage point higher than last quarter's guidance. LoopNet's dedicated sales force continues to perform. In fact, the sales team delivered LoopNet's highest first half net new bookings ever. The shift in sales strategy to focus on selling broad subscription packages and utilize asset-based pricing has been working well and we anticipate the benefits of this strategic shift to continue.\nThis first half performance and strong momentum gives us the confidence to increase our 2025 revenue growth expectations to 8% to 9%. Third quarter revenue growth is now expected to be between 10% and 11%. Revenue from information services was $39 million in the second quarter. We are updating our guidance for Information Services revenue growth to 16% to 18% and expect third quarter revenue growth of approximately 20%. Other revenue was $75 million in the second quarter, with Matterport contributing $44 million. For the third quarter, we expect other revenue of approximately $75 million including approximately $40 million for Matterport. Through our integration and streamlining efforts, we are discontinuing certain noncore Matterport revenue that did not positively contribute to earnings which is why we're expecting Q3 revenue to be below the level realized in Q2.\nThe impact from the discontinued revenue to our full year outlook is around $10 million. As such, we are revising the top end of our revenue guidance and now expect other revenue between $270 million and $275 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $85 million at an 11% margin, meaningfully above the high end of our $50 million to $60 million second quarter guidance. The favorable performance relates to higher-than-projected revenue lower-than-anticipated professional services costs and timing of certain growth initiatives. We have made great progress on bolstering our sales force, which has reached 1,800 reps at quarter end. This is an increase of more than 400 salespeople since the beginning of the year and a 43% increase in reps year-over-year. While sales headcount has reached the most at Homes.com has increased the most at Homes.com. We are delivering sales rep growth in all our major brands.\nOur contract renewal rate was 89% for the second quarter with the renewal rate for customers who have been subscribers for 5 years or longer at 95%. We Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 78% for the second quarter. Matterport's inclusion decreased this metric by 2 percentage points. On June 30, our June 30 balance sheet includes $3.7 billion in cash, which are a net interest income of $33 million in the second quarter, a 3.5% rate of return. We repurchased 585,000 shares in the second quarter for $45 million, bringing our year-to-date total to 825,000 shares repurchased for $64 million. In 2025, we anticipate repurchasing at least $150 million of the $500 million share repurchase authorized. On May 9, we formally agreed to purchase Domain Group for AUD 4.43 per share. As mentioned last quarter, we already acquired a 16.9% ownership in Domain. We expect to pay an incremental 2.3 billion to acquire the remaining shares when the transaction closes. In anticipation of the deal closing, we entered into a forward swap of USD to AUD to mitigate foreign currency risk while the deal is pending.\nWe expect the total remaining equity purchase price to be around $1.5 billion. Based on our outperformance in the second quarter, we are increasing the midpoint of our 2025 revenue guidance. We are now providing a range of $3.15 billion to $3.155 billion, implying an annual growth rate of 15%. Our guidance does not contemplate the expected closing of the Domain Group acquisition in the third quarter. The company expects third quarter revenue of $800 million to $805 million representing 16% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We are also increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year with revised guidance of $370 million to $390 million. Our revised adjusted EBITDA guidance reflects our second quarter beat versus guidance and incorporates the timing of the growth initiative spend getting pushed to the back half of the year. For the third quarter of 2025, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $75 million to $85 million.\nAnd with that, I will now turn the call back over to our call operator to open the line for questions."

Welcome to the Q1 2025 CoStar Group Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Rich Simonelli, Head of Investor Relations.\n\nRichard Simonelli\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you so much, operator, and hello, and thank you all for joining us to discuss the first quarter 2025 results of the CoStar Group.

Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nGood day, and thank you for joining CoStar Group's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. We posted another strong quarter with Q1 '25 revenue coming in at $732 million, a 12% increase year-over-year. This was our 56th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Q1 revenue exceeded consensus and was at the top end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA was $66 million, a 429% increase of Q1 -- over Q1 2024. Adjusted EBITDA also exceeded consensus and it was at the top end of our guidance range.\nWe achieved a very strong 43% profit margin, our Q1 '25 commercial real estate and information marketplace businesses, that includes CoStar Apartments, LoopNet, STR Real Estate Manager, Land and BizBuySell in aggregate coming in at 43% profit margin. Company net new bookings were $56 million in the first quarter of '25, up 6% sequentially from the fourth quarter of '24. Our international businesses have achieved 3 consecutive quarters of all-time net new bookings, reaching over $5 million ARR in Q1 of '25, representing 56% year-over-year growth. We had 130 million average unique visitors to our global websites in Q1 '25 according to Google Analytics.\nCoStar achieved $265 million in revenue in Q1 '25. Revenue was up 6% year-over-year, while annualized net new bookings reached their highest level since Q3 '23 and generating 68% year-over-year growth. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of increasing net new bookings as we continue to generate strong sales with banks, institutional investors and owners.\nSTR's integration to CoStar contributed to its best quarter ever for net new bookings, up 17% year-over-year. This increase was driven by a significant rise in sales to owner operators who were 40% of STR's net new bookings in Q1. We grew the number of CoStar subscribers in Q1, 17% year-over-year, largely driven by the migration of STR to the CoStar platform.\nCoStar for lenders, led by Mr. [ John Vecchione ] achieved its best ever quarter of net new bookings, up 116% year-over-year. Today, lenders used by 385 institutions to manage risk on $1 trillion of CRE debt. In less than 3 years, it has achieved $80 million in annual revenue run rate. We have had several -- we have several product enhancements that we'll roll out in the course of the next few years that can take the total addressable market for lender well above $1 billion.\nCoStar remains a mission-critical tool for our clients across all segments. Log-ins to CoStar were up 21% year-over-year, and our subscribers averaged 100 million activities each month, the highest level of activity in the past 9 quarters. Our quarterly renewal rate remains strong at 92%.\nDuring the past few years and through today, we're operating in one of the worst commercial real estate environments in decades. Looking at investment-grade office, although absorption is improving, we are still seeing historic high vacancy rate of about 16%, real asking rents of [ $36.64 ] sit at a 30-year low. Real sales price per square foot is a decade low of $257 per square foot. Market cap rates are at a high point of 9.17%. Sales volume, while recovering, is about 1/3 of normal levels. In industrial, we're seeing record lows for absorption and a 6% year-over-year decline in real asking rents. In retail, real asking rents are 10-year lows. But I want to be clear, we see clear signs that the cycle is improving. Vacancy rates have hit their [indiscernible] and are beginning to fall. Availability rates have fallen 60 basis points. Sublet rents are beginning to rise. We expect that as market conditions improve over the next few years, the headwinds we've experienced will shift to tailwinds and CoStar will return to double-digit growth.\nLoopNet turned in an outstanding quarter as annualized net new bookings skyrocketed 200% year-over-year. This was LoopNet's highest quarter of annualized net new bookings since Q3 '22. In the quarter, per rep productivity was twice as high as Q1 '24. This great sales performance was a result of changing our go-to-market sales strategy, our sales team is focused on selling a broad subscription package to owners and brokers to get all their properties on the platform rather than focusing on selling a few high-value signature ads that only address a small portion of the portfolio. [indiscernible] begin their search online and LoopNet is the largest commercial estate marketplace in the world. So it's far more valuable to the owner to have exposure for all their properties rather than have a robust exposure for 1 or 2 of their properties.\nThis strategy will grow the number of paid properties in the platform, which increases the choice available on LoopNet for consumers and gives our sales team the opportunity to upsell silver ads to signature [ depth ] ads in the future. We're now also implementing asset-based pricing as silver ads come up for renewal. Our renewal rates on these ads remain strong at 97% as our customers understand it is important to tie the price of any given LoopNet add to the value of the property being advertised.\nOur pricing will reflect that $1 billion 5-star office building in Manhattan drives more value from LoopNet than does a $100,000 2-star retail building in Montana. Ultimately, it is our goal to implement asset-based pricing across all ad tiers on both new sales and renewals.\nCoStar Real Estate Manager and Visual Lease attained annualized subscription revenue growth nearing double digits. In Q1 2025, we moved forward with the consolidation of leadership and operations across the brands, positioning the leases businesses for integration in the greater CoStar data offering. This, combined with other identified cost savings resulted in 50% year-over-year EBITDA growth for the combined brands. Both brands continue to take market share from lease management competitors, many of whom are falling short on product innovation and focus on customers. The leases product team is now focused to combine the value of its portfolio management applications with CoStar's data and analytics, Matterport and LoopNet offerings to create an unrivaled solution for occupiers for real estate.\nCoStar continues to develop a data set of leases from both anonymized customer data from the leased brands and publicly available sources like the SEC and U.K. Land Registry with the goal of providing full transparency on rent concessions and tenant improvements to real estate professionals. Q1 brought additional growth of customers electing to share data on an aggregated and anonymized basis.\nFor the quarter, Land.com net new bookings increased 58%. And land.com continues integrating with Homes.com. Today, over 8,000 Homes.com members are syndicating over 22,000 applicable listings to Land.com. Soon, Land.com members will receive a similar benefit on Homes.com increasing value and opportunities for both sites.\nIn mid-March, Farmer Mac released the Farmer Mac Farmland Price Index powered by our recently acquired Acre Value. Farmer Mac said the introduction of the FPI marks a significant advancement in tracking farmland price trends with greater precision and timeliness. We agree and look forward to providing greater, more timely insight into farmland markets.\nBizBuySell revenue reached $8.7 million in the first quarter, representing a 10% increase year-over-year. Net new bookings increased 85% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in both business owner and business buyer subscriptions. Subscription revenue from BizBuySell Edge, which offers entrepreneurs advanced tools and market insights, grew 48% year-over-year. Buyer demand continues to strengthen with website visits up 22% and lead volume increasing 33% year-over-year.\nApartments.com turned in another strong quarter with revenue of $282 million, an increase of 11% over Q1 '24. Apartments.com sales team was very active in the first quarter. They conducted over 166,000 quality interactions with clients and prospects in the quarter and increased their face-to-face meetings by 65% year-over-year. The increase in quality interactions is paying off as we added 4,300 new communities in Q1, the most properties we have added to Apartments.com in a single quarter in almost 10 years.\nWe're benefiting from the shutdown of Redfin of their rent period business as we target those properties that were formally on rent period, not apartments. We launched marketing campaigns to owners, specifically comparing our traffic, leads and leases to rent period with face-to-face follow-up with these communities with much success.\nWe now have 80,000 multifamilies on Apartments.com. The sales team maintained a 94 Net Promoter Score during the quarter. We see a $2.6 billion opportunity in the 20-unit and above building space and is our intention to grow the sales team 23% this year to keep up with this potential. Since 2019, we've grown our apartments revenue 118%, but only grown our sales reps in production by 56%, so we'll continue to accelerate our sales force growth to keep up with this opportunity. We've added 56 sales professionals so far this year with an additional 24 sales professionals that started training this week.\nI'm especially excited to welcome our 37 new sales team members that have come to us from rent period. I believe that we have added more salespeople from rent period than Zillow did despite Zillow spending a lot of money to acquire assets from Redfin. These individuals average 10 years of multifamily sales experience and are already producing good results.\nOur 2025 Apartments.com marketing campaign is in full swing and features the most content we've ever developed to reach the largest audience possible. In Q1, our 5 new TV spots were featured in March Madness, the National Women's Soccer League. And for you NFL fans, you probably saw us last week on the NFL draft. Our campaign will also be featured throughout other profile shows and during the Major League Baseball, NHL and NBA seasons.\nWe have increased our paid search efforts in the first quarter and will continue to do so throughout the year to attract more potential renters to our advertisers' communities by generating 5x more #1 positions in Zillow in the top 50 U.S. rental markets. Our unaided awareness among apartment seekers remains higher than all of our competitors combined at 65%, and our closest competitor is 30 percentage points below us. Among industry professionals, our unaided brand awareness is now at an all-time high of 86%, a 26% increase over 2024.\nIndustry professionals tell us that delivering high-quality leads to convert to more leases is the most important thing we do. In 2025, Brand Study, a brand study conducted by [ Gov x ], 47% of owners and operators surveyed said Apartments.com had a completely or very effective lease to -- lead to lease conversion rate that's 38% more than Zillow's and 160% more than Rent Period's.\nApartments.com Network had 38 million average monthly unique visitors in the first quarter. ComScore has released their March data and has us ahead of Zillow in visits in March by 5% with 90 million visits and has the Apartments Network up 7% year-over-year for the first quarter while Zillow is showing down 27% for the same period. Very importantly, our lead flow to our customers continues to increase and is up 17% year-over-year.\nAccording to the most recent analysis by Entrada through March of this year, Apartments delivered 1.8x more leads in other rental networks. Apartments.com also delivers by far the highest quality of leads converting 2.7x better than other rental networks and ultimately delivers more leases than other rental networks, 5.1x more to be exact. Our applied now leads, our highest converting lead type, are up 814% over Q1 of last year as more and more properties enable this feature. In the first quarter, we added a record of a -- high of 142,000 single-family rentals posted on the platform and assisted our independent owner clients by collecting $1.4 billion in rental payments.\nWe continue to see success from the utilization of Matterport on our rental sites with potential renters viewing Matterport's 53 million times in the quarter, up 59% year-over-year, while spending 71% more time on listings detailed pages with a Matterport. Apartments.com is also benefiting from the increased traffic on Homes.com as Apartments.com paid advertisers also get exposure over a Homes.com's rental area.\nApartments.com Canada revenue grew 350% year-over-year with all-time highs in March for visitors, visits and leads. According to recent data from [ dash IQ ], Apartments.com now delivers more leads and leases than any other ILS in Canada.\n14 months ago, CoStar Group launched the new Homes.com with a marketing blitz at Super Bowl 58. The new Homes.com offers a completely different business model than do competing U.S. residential portals in the U.S. The new Homes.com is based on the premise that the most important thing a portal can do is to market a property for sale. This is in harmony with all the most successful and highly profitable portals around the world outside the U.S., which are all based upon this market the property, not an agent lead gen business model.\nThe legacy competing unprofitable U.S. property portals are based upon lead diversion business models. These lead diversion models divert leads from the potential homebuyers away for the listing agent and into the hands of a buyer agent willing to split their commission with a portal. Our research shows that these lead diversion models are very unpopular with home sellers, buyers and agents. These lead diversion sites are not designed to solve for the most important task, which is to sell the home.\nThe new Homes.com is a clean fast site offering a wealth of valuable content on neighborhood schools that home shoppers cannot find on competing sites. Based upon a wealth of consumer and agent feedback, we believe that Homes.com offers a vastly superior user experience and is preferred by home shoppers.\nTo build a massive audience for home sellers and listing agents, we launched one of the largest marketing campaigns ever in real estate. Using RPA, the same firm we successfully used to create the Apartments.com brand, we recruited talent like Dan Levy, Heidi Gartner, Morgan Freeman, Lil' Wayne and Jeff Goldblum, to create memorable and effective spots for the new Homes.com. We have run 32,000 commercials in digital placements, generating approximately 80 billion impressions. In Q1 alone, we generated 6 billion brand impressions across many of the biggest events in America, including the Super Bowl, the College Football Championship and March Madness.\nTo be successful, Homes.com -- for Homes.com to be successful, home shoppers need to be aware of Homes.com and have intention to use it. Our target audience is several hundred million home shoppers is massive. Before we launched in February '24, only 4% of that target audience when asked top of mind what home shopper and websites can you think of for replied Homes.com. In 14 months of marketing campaign, we have steadily increased our unaided awareness 9x to 36%. So we're now at 36% unaided awareness. Early last year, our unaided awareness surpassed [indiscernible] last summer, we surpassed Redfin's unaided awareness. And last month, we crossed realtor.com. We began Zillow with 64 points above our own unaided awareness. We've closed the gap to 24 points and are still improving.\nOur unaided intention or the percentage of people surveyed that say they intend to use our site has grown from single-digit to 26%. We've also crossed realtor Redfin and Trulia on unaided intent. Zillow and Realtor have been trending down while we have been growing. I have consistently set the expectation of building a B2C brand takes 3 to 5 years. To reach this level of unaided awareness and unaided intent in an audience of hundreds of millions in 14 months is excellent progress.\nI feel that over the next 2 to 4 years, we can take a solid and very valuable leadership position in the industry. With a superior product and aggressive marketing campaign and both growing unaided awareness and intent, we're seeing very strong audience and traffic growth in the Homes.com network. In just 14 months, we've built a Q1 '24 audience of 104 million average monthly unique visitors. That's according to Google Analytics. This now makes the Homes.com network 1 of the top 2 residential portals based upon monthly unique visitors according to the latest available public securities filings of our peer portals or near peer portals.\nWe remain well ahead of Redfin and realtor.com's traffic. With such a wide lead over these 2, we've shifted our traffic acquisition strategy away from pure volume to targeting quality engaged traffic. Our bounce rate has approved 45 percentage points. Our session duration is up 200%, and the number of page visits per visit has more than doubled.\nWe're monetizing Homes.com by selling memberships to agents giving their listings priority placements on Homes.com which brings more buyer views, more leads and on average, enables them to sell the property faster and for more money. Members listing sort to the top of their market, generally the first page where 90% of all buyers click through to listings. We present their listings with our neighborhood school content on competing listings and suggestion e-mails in our home page.\nWith 1 billion visits to Homes.com in the past 12 months, we have unique insights in the market to buy a new home. We retarget members' listings across thousands of websites to keep their listings top of mind. We also provide members with the Matterport and floor plan for their listing so that potential buyers can tour their listings 24/7. It's a comprehensive digital real estate marketing package no one else is offering. In a time where home sales are getting a little tougher to achieve, I think we're well positioned in the right place at the right time of the cycle.\nOne of the most important events for a real estate agent is the listing presentation where they meet with a home seller and try to win a listing to sell their home. Homes.com members use the marketing benefits we offer through membership to differentiate themselves from competing agents and win more listing presentations. We track the listing win rate advantage for members closely, and it's steadily climbing and now member agents are winning 61% more listings than before membership. Since the average value of winning a new listing is $15,000 and monthly membership fee is less than $500, the ROI is outstanding.\nLast February, when we launched the new Homes.com, we faced several hurdles. At launch, we only had a very small dedicated Homes.com sales force of about 50 reps to sell to more than 1 million agents. We were offering a completely new value proposition to an agent customer base with very negative feelings about the business models of legacy real estate portals in our space. There was a bit of undeserved guilt by association.\nLast May, just after launch, our first Net Promoter Score was disappointing at negative 42. Many early members did not understand our new value proposition and believe that Homes.com like Zillow was a lead diversion site, and were disappointed we were not diverting other agents leads to them to generate buyer agency business. That had never been our intent.\nOur out-of-cycle early cancellation rate or failed payment at the time was high at 10% monthly. By late summer to early fall '24, our value proposition was better understood and our NPS turned positive and moved into the good classification in the low single digits, and our early cancellation dropped significantly to 6%. In the last few months, our Net Promoter Scores have been surging upwards and have reached 43 which is at the great classification and our early cancel or failed payment rate has dropped to between 0.25% and 2.5% per month, great progress.\nSince we launched a completely new product concept in the U.S. in February '24, the early cancellation rate of 12-month contracts has plummeted 65%. Since last May, our Net Promoter Score has soared over 85 points to sit in a great classification.\nUnder the very strong leadership of our Senior Vice President of Sales, Andy Stearns, we've grown that small initial team of 50 dedicated sales reps, [ 600% ] over the last 14 months to 314 reps in production. Those reps with 4 months of production are turning in a steady $1,612 monthly net new revenue, which implies our straight lines to $232,000 in billings per average rep at the end of 12 months or $1.1 million billings per rep at the end of 5 years accounting.\nThe sales force is still growing very rapidly with 64 more in training and with offers out to an additional 214 salespeople. In Q4, we anticipate we'll have 500 salespeople with 4 months of experience selling Homes.com that would suggest we could be adding over $800,000 a month new billing each month by Q4. We have recently optimized our pricing strategy to better align the price of our product with the stronger benefits, listing agents and rental agents receive as Homes.com members. The first iteration of our pricing strategy determine membership price based on equal weighting of buyer and seller agency deals. Now we largely pace price based on seller listings.\nIn April, month-to-date, our demo-to-close rate is 56%. So something is going right there. This is the highest monthly close rate I've ever seen for any CoStar brand. With 1 day left in April, the dedicated Homes.com sales team is currently positioned to close [ $240,000 ] monthly net new bookings. They're still selling past some of the sales from the prior year that the general sales force did, but they're solidly into positive territory. This is the dedicated sales team's best net new bookings month to date and a $420,000 positive swing from the prior month.\nWith improving NPS scores, our projected cancellations for May are falling approximately 70%. At the same time, our gross sales are climbing as we bring on more salespeople and they gain experience. I believe that by year-end, our Homes.com sales team will be our largest and will be turning in the most net new revenue of any CoStar Group -- any product in CoStar Group with a regular 1 million net new months for Homes.com.\nWe recently released a new purchase option for Homes.com called Boost, which is a marketing option for a single listing for agents with unpredictable income and not yet ready to commit to an annual membership, they can boost 1 listing via e-commerce. Just like membership once boosted their listing source -- at the top of search results, receives a Matterport and is retargeted across the Internet. This is a low-risk purchase option for an agent because they can go into a listing presentation use the boost as a differentiator, but they only have to pay for it when they win the listing and have offsetting commission revenue.\nFrom our perspective, this is a great way for agents to get their foot in the door and we will be funneling Boost purchases as leads into our sales team to call upon for upsales to membership. We're also offering the Boost option directly to home sellers. These are home sellers with agents, but often home sellers -- we've seen it in Australia, it's really successful where home sellers regularly add marketing tailwinds to their home for sale, purchasing tens of thousands of dollars worth of boost from portals to market their home for sale online.\nWe tested the Boost option with home sellers and listing agents and focus groups in Southern California recently. The feedback was universally positive with almost all participants saying they would purchase a boost for their home or listing at about the $500 price point. In July, we expect to launch a new homes Homes.com marketing offering for homebuilders. This is an attractive market for us to enter because new construction represents approximately 20% of all homes sold in any given year, yet there's no great single place for consumers to go and find all the available new communities. Building a site with full inventory of available new homes would be a very valuable option for both consumers and the industry, and would allow Homes.com to capture a piece of the estimated $3 billion annual of marketing spend by Americas homebuilders. We've already secured listing fees, representing 60% of the total available inventory, and I expect this number will grow as we approach July.\nInitial feedback from builders has been overwhelmingly positive as we meet with them builders tell us they're thrilled that a portal is finally delivering a beautifully designed, robust new home search experience.\nWe are carefully controlling expenses generally and with Homes.com specifically. In the first quarter, we released over $50 million in annualized savings, mostly through cost reduction initiatives in our Homes.com investment. Overall, we reduced head count in the company by 423 in Q1.\nZillow recently announced an aggressive new policy of permanently banning homes that have been privately marketed for over 24 hours. Pretty aggressive. With the post NAR lawsuit, industry changes around clear cooperation no co-mingling rules, I believe that our lead diversion competitors are getting anxious that brokers with more choice may increasingly choose to market their properties away from those lead diversion platforms. The home is not listed on Zillow, they'll lose the opportunity to use the listing to seller buyer agency leads and take 40% of the buyer agency commission. We're still for them is that -- if more and more listing agents stay out their platforms and the listing count will fall and they can lose audience and fall into a downward spiral. We view this move not only as anticompetitive but also shows a bit of desperation.\nI authored an open letter last week to the industry making sure everyone was watching the power-grab Zillow is attempting. My communication surprisingly reached an estimated 50 million impressions across e-mail, LinkedIn and earned media coverage. The reaction from agents was approximately 10:1 positive to us. In those most recent focus groups, 1 agent said, \"Well, everyone hate Zillow, buyers, sellers, agents or brokers.\" The word that many described Zillow was predatory. The decades of mistreatment agents are desperate for a viable alternative, and they now have one in Homes.com. My favorite quote of the evening was: Homes.com brings us a lot and they're going to surpass Zillow very soon. The moderator asked where they're hearing that and the agent applied by saying, \"God, everyone at my brokerage meetings, lawyers, brokers, commercial agents, everyone.\"\nAt the end of the 1-year mark since we kicked off our sales efforts, I'm confident that Homes.com is a winning product. We are seeing excellent momentum in sales. If you look around the world at successful real estate portals that use our business model of marketing the real estate, not lead to version, the EBITDA opportunity is really impressive. The EBITDA normalized to the size of the U.S. GDP of market leaders like REA Group, Scout, Rightmove, Domain, Hemnet Nedialista. For the United States, ranges between $1 billion of potential EBITDA to $9 billion of potential EBITDA in the U.S., suggesting that, that residential portal opportunity in the United States is a lot larger than the $79 million adjusted EBIT number one of our competitors turned in, in 2024, about 100x larger than that.\nOnTheMarket had a -- over the United Kingdom had another strong quarter. 11 straight months, we've seen net new bookings growth equivalent to $7.2 million annualized revenue. We are delivering fantastic ROI to agents to subscribe to OnTheMarket. Lead volume increased 17% year-over-year. We increased listings by 23% year-over-year. The audience is engaged as we saw page views and time on site grow by 99% and 81%, respectively, year-over-year.\nIn February 2025, we made an all-cash offer for Domain Holdings, 1 of Australia's 2 largest real estate portals and 1 of the 10 largest real estate marketplaces in the world. Domain is very profitable, growing and is in the market -- in a market with great dynamics for real estate portals with vendor or owner paid models. 2024 annual revenue was $250 million in using today's conversion rate and EBITDA of $88 million.\nAustralia's real estate portals use the vendor-paid advertising model unlike the competing U.S. portals, which have lead-gen models for buyer agents. Australian portals generate revenue through marketing their real estate. Home sellers are regularly paying companies like Domain and REA anywhere from $3,000 on up to $50,000 to market their home for sale online and those -- could be AUD 5,000 to AUD 50,000.\nOne element Domain -- one element that from Domain that will benefit Homes.com and OnTheMarket is depth advertising. Similar to signature ads for Apartments.com and LoopNet, Domain offers 4 tiers of advertising that offer increasing levels of exposure as you move up their ad tiers by utilizing sort order, larger search placards, social notification and retargeting. We will be adopting the best practices of Domain in the U.S. and in the United Kingdom.\nWe see numerous opportunities to create additional value for Domain following the potential acquisition. Domain's majority owner today is a media business, which has historically underinvested in the product. Simultaneously REA Group's market dominance is not incentivized to innovate, improve their product. Both sites pale in comparison to the product we built with Homes.com. We will bring what we built in Homes.com to Australia and the United Kingdom to win over consumers.\nDomain is also a strong entry point into Australia's commercial real estate market. They operate commercialrealestate.com.au, a top 2 CRE marketplace in Australia with thousands of listings we can migrate into LoopNet. Adding Australian listings to LoopNet would provide great value to multinational owners and brokers that list on LoopNet and the multinational tensor searching the site. Domain's inventory commercial listing lays a strong foundation for building CoStar covering Australia.\nThe Board of Domain is -- majority shareholder [ 9 Entertainment ] has backed our offer, and we're in the process of conducting due diligence. Of course, there is no guarantee that our proposal will result in a transaction.\nWe closed the acquisition of Matterport at the end of February, and we have been long time users of Matterport and I'm very excited to have the opportunity to work with RJ, [indiscernible] and the entire Matterport team on the next phase of their impressive journey. The Matterport technology will be an incredible asset for us. They have an impressive product road map, which will benefit our entire ecosystem.\nAt the end of March, Matterport created digital twins for an astounding 54 billion square feet of space. Over the past 4 years, Matterport has increased total spaces under management by more than 20% annual and total square footage by over 30% each year. Our new goal is to reach 1 trillion square feet of digital twins that requires 35% year-over-year growth.\nTheir sales success was achieved with a small sales team but mighty at 47. We plan to grow both their R&D and sales team. With Matterport technology combined with CoStar's global scale and reach, the future is bright for both companies.\nI want to close by doing something important, thanking our Board members, [ Mike Klein, Chris Nassetta and Laura Kaplan, ] who are concluding their service on the CoStar Board. Through the years, they have offered excellent counsel and have been extremely valuable in helping us build CoStar Group into the global organization it is, operating in 192 countries with a $34 billion market cap. [ Mike Klein and David Bonderman ], they cofounded the business with me in 1987. I still marvel at [ Mike Klein ] mortgaging his house to invest. Most all of his net worth or maybe 150% of his net worth into a 22-year-old's start-up concept. It turns out he was a genius, he is a visionary and his support and counsel was matchless.\nAs part of the ongoing refresh of our Board, we made some important announcements earlier this month. [ Louis Sams, ] who's been a CoStar Board member since 2019 has been named Chair of the Board. She has a strong international legal experience having served as EVP and General Counsel of [ Turner ] Broadcasting System, Inc. for nearly 2 decades and President for nearly a decade. Louise is currently the Board Chair of Princeton University, which I hear is a good place. She has been an impactful Board member and is the perfect person to chair our Board.\nI'm looking forward to working with [ John Berisford, Rachel Glaser; and Christine McCarthy. ] They bring a wealth of business experience with strong track records at leading global companies. Christine is a recognized corporate finance leader with over 30 years of experience, most recently as CFO of the Walt Disney Company. John is an accomplished executive who most recently served as President of S&P Global Ratings. Rachel has extensive market experience as the former CFO of Etsy and direct residential industry experience as the former CFO of Move, Inc.\nI'll be chairing our new Board's Capital Allocation Committee and [ John Christie and Robert Musselwhite ] will also serve on the committee. The Board established the committee to review and make recommendations to the Board regarding the company's capital structure, capital allocation priorities and financial targets. The committee's review will also focus on operating performance, including the setting of near-term long-term financial targets for resource and capital allocation. The committee's charge is to continue the company's outstanding capital allocation track record has resulted in the company's outperforming 98% of the NASDAQ companies since our IPO.\nAnd with my very brief remarks, I'm going to turn it over to Chris Lown.\n\nChristian M. Lown\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Navient Corporation\n\nThank you, Andy. First quarter 2025 revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $732 million. Matterport contributed $15.9 million of revenue for the quarter, which represented 1 month of activity. Excluding the Matterport contribution, revenue was at the high end of our guidance and above consensus estimates.\nFirst quarter adjusted EBITDA came in at $66 million and a 9% margin, also exceeding consensus on the high end of our guidance range. The outperformance in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to timing of marketing spend, lower personnel costs from cost saving initiatives and hiring timing. Matterport contributed an adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.7 million for the first quarter stub period. Our commercial information and marketplace plans delivered healthy 43% profit margins in the first quarter. This measure does not include our investments in Homes.com, OnTheMarket and Matterport.\nCoStar revenue grew 6% in the first quarter, in line with our guidance. Even considering what continues to be a difficult commercial real estate backdrop, CoStar net new bookings continue to improve and are now at the highest levels since the third quarter of 2023. While we do not anticipate -- I'm sorry, while we do anticipate some slight headwinds from government contract cancellations expected throughout 2025, we still expect CoStar revenue growth to remain at 6% in the second quarter and we are maintaining our 6% to 7% revenue growth guidance for the full year.\nApartments.com revenue grew 11% year-over-year in the first quarter, in line with our expectations. We refocused our sales plans this year to emphasize new rooftops, and we are seeing the benefits of this incentive structure with a considerable growth in our number of listed properties. The under 100-unit property cohort increased 19% year-over-year in the quarter. This addressable market is nearly 4x the size of the over 100 unit property cohort. We expect to continue to penetrate the sub-100 property segment, and as such, we are maintaining our full year 2025 Apartments.com revenue guidance of 11% to 12%. For 2Q 2025, we expect multifamily revenue growth of 10%.\nLoopNet revenue grew 5% in the first quarter, also in line with our guidance. Importantly, we are building great momentum at LoopNet as it delivered its highest net new bookings quarter in nearly 3 years. We expect revenue growth to accelerate throughout the year with 7% growth expected in the second quarter of 2025. We are increasing our guidance expectations for 2Q for 2025 and now expect revenue growth of 7% to 8% for the full year as growth accelerates throughout the year.\nRevenue from information services was $40 million in the first quarter. Revenue growth for the second quarter and full year is expected to be in the 18% to 20% range. Visual Lease's integration with Real Estate Manager is well underway and we're extremely excited about the lease benchmarking product and expect the beta launch by year-end.\nOther revenue, which now includes Matterport, was $45 million for the first quarter, with Matterport contributing $15.9 million. We expect other second quarter revenue of approximately $70 million with Matterport revenue of approximately $40 million. We expect full year revenue to increase by 100% to 115% and to $270 million to $280 million, with Matterport contributing $135 million to $140 million.\nResidential revenue was $27 million in the first quarter. First quarter sales reflected the nature of cancellations from our initial first quarter 2024 Homes.com sales, and we expect net new bookings to increase throughout the year. This will result in meaningful revenue growth acceleration throughout the second half of 2025. Our 2025 residential revenue growth outlook remains in the mid-teens to low 20s percent range, and we expect second quarter revenue growth in the low single digits due to the impact of first quarter cancellations.\nIn just 1 short year, we have rapidly increased Homes.com's unaided brand awareness 9x to [ 36 ] and have become the second most visited U.S. residential portal. As we continue to scale the Homes.com dedicated sales force, we expect revenue growth to accelerate into 2026 and beyond and are excited about what could be CoStar's largest business.\nFor the first quarter, CoStar posted a $15 million net loss due primarily to the onetime costs from closing the Matterport acquisition. We earned $38.5 million of net investment income on our $3.8 billion in cash in the first quarter or a 4.1% net yield. We are making great progress on increasing our sales forces, which totaled 1,600 salespeople at end March. While much of the increase was concentrated in Homes.com, we are ahead of our sales head count hiring plan across all of our brands. Our contract renewal rate was 89% in the first quarter of 2025 and remains strong at 94% for customers who have been subscribers for 5 years or longer. Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 80% of total revenue for the first quarter of 2025.\nNet new bookings for the first quarter were $56 million, representing a sequential increase of 6% from the fourth quarter and a 29% increase from the third quarter of 2024. Absent the onetime headwinds from Homes.com cancellations in the first quarter, net new bookings would have been $60 million. Commercial net new bookings increased 14% year-over-year and 19% from the fourth quarter, coming in higher than any quarter in 2024.\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, CoStar Group repurchased 240,000 shares for an aggregate cost of $18.5 million. We still anticipate repurchasing $150 million of shares in total in 2025.\nOn March 27, CoStar provided a nonbinding indicative offer to acquire Domain Group for AUD [indiscernible] per share. As part of this effort, we acquired 107 million shares at an average cost of AUD 4.22 or approximately USD 290 million. We now own 16.9% of Domain's outstanding shares, are in the process of performing due diligence and recently received a 2-week extension to complete our due diligence by May 12.\nFor the full year of 2025, we expect revenue of $3.115 billion to $3.155 billion, implying an annual growth rate of 14% to 15%. This forecast is broadly in line with our original 2025 guidance and includes a 4 to 5 percentage point contribution from the Matterport acquisition. Second quarter 2025 revenue is expected in the $770 million to $775 million range, representing 14% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.\n2025 adjusted EBITDA is now expected in the range of $355 million to $385 million, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 12%. The inclusion of Matterport is anticipated to reduce our adjusted 2025 EBITDA forecast by approximately $30 million. So excluding Matterport, we remain broadly in line to slightly above our original 2025 guidance. Second quarter 2025 adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be $50 million to $60 million, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of around 7%.\nWith that, I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

Welcome to the Q4 2024 CoStar Group Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Rich Simonelli, Head of Investor Relations.\n\nRichard Simonelli\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nHello, and thank you very much for joining us today to discuss the fourth quarter 2024 and full year 2024 results for the CoStar Group. Before I turn the call over to Andy Florance, CoStar's CEO and Founder; and Chris Lown, our CFO. I would like to review our safe harbor statement.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being webcast. Please refer to today's press release on how to access the replay of this call. remember just one call for person. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance.\n\nAndrew C. Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nAgain, thank you for joining CoStar Group's Fourth Quarter and Year-end Earnings Call. We achieved another very strong quarter of financial results with 2024 full year revenue and adjusted EBITDA exceeding consensus and the high end of our guidance range. Revenue for the full year of 2024 was $2.74 billion, an increase of 11% over the full year of 2023 as we delivered our 55th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. For the fourth quarter of 2024, revenue was $709 million, an 11% increase year-over-year. We continue to generate profit while we are investing aggressively back into the business to create powerful future growth drivers, such as Homes.com.\nFor the full year, our commercial information and marketplace businesses achieved a very strong 43% profit margin for CoStar Group, net income EBIT and adjusted EBITDA significantly improved each quarter in 2024. We grew net income from $7 million in the first quarter of '24 to $60 million in the fourth quarter. We increased EBITDA from negative $13 million in the first quarter to $73 million in the fourth quarter. We grew adjusted EBITDA from $12 million in the first quarter to $112 million in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA of $112 million in the fourth quarter was well ahead of our guidance range of $76 million to $86 million. Our average monthly unique visitors to our global websites increased 17% year-over-year to $134 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to Google Analytics.\nCompany net new bookings were $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 21% sequentially from the third quarter of 2024. We Net bookings are increasing because our sales forces are now optimized and back to selling their respective core product offerings. When we launched Homes.com sales just 12 months ago, we only had 41 Homes.com sales professionals to prospect over 1 million real estate agents. To backstop this very small team, we temporarily tested all of our sales forces to sell Homes.com. We no longer need to do that because over the past year, we've grown the Homes.com sales force nearly sixfold to 277 salespeople.\nWe anticipating having -- we anticipate having 500 home salespeople by year-end 2025. And the dedicated home salespeople understand the significant value proposition Homes.com offers well. So they sell more, service more effectively, earn much higher NPS scores and renew the business at much higher rates. From all perspectives, having [ COMPS ] expert cell homes.com CoStar Expert sell CoStar and apartments experts sell Apartments.com yields higher net bookings. Our CoStar product achieved $1.2 billion -- $1.2 billion in revenue in 2024, with a growth rate of 10% year-over-year. CoStar continues to be the preeminent source of information analytics for the industry. During the worst commercial real estate market in our lifetime, we have grown revenue, adjusted prices for inflation, and launch innovative, valuable new products and features like lender and hospitality benchmarking.\nWith the full CoStar sales teams focused on selling CoStar December 2024 and was the highest month of net bookings for CoStar in almost 2 years. Q4 2024 net new bookings were the highest since Q3 of 2023. We are pleased to report accelerating CoStar sales in the year as we cross $1 billion in CoStar revenue. The CoStar subscriber base has grown to over 240,000. Our renewal rates are very strong at 92%. We monitor our Net Promoter Scores closely to continually improve our service offering and maintain high renewal rates. Over the past 3 years, our U.S. CoStar NPS has improved 10% to 65. Our Canadian CoStar NPS has improved 25% to 60.\nMost notably, our U.K. CoStar NPS has improved 35% to 65%. That's really remarkable improvement there. The U.K. CoStar team's significant success in achieving high NPS scores might have led to our primary U.K. competitors, EG's recent announcement that they were withdrawing all their products and services from the U.K. in 2025. Each year, State Gazette was founded 166 years ago an 1858 during Queen Victoria's rain and before Abraham Lincoln became President. CoStar has competed against EG and its various companies since we acquired Focus in the U.K. in 2004. We first began competing with them. They were primarily a weekly commercial property news magazine, stuffed with hundreds of high-paying property ads, but they launched an online commercial property service.\nEG has also launched an online marketing service called EG Property Link that compete with LoopNet. As CoStar gained leading share in the U.K., EG merged their information offering into a brokerage affiliated consortium called Radius. EG was owned by the information giant RELX. In their announcement, they cited irreparable impact of headwinds that have struck the whole of commercial real estate industry hard. I'd like to believe that to some degree, the quality of research field research service and technology that our team provides played some competitive role. RELX may have sold or may in the future sell elements to discontinued businesses to other companies. is with respect that we acknowledge the hard work contribution achievements of one of the U.K.'s leading commercial property and information sources over 166 years. It's our competitors that motivate us to be the best we can be.\nObviously, the Seri economy has created strong headwinds for CoStar over the last 4 years as well, but I believe those headwinds may shift to tailwinds. I believe that the Seri economy has passed its nature and is moving into what may be a very strong recovery. Demand and absorption for office space turned meaningfully positive at the end of 2024 for the first time since 2021. Availability rates are falling total available space is declining. Sublet vacancy rates are falling, sublet rents are climbing. The new construction pipeline is shut off and net supply after depreciation and obsolescence is contracting. The economy is strong and resilient. We read stories about major corporations mandating 5 days a week in the office and then the observation that there's not enough space for the company in their offices to allow everyone to return to work.\nIn the first quarters of the pandemic office owner steeply discounted prime office space and leased it to tenants who normally have a second-generation budget. I believe that we could see very strong rent growth in the years ahead with capital appreciation. We are already seeing sales transactions return to pre-pandemic levels and cap rates are rolling over their peaks. I've managed CoStar through 4 economic cycles or 4 real estate cycles. And every time the world is certainly the office sector will never again regain its value. And yet every time the correction over the shoots in the office economy roars back. CoStar and our clients may enjoy tailwinds in the next few years. The CoStar for Lenders product continued to gain momentum this past quarter. Q4 was our best quarter for the year with $1.7 million of net new annual revenue in December across 17 institutions, bringing total annual revenue to $75 million, including risk analytics.\nWe now have signed up 370 institutions of all sizes and types, who collectively manage over $1 trillion of CRE debt, reinforcing our role as a key solution in the industry. Clients have been actively uploading portfolios over the last 2 years, further validating our long-term adoption stickiness and the depth of our platform's integration into our clients' lending cycles. Additionally, we're seeing a growing number of clients transitioning from their initial CECL or current expected credit loss and stress test solutions to ours. A clear sign that our platform is outperforming alternatives and capturing market share in a regulatory-driven segment.\nDespite a challenging high interest rate environment and cautious lending landscape over the past couple of years, we had continued to demonstrate consistent revenue growth in our lender solution. Corporate real estate departments are increasingly subscribing to CoStar as well to manage their costs find the best spaces to support their operations and efficiently renew their leases. These corporations already rely on brokers who are very often using CoStar. But increasingly, corporate users want direct access to CoStar as well to support a faster velocity and analysis and decision-making. New corporate subscribers to CoStar this year include great brands like Amazon, Visa, Ecolab, Macy's, Church's, UnitedHealthcare, Cracker Barrel, Cisco, Edward Jones, Salesforce Sherwin-Williams, LG and many others. CoStar Group leases announced more than 1 million square feet of real estate across dozens and dozens of locations, and our facility staff as well use CoStar daily and find it indispensable. Despite it being some of the most important information owners and tenants need.\nHistorically, accessing accurate and useful rent information has been very problematic and difficult in CRE. Rents are quoted a myriad of ways with numerous modifiers and inclusions and exclusions that can completely change the meaning of the numbers. Often, the details of individual lease deals are closely guarded. We have begun the integration of CoStar Real Estate Manager and our newly acquired operation visual lease, managing more than 1 million leases for thousands of major corporations. These two companies are leaders in lease accounting, lease management and transaction management. Our intention is to build the next generation in corporate real estate digital solutions by integrating these two products with CoStar and empowering our clients with the anonymized aggregated information we and this community of corporates can bring together.\nJust as CoStar STR aggregates and anonymizes the confidential pricing and occupancy information for the world's major hotels and creates in invaluable, accurate and precise hospitality revenue information that, that industry relies on, we intend to do the same thing for corporate real estate. This would empower decision-makers to quickly evaluate potential transactions and understand if they're reasonable in the marketplace. Corporate occupiers with hundreds or even thousands of leases renewing in a quarter a year would have very good visibility into how new rent levels would increase or reduce their cost on renewal. Within CoStar, users would be able to access very precise rent levels by geography, segment and quality, empowering them to make better informed leasing, valuation, lending, transaction development and investment decisions.\nBuilding this next-generation corporate real estate solution and the associated rent indices is one of our top priorities for CoStar in 2025. We believe that the total addressable revenue opportunity for CoStar is enormous and that this initiative will help us recognize more of that huge TAM sooner. We continue to make good progress on building CoStar in Europe and particularly in France for the top markets there, and we expect to release CoStar France by year-end 2025. We intend to grow the CoStar sales team by 20% this year. Turning to LoopNet. It's the most heavily trafficked marketplace for commercial real estate in the United States and one of the most effective ways to market commercial real estate. We believe that it has more than $1 billion TAM in the U.S. alone.\nIn 2025, one of our primary objectives is to move the asset-based pricing move to asset-based pricing, where the price to market high-value properties is greater than the price to market lower-value properties. We have begun renewing contracts on this basis and for the first cohort of contracts that received price increases, 98% have renewed at the significant price list. We believe that we can expand the volume of properties market on LoopNet by lowering the price point for some properties for which the current one-size-fits-all pricing is not affordable. We are shifting our sales force's emphasis from selling a few higher-priced depth advertisements to selling higher volumes of asset-based priced advertisements. While we will continue to sell the higher tier ads, we believe that we will generate significantly more revenue growth by selling a higher mix of the silver basic tier ads that renew at a very high level.\nAlong with crossing the $1 billion revenue mark in 2024, Apartments.com turned in a very strong fourth quarter. Revenue was $276 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. Our multifamily revenue is subscription-based with outstanding customer satisfaction with NPS scores of 94 or average NPS score of 94 and very high renewal rates in the '90s with a monthly renewal rate of 99%. In 2024, we reached 90% of renters and all of our prospects and clients through almost every marketing channel. In 2025, we expect to deliver 13 billion impressions across TV, streaming video, podcasts, social media and influencers, direct digital paid search and display. We'll be launching 5 new advertising spots for Apartments.com with Jeff Goldblum. Our marketing campaign continues to deliver with top programming venues.\nIn March, you'll see us all over March madness. Our unmatched retargeting program creates 1 billion annual impressions and 1.4 million leads. Apartments.com continues to be the industry leader across many key metrics. We have set the standard in multifamily for high-quality leads and a strong in-person sales force. Apartment owners Apartments.com as #1 in the metric that matters most to them delivering leases. In 2024, according to Entrada, we produced 1.5x more leases than all of our competitors combined. Most importantly, Apartments.com delivered 3x the number of leads that convert to leases compared to our competitors.\nSo with the most leads and the best conversion rate, we delivered 4.8x more leases than other rental networks. We dominate apartment search engine results and are #1 in organic search for the term apartments. We are also #1 in paid search with 1.8x more than all the competitors combined. We had 35 million average monthly unique visitors in the fourth quarter for our Apartments.com network. Similar Web reported that Apartments.com had the most visitors in 2024 and more than Zillow and rent.com combined. The Apartments.com network delivered by far the most visits in the industry with $920 million in 2024. With consumers, we have dominated brand awareness with 2 out of 3 apartment seekers saying they will use Apartments.com. That is nearly double Zillow and 5x more than rent.com. We have higher brand awareness than Zillow and Rent.com combined among apartment seekers.\nWe continue to add new customers with properties of all unit counts to our marketplace at a rapid pace with more than 75,000 paying apartment communities on our network, up 7% year-over-year. This includes more than 10,000 in the 5- to 49 unit range. Business to our House condo and townhouse pages increased 25% year-over-year and 32% in Q4 2024 over the prior year. We increased the number of single-family rental listings by 26% over $3 million year-over-year or over $3 million, not year-over-year. In 2024, paid single-family rental listings increased 59% year-over-year to 323,600 and with a number of independent rental owners using Apartment.com climbing to 13% to 244,000. For the year, we processed nearly $5 billion in rental payments or just over $5 billion in rental payments.\nIn a little over a year, we are already #1 in traffic in Canada, our newest Apartments.com market which demonstrates the success we can have extending a brand from one market -- one country to another. There's still a lot of room to grow this business. We see $2.6 billion of opportunity in the 20-unit plus buildings and above, and there is much more opportunity below 20 units. We believe there is more than a $9 billion TAM in multifamily. We intend to grow the Apartment.com sales force headcount, 23% in 2025 and to keep up with the potential of the site. Last week, Redfin announced an agreement to transfer basically the guts of the apartments Redfin portal business to Zillow. Redfin acquired RentPath, the parent company of rent.com, an apartment guide for $608 million in February of 2021.\nRedfin was able to purchase RentPath after the FTC blocked our $588 million purchase after RentPath had gone bankrupt. On the day Redfin purchased RentPath, its stock was trading at 98 a share. And since that date, their stock is dropped precipitously down 91% to $8.87 a share at yesterday's close. I think it's safe to say that Rent.com has not performed well under Redfin. So probably good that it's moving on. While the announcement called the deal of partnership, I believe it's effectively a sale of the asset that attempts to avoid FTC regulatory review. I find it hard to believe the FTC will ultimately surrender the authority to investigate the potential loss of competition that this deal appears to achieve.\nWe believe that if present to the FTC as a transaction, the FTC would obviously block such a deal. As part of the deal, Zillow pays Redfin $100 million upfront. Redfit terminates 450 of the vast -- or Redfin will be terminating 450 or the vast majority of the Rent.com staff, and Redfin will attempt to transfer its apartment property management clients to Zillow. Effectively going forward, Rent.com will no longer operate as a normal independent competing website, but rather will only operate as a shell syndication site sending leads to Zillow. We do not know the terms and costs of the lease syndication deal, but I would not be surprised if still Ultimate has to pay Redfin hundreds of millions, if not $1 billion for what we see as relatively low converting leads. This would not sound like an attractive transaction.\nCertainly, apartment property managers will have less choice now. We see a large opportunity to win away many of the properties formerly market on rent.com without paying Redfinancial a mass sum of money. It feels like Jump ball on the former Redfin clients, and our Page [indiscernible] team are quite tall. We launched the new Homes.com just 1 year ago during Super Bowl 58. At [ Russel's ] same time, we acquired the residential portal on the market in the U.K. and relaunched it as well. In just 1 year, we've made tremendous progress towards our goal of providing the leading residential real estate portals and monetizing a new multi-billion dollar TAM opportunity for CoStar Group.\nIn less than 1 year, the Homes.com network became the second largest real estate portal in the United States based on traffic with an audience of $110 million average monthly unique visitors in the fourth quarter, according to Google Analytics. 110 million unique visitors is nearly double realtor.com's 62 million average monthly unique visitors that News Corp reported for the same quarter recently. I think that's remarkable. Realtor.com launched 30 years ago in its predecessor form back in 1995, and we passed the [indiscernible] traffic in our first year of the relaunch. We began the year with our low single-digit unaided awareness. And during the year, built and grew that awareness number to as high as 33%. As we complete our second successful Super Bowl campaign and launch our 2025 campaign, I believe that we can reach 50% unaided awareness this year potentially surpassing in 2 years with our competitors spent 30 years building.\nWe began last year with 41 Homes.com salespeople, and today, we have 275. With job offers outstanding, we are forecasting an additional 50 hires in March alone. Our goal is to have 500 Homes.com salespeople in place by the end of the year and productive. Achieving that goal, our Homes.com sales force will go from basically not existing last year to being one of our largest sales teams in just 2 years. Despite that, the fact is the entire team is literally rookies, but they're selling effectively. During Q4, the team in production sold on average 1,742 net new monthly revenue. As the denominator grew dramatically coming into January with more new head count, the January number remains strong at 1,636 net new per month.\nIn January, the dedicated home sales team sold $3.3 million in annualized net revenue based upon that group's sales and their cancels. I expect that as the team both grows and becomes more experienced, that the sales numbers will increase significantly. The Dedicated home sales team is significantly more effective at servicing our new clients, achieving good net new promoter scores and renewing business then was the stop gap broader sales effort we put in, in the beginning of the year on adhoc basis.\nWe launched the new Homes.com memberships last year I believe we offered a better value proposition than did the legacy residential portals, but it required educating real estate agents accustomed to buying agency leads for 30 years, and we need to educate them to the fact that we were selling solutions to win more seller listings. Simply put, Homes.com provides a unique Internet marketing solution that helps agents sell the home they were hired to sell faster and for more money, making them better listing agents. Because they can show prospective homebuyers that they have a superior selling solution, they should be hired more often.\nIn contrast, the legacy solutions in the past 30 years sell agents leads that really belong to competing agents. Our model is used by 95% of the real estate portals around the world and is associated with profitable real estate portals. And that stands in contrast to the legacy U.S. portals, which are really in the minority with the lead diversion model and has struggled with profitability. When we first launched, many agents thought that we were just like the legacy portals so selling them leads that belong to competing agents. So initially, we had negative NPS scores that need improvement. As we built a dedicated Homes.com sales team just focused on selling and servicing residential agents, they did a much better job communicating our superior value proposition.\nOur NPS scores have climbed dramatically throughout the year. When the broader sales force first began selling last year, our NPS was negative 40. But by January, our dedicated home sales team is achieving an average NPS score of 28, which is in the good category and 2 points away from the great category. At CoStar Group, we're accustomed to consistently achieving great and excellent NPS scores, but brand-new products do not launch it excellent. When apartments first launched the NPS scores were 10 and now at dilators I mentioned, the average 94. Homes.com MPS, climbed 68 points in just 1 year. I want to congratulate the team on that achievement. It's an incredible accomplishment. We already have many of our Homes.com sales reps earning excellent MPS scores at 80 and above. Our goal is to get everyone up in that range. We expect that higher NPS scores will drive higher renewal rates and drive additional sales through referrals.\nWhen we relaunched an all-new Homes.com site 1 year ago, I felt we offered one of the best search experiences for buying or selling a home. While I was extremely proud to work with exceptional development product teams on such a successful launch. I am even more proud by how much those teams have accomplished in the first 12 months after that great initial launch. At our sales conference a week or so ago, I walked through over 110 new important features our teams added to the product across 2024. The features are too numerous to detail but include innovative valuation tools, lead verification, search by commuting distance, visualization layers to assess crime, schools, renters, owners residential and adding residential news and much, much more.\nWhen I look at the product road map in the year ahead, I believe it's the most innovative work that I've ever seen in my career by a wide margin. I feel that everyone in the Homes.com product and development team is excited to be working on one of the most effective, innovative and exceptional development teams anywhere in any industry. There are 3 major initiatives for Homes.com in 2025 that we believe will add new revenue streams to Homes.com. Our U.K. residential real estate portal on the market also achieved significant growth in our first year running it. In just 1 year, we've grown the number of advertisers 23% and the number of properties listed by over 40%. Our marketing investment has led to an increase in total visits by 75%, which in turn generated 42% more leads for agents.\nAs a result, on the market has seen 8 consecutive months of net new revenue growth. Last week, launched the new Homes.com second year with 2 -- we launched the new year, year 2, with 2 new Super Bowl ads. I was proud that Adweek raised our ads as #2 in Super Bowl ad ranking this year. We believe that homes.com is now the best site for hub shoppers, sellers, agents and brokers. Homes.com has a clean spam free design, more content than other sites have, robust and growing product functionality and most importantly, a better business model in which all the parties can be aligned. We want to let the world know that homes.com is the best, but our attorneys say we cannot legally say that.\nSo we built an ad campaign trying to say that we are the best, but not doing it in line with our reality. This year, our two 30-second Super Bowl ads featured Morgan Freeman, Dan Levy and Heidi Gartner. When Morgan Freeman tries to say Homes.com is the best. It sounds like the voice of God. Overall, our marketing campaign for Homes.com continues to deliver strong results. In 2024 we delivered nearly 19 million impressions with nearly 3 billion impressions in Q4. In 2024, we ran more than 47,000 commercials, including spots and high-profile media like the Olympics, the World Series, College Football, the NFL, the Grammys, the Emmys and across primetime TV and streaming video like Netflix, Disney, Paramount, YouTube and ESPN. We are also advertising on streaming audio partners like iHeartRadio, Spotify, Pandora and Amazon Music, including podcasts like Freakonomics, Mad Money and Conan O'Brien.\nWe are all over social media with millions of impressions on Meta, Pinterest, Reddit and Tiktok tack and whatnot. 90% of Americans have likely seen Homes.com adds. We believe that we have built the best site for buying and selling a home. Our members are gaining dramatically more exposure for their sellers on Homes.com. They're listing sell faster and for more money on average. And because our members offer superior marketing solution, they're winning 58% more listings. We had a great first year for Homes.com and we're building phenomenal momentum to create the leading site for buying and selling homes. I believe that we can win major share grow a third $1 billion business and generate substantial long-term EBITDA value for our shareholders.\nA quick update on Matterport. CoStar and Matterport have each certified substantial compliance with the FTC's second request and continue to work cooperatively with the FTC review of CoStar's pending Matterport acquisition. We believe we're on track for the deal to close in the first quarter. One of our main investments in 2025, we probably picked up will be growing our sales force. We plan to grow the sales force from 1,390 at December 2024 to reach 1,890 by December 2025. Adding approximately 500 salespeople will grow our sales force by 35%, and we believe bring significant revenue growth potential or incremental additional revenue growth potential to a great business.\nAt this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Chris, our CFO.\n\nChristian M. Lown\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Navient Corporation\n\nThank you, Andy. Full year 2024 revenue grew 11% versus the prior year. Coming in ahead of consensus and above the high end of our revenue guidance range. Full year adjusted EBITDA in 2024 came in above expectations at $241 million and a 9% margin also exceeding consensus on the high end of our guidance range. Our commercial information and marketplace brands delivered 43% profit margins for 2024 and proving the underlying strength of the commercial product portfolio as we continue to invest in our residential and international strategy.\nCoStar revenue grew 10% in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2024, in line with our guidance. As mentioned on previous calls, CoStar revenue was positively impacted by the integration of the STR benchmarking into our CoStar platform. This integration resulted in approximately 4 percentage points of CoStar revenue growth in 2024. For Q1 2025, we expect revenue growth of 6% as STR has now been integrated into CoStar, and we expect 6% to 7% growth for the full year as we continue to manage through the challenging CRE markets. Apartments.com revenue grew by $153 million or 17% year-over-year in 2024, in line with our expectations and in line with Apartments.com's 5-year revenue CAGR.\nWe expect Apartment.com revenue growth of 11% to 12% for the full year of 2025, and we are forecasting 11% revenue growth for the first quarter. Our moderating growth rate in 2025 reflects the increased scale of Apartments.com and the impact of Apartments.com sales reps supporting both our commercial brand as well as the launch of Homes.com in 2024. We believe the expansion of our Apartments.com sales force throughout 2025 should bolster growth as we continue to penetrate the significant untapped TAMs.\nLoopNet revenue grew 5% in the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year of 2024, in line with our guidance. We expect that in the first quarter of 2025 and for the full year of 2025, LoopNet revenue growth will be in the mid-single digits, consistent with 2024 growth. Revenue from information services was $37 million in the fourth quarter and $136 million for the full year of 2024. We expect Information Services revenue growth for 2025 to be in the range of 18% to 20%, with visual lease contributing approximately $40 million of revenue. Revenue growth for the first quarter of 2025 is expected to be in the high teens to low 20% range.\nOther marketplaces revenue was $36 million for the fourth quarter and $130 million for the full year 2024. We expect revenue growth for 2025 in the mid- to high single digits and first quarter revenue slightly below $30 million. We expect 10x transaction volumes to ramp through 2025 and in line with an expected improvement in overall CRE transaction volumes. Residential revenue was $28 million in the fourth quarter and $101 million for the full year of 2024. Our 2025 residential revenue growth outlook is in the high teens to low 20s percent range, and we expect first quarter revenue growth of approximately 40%.\nFor CoStar Group, Net income was $60 million for the fourth quarter and $139 million for the full year of 2024. We earned $213 million of net investment income on our $4.7 billion in cash in 2024 and or a 5.5% net yield. Our sales force totaled 1,390 people at the end of 2021, with the majority of the increase concentrated in our Homes.com residential business. We expect to have over 500 sales reps for Homes.com by the end of 2025. Due to the large untapped total addressable market in the commercial real estate and apartment markets, we are also expanding the sales force of CoStar apartments and LoopNet to capture that opportunity. Our contract renewal rate was 89% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and remains strong at 94% of customers who have been subscribers for 5 years or longer.\nSubscription revenue on annual contracts was 80% for the fourth quarter of 2024. Net new bookings for the fourth quarter was $53 million, representing a sequential increase of 21% from the third quarter of 2024. We expect net new bookings in 2025 to be higher than 2024, and as a result of our sales forces refocused on their respective businesses, a significant increase in dedicated Homes.com sales reps compared to the first quarter of 2024, increased sales forces in our other commercial businesses and improving market conditions in commercial real estate.\nIn 2025, we are also announcing a share buyback program of $500 million. We expect to execute $150 million of share repurchase annually which will more than offset annual noncash based compensation. Looking ahead to 2025, we expect full year revenue of $2.95 billion to $3.05 billion implying an annual growth rate of 9% to 10%. First quarter 2025 revenue is expected to range from $711 million to $716 million, representing revenue growth of 9% year-over-year at the midpoint. 2025 adjusted EBITDA is expected in the range of $375 million to $405 million, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 13%. The first quarter 2025 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $25 million to $35 million.\nOur level of capital expenditures is expected to range from $400 million to $450 million in 2025 and with roughly $360 million of that total spend for our Richmond campus, which we expect to be substantially completed in the first half of 2026. The Operating capital apart from the Richmond campus is expected to be in the $90 million range, an increase over prior years, primarily due to our planned CapEx for Arlington, Virginia headquarters. Our forecast for net interest income is approximately $170 million for 2025, taking into account our increased capital spend and possible interest rate reductions in the year ahead. This figure does not account for any M&A activity.\nFinally, we are withdrawing our 5-year revenue and EBITDA targets that we set back in February 2022. When we provided this guidance, we could not unforeseen the unprecedented long-lasting downturn in the commercial and residential businesses over these several years. However, looking ahead, we continue to see significant growth opportunities in our core products. For CoStar Suite, the significant untapped TAMs, the inclusion of STR, the continued rollout and penetration of the lender product expansion into Europe in 2025 and 2026 and additional in-development products, we've lost optimistic that CoStar will see double-digit growth again once we are through the RE malaise.\nIn Apartments.com, we expect to continue to see low to mid-double-digit growth over the coming years, given the $2.6 billion TAM in 20 unit plus buildings and much more than that in the TAM for 1 to 19 unit buildings. These opportunities remain underpenetrated, and we are optimistic we will capture the lion's share of that opportunity as we continue to invest in the platform and deliver best-in-class metrics and service to help our customers achieve their objectives.\nWith the relatively new head of LoopNet and brand new head of LoopNet sales, we expect LoopNet to again deliver double-digit growth in the future on the back of an expanded footprint and revised pricing strategy. Even in light of its growth from approximately $50 million when we acquired the company to nearly $300 million today, we expect this division to return to double-digit growth as we take advantage of these opportunities. With regard to our other businesses, like real estate manager and Visual lease, Landcom and BizBuySell, we believe these properties have long-term double-digit growth opportunities.\nFinally, given the meaningful industry changes in the residential real estate market, we remain enthusiastic about Homes.com as we continue to scale this platform to monetize what could be one of CoStar's largest businesses. As we increase our dedicated sales force through 2025, we expect revenue to increase in line with that growth, which will pay dividends from 2026 and beyond, delivering strong double-digit growth. In summary, I'm proud of our 2024 results delivered during a year of complicated by high interest rates, inflation and economic volatility. We remain focused on our strategic investments in the commercial and residential markets while producing record profit levels in our established commercial businesses.\nWith that, I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

Welcome to the Q2 2024 CoStar Group Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand it over to the Head of Investor Relations, Cyndi Eakin. Please proceed.\n\nCyndi Eakin\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations & Controller\n\nThank you, Carmen. Good evening, and thank you all for joining us to discuss the second quarter 2024 results of the CoStar Group. Before I turn the call over to Andy Florance, CoStar's CEO and Founder; and Chris Lown, our CFO, I would like to review our safe harbor statement.\nCertain portions of the discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook and expectations for the third quarter and full year 2024 based on current beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements involve many risks, uncertainties, assumptions, estimates and other factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements.\nImportant factors that can cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those stated in CoStar Group's press release issued earlier today and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the heading Risk Factors.\nAll forward-looking statements are based on the information available to CoStar on the date of this call. CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of any non-GAAP financial measure discussed on this call are shown in detail in our press release issued today, along with the definitions for those terms. The press release is available on our website located at costargroup.com under Press Room.\nAs a reminder, today's conference call is being webcast, and the link is also available on our website under Investors. Please refer to today's press release on how to access the replay of this call.\nAnd with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florence.\n\nAndrew C. Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Cyndi. Cyndi, I would note that, that was the most upbeat reading of the preamble I've heard ever, which suggests to me that you are looking forward to turning over your duties. .\nSo good evening, and thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's second quarter earnings call. Second quarter 2024 revenue was $678 million, a 12% increase year-over-year, coming in above the midpoint of our guidance range and in line with consensus estimates. Our $2 billion businesses continue to deliver double-digit year-over-year revenue growth with Apartments.com growing 18% and CoStar growing 10%.\nCompany net new bookings were $67 million in the second quarter with 79% of our net new bookings coming from sales of our commercial real estate products and 21% from net new bookings of Homes.com memberships. Adjusted EBITDA was $41 million, which was well ahead of our guidance of $5 million to $10 million and consensus estimates of $10 million.\nOur commercial margins remained strong, delivering over 40% in the quarter and are expected to expand throughout the remainder of the year. Our average monthly unique visitors to our global websites reached a record of 183 million in the second quarter, according to Google Analytics, which is up 81% over the prior year.\nThe Homes.com network delivered 148 million average monthly unique visitors for the second quarter, according to Google Analytics, which was an increase of 73% over the same quarter last year. Our Homes.com site alone delivered 99 million average monthly unique visitors for the quarter, an increase of 197% -- make you get -- 197% over the same quarter a year ago according to Google Analytics.\nWe believe that complete site-centric census style tool, like Google Analytics is more accurate than user-centric panel estimate counts generated by firms such as ComScore or SEMrush. I believe tools like Google Analytics are like an election result, whereas a tool like SEMrush or ComScore is more like an election poll. If I have the election results, I choose to report those rather than the sample poll result.\nOur leading competitors in the U.S. residential portal space combined and report traffic associated with home sales, home rentals, rural homes, land sales and apartment rentals in their traffic numbers. For that reason, I believe the most accurate and best apples-to-apples comparison is comparing the traffic from our homes network of sites to the reported traffic of these 3 leading competitors.\nOur Homes.com network includes our sites with home sales, home rentals, rural homes, land sales and apartment rentals. The most recent reported traffic numbers we have for the leading residential portal competitors is from their first quarter results, so the comparison is not perfect.\nOur reported homes.com network traffic of 148 million average monthly unique visitors for the second quarter is fast approaching Zillow's first quarter report traffic of 217 million average monthly unique visitors. The Homes network now has solidly lapped Realtors reported first quarter 70 million average monthly unique visitors and has thrice lapped, Redfin's reported first quarter 49 million monthly unique visitors.\nThese solid traffic numbers far exceed our traffic performance expectation for this early in the development of the new Homes.com. The second quarter was our first full quarter of selling Homes.com memberships. And since mid-February, we have sold over $55 million in net new bookings. The first 4 full months selling Homes.com far exceeds the launch sales pace of any of our prior product launches. By comparison, it took 2 years after launch of Apartments.com to accumulate the level of net new bookings that Home has achieved in its first full 4 months of sales.\nThe solid bookings numbers are exceptional for this early in development of the new Homes.com. We now have 10,200 member agents on the platform and 86% are on 12-month contracts.\nMarketing efforts continue to be successful, delivering almost 10 billion consumer impressions and 21,000 commercial placements since we launched the product. This across broadcast, cable TV, streaming audio and video, digital and social media and high-profile sponsorships.\nUnaided brand awareness continues to increase and is now at 27%, and -- up from our prelaunch baseline of 4%. Over the past month or so, I attended focus groups with agents and consumers in Atlanta, Chicago, Irvine and Nashville. Our growth in unaided awareness was clear. Agents reiterate that they prefer our business model of Your Listing Our Lead -- \"your listing, your lead, \"definitely, \"your listing, your lead. \"\nWe have more work to do to make them aware of that preferred business model, and we'll do that work. In each session, the moderator asked agents and consumers to spend a few minutes using the Homes.com site. The response was fantastic. The overwhelming majority of participants said that Homes.com is the better home search site than competing sites. Common themes with the site is clean, it's beautiful, ad-free, has more information than other sites have, has all the information you need in 1 spot and participants like that the listing agent is clearly visible is not obscured and a listing agent who knows the most about the property can be readily reached to ask quick and simple questions of.\nAgents responded very well to our value proposition, and -- 2 agents really stood out to me as they raved about how much value they were getting from their Homes.com membership. They said that they were using the advantages Homes.com membership offered to win more exclusive listings. So I'd like to quote 1 Chicago participant named Laura. She said, a couple of months ago, I became a premier agent on Homes.com. My listing that used to get 6,000, 7,000, 8,000, 9,000, 10,000 views, I now get like 2 million views on my listings. And it's a listing tool she went on to say so that she can then say the seller, well, go up and look up Orland Park, and I'll show up first if I've got a listing there.\nAnd so then as she goes on to say, I say to the seller, my listing has 2 million views. Look at every other one after that, and they've got like 3,000, 4,000 views and I've got 2 million views. I'm like hashtag winning. She goes on to say, it's a listing tool. So when a seller asks what are you going to do differently than everyone's else, most people will be saying the same things. And then I can say, \"Oh, Homes.com pull up a neighborhood and I show up first. \"\nBecca, an agent from California said something similar. She said, Homes.com has been great for me as a listing agent. I've had -- I'm having calls directly on my listings. I have a paid subscription where it puts my information in front of buyers who are calling me directly. In my actual listing presentation, she goes on to say, \"I do have marketing information about getting 60x more views on my listings since I'm a pro member on Homes.com and I think that has helped me secure listings. \" This was the first platform she says that I had enough confidence in that I actually paid for a Pro membership.\nAnother agent from Columbia, South Carolina said, within 2 days of signing up for my Homes.com membership, I secured a new listing that went under contract less than a week. Another agent from Spokane, Washington said, \"since I've joined Homes.com I've watched the amount of traffic on my listening increased 30x to 40x compared to us getting anywhere else. \"\nWe built an analysis, actually Terry Rogers and team built an analysis to understand the advantage member agents were having in winning new listings as compared to nonmember agents. We create cohorts of members based upon the city, tier size they're in, the number of listings they had at the beginning of the study period and the average list price of their listings.\nWe compared members new listing win count to nonmembers wins for each month from March through June. This created a total of 192 cohorts -- 192 cohorts. On average, members won 51% more new listings than did nonmembers. More importantly to me, in 95% of the 192 cohorts members outperformed nonmember agents. This is very important and the core point.\nWinning new listings is a primary objective for real estate agents. We believe that the evidence is overwhelming that our product is enabling agents to achieve that core goal. We believe that the potential ROI for member agents is phenomenal. The average agent is getting 17 million annualized impressions for their listing and profile on Homes.com. Member listings get 46x more exposure on average than nonmember listings.\nAnother analysis we ran indicated that on average, member agents are 20% more likely to sell the home in the first 10 days than nonmembers and members are getting on average $11,000 more for a home. That second analysis will vary from time to time, but multiple analyses have each shown a benefit for members over nonmembers in selling homes.\nSo in summary, I believe the product is a winner. As of today, we've only demoed approximately 3.5% of residential agents. Building a dedicated Homes.com sales team is the key driver to future Homes.com revenue growth. We have 63 dedicated Homes.com salespeople in production that I can see. We have an additional 53 in training and another 30 hired.\nWe have been borrowing resources from our Apartments.com, CoStar LoopNet and other sales teams to supplement the Homes.com sales team, but those borrowed sales resources will inevitably return to selling their core products as they should. Growing the Homes.com sales force must be our top priority.\nOn the market, our U.K. residential real estate portal is making great progress. Listings on the platform are now up to 716,000, an increase of 41% from June of 2023. Average monthly visits for the month of June were 35 million up 78% compared to June 2023, and average monthly unique visitors were up to 18 million in June or an increase of 118% over June 2023. The according to Google Analytics.\nLead counts are up 50% over the second quarter of last year and the sales results are looking good. A recent article from a site publication called the Negotiator, said that a leading lead management platform has found that OnTheMarket has now overtaken Zoopla for engaged inquiries.\nApartments.com continued its positive momentum with another strong quarter. Revenue was $264 million for the second quarter of 2024, and -- representing 18% growth over the same period a year ago. We continue to add new customers with rentals of all sizes to our marketplace at a rapid pace and now have almost 76,000 paying communities on our network.\nIn June, we had a record number of single-family rental listings represent an increase of 108% over the prior year. Single-family rental listings have boosted lead count by more than 4x our Homes.com membership agents.\nOur mid-market efforts are contributing thousands of new properties, growing paid subscribers by almost 22% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. New construction is also contributing to subscriber growth with 75% of all new 100-plus unit communities advertising with Apartments.com. That's a great stat.\nOur sales team continues to deliver exceptional results and extremely high engagement with our clients and prospects. During the quarter, Page's team conducted over 187,000 quality meetings, which is an increase of 23% compared to the second quarter of last year. Our second quarter Net Promoter Score of 94 continues to lead the industry or just about any industry, which is a testament to the quality of the sales team and their service.\nWe continue to outperform our competitors and lead quality and conversion. In the second quarter, Market Connections, a third-party market research firm conducted a survey of industry decision-makers responsible for 18,000 communities with over 1.5 million units under management. Apartments.com continues to lead all the metrics that matter to most -- matter most to multifamily owners and property managers. We're #1 in advertiser usage and deliver the highest quality leads. We continue to have the highest lead-to-lease conversion rate, significantly outperforming our next closest competitor in every 1 of these 3 metrics.\nOur 2024 Apartments.com marketing campaign featuring Jeff Goldblum as Brad Bellflower, the inventor of the Apartminternet is in full swing again. We are reaching renters across all media channels during peak rental season and generating over 2.1 billion media impressions. This year, we launched a dedicated landlord campaign to generate awareness with landlords owning 1 to 4 rental properties and have generated almost 500 million brand media impressions to date.\nAs a result of our continued investment and success our unaided brand awareness, specifically attributed to apartment seekers is now 74% compared to Zillow, which is only at 42%, 74% compared to 42%. And -- our average monthly unique visitors for the quarter grew 3% year-over-year to 48 million, significantly outperforming the overall market, which was down 3% year-over-year according to Google. Economic conditions in the apartment industry continue to create a favorable advertising environment. apartment vacancy rates of 3, 4 5-star properties, continued elevated levels with a 9.3% vacancy rate at the end of the quarter and are forecasted to remain at or above 9% for the remainder of this year.\nUnit level deliveries continued at all-time highs and are expected to be 561,000 units in 2024. And -- Supply will continue to outweigh demand in the foreseeable future. Apartments.com continues to deliver strong growth, and we expect to see Apartments.com revenue growth of 17% for the year, in line with our guidance.\nIn the second quarter, CoStar continued to deliver double-digit revenue growth with $253 million of revenue, a 10% increase over the prior year and in line with our guidance. Our lender product had the highest net new sales quarter ever, with a 47% increase in revenue over the same period last year. We now have 298 banks and lending institutions in the platform, up 50% year-over-year with sales to several large institutions in the quarter.\nWe believe that our product is superior to the competition, which is something we continue to hear from our customers. Lender is a $300 million market opportunity with 3,000 more significant lending institutions to pursue.\nThe STR sales team had another strong quarter with a 54% increase in net new sales year-over-year. Revenue from our benchmarking product and CoStar subscriptions to hospitality clients increased 28% in the second quarter. We are well positioned to penetrate this $300 million market opportunity with a best-in-class product.\nOur consistent strong revenue and sales performance for CoStar is the result of a steady stream of product innovation that delivers expanded capabilities and increase customer value. Over the past few years, we've integrated the STR benchmarking product, enhanced our fund data, added hospitality and CMBS data, launched a new lender product and opened international reach for our CoStar customers.\nAt the event of Q2, we just released our newest feature called Owner. The new Owner module of CoStar provides unparalled insight into the underlying portfolios of the world's largest real estate developers and owners, their key tenants acquisition and disposition trends, aggregate vacancies and availabilities in key context. Our usage data continues to show that these customers are engaging with the platform more despite the economic cycle.\nOur customers logged in 5 million times in the quarter and conducted 68 million property searches, up 8% over the same period a year ago. Renewal rates are up to 92%, and our NPS scores are at 65%, which is the highest levels in our history for NPS for CoStar. We've grown our subscriber base to 230,000 CoStar professional users, which is up 19% year-over-year.\nWe have a proven track record of growth throughout economic cycles and even in the face of historically low CRE transaction levels, CoStar is delivering solid growth and continues to be the mission-critical data and information pride for brokers, owners, lenders, tenants, fund managers and other participants in commercial property information markets.\nLoopNet revenue was $70 million, up 7% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our 5% to 6% guidance. International revenue grew 17% in the second quarter year-over-year. The LoopNet network remains the #1 platform in the market with 6x the traffic of our nearest competitor. Average monthly unique visitors for the second quarter were 13 million with direct and organic traffic at 75% of total traffic.\nEven considering the difficult commercial real estate market conditions, total detailed listing views are up 14% compared to the second quarter of last year. As the market normalizes over the coming years, LoopNet is poised to benefit significantly from that recovery. We continue to enhance all aspects of sales and client service and as a result, our NPS scores have improved to 58 or up 87% since last year.\nWe're growing our dedicated sales team, which will help us further penetrate this large and global market opportunity. Real Estate Management revenue was up 9% year-over-year with renewal rates at 99%. And -- Real Estate Manager continues to take market share from legacy competitors. 2/3 of our customers are sharing their lease data for anonymized analysis, which will greatly enhance our analytics in the CoStar platform.\nLand.com revenue grew 5% year-over-year. Signature ads increased 9% in the second quarter and diamond ad sales were up tenfold in the last quarter. Land.com is exclusive sponsor of a new show in production, Ranchland which will stream on Paramount Plus and CBS, featuring aspirational ranches that are listed for sale of Land.com. Each episode will feature an aspirational ranch currently on the market and listed on Land.com and will feature a day in the life of the ranch owner. I know none of you are going to want to miss that exciting show.\nBizBuySell revenue increased 6% year-over-year. The platform had a record $2 billion in enterprise value that transacted in the second quarter. Our franchise directory leads are up 25% and listing leads are up 16% over the same period last year. Providing these quality leads to our customers and having customer response rates in the mid-19s correlates directly to our NPS score rising 15% to 55% this quarter.\nOur Ten-X platform continues to outperform the market with a trade rate of 50%, more than double the off-line trade rate of 23%. We brought 57% more assets to the platform in the second quarter compared to the first quarter of 2024.\nCRE transaction volumes may be bottoming out with sales activity increasing slightly 6% year-over-year for the first time since the second quarter of 2022. To stress sales are beginning to service, particularly for office and multifamily, but remain historically low, with lenders still preferring to extend loans. CMBS delinquency rates remain elevated and office delinquencies have increased notably to 7.4%. This is a significant opportunity as these properties will eventually need to change hands and Ten-X is the most efficient way to execute commercial real estate transactions.\nI believe that the results this quarter demonstrate the strength of our commercial real estate business with continued double-digit growth and strong EBITDA margins in the face of economic headwinds. And -- I believe that this quarter, Homes.com is coming into focus as a better product with a better business model than our competitors have. I think that Homes.com value proposition is emerging clearly, it's compelling and offers our future clients a huge potential ROI. Going forward, we need to focus on the blocking and tackling of building out our sales and marketing organization to realize the full revenue potential of Homes.com.\nAt this point, I'm pleased to welcome our new CFO, Chris Lown, and will turn the call over to him, and here we go.\n\nChristian M. Lown\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Navient Corporation\n\nGreat. Thank you, Andy. Good evening. I'm excited to be here for my first of many CoStar earnings calls. I'm happy to report that CoStar has now reached its 53rd consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, coming in at 12%, and we achieved a commercial business margin of 41% in the second quarter.\nLooking first at our Residential businesses. Residential revenue came in at $26 million, up 40% sequentially. In just 4.5 months, we have delivered cumulative net new bookings of $55 million, which is a great accomplishment. We are focused on hiring dedicated Homes.com sales reps over the next year, who are more productive at selling homes memberships and will also allow many of our commercial sales teams to return to selling their core products full time.\nAs Andy mentioned, focus groups have bolstered our confidence in our Homes.com offering, and we are confident in our differentiated business model and our ability to capture this exciting long-term revenue and data opportunity. We now expect third quarter residential revenue to come in around $30 million, and we are revising our full year 2024 residential revenue guidance to $105 million to $110 million.\nFor the full year, we continue to expect to execute on our Homes.com investment plans. Apartments.com's second quarter revenue growth came in at 11%. And -- the Apartments.com team continued to perform well with the highest number of sales reps and the highest sales productivity of any brand in the company. We are on track to achieve the guidance we provided last quarter, resulting in 17% year-over-year revenue growth.\nCoStar revenue grew 10% in the second quarter, in line with our guidance, and we are maintaining our previous full year guidance of 10% growth. We expect growth in the third quarter to be broadly in line with the full year.\nLoopNet revenue grew 7% in the second quarter, slightly ahead of our 5% to 6% guidance range. We are maintaining our full year revenue outlook for LoopNet of mid-single-digit growth. Revenue from Information Services was flat sequentially and dropped 20% year-over-year due to the transition of STR into CoStar.\nWe are reiterating our previously stated guidance of $130 million to $135 million for the full year and expect the third quarter to be consistent with the first 2 quarters of 2024.\nI -- Other Marketplaces revenue was $31 million in the second quarter, and we are maintaining our guidance for Other Marketplaces to be relatively flat in the third quarter and full year.\nFrom a consolidated basis, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $41 million at a 6% margin, meaningfully above the high end of our $5 million to $10 million second quarter guidance. The favorable performance relates primarily to slower-than-anticipated hiring as well as the timing of investment spend. We anticipate incurring some of the spend in the second half of the year.\nOur sales force totaled some 1,240 people at quarter end, an increase of 7% year-over-year and around 30 salespeople higher sequentially. The -- most of the increase in the second quarter was in our Homes.com sales force. Our contract renewal rate was 90% for the second quarter, with the renewal rate for customers who have been subscribers for 5 years or longer at 95%. Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 81% for the second quarter, consistent with the prior quarter and the second quarter of 2023.\nWe continue to have a strong balance sheet with $4.9 billion in cash, which are net interest income of $53 million in the second quarter, a 5.1% rate of return.\nOur full year 2024 revenue guidance is now in the $2.735 billion to $2.745 billion range, a 12% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. This range reflects our adjusted residential revenue guidance for the second quarter -- second half of the year. The company expects third quarter revenue of $692 million to $697 million, representing 11% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range.\nWe are increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year with revised guidance of $195 million to $205 million. For the third quarter of 2024, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $47 million to $52 million.\nI will now turn the call back over to our call, operator, Carmen, to open the line for questions."

Welcome to the CoStar Group First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Cyndi Eakin, Head of Investor Relations, who will read the safe harbor statement. Cyndi, you may begin.\n\nCyndi Eakin\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations & Controller\n\nWell, thank you, Josh.

Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nGood evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.\nFirst quarter 2024 revenue was $656 million, a 12% increase over first quarter of '23, coming in above the high end of our guidance range and above consensus estimates. Both Apartments.com and CoStar surpassed the $1 billion revenue mark in the first quarter, a tremendous milestone for the company. Congratulations to both teams.\nCompany-wide net new bookings achieved an all-time high in the first quarter of $86 million, fueled by a very strong launch of our Homes.com membership product. In the first quarter, 60% of our net new bookings were from sales of our commercial products and 40% were from net new bookings from our new Homes.com memberships and Residential products.\nOverall, traffic to our global websites reached a record 170 million average monthly unique visitors in the first quarter according to Google Analytics, which is 93% above the first quarter of last year and an impressive 34% above our previous all-time high. CoStar Group has now reached 90% of the 194 million unique visitors Zillow reported in the last earnings call.\nOur Residential network reached a record 156 million monthly unique visitors in March, according to Google Analytics. I believe we have clearly established Homes.com and our Residential network as one of the 2 most trafficked residential marketplaces in the United States.\nYesterday, we announced that we reached a definitive agreement to acquire Matterport, the global leader in immersive 3D digital twins and artificial intelligence for the real estate industry for $5.50 per share. Founded in 2011, Matterport pioneered the development of the first 3D capture solution to deliver dimensionally accurate, photorealistic virtual tours, or digital twins, for any type of property. Matterport's proprietary and patented technology enables anyone to digitize a property using a variety of camera technologies, including cameras found on most smartphones.\nMatterport's 3D technology is utilized in nearly every sector of real estate, spanning residential, commercial, hospitality, retail and industrial spaces, among others. Over the years, Matterport has curated what is considered the largest and most precise collection of spatial property data worldwide, with over 12 million spaces captured in 177 countries and representing more than 38 billion square feet of digital commercial property under management. Hundreds of thousands of new 3D digital twins for properties around the world are being added to this impressive database each month.\nMatterport makes it possible to experience real estate remotely. People now select their next home, apartment office, store, hotel or warehouse on their mobile device often without ever visiting the property. The pandemic accelerated remote real estate shopping trend, and we believe it is the new normal.\nCoStar and Matterport have nearly identical mission statements of digitizing the world's real estate. CoStar Group was one of the first adopters of Matterport's technology and currently has almost 300,000 Matterport digital twins available in the CoStar Information product and online property marketplaces.\nIn March this year, there were over 7.4 million views of Matterport 3D tours on Apartments.com. Visitors who interact with the Matterport on Apartments.com spend 16.6 minutes on the site, which is 134% more than the 7.1 minutes time on site if they do not interact with a Matterport. Properties with a Matterport generated 74 leads, which is 10x the 7 leads generated for a property without Matterport.\nCurrently, 50% to 60% of consumers looking for an apartment say they're comfortable selecting their next apartment without visiting the property at all.\nAs we listen to corporate real estate executives who use LoopNet discuss their challenges of buying and leasing properties around the world, they tell us 3D digital twins are invaluable in facilitating technology for them. In residential focus groups, homebuyers are clearly telling us that they prefer listings that offer 3D digital twins so that they can best understand the property.\nWe believe that our substantial empirical data and our market research clearly shows that consumers and advertisers prefer real estate portals with digital twins. We intend to go all in on 3D digital twins, adding more digital twins to Apartments.com, loopnethomes.com, costarland.com, BizBuySell, [ Real Estate Manager ], STR, Belbex, OnTheMarket and others.\nWe intend to add Matterports as one of the benefits of Homes.com membership. We believe adding 3D digital twins for Homes.com members will increase the leads we deliver, increase customer satisfaction, increase renewal rates, increase sales and increase site traffic further. We have thoroughly researched the many 3D digital twin solutions out there and have concluded that Matterport is the best solution for our clients' needs.\nGiven the fact that we intend to make a much greater commitment to capturing 3D digital twins, we decided to capture the value of our increased volumes by acquiring Matterport. As we make Matterports more ubiquitous, we believe others will buy more Matterports, making the company more valuable. We believe that we can accelerate Matterport sales to non-CoStar Group advertisers by increasing Matterport's investments in sales and marketing.\nWhile Matterport has been very responsive to us as customers over the past 9 years, we see the acquisition is giving us increased ability to influence the product road map for Matterport to best serve our clients' needs.\nI believe we're standing on the verge of a potential exponential acceleration in the technology surrounding 3D digital twins, which will create transformative value for real estate. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, generative AI, computational photography, [ nerve smurf ] and gaussian splat, all have tremendous potential for real estate. Matterport has incredible research and development talent. These are the people who are very passionate about the future of digital twins and literally invented the genre, and we believe they are the ones who will imagine and create the industry's future. Right, Dave?\nWe intend to actively support and invest in Matterport's spatial technology research and development efforts. Imagine the potential to scan your home and move 3D digital twins of your furniture and art into a virtual moving truck and try laying it out in a potential new home virtually. Imagine using a 3D digital twin to virtually see various potential kitchen renovations in seconds. Imagine the value of creating a 3D twin of an unattractive raw office space and using generative AI to rapidly generate 3D realistic potential build-outs of the office space for a future tenant to see.\nAdding virtual reality to the Matterport, you could take a virtual tour of the property with your virtual agent walking to the space with you. The possibilities are certainly exciting to imagine and represent a massive opportunity to propagate new technologies to our global Information and Marketplace businesses.\nI believe CoStar Group faces 2 major challenges in our effort to make Homes.com the leading U.S. real estate portal. First, we need to build massive site traffic. And second, we need to successfully monetize our new \"your listing, your lead\" model.\nAs we report our first quarter results I believe we are showing, for the first time, clear proof that we are very successfully delivering against those 2 important challenges. With almost $40 million in homes net new bookings and 156 million monthly unique visitors achieved in the quarter, were growing revenue and traffic faster than any other product launch in the history of the company.\nWe launched the Homes.com brand marketing in February. I think it was the 11th during the Super Bowl and the results are outstanding. We believe the Homes.com marketing program is the largest in the history of real estate, delivering almost 9,000 commercial placements in the first quarter across broadcast and cable TV, streaming audio and video, digital and social media and high-profile sponsorships as well.\nIn less than 2 months, our brand campaign generated almost 4.5 billion consumer impressions. Our marketing and media advertising and featuring Dan Levy, Heidi Gardner as well as supporting roles from Jeff Goldblum and Lil Wayne is proving effective with consumers as, oh, a supporting role from yours truly, Andy Florance, is proving effective [ at ] consumers as evidenced by our unaided brand awareness, which increased from 4% in January to 24% in March of this year.\nWith unaided awareness approaching 25% in just 1 quarter, we're halfway to our goal of 50% unaided consumer brand awareness for Homes.com. And we'll obviously work to go beyond the 50%, but 50% is a very important number.\nThe consumer traffic response to our marketing efforts has been equally impressive, in March, the Homes.com site attracted 110 million monthly unique visitors according to Google Analytics, increase of 386% over the same period last year. In March, monthly unique visitors to our overall Residential network reached 156 million. That is pretty much U.S. Apartments and Homes, which is basically an apples-and-apples comparison to our competitors.\nWe believe Homes.com and our Residential network continue to be the fastest-growing residential marketplace in the U.S. in terms of consumer traffic. We are also seeing quality improvements in our traffic metrics with direct traffic to Homes.com increasing 115% since the first quarter of last year.\nSales of Homes.com memberships are off to a fantastic start. In the first quarter, our sales team sold almost 8,000 Homes.com membership subscriptions, making Homes.com product launch easily the fastest-growing new product in the company history.\nFor context, we launched Apartments.com in early 2015, and it took 7 years to achieve our first quarter with $40 million annualized bookings. Homes.com reached the $40 million annualized bookings in the first quarter we launched. And it wasn't even a full quarter. It was less than 2 months of selling. So it was a really fast start.\nWe're seeing a strong continuation of sales results and metrics that I mentioned in our last earnings call in February. 90% of agent members are selecting the 12-month contract option, with the rest choosing the 6-month subscription. Through the end of the first quarter, the average monthly selling price of membership was in the $475 to $500 per month range.\nWe are signing up agent members of all sizes, ranging from single agents with no listings up to large agent groups with hundreds of listings per year. We recently had a regional broker in Indianapolis sign up all 180 agents on their brokerage team. They want to enhance their marketing strategy and excited about the Homes.com advertising opportunity to build their brand's awareness.\nAgent feedback has been extremely positive, an agent from Western Florida said, Homes.com has truly transformed my business with genuine leads that are directly -- that directly connects potential buyers to my listings. No more confusion or waste of time, just real quality leads that make a difference. Clearly, the \"your listing, your lead\" model is resonating.\nAnother agent from Westlake Village, California said, what impressed me most after I signed up was how Homes.com boosted the number of views I have compared with other listing agents in the area. Currently, on average, Homes.com members' listings and profiles are viewed 1.8 million times a month or 200x more than 9,000 views a basic agent receives.\nOur company-wide sales team of over 1,000 sales representatives is proving very effective in selling Homes.com. It's still early days, but every 1 of our 8 commercial product sales teams from the largest Apartments.com to the smallest CoStar Real Estate Manager are selling Homes.com memberships. In total, 85% of our sales representatives have successfully sold at least one Homes.com membership. We are selling memberships all over the country, in major cities and markets, smaller communities [ and ] rural areas. Through last week, around 40% of our memberships were sold to agents outside the top metro areas.\nLooking at roughly 70 major markets where we have a field sales presence, every market has contributed dozens of new memberships with Dallas leading the way in terms of total memberships and net bookings. Relative to city size, Las Vegas and Columbus are the champion sales teams overall, each producing the highest net new bookings per person.\nWhat is really exciting is that our early sales success measured against our 500,000-plus agent prospect list is still only 1% penetration. This implies a total market opportunity of over $3 billion of revenue for our basic membership product.\nWhile the broader sales force is selling Homes.com in addition to their original product responsibility, we do expect a substitution effect of slightly lower sales for these non-Homes products. As we build up a dedicated Homes sales team, the non-Homes sales teams will return more of their time to their original products.\nOur new VP of Home sales, Andy Stearns, is focused on building out our Homes.com dedicated sales force in Richmond, Virginia, with the goal of having over 300 sellers in place by the end of the year. The first 80 or so members of this team are proving very effective, turning in more Homes.com net bookings per person, the company wide average, after only 30 to 60 days with the company.\nOverall, I'm very pleased with our results and momentum from the first 60 days since the launch of Homes.com marketing and sales efforts.\nI want to comment on our perception of the impact of recent class action lawsuits in the real estate industry. We are not experts. We're not involved, but it clearly is going to have some impacts in the industry.\nWhile Homes.com relies on a \"your listing, your lead\" model that focuses on selling the home as the highest priority, our competitors use a lead diversion model that focuses on generating buyer agency leads as their highest priority. We are not aware of any other portal in the world that uses such a lead diversion model the way our U.S. competitors do.\nOur competitors present agents listings with a contact agent button that diverts the leads away from that agent who's listing it is to one of their competitors who's listing it's not. We believe that the lead diversion model is very unpopular with home sellers, agents, buyers and brokers, which may be why it has not been very profitable.\nWith recent seismic legal settlements in the real estate industry, we believe the portals that rely on the lead diversion models could become stressed. Legacy portals rely on MLS data feeds that provide them with information on offers to compensation to buyer, brokers so these portals can take a significant portion of the buyer-broker commission from the diverted leads. Going forward, under the terms of the settlement, those feeds can no longer include buyer-broker compensation fields.\nIn addition, buyer agents will need to get buyers to enter into a written agreement, a written buyer agency agreement before they even show the buyers a house for sale. It may be difficult for the diversion model agents to get homebuyers to sign a written commitment to the agent just to see one house. Currently, only 30% of buyer agents ever get a written agreement at any point in the transaction process.\nIn contrast, Homes.com connects homebuyers with directly the listing agent so they can arrange to see the house with no paperwork or commitments. We are increasingly confident in our ability to build out the #1 residential marketplace in terms of traffic, revenue and profitability in the years ahead.\nOur U.K. property portal, OnTheMarket, is off to a strong start in the first quarter. Coming into the quarter before we acquired on the market, it was a distant third place in the U.K. based on traffic. We have made a focused and successful effort to grow OnTheMarket market traffic.\nIn March, according to similar web reporting, we surpassed Zoopla in site visits and are now the U.K.'s #2 residential property portal. Monthly unique visitors were 17 million in March, representing a 107% increase over the same period a year ago according to Google Analytics. The increase in traffic has translated to nearly 50% more leads for agents in March of 2024 versus the prior year.\nThe early results tell us we are delivering on our strategy of investing and partnering with agents to generate high-intent leads at a fraction of the cost of competing U.K. portals. In response to the strategy, more and more agents are choosing to put their listings on the market. In March, we exceeded 15,000 advertisers on the portal and have grown listings almost 40% year-over-year.\nApartments.com reached a significant milestone in the first quarter with annual revenue run rate of $1 billion. Revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $255 million, representing 21% growth compared to the first quarter of 2023 and above our guidance growth rate of 20%. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter with Apartments.com growing at or above 20%.\nI believe the continuing success story of Apartments.com is a tribute to the quality of the product, the effectiveness of our brand marketing and our ability to build the largest and most effective sales force in the industry.\nThree weeks ago on April 1, we celebrated the 10-year anniversary of CoStar's acquisition of Apartments.com and what an amazing 10 years it's been. We transformed the way consumers find their next rental home growing our revenue from $75 million in 2014 to over $1 billion today. Our sales team is 5x larger, delivering 3,225% more sales than when we started. We went from fourth or fifth place in that industry in terms of traffic to the #1 traffic position with the brand most recognized by consumers.\nI would like to personally congratulate Fred, [ Page ], Jerry and the entire Apartments.com team for this outstanding success. And I'm looking forward to the next 10 years. providing the best possible rental experience for consumers and our advertising customers. And Fred, I'm looking for another tenfold increase plus in revenue, at least 12-fold increase. So good luck.\nOur 2024 marketing campaign is off to a great start. We kicked off with a fantastic Super Bowl ad during the most viewed Super Bowl game in history. The campaign generated over 2.3 billion media impressions in the first quarter of 2024, which is 3x the number of impressions delivered in the first quarter of last year.\nWe launched 5 new television commercials featuring Brad Bellflower, the inventor of the Apartminternet, known to many of you as Jeff Goldblum. We expect this year's campaign to deliver our highest number of impressions ever over 12 billion while reaching 90% of renters across the U.S. Our brand marketing strategy continues to pay dividends, and our first quarter unaided brand awareness was 51%, which has outperformed [ those ] unaided brand awareness for 4 quarters in a row.\nApartments.com continues to be the most highly-trafficked rental website in the U.S., attracting over 43 million monthly unique visitors on average in the first quarter according to Google Analytics. According to comScore, unique visitors in the first quarter of 2024 were relatively flat over the same period last year, which is quite the opposite of our competitors, with Zillow decreasing 13% and [ rent period ] down 21%.\nIn addition, as Homes.com traffic grows, Apartments.com benefits from consumers that want to explore rental options. Monthly unique visitors sourced through Homes.com grew 21% in March year-over-year according to comScore.\nWith both Apartments and Homes' products to sell, the sales team conducted 189,000 quality meetings in the first quarter, an increase of 38% over the first quarter of last year. These efforts are clearly producing results as properties advertising on our platform reached an all-time high of 73,000 at the end of the quarter, while the number of under 50 unit properties advertising increased 31% over the prior period. It's important to keep in mind that despite such strong growth in advertisers and revenue, we remain below 12% penetration in the Apartments.com market opportunity, which we estimate to be worth $9 billion.\nOverall, economic conditions remain favorable for rental property advertising. Vacancy levels continue to set record highs for 3, 4 and 5 star properties, increasing 10 basis points above the fourth quarter of 2023 to reach 9.1%.\nNew unit deliveries remain at elevated levels, with 495,000 units expected to be delivered in 2024 coming off the peak of 583,000 units that were delivered in 2023.\nCoStar revenue was $250 million for the quarter, an increase of 11% over the same quarter a year ago. Our [ flagship ] [ information product ] reached a significant milestone in the first quarter, just like Apartments.com did, but Apartments got there a month earlier.\nCoStar Group reached an annual revenue run rate of $1 billion. So just to be keeping track, that's 2 of our products cross the $1 billion revenue run rate in the quarter. In other way, saying both CoStar and Apartments crossed $1 billion revenue run rate in the quarter.\nRegardless of economic cycles, we continue to see strong revenue growth in CoStar. The 20-year compound annual growth rate for CoStar is an impressive 12%, which we expect to continue for years to come. Our lender product delivered revenue growth of [ 57% ] in the first quarter year-over-year. The number of banks and lending institutions on our lender platform is now 285, an increase of 71% year-over-year. We're still in the early stages of what we believe to be a $300 million-plus revenue opportunity for our lender product.\nThe CoStar hospitality product, STR, has experienced some of the fastest sales growth in the company, increasing 44% in the first quarter. Revenue from our benchmarking and CoStar subscriptions hospitality clients increased 15% in the first quarter. Our CoStar sales force team -- our CoStar sales team force delivered the strongest sales of Homes.com in the quarter and their highest level of total net new bookings output since '22.\nCoStar renewal rates remain above 90%, and our NPS scores continue to grow. We now have 221,000 subscribers in the CoStar platform and they logged in 5.2 million times in the first quarter, with 24 million property searches conducted and a 17% increase compared to the prior year. So CoStar Group is robust, healthy and growing.\nLoopNet revenue was $69 million in the first quarter of 2024, up 9% over the first quarter of last year. The international revenue in the first quarter was up 29% compared to the first quarter of last year. LoopNet continues to be the leading commercial marketplace in the U.S., with over 13 million monthly average unique visitors according to Google Analytics.\nOur direct and organic traffic represents over 70% of average monthly unique visitors, which is a testament to our brand as we continue to generate quality leads for customers. We continue to enhance our sales capabilities and are seeing positive sales trends coming out of first quarter.\nNet new bookings increased 147% sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The net sales per sales representatives, including Homes.com sales, was the highest of any period since we launched a dedicated sales force almost 18 months ago. The quality level of interactions with customers is also improving, with the LoopNet sales team Net Promoter Score increasing 70% from the same period a year ago.\nWe welcomed Ben Drew to the President of LoopNet role this past week. Ben brings over 2 decades of digital marketplace and leadership experience, most recently, Ben served as President of Viator, the leading marketplace for travel experiences. Prior to Viator, Ben held roles with increasing levels of responsibility at TripAdvisor, the parent company of Viator.\nEven though commercial real estate trends -- commercial real estate sales transactions, volumes dropped 17% in the first quarter, the lowest level since beginning of the pandemic, Ten-X outperformed the market with an 8% increase in assets brought to the platform in the first quarter. The Ten-X trade rate increased from 48% in the fourth quarter of '23 to 56% in the first quarter of '24.\nThe average number of bidders per auction was 3.2 this quarter, which was the highest number in a year and above the fourth quarter average of 2.3 per auction -- bidders per auction. Our approval rates of allowing proposed assets to trade in the platform increased as well in the first quarter, up 50% from the prior quarter, a good sign of improvement.\nLooking at the real estate economy. Office sector vacancies now stood at 13.8% and have risen 19 consecutive quarters. Office attendance has shown a positive trend of 2% to 3% over the past year, but that is currently counterbalanced by declining overall office using job growth. But the true silver lining is construction levels with the current supply pipeline at the lowest level it's been in 10 years and construction starts this quarter, the lowest ever. This will likely translate into a shortage of premium office space and associated price premiums in the coming years. [ Maybe ] a good time to buy an office building.\nThe industrial sector saw a 90% drop in demand in the first quarter compared to the average of the past 3 years. Deliveries in the quarter pushed vacancies up 50 basis points to 6.2%, the highest level since 2015. Retail vacancies remained largely unchanged in the first quarter, near the all-time low of 4%.\nIn the residential sector, mortgage rates are still high enough to keep most Americans from listing their homes for sale, which is propping up home prices and impacting affordability. The recent decline in mortgage rates created positive momentum in sales, increasing affordability and increasing existing home sales to 500,000 homes a month. If rates continue to drop, we could see a significant increase of activity in the residential sector.\nSo we've had a lot of good news to share with this quarter, but I think the most important news is that the early indications of the Homes.com investment is working. We're proving out our ability to generate traffic on Homes.com Clearly, we're building the brand, and we're monetizing the site. We believe that before too long, Homes.com will be our largest revenue business in the portfolio.\nAt this point, I'm going to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, who seems to be sort of fading away. Go ahead, Scott.\n\nScott T. Wheeler\n\nCFO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andy. I'll try to remain present for the next 10 or 20 minutes.\nWell, that was a great start to the year. I wish we could have a quarter like that every year. That's a pretty amazing highlight reel that you shared for the company, with the 3D groundbreaking acquisition and $1 billion businesses, the best product launch ever with Homes, record sales, the Super Bowl marketing launch, you even managed to wiggle in the word gaussian splat into your script, which -- it's a real word people, that wasn't a joke. You can look it up.\nSo how are we going to top that in the second quarter? I don't know, but we better get going because we got a lot to do. So our streak of double-digit revenue growth continued in the first quarter at 12% overall for the company. And you know what I think the best news is here, it's our Residential business is now making a solid positive contribution to growth.\nAfter 2 years, we've endured this sort of painful revenue decline from the legacy Residential products like this quarterly drip, drip, drip, revenue erosion like water torture, while we're finally on the upswing with the launch of Homes.com monetization.\nOur Residential revenue came in at $19 million in the first quarter, which was up 90% sequentially from the fourth quarter of '23 and up 42% year-over-year, thanks to our Homes.com launch and a full quarter of OnTheMarket results.\nFirst quarter residential revenue was above our $15 million guidance estimate, primarily due to the fast start for the sales of Homes.com. So we're going to raise our revenue forecast for Residential revenues by $15 million at the midpoint to reflect faster growth of Homes.com. Our new estimates have revenue improving almost $10 million sequentially each quarter, with revenue growing to almost $50 million by the fourth quarter of 2024.\nYear-over-year revenue growth is expected to be 180% in total and around 105% organic in 2024. We now expect the exit run rate for Homes.com to be in the $130 million to $140 million range, which is up from the $100 million exit run rate I provided back in February.\nRevenue in our commercial businesses for the first quarter came in at $638 million, which was up 12% year-over-year and above expectations. We saw a sales substitution effect, as Andy mentioned in the first quarter, as we launched Homes.com which I expect will shift our revenue mix a bit more towards Residential than what we had assumed in our full year revenue outlook we shared in February.\nNow my original revenue forecast model, which quite frankly, wasn't much more than an educated guess at the time, given we had not launched Homes.com, I assume that the full year sales split would be 70% commercial and around 30% residential. While the actual sales split in the first quarter was around 60% commercial and 40% residential, which translates to around a $10 million revenue shift for the full year, commercial to residential. Well, it's not really a whole lot in the grand scheme of things. It's only about 0.4% of revenue, but I thought it was at least worth noting. And you'll hear some of those effects as I talk through the rest of the product groups.\nApartments.com grew revenue 21% during the first quarter, ahead of our guidance of 20% revenue growth. Crossing $1 billion in annualized revenue and celebrating 10 years from the acquisition, it's remarkable to see 5 straight quarters thus far on of 20% plus growth of the size and the stage of this business has become. Like whoever puts a 20% growth rate 10 years out in your acquisition model? Well, I guess Fred did because he's done a great job, and the team delivered it.\nWhat's encouraging is that Apartments.com revenue reflects only 12% penetration of the multifamily revenue opportunity, and that's just in the United States.\nWith a strong start to the year and considering a modest sales substitution effect, we're maintaining our revenue forecast for Apartments.com of around 17% revenue growth for the full year of 2024.\nCoStar revenue grew 11% in the first quarter, in line with our guidance expectations. We continue to see strong growth within our hospitality, lender and owner customers, while working through this downturn and the effects of continued high interest rates on commercial real estate.\nIn the first quarter, our CoStar sales team sold more Homes.com memberships than any of our other sales teams. Recognizing the slight shift in sales mix year, we're adjusting our revenue forecast and expected CoStar revenue growth of around 10% for the second quarter and for the full year of 2024.\nLoopNet revenue grew 9% in the first quarter at the high end of our guidance range, demonstrating the ongoing productivity improvements within our dedicated net sales team. Welcome to the team, Ben. Looking forward to seeing what you can do in the quarters ahead.\nWe expect 5% to 6% revenue growth for LoopNet in the second quarter of 2024, with full year revenue growth in the mid-single digits, broadly in line and unchanged from our previous LoopNet revenue outlook.\nRevenue from Information Services was $33 million in the first quarter, consistent with expectations. We expect revenue for the full year to be in the range of $130 million to $135 million, in line with the revenue growth guidance range we provided in February.\nOther Marketplaces revenue was $31 million for the quarter, slightly ahead of guidance. Ten-X trade rates and deal closings improved in the first quarter, providing the extra revenue versus our forecast.\nRevenue for the second quarter is forecast to be in line with the first quarter's results. and we confirm our previous guidance for the full year 2024 revenue to be relatively flat to the full year 2023 revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $12 million in the first quarter, $27 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. The outperformance was primarily attributable to our strong revenue performance and lower-than-anticipated personnel costs, with some of the favorability coming from timing of spend that we now expect to occur in the back half of the year.\nWe remain on track with similar investment levels of Homes.com as we planned for the year and that we discussed last quarter as well as the expected adjusted EBITDA margins in our commercial product businesses unchanged from what we said at the beginning of the year.\nThe size of our sales force is about the same at the end of the first quarter as it was at the end of 2023, 1,200 sales members. As we grow our Homes.com sales force, we expect to have a total of around 1,500 sales team members by the end of this year.\nOur contract renewal rate was 90% for the first quarter of 2024, while the renewal rate for customers who've been subscribers for 5 years or longer remained strong at 94%. Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 81% for the first quarter of 2024, consistent with the prior quarter.\nWith a strong start to the year, we're increasing our revenue guidance to a range of $2.760 billion to $2.770 billion. Net midpoint guidance is up around $5 million, with Residential revenue up $15 million and commercial revenue -- commercial business revenue lower by $10 million from the fine-tuning of our sales mix based on the first quarter sales split.\nSecond quarter 2024 revenue is expected to range from $674 million to $679 million, representing revenue growth rate of 11% to 12% for the quarter.\nOur full year revenue outlook includes revenue growth of 12% in the first half of the year, accelerating to 14% in the second half of 2024. Isn't it great to accelerate revenue growth in a really bad property market? This business is pretty amazing.\nWe're also increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance and raising the midpoint of our guidance range. The new adjusted EBITDA forecast range for the full year is now $185 million to $205 million, up $15 million at the midpoint and indicating a margin of around 7% at the midpoint of the range.\nSecond quarter adjusted EBITDA margin includes the highest marketing seasonal spend for the year, and are expected to be in the range of $5 million to $10 million or approximately 1%. Margins are expected to increase sequentially in the second half and exit the year in the range of 15% to 16%.\nOur outlook for interest, capital and taxes remains unchanged for what we communicated back in February.\nSo I'll wrap up with a few financial comments on the pending acquisition of Matterport that was announced yesterday. Financially, Matterport operates a very attractive financial model, very similar to CoStar, but at a smaller scale.\nMatterport has a history of strong revenue growth with a 5-year compound annual growth rate of 31%. Their subscription business represents 60% of the overall revenue and is growing over 20% per year, has a very high renewal rate similar to CoStar. We love this kind of business.\nThe Matterport subscriber customer base is highly diverse, operating across a variety of vertical markets with no single customer over 3% of revenue. Approximately 30% of their new 3D models, along with around 30% of revenue are generated outside of the United States. The customer and vertical market diversity creates a resilient financial growth profile just like CoStar.\nMatterport enjoys significant operating leverage on incremental subscription revenue with gross margins of around 70%. This is scalable for high profit margins and cash generation. Matterport has a strong and conservative balance sheet with over $400 million of cash and 0 debt. Sound familiar?\nThe total purchase price of approximately $2 billion comes with around $400 million of cash and investments which is currently on the Matterport balance sheet, yielding an enterprise value of roughly $1.6 billion. The purchase consideration will be paid 50% from our available cash balances and 50% with CoStar stock.\nOn a net basis, after closing, we expect to use around $550 million to $600 million of our cash to complete the acquisition.\nMatterport expects quarterly cash flow from operations to break even in the second half of 2024 and turn positive in 2025. The breakeven point is somewhat in line with what we might see as the expected time to close the transaction.\nWith Matterport cash flow turning positive in 2025, [ and ] modest synergy assumptions, we expect the stand-alone acquisition to be neutral to slightly accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share in the first year post closing. Now it's far too early to estimate financial guidance outcomes for the acquisition. We expect the post-integration benefits from this acquisition to be highly value accretive for many of the reasons that Andy described.\nWe have a strong track record of successfully acquiring, integrating and growing great companies, which I believe will continue with the combination of Matterport technology and CoStar's marketplace scale, research capabilities and product development expertise.\nWe're in a very strong financial position as we head into the second quarter, with our growth and profit plans already exceeding our expectations for the year. We're focused on and committed to accomplishing our stated long-term revenue and profit goals and we've taken a big step closer to achieving those with the fast launch of Homes.com and the potential acquisition of Matterport.\nI certainly believe there will be many more exciting growth years ahead for the company. Well, that's about wraps it up for me. I guess you could say for the last time on the CoStar earnings call airwaves, I'd like to say thank you, Andy, for taking me along and what I so affectionately call [ Mr. Toad's ] wild ride at CoStar for the past 8 years. That's truly been, I must say, the best and without question, the most entertaining time in my professional career.\nWell, I will, without doubt, miss all of you, as I climb the many peaks on my list, recovering the hot tub, and experiment with the endless combinations of whiskeys available to me in crafting the ultimate Manhattans. If you stop in some time, Andy or Cyndi, I will be certainly happy to mix one up for you.\nWell, with that, I'll turn the call back over to our operator for a bit of Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] [Technical Difficulty]\n\nAndrew C. Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nBrian Radecki is -- Brian just texted me, our former CFO. Sounded a little harsh.\n\nScott T. Wheeler\n\nCFO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nI love Brian. [indiscernible] I know.\n\nAndrew C. Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nHe's having a little martini on his plane. Okay. So the -- before we jump over to Q&A, I apologize to the operator.\nBut that was -- this is my 103rd earnings call. Scott is a relative rookie with only 32 earnings calls with us. Certainly, very grateful everything Scott has accomplished it was 8 years with CoStar Group. And so I thought we could all do his performance review here together. He's a numbers guy, so let's review his performance with his stats.\nAt Scott's first earnings call, we had a cash balance of $422 million. We now have $5.5 billion. In the first earnings call that Scott held, we were -- our stock price was at $18 and it's now grown to $85. That's a 21% CAGR on the stock price annually through his tenure.\nNow we're going to have to compare that to the last CFO that you just guessed Brian Radecki. He achieved a 23% compound annual growth rate and his predecessor CFO, Frank Carchedi turned in a 25% comp annual growth rate. However, but in fairness, the rule of small numbers with Carchedi, with Radecki because our cap rate was only $75 million when they began, you began at $5 billion.\nSo you're the hands-down winner on market cap. So our market cap when you started was $6 billion, it's now $35 billion. So you're just the victor. So well done, Scott, and you go into the CoStar CFO hall of fame. And now you've successfully summited CoStar mountain. God speed climbing all the other mountains around the world, your heart desires to climb, and I will take you up on the Manhattan. I'm not a big Manhattan guy, but I would look forward to a quality mix.\nSo with that sort of unprofessional [ drivel ], we'll turn it over to Q&A with our operator."

Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nFantastic job, Cyndi. Thank you. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2023 Earnings Call. Total revenue for the full year of '23 was $2.46 billion, a 13% increase over the full year of '22, coming in above the high end of our guidance range and above consensus estimates. Revenue for the fourth quarter of '23 was $640 million or 12% growth year-over-year. This is our 13th year in a row of double-digit revenue growth.\nWe turned in another very strong year in sales in '23, achieving our second highest net new bookings level ever of $286 million. This performance in the face of higher interest rates and demand shocks that kept property markets distressed in '23 demonstrates the resilience of our business. Our full year '23 adjusted EBITDA was $492 million and $130 million for the fourth quarter, ahead of both the high end of our guidance range and consensus estimates.\nI'm proud to say that we achieved a major profit milestone in 2023 in our commercial real estate information and marketplace businesses as we deliver adjusted EBITDA margins of 40% for the full year. For the past 3 years, thousands of our team members have worked with professionalism and committed focus to build the new homes.com the premier marketplace for buying, selling and renting homes in the United States.\nWe've conducted dozens of focus groups across the country listening to hundreds of agents, home buyers and home sellers, learning why they were so dissatisfied with the legacy offerings and what they hope for in a better residential portal. We heard loud and clear that brokers, agents, sellers, buyers and investors all dislike, real estate portals that use agents listings as baked to drill in homebuyers and then sell them off to other agents as leads with exorbitant commission splits.\nWe learned that home buyers buy a home in a community, not in isolation, so they want quality in-depth information on neighbored schools, parks, restaurants and local culture. Our product teams have designed what we believe is clearly the best residential real estate site in the world. The size clean, powerful, intuitive appealing and span free. Our software developers rose to the challenge and built a lightning fast, reliable platform that met the design specifications perfectly. Good job, Jerry and Zack and crew.\nOur content team comprised of hundreds of photographers, drone pilots, writers, voiceover talent musicians, geographers and video editors, captured the essence of tens of thousands of U.S. neighborhood schools and parks. Our team drove 2.6 million miles, captured 1.5 million images, shot 3.8 million video clips and conducted over 350,000 drone flights. This investment creates an experience that consumers love, strengthens our SEO traffic position and provides a significant advantage over competitive sites.\nOur efforts to grow traffic on Homes.com in 2023 and were a big success. Homes.com was the fastest-growing real estate website at the end of '23 with over 600% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, according to Google Analytics. Our residential network traffic in the fourth quarter totaled 95 million average monthly unique visitors, growing 94% year-over-year. We were easily in the second place in traffic by this measure, well ahead of the 66 million average monthly unique visitors at Realtor.com reported 2 weeks ago.\nOur largest competitors, Realtor and Zillow, reported either flat or declining traffic in the fourth quarter of '23. I believe we will be able to report even stronger traffic numbers in the near future.\nAfter building the site and traffic for over 2 years, last week, we launched a massive marketing campaign for Homes.com with 4 commercials during Super Bowl -- during the Super Bowl, an event that was watched by an estimated 123 million viewers. We ran a clever Apartments.com commercial in the first quarter with invading liens to set Jeff Goldblum up for a memorable came in the first homes.com ad in the second quarter, connecting the 2 brands. In the spots, Dan Levy plays that nephew inheriting is Uncle's business Homes.com and he sets out to reinvent the company and make it better than ever. He is supported by his hesitant sidekick played by SNL's Heidi Gartner. The spots draw attention to the value of our neighbor and school data that we offer home shoppers.\nThe Super Bowl was only the kickoff. In the week following the Super Bowl, we generated an estimated 560 million impressions across prime broadcast TV, syndicated TV, cable TV, morning shows, late night shows, major streaming audio and video platforms and of course, on Google in various forms. During the course of the year, we will be in the Olympics, the Oscars, the Emmy's, March Madness, the U.S. Open, the Stanley Cup playoffs, Major League Baseball and much more. We believe that we will generate approximately 80 billion impressions for Homes.com and reach 90% of U.S. households with our message in 2024.\nWe believe that no other competitor is investing close to what we're investing in this effort. We believe we can grow share. We believe that we have a better product and can significantly shift share and create a very attractive ROI for our investors. While we have excellent traffic numbers, we do not yet have the unaided awareness we need to sustain the top traffic position and to draw the volume of advertisers we seek. As we did with Apartments.com, our plan is to grow unaided awareness from the low single digits to more than 50%. That process will take time but we believe that will drive brand awareness, SEO, SEM efficiency, traffic, audience, customer demand and revenue.\nOn Monday, February 12, adapts the Super Bowl, we were ready to begin monetizing Homes.com selling memberships to agents a quarter earlier than we had previously communicated to you. As we did when we launched the new LoopNet, the new apartment -- the new Apartments.com, we deployed the entire CoStar Group sales force to sell Homes.com. Our goal is to catapult our growth forward and quickly capitalize on the momentum and exposure generated from our marketing campaign.\nOur 1,000-plus person sales force gives us instant national reach with experienced salespeople that live in many of the very same neighborhoods as the 1.5 million residential property agents that we intend to reach. We trained the full sales team in January and rolled out very attractive incentive structures that reward our sellers to sell both homes and their primary brands like CoStar or apartments with -- along with homes. The more they sell of both brands combined the more money they make.\nIn addition to leveraging the strength of our entire CoStar Group sales team, we are rapidly building a sales force dedicated to selling only Homes.com. We have accrued a vice president, sales managers and 100 sellers to date and intend to have over 300 account sales representatives in place by the end of the year. The response to our sales effort is phenomenal. From a standing start, we sold almost $5.2 million. It was $5 million an hour ago. $5.2 million annualized subscription revenue in just a little over a week.\nFrom a modest start on Monday, our sales climbed each day. And by Friday, we were selling $1.1 million in memberships in a single day. We sold more than 827 memberships so far with approximately 90% of the agents selecting 12-month memberships with the rest choosing a 6-month subscription. We've seen agents with larger portfolios signing up at price points in the thousands of dollars a month so far topping out at 7,400 a month. We have proposals out at much higher price points.\nWe also have agents with just a listing or so signing up at price points of only $100 to $200 a month. It doesn't matter if you're an agent with a large portfolio or a small portfolio. Either way, we're charging a small fraction of the serious ridiculously high 30% to 40% of commissions being charged by Zillow and Realtor.com to agents. We have only demoed 0.02% of the agents out there at this point. If we maintain this pace, we could sell around $200 million in annual reoccurring revenue in our first 12 months of selling.\nThe great news is that agents are definitely willing to spend for advertising exposure and they absolutely love the Homes.com \"your listing, your lead\" business model. Our direct field sales team, telephone sales teams and e-commerce sales channels are all producing results. We are initially focused on approximately 500,000 of the 1.5 million agents in the country. The annual revenue potential of this initial pool of agents for a basic Homes.com membership is over $2.5 billion. Knowing that Apartments.com basic silver ads comprise around 25% of all Apartments.com listings. If the same ratio were to apply to Homes.com then the potential opportunity could be as high as $10 billion.\nOverall, I'm very proud of what the team has worked so hard to accomplish with Homes.com in only 3 years and believe it will be the most successful product launch in CoStar Group history. This coming year also marks a turning point as we've reached the peak year of our residential investment with sales and revenue growing in the months ahead, we expect overall company profit levels to increase each quarter throughout the year and for the foreseeable future. In December, we successfully closed our acquisition of on the market in the United Kingdom for GBP 100 million. We believe that at the time of the acquisition on the market -- we believe that the time of the acquisition on the market was 1 of the top 3 residential portals in the U.K. GBP 100 million is 2% of the current leading portal, Rightmove's GBP 4.4 billion market cap. Rightmove currently has significantly more traffic than on the market. So a top priority for us is to grow the appeal of the site for homebuyers and sellers and grow traffic.\nJust 1 month in, we're making huge progress increasing January 2024 site traffic on the market by 81% year-over-year according to Google Analytics, within waste time. We believe that we are now the fastest-growing residential portal in the U.K. As our traffic has grown, our leads have also grown 81% since December of 2023. Rightmove announced at the recent Investor Day that they plan to grow revenue per agent by 42% to over GBP 2,000 per agent per month over the next 5 years. That is 10x on the market charges agents today. Rightmove is also committed to maintaining at least 70% profit margin levels through 2028 and leaving them a little room for investing in product and technology. You simply cannot make this stuff up, but you have to love it.\nIn sharp contrast, we plan to continue CoStar's long-standing strategy of investing and partnering with agents in the industry to generate and attract high-intent leads at a fraction of the cost of other U.K. portals while still achieving an attractive margin. Agents are telling us that they're insertional alternative to Rightmove's unfriendly agent listing fees and are supportive of in the market. Since acquisition, we have added over 1,000 agent advertisers and 57,000 listings to the site, again, in a matter of 2 months.\nOur long-term intention is to create the #1 property portal in the U.K. by combining CoStar's marketing and traffic generation expertise, the market-leading technology we have developed in Homes.com, CoStar's research and content generation capabilities and the strength of our established commercial real estate platform in the U.K. The European residential market opportunity is estimated to be $17 billion and we intend to build and expand our share of the residential opportunity in Europe, beginning with OnTheMarket.\nApartments.com had a phenomenal year. Revenue for the year was $914 million or 23% growth over $22 million. This is almost $170 million of incremental annual revenue, the largest contribution ever for any of our brands. As of January this year, Apartments.com is now not only the largest business by revenue at CoStar, but also officially our first $1 billion revenue run rate business. But here comes CoStar right behind it, and then Homes.\nThe sales team delivered exceptional results at Apartments.com in '23 with annualized net new bookings growing 34% over '22. We now have almost 71,000 communities advertising their availabilities on Apartments.com, which is 11% above the fourth quarter of '22 and almost twice that of our nearest competitor. Our highly productive sales team conducted over 623,000 quality meetings in '23, which was 37% higher than in 2022 and a new record. Our customers love our sales team rewarding them with a 94% -- 94 Net Promoter Score rating for the full year of 2023.\nWe continue to expand our mid-market sales effort by growing our sales team and developing targeted product offerings that suit the needs of midsized communities. Net productivity for our sales team increased by 14% in 2023 as compared to 2022, which resulted in a 44% growth in properties under 50 units advertising on Apartments.com. The opportunity in the small property sector is massive at almost $7 billion, and our penetration in this sector is still below 5%.\nOur award-winning marketing campaign featuring the wonderful and very funny Jeff Goldblum as Brad Bellflower, inventor of the [ Apart Internet ], entertained audiences and delivered over 12 billion media impressions and almost 1 billion visits to our websites during the year. We jump-started our 2024 media campaign with a Super Bowl ad. This is year 10 of our brand-building marketing campaign since we launched Apartments.com back in 2015.\nThis consistent long-term brand marketing strategy continues to prove successful as we finished the year with 52% unaided brand awareness with renters in the fourth quarter, 6 percentage points above our closest competitor. Based on recent study by market research for Market Connections, industry decision-makers representing 15,000 communities named Apartments.com as the most widely used advertising solution at 74%. The research also found that Apartments.com was the most well-known advertising solution beating our closest competitor by 25%.\nThe Apartments.com brand is stronger than it's ever been, delivering almost 1 billion visits to our websites and 43 million average monthly unique visitors during 2023 according to Google Analytics. Our customers care about the number of potential renters utilizing our site every month to find a place to live, making unique visitors a key metric. For the past 8 quarters in a row, Apartments.com held the #1 position in terms of monthly average unique visitors when comparing to our traffic to Zillow's publicly disclosed average monthly unique visitors.\nOverall economic conditions are expected to remain favorable for rental property advertising. Vacancy rates increased in 2023 for 3 to 5 star properties by 160 basis points to 9.1% and are expected to increase in 2014 as new unit deliveries are expected to remain high in 2024 at approximately 470,000 units. We expect to see Apartments.com generate strong double-digit revenue growth in 2024, somewhere in the high teens or more, which is balanced to some degree by the level of Homes.com sales effort, this top-performing advertising juggernaut not delivers in 2024.\nCoStar delivered another strong quarter with revenues of $925 million and 11% year-over-year growth rate. Fourth quarter revenue grew 8% year-over-year to $238 million. We have never seen this level of positive revenue growth for CoStar while we're at the bottom of a severe property market downturn. The strength of CoStar continues to be our ability to expand the information content and analytic capabilities in the product to diversify into bigger and broader customer sets like owners, lenders and corporate tenants.\nIn '23, we sold twice as much to the owner, lender and corporate tenant sectors than we did to brokers. Net sales in the fourth quarter to owner, lender and tenant customers grew almost 30% compared to the third quarter of this year. The CoStar Lender product had an exceptional year in '23, nearly doubling our customer base and delivering over 5x the revenue that we realized in '22. We now have over 1,000 active users for our lender product. Our opportunity pipeline is large with over 300 institutions progressing through our sales process.\nOur competitive data advantage has helped us win virtually every deal versus the main competitors in this space, including winning 7 of the largest CRE lenders in the industry. Looking ahead, there is significant opportunity to expand the CoStar lender addressable market beyond our initial focus on depository institutions as regional banks and credit unions tighten up their credit lending requirements or commercial earning requirements, private lenders are stepping in to fill the void.\nWe believe the total addressable market for our expanded target customer set is over $600 million. We are currently serving less than 15% of this opportunity and have plans to increase our sales and product teams to accelerate our growth next year. We released our hospitality benchmarking product in the CoStar platform in '23 and are rapidly migrating our STR customer base into the CoStar environment. Over 600 customers are now using the benchmark product in CoStar with the remaining customers to be migrated in the first half of '24.\nMore than 18,000 users are now in CoStar managing their hotel's performance and optimizing the revenue through the reimagined tools and additional analytic capabilities. As a result of the movement of STR benchmarking at CoStar, revenues from our hospitality benchmark subscriptions will now be reported as part of CoStar, similar to our integrated approach of our lender products for financial institutions being CoStar. The transition of STR benchmarking to CoStar in '24 is a major milestone for our road map to build the full suite of STR product capabilities in CoStar.\nWe plan to incorporate forward-booking information, complete P&L benchmarking and international market performance this year and the next. STR overall had an incredible year. '23 revenue grew 13% over last year, delivering the highest annual ever result since we bought STR in '19. The team had a record sales quarter to end the year growing 54% over the fourth quarter of last year. Subscription revenue grew 17% and 23% over the prior year and now makes up 81% of the overall revenue, the highest percentage since the acquisition. STR's quarterly renewal rate is now in a very impressive 98%.\nWith the full capability of CoStar and STR combined, we expect to unlike increased value for our customers and grow strong double-digit revenue towards what we believe is a $300 million hospitality market opportunity. Overall, we remain very confident in the strength and value of CoStar's platform and our growth performance in a downturn. Renewal rates for CoStar remain rock solid at 92% and and we're seeing early indications of increased leasing and sales activity as we move into the first quarter of 2024. Although it's too early to call a recovery in the property markets, we expect solid mid-single-digit revenue growth from CoStar in '24.\nLoopNet revenue was $265 million in '23, up 15% year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range. uiSignature ad listings were up 11% in the fourth quarter, delivering more traffic and leads to our customers. International revenue in the fourth quarter was up 33% and net new bookings were up 186% over the fourth quarter of '22. LoopNet continues to be the #1 listing site for commercial properties. Average monthly unique visits, the global network in the fourth quarter were up 11% year-over-year and was 7x the traffic of the next largest competitor.\nIn the U.K., LoopNet is now the #1 dedicated commercial property marketplace by traffic after launching only a little over a year ago. We continue to expand internationally given our success to date and the size of the opportunity. We plan to launch LoopNet in France and Spain in 2024. 2023 was a year of growth for the LoopNet sales team. At the end of '22, only 40% of the sales were managed by LoopNet dedicated sales representatives. And we've now effectively transitioned to 80% of those accounts from CoStar reps to LoopNet reps.\nThe LoopNet sales team is focused on ramping up activity face-to-face meetings and NPS scores following the success formula of Apartments.com. As a result, we expect to deliver increased sales productivity and bookings as we move through 2024. 10x continues to demonstrate the value of our digital sales. platform for our commercial properties. In the year when sales transactions were down 49%, Ten-X brought $4.5 billion in assets to the platform which was a modest decline of 9% relative to the market's steeper decline. We delivered a 52% trade rate in '23 and nearly double the off-line trade rate, but below the rates we achieved in '22.\nOverall, Ten-X revenue finished the year around 20% below prior year levels. Despite this decline, we increased our share of property sales in the $1 million to $10 million asset category during the year, moving more transactions from offline to online. The market outlook for the coming year remains uncertain, although interest rates have stabilized in near term, bid-ask spreads and debt constraints remain a challenge.\nRegardless of these uncertainties in the first 45 days of 2024 and our trade rate and number of bidders per asset have increased from the fourth quarter of '23 levels. There are still billions of dollars of transactions occurring each year in the $1 billion to $10 billion asset category, which we continue to pursue as part of what we believe is a $3 billion long-term market opportunity.\nThe real estate capital markets in the fourth are continue to be impacted by higher borrowing costs, tight lending standards and deteriorating real estate fundamentals. In '23, transaction volumes were down 49% and price declines range from 10% to 35% across all sectors. Banks continue to slow their loan growth as property fundamentals decline and delinquencies rise. With interest rates expected to decline later this year, current expectations are for sales volumes to increase compared to last year. We saw some early indications in January with sales volumes rising 6.4%.\nThe office sector continues to be the most challenged with 58 million square feet of negative absorption in '23. Absorption since pandemic now sits at negative 178 million square feet office attendants is 60% of what it was before 2020, though that understates demand since hybrid work requires higher peak use. The market sits at a record high, 13.5% vacancy rate. A silver lining is the decline in construction starts, which we predict will eventually result in a shortage of premium office space.\nSince our 15-year lease at our Washington, D.C. headquarters location is set to expire in 2025, we assessed more than 25 viable sites in the Greater Washington, D.C. metro area. We ultimately decided to purchase a 5-star trophy lead platinum office building located at 121 Wilson Boulevard in Arlington, Virginia. We were able to purchase the building and the land lease for a significant discount to both recent valuations and current replacement cost. We also received nearly $7 million in both tax and economic incentives.\nWhile past performance does not ensure future performance, you might recall that back in 2010 during the great financial crisis, we acquired our 1331L Street location for $42 million, a then significant discount to replacement cost and sold it within 2 years in the sale leaseback for $101 million, more than twice what we bought it for. We are betting that the office market is at a nadar again. we will likely execute a sales leaseback on 1201 Wilson Boulevard at some point in the future.\nThe industrial sector has also seen a historic wave of new construction, push vacancies up from all-time lows. But at 5.7%, industrial vacancies are still at half their peak levels. Industrial demand has remained positive, though, and the rise in vacancy should be mitigated by a pullback in construction starts in the second half of '23. The retail sector continued to be the best performing in the fourth quarter with both positive absorption and limited new construction. The result was vacancy rates dropping to 4% an all-time low. Conditions should remain healthy for retail with under construction at near all-time level lows.\nThe U.S. hotel sector ended the year with RevPAR growth of 4.9%, outpacing inflation and being driven by ADR growth of 4.3% and occupancy growth of 0.6%. Robust group demand and corporate transient demand were the primary contributors to growth. RevPAR is expected to continue to outpace inflation in '24 with 4.1% growth projected.\nIn the U.S. residential sector, mortgage rates have come down from 7.8% to 6.6%, but rates are still high enough to prevent homeowners from selling, creating low inventory of homes for sale and low levels of homes being sold. But if interest rates continue to drop, affordability will improve and even a drop to 6% would mean home ownership would become affordable for an additional 37 million Americans.\nIn the context of a distressed commercial real estate market, CoStar turned in an outstanding performance in '23, growing revenue 13% with record levels of profitability in our CRE business. It is clear that CoStar Group's diversified subscription business is highly resilient in a distressed property cycle. We believe that we will improve profits and margins again in '24 and to $1.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA with 42% margins.\nOur entire team has worked extraordinarily hard in building the Homes.com platform and business. We believe that we just launched CoStar Group's next transformative billion-dollar business. In the conversations we are having with brokerage leaders and agents, they tell us they are 100% behind our year listing your lead business model. but gets better for brokers, agents, home buyers and home sellers.\nI am thrilled to see that support with $5.2 million in annualized subscription sales in just the first 6 business days of selling Homes.com. The first half of '24 is the peak investment for Homes.com and we believe profits and margins will start showing significant growth in the second half of '24.\nAfter my brief remarks, I'm going to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler. Are you still there, Scott?\n\nScott T. Wheeler\n\nCFO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nStill here, ready to go. Thank you for those brief remarks. Okay. So clearly, 2023 was a very strong year for the company, but that sure feels like a long time ago, doesn't it? These last few weeks have really been like turning a page when you get into the launch of Homes.com the advertising brand campaign, the selling efforts. I think 2024 is going to be a great year, I can already tell.\nBut first, let's wrap up on 2023. The full year revenue growth was an impressive 13% versus prior year, which was ahead of our guidance and forecast. What I found interesting was that 2023 was the 13th consecutive year of double-digit growth, and we grew 13%. Did you know that? And last year, when our 12th consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth, we grew 12%. I wonder what that means this year. We'll see.\nLet's not get ahead of ourselves, but we actually turned into great revenue performance in 2023. Profit results also came in above expectations with full year adjusted EBITDA at $492 million and 20% margin, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. What I think most is impressive is that you can still see our core CoStar business delivering 40% profit margins and a record high 45% in the fourth quarter before you consider the investments we're making moving into the residential sector.\nI think it's important we keep an eye on the underlying strength of this business portfolio. as we exit the investment phase of Homes.com particularly, and we'll expect profitability to increase, as Andy mentioned, once again as we move through 2024. So looking at our revenue by our different businesses, Apartments.com grew 23% in the fourth quarter and the full year, in line with our expectations. Apartments.com added twice the amount of revenue in '23 than its nearest competitor and increased revenue in the fourth quarter of 23% sequentially over the third quarter, which demonstrates both the strength of our product platform and our 97% subscription model in Apartments.com.\nOur competitors are still in the game of chasing transaction revenue, which is why their revenue cycle is up in the middle of the year and then drops back in the fourth quarter. These transactions sure feel good during an upswing in market demand but will leave you weak and unable to invest in a cyclical downturn. We expect Apartments.com revenue growth rate somewhere in the 17% to 18% range for the full year of 2024 and we're estimating 20% revenue growth for the first quarter. We expect our renewal pricing levels to moderate this coming year as inflation in the economy has come down.\nAlso, we continue to grow aggressively in the smaller property space, which carries lower price points relative to institutional scale communities. We're going to see increased levels of productivity in 2024 for our large and more experienced sales force and apartments. Now the question is, will this increased output benefit Apartments or Homes.com? So far, the sales team is proving very effective at selling both. CoStar revenue grew 8% in the fourth quarter and 11% for the full year of 2023 at the top end of our full year guidance range.\nAs Andy mentioned, in 2024, we will report STR benchmarking revenue in CoStar as the STR product is now fully integrated into the CoStar platform and customer migrations will be complete this year. Including our benchmarking revenue, we expect full year and first quarter CoStar revenue growth in the range of 11% to 12%. So in 2024, CoStar will become our second brand business producing over $1 billion in revenue. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for the STR revenue shift, we expect CoStar revenue growth of between 7% to 8%, consistent with what we indicated in our third quarter earnings call back in October.\nLoopNet revenue grew 12% in the fourth quarter, exceeding our 11% guidance. Revenue for the full year was $265 million or 15% increase over prior year at the top end of our guidance range of 14% to 15%. We expect to see first quarter LoopNet revenue growth in the range of 8% to 9% as the sales results for LoopNet in the fourth quarter were lower than earlier in the year following the full account transitions from CoStar to LoopNet. We expect our LoopNet sales team to make meaningful contributions to selling both LoopNet and Homes.com in 2024. So accordingly, our LoopNet 2024 forecast range assumes revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range.\nRevenue from Information Services grew 9% for the full year as expected. As a reminder, Information Services includes STR, Real Estate Manager, our original lender products and a few smaller information-related products Thomas Daily and Business Immo in Europe. In 2024, a big piece of this revenue, the STR benchmarking will move up into CoStar. Also, as we continue to grow our integrated CoStar lender product, more and more of the original lender products residing in information services are also moving into CoStar.\nThis is good news, of course, as we are executing on our strategy to integrate all of the information services products inside the CoStar platform. When the dust settles on all this, we expect Information Services revenue for 2024 in the range of approximately $130 million to $135 million, with $33 million of revenue in the first quarter. Our Real Estate Manager business is now the largest single component of Information Services, which we expect to grow in the mid- to high single digits in 2024 for Real Estate Manager.\nOther Marketplace revenue was $134 million for the full year of 2023, ahead of our expectations for the fourth quarter, with modestly higher transaction revenues from Ten-X. Our subscription marketplace businesses, lands and business for sale contributed solid double-digit growth as they do year in and year out. We expect similar outcomes in 2024 with revenue relatively flat to the 2023 overall and first quarter revenue a little below $30 million.\nOur 2024 revenue outlook includes double-digit revenue growth in the subscription marketplace businesses and a rather conservative view, I must say, of Ten-X transaction revenue. We've not built any transaction market recovery assumption into 2024. So if a recovery does materialize in the months ahead, then we should benefit.\nResidential revenue, I saved the best for last. I can finally talk about forward growth expectations for Homes.com. First, to round off on 2023, our residential revenue was $10 million in the fourth quarter and $44 million for the full year of 2023, in line with our expectations for the legacy Homesnap revenue and inclusive of a small amount of revenue from the OnTheMarket acquisition. Our 2024 residential revenue outlook includes 3 components. These are Homes.com, OnTheMarket and the legacy residential products formerly known as Homesnap.\nHomes.com is generating revenue. I've been waiting 3 years to say that. I'm just going to have to say it again, Homes.com is generating revenue. I think it definitely felt better the second time. So it was exciting to see our first Homes.com membership product, putting points on the sales board this year. We have every brand sales team in every city across the country, competing to sell Homes.com and this is certainly going to be fun to watch.\nI think the CoStar team is a little bit salty still from having Apartments reach $1 billion in revenue first, and they are currently leading the Homes.com top-selling contest ahead of Apartments. What's fun is that every sales team, no matter how big or small, has a shot at victory. Pound for pound, I'm seeing Lands.com sales team is ahead of everyone in terms of net sales per person of Homes.com and their team is 1/10 the size of apartments. Momentum is certainly building and all 9 of our brand sales teams have contributed net new sales for Homes.com.\nOf course, it's very early in the year and with every salesperson in CoStar incentivized to sell both their core brand products as well as Homes.com, it's a bit challenging, as you might imagine, to pin down the sales and revenue outlook by brand this year. Will we sell more Homes.com or will we sell more of our commercial brand products? It's really too early to tell, but I believe we are going to sell a whole lot of both. It's a great problem to have and regardless of the specific mix of products we sell, we believe that 2024 will be the best net sales year in the company's history by a wide margin.\nWell, let's look at what happened the last time we took this approach, which was back in February 2015, and when we pointed the entire sales force at the launch of Apartments.com. As we came into 2015, our total net sales bookings for the company were growing around 15% year-over-year. In 2015, with everyone selling our new Apartments.com ad products in addition to their core branded products, our net new bookings increased almost 80% with sales of all brands growing year-over-year.\nNow to par with Mr. Florance a few moments ago, we all know that past performance is not indicative of future results. However, there are a number of factors working in our favor with Homes.com. We know the size of the residential market opportunity is multiple times bigger than multifamily. We just launched the biggest marketing campaign in real estate history, 4x the size of our Apartments.com initial marketing campaign. And nobody else in the industry is competing with a \"your listing, your lead\" business model that doesn't try to take agent commissions, but lets them buy advertising exposure to sell their listings. I think these are all very positive relative to our Apartments.com experience back in 2015.\nSo taking our best educated guess, our 2024 forecast assumes revenue contribution from Homes.com memberships in the $50 million to $60 million range in 2024, starting from 0 in the first quarter and exiting the year with an approximate $100 million quarterly run rate. Now you might think my forecast looks a bit lumpy as you keep hearing Andy talk about updating our sales efforts every minute over here. But one step at a time, we're just getting started.\nWe expect OnTheMarket, our new U.K. residential business, to deliver approximately $40 million in revenue in 2024. First quarter revenue is expected to be in the $10 million range. The results of OnTheMarket were insignificant to our overall financial results in 2023 as the acquisition closed in the middle of December. We expect legacy residential products to continue to decline in 2024 as we sell customers Homes.com memberships. We expect full year 2024 revenue of around $20 million from the legacy products.\nSo combining all the components of our residential business, our forecast assumes revenue in the range of $110 million to $120 million in 2024, starting the year with a little over $15 million in the first quarter and growing to over $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Year-over-year total revenue growth is expected to be 150% and year-over-year organic revenue growth in residential is around 70% in 2024.\nSo to wrap up on 2023, net income was $96 million for the fourth quarter and $375 million for all of 2023, an increase of around $5 million compared to 2022. It's nice to see net income improve while we are in a major investment cycle, and that's thanks to our net interest income, which was an impressive $220 million in 2023. We earned roughly 5% on around a $4.2 billion net cash balance for the year.\nLet's talk about a few of our performance metrics. First, with our sales force, which totaled approximately 1,160 people at the end of the year. with modest increases in 2023 focused on our marketplace businesses of Apartments.com and LoopNet. Sales force expansion in 2024 will be primarily concentrated in our Homes.com residential business. Contract renewal rates were 90% in the fourth quarter of 2023. And these remain strong at 95% for customers who have been subscribers for 5 years or longer. Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 81% for the fourth quarter of 2022, up from 80% in the prior year.\nLooking ahead to 2024, we expect full year revenue to range from $2.75 billion to $2.77 billion, implying an annual growth rate of between 12% and 13%. First quarter 2024 revenue is expected to range from $645 million to $650 million, representing revenue growth of 11% year-over-year at the midpoint. 2024 adjusted EBITDA is expected in the range of $170 million to $190 million, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA margin rate of around 7% for the entire year.\nFirst quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA is expected to dip slightly into negative territory as we launch our brand marketing campaign ahead of the revenue growth in Homes.com. We expect to see positive margins return after the first quarter and growth for the remainder of the year with adjusted EBITDA margins in the 12% to 13% range in the second half of 2024 and exiting much higher than that.\nOur financial strategy for 2024 is to once again drive operating leverage and profit generation in our commercial businesses while we fund our residential marketplace strategy. We expect to increase profit margins in our commercial portfolio which should be generating approximately $1.1 billion of profit before investments in Homes.com and OnTheMarket in 2024.\nWe're off to a strong start with Homes.com sales this year with plans to increase our total residential investment levels in 2024 to support the brand launch and build our sales capabilities. 2024 will be the peak net investment year for residential, which includes our full marketing campaign OnTheMarket in the U.K. and our teams reaching full strength in content, technology and sales.\nOur level of capital expenditures is expected to increase in 2024 from around $150 million in 2023 to around $800 million in 2024 as we enter the big construction years for our Richmond campus and at our new headquarters building in Arlington, Virginia. The operating capital apart from the building projects is expected in the $40 million to $45 million range in 2024 and which is consistent with the same spending levels in 2023. Our forecast for net income -- net interest income is around $200 million for 2024, which takes into account our increased capital spend and the possible interest rate reductions in the years ahead.\nIn summary, I'm very proud of the exceptional results we delivered in 2023 during the year, complicated by high interest rates inflation and continued economic uncertainties. We remain focused on our strategic investment in residential markets while producing record profit levels in our established commercial businesses. With monetization of Homes.com this year, we are adding another strong double-digit growth revenue stream to our brand portfolio and moving past the peak of the residential investment cycle, and onto the next phase of profit growth and profitability improvement for the company.\nOverall, we're making great progress towards our long-term revenue and profit objectives and remain confident in our ability to grow Homes.com to become yet another high-margin billion dollar revenue business for CoStar.\nHaving said all that, I think it's time to turn the call back over to our operator for the question-and-answer session."

Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nGood evening, everyone and thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Revenue for the third quarter of 2023 was $625 million or 12% growth year-over-year. Our commercial real estate information and marketplace businesses grew revenue at an impressive 14% this quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. We also delivered strong net new bookings of $65 million in the third quarter, with CoStar sales improving sequentially and Apartments.com coming off a seasonally strong sales record they set in the second quarter.\nWe've now reported 50 straight quarters of double-digit revenue growth, stretching all the way back first quarter of 2011 as we came out of the great financial crisis. This is a remarkable achievement. Over the past 12-plus years, we've generated 21% compound annual revenue growth, increasing revenue tenfold from $230 million to over $2.3 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. As we move into the fourth quarter, we are generating almost $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA annualized from our commercial real estate business. We have diversified our revenue across countercyclical marketplaces such as LoopNet and Apartments.com while diversifying CoStar product revenue into broader vertical markets such as owners and lenders. Alongside our diversification efforts, we remain committed to building a subscription-only revenue portfolio across the business.\nThe results we see today is an extremely resilient and steady growth business. even during a time when the property markets are in a hard down cycle as they are now. To produce these exceptional results, we made big investment bets on expanding our geographical footprint or entering new adjacent segments. These investments, for example, such as expanding CoStar into all the U.S. cities, Canada and the U.K. or entering the apartment marketplace business though clear to us, we're not universally popular at the time when we were in the investment phase they required. We pursue growth investments regardless because we are singularly focused on the enormous value creation we see in meeting the demand for digital information, analytics and marketing of the $300 trillion real estate asset class globally.\nDigitizing real estate is unlocking major value, and we are absolutely in the earliest innings of this opportunity. I believe that CoStar's group's revenue will grow tenfold again over the next 12 years because of the careful significant calculated investments we're making that optimize our competitive advantages and capabilities. We firmly believe that Homes.com can compete and win in the residential opportunity. Just as we lead today in all the prior asset class we have entered in the past, including office, industrial, retail, hospitality, multifamily, land, et cetera.\nHomes.com delivered over 100 million unique visitors in the month of September, according to Google Analytics. That's an increase of 1,290% and over the same period a year ago, making Homes.com the fastest-growing residential marketplace in the United States. Our residential network traffic, which consists of homes and apartments, reached over 140 million monthly unique visitors in September which is more than Realtor and Redfin combined based on the traffic reported in their most recent earnings announcements. According to [ Comscore ], we are clearly now the second most heavily trafficked residential network by a wide margin with monthly unique visitors, 35% higher than realtor.com and 90% higher than Redfin in September. Looking at the trend lines, we are in a convergence path with the historically most traffic site.\nTwo short years ago, when we acquired Homes.com we set out to deliver an agent-friendly site that homebuyers love. I believe that reaching over 100 million monthly unique visitors in September at Homes.com is evidence that we are achieving that goal. Our returning users have increased almost 900% over September of last year, which is a testament to our success of building rich content and providing a great consumer experience. The traffic generation plans for Homes.com are still in the early stages, and we've already delivered double the 50 million monthly unique visitors that we initially targeted. In the Apple Appstore homes.com has climbed from 136 under lifestyle to now become #19. Homes.com is now ranked above Realtor Redfin [ Trulia ] and even Apartments.com in the App Store. When we announced that we were going to build Homes.com into a leading residential portal, the #1 risk factor called out was skepticism that we could build the traffic required to compete.\nEarlier this year, media reports speculated that CoStar Group was in talks to acquire realtor.com for approximately $3 billion. If that was true, the primary objective in acquiring realtor.com could have been to take the #2 traffic position in the United States. Given that, that speculation did not come to pass, we might have been good stewards of our shareholders $3 billion that we saved by building the traffic to Homes.com for a fraction of the cost of buying it. Clearly, successfully building traffic is no longer Homes.com's primary risk factor. At this point, shrewed investors seeking a new risk factor to replace the now reduced traffic risk factor will now need to turn to monetization as the next key risk factor. Unlike its competitors, Homes.com has never invested in any material brand marketing. Because of that, Homes.com unaided awareness is in the low single digits, while our competitors unaided awareness is in the mid- to high double digits. When we acquired Apartments.com, it similarly had a single-digit unaided awareness problem. But through a persistent creative branding, we've grown Apartments.com unaided awareness to the industry-leading unaided awareness of 53%.\nAchieving significant unaided awareness is important because it improves [ SEO and ] optimizes SCM investments and facilitate sales of advertising products to prospects. It is essential to build unaided awareness before we begin monetizing. We do not believe that building unaided awareness is our most significant risk factor. We anticipate selling Homes.com memberships in the second quarter of 2024.\nCoStar Group has created dozens of successful monetization strategies, and we believe that our planned monetization strategy for Homes.com will become dozen plus one of our successful monetization strategy. When we acquired Homesnap, we quickly built a centralized sales team to sell their Facebook ads. While we did not believe in the long-term value of reselling low retention low-margin Facebook ads, we did very quickly scale a sales force and sold tens of millions of dollars worth of ads. We look forward to doing it again with Homes.com which we will believe will be a much better product with higher margin and higher retention.\nWilliam Blair recently published a paper on October 20, titled Competition Intensifying Among Home Search Portals. There are some interesting call-outs from their survey of residential agents that are worth noting. Combined spend and potential efficiency gained from agents marketing their properties and services is $15 billion to $20 billion in the United States. Most of the agent's marketing spend today is not on our competing portals. It's like print. Most patients do not spend marketing dollars with Zillow. Most agents do not spend marketing dollars with realtor.com.\nMost of Zillow's clients feel that Zillow will become less important to their lead generation efforts in the next 1 to 2 years. 60% of Zillow's Premier Agent client surveys stated that the value of the product is declining, and 5% said it's improving. So 60% said the value was decline and 5% said it was improving. 94% of Zillow's Premier Agent customers said that they're very open or somewhat open to alternative sources for lead generation. Sounds good to me. Even before we begin selling premium services, we're creating real value for agents. As a result of our traffic growth and superior your listing your lead business model, I believe we are already generating millions of leads for agents that are converting to commissions for them. I'm encouraged by the feedback with one agent saying that 85% of their total sales come from being able to build their brand and collaborate with sellers and buyers on the Homes.com network. From these leads, we estimate that Homes.com is helping agents generate billions and billions of dollars in annual commissions already while saving them billions in referral fees.\nLast week, Sitzer/Burnett versus NAR lawsuit went to trial. We could be seeing the biggest change to the residential real estate industry in recent or even intermediate history or long-term history. Sitzer/Burnett and other class action lawsuits are challenging the legality of the buyer broker commission rule, which requires the home seller to pay the homebuyers agent fees. Plaintiffs are seeking damages of more than $40 billion, implying the nationwide damages of more than $400 billion. Several defendants have already agreed to collectively pay $138 million in settlements and to changes to the rule.\nThe first generation real estate portals leverage this threatened buyer broker commission rule to divert listing leads from all the agents in the market to a small handful of agents who are then required to split their commissions with the portal. Often, that's the model. Many agents and brokers strongly resent that model. Now that Homes.com is one of the most heavily trafficked portals, there is a strong and viable alternative for lead generation available to agents that does not require various commission splits. Unlike the first-generation portals, Homes.com business model is not negatively impacted by the potential end of the buyer broker commission rule. Momentum around our residential strategy is clearly building with the early successes of Homes.com and there is potential for dramatic change in the industry soon. Our confidence in the success of Homes.com and timing is increasing, the need to time the movement that we see happening. For these reasons, we have decided to slightly accelerate the pace and level of our investments into Homes.com.\nLast week, we announced our offer to acquire on the market, the third most traffic residential property portal in the U.K. for approximately GBP 100 million. Doesn't seem like we thought that number out carefully. How could I just round out to GBP 100 million. Okay, we did actually. On the market, it was founded by agents in 2013 to provide a competitive alternative to the existing U.K. portals which the agents felt represented duopoly extracting economic rent from them. We believe that Rightmove's ARPA is 21,000 while ours is less than 1,000 so we feel confident that we can profitably deliver the U.K.'s most cost-effective solution over the long term. On the market has successfully developed a large network of agents and property listings by taking an agent-friendly approach.\nToday, on the market has over 13,000 agent advertisers and attracts high-intent leads at a fraction of the cost of other U.K. portals. Our intention with the acquisition of on the market is to create the #1 property portal by combining the strengths of our leading commercial U.K. commercial property site -- I said U.K. twice there -- CoStar and our technology platform, driving Homes.com with on the market's large network of agents. So taking our 2 decades of experience with commercial property sites in the U.K., along with the technology driving the successes of Homes.com and combining it with on the market's large share of agents in the United Kingdom to create a very valuable solution.\nWe believe the acquisition of the on the market represents an attractive and efficient entry point into the $8 trillion United Kingdom residential property market. CoStar Group has a proven track record of acquiring strong-performing property portals that are not the #1 players and investing and building them into the most successful portals serving their market. We intend to apply a similar approach with on the market as we plan to invest GBP 46.5 million into sales and marketing in the first full year following the commencement of the integration of the portal into CoStar's network of marketplaces.\nThat amount represents 6x on the market's current annual media spend and more than 3x the current annual media spend of Rightmove. The sales and marketing investments in the first stage of a multiyear investment program to drive consumers to on-the-market portal with the goal of significantly increasing the quality of valuable leads to on-the-market agent clients at good prices. We believe that real estate portals across Europe will soon be entering a period of consolidation. We did not want to approach that emerging opportunity by jumping into buying assets that are priced to perfection. Private equity firms are more likely to seek to acquire portals in the #1 position at elevated multiples because they don't have the same strategic value add with which to grow share. We believe that as a strategic with extensive proprietary technology and expertise, we can create more value for shareholders by acquiring good or great assets at excellent values that may benefit from our track record of acquiring and growing traffic share and revenue in high potential portals.\nWe believe that Europe represents a $17 billion revenue opportunity. Currently, we estimate that publicly traded and large private portals in Europe have a market cap of about $30 billion or so. We also believe that those declined about 10% when we announced the acquisition of on the market or since we -- we don't know that's related, but there has been a decline since we announced the acquisition of on the market. Apartments.com continues to deliver impressive quarterly results with revenue of $235 million in the third quarter, a 24% increase over the third quarter of last year. Apartments.com is now our largest business by revenue and is on track to reach $1 billion in revenue run rate in the first quarter of 2024.\nNet new bookings increased year-over-year for the seventh consecutive quarter while communities advertising their spaces on Apartments.com grew to more than [ 69,000 ] in the third quarter, the highest tally ever and 15% above the third quarter of 2022. Apartments.com achieved an all-time high in unaided brand awareness in the third quarter of 53%, proving the strength of our brand and the value of our long-term commitment to marketing investments. Apartments.com attracts the highest quality potential renters with average monthly unique visitors of $45 million in the third quarter according to Google Analytics, outperforming the market on a year-over-year basis. visitors spend twice -- 2x more time on our site per visit and our leads convert to leases 3.4x more than our closest competitor according to rent dynamics. Our sales team continues to deliver strong results, conducting the highest number of quality meetings ever at 163,000 meetings in the quarter. There's an increase of 36% over the same quarter last year all while maintaining a Net Promoter Score of [ 95 ].\nOur expansion of the mid-market sales team continues to deliver productive results. We have more sellers, increasing levels of productivity and new flexible listing plans, all of which result in a 48% increase in properties under 50 units advertising on Apartments.com. The size and strength of our sales team continues to differentiate us from the competition. As we hear about competitors shrinking their sales teams, we continue to add and train new sales reps each month to capitalize on the large opportunity we see clearly in front of us. We continue to see favorable overall economic conditions for rental property advertising, Vacancy rates continue to go up with 3 to 5 star property vacancy rates increasing 200 basis points over prior year to 8.1%. New unit deliveries are expected to continue at or near all-time highs through the end of the year.\nFor these reasons, we expect to see Apartments.com revenue grow -- growth to continue at 24% in the fourth quarter of 2023. CoStar revenue for the second quarter was $233 million or a 10% increase over the same period last year and in line with our expectations. Our focus on selling to owners, lenders, investors and corporates continues to yield great returns and most of our sales activities are now focused on these high-value customers. Even though the property markets remain as some of the worst in decades, we still see high levels of engagement and usage of CoStar by our customers. Our subscriber count remains well above 180,000 this year, and our renewal rates increased sequentially in the third quarter and are now above 93%.\nThere were 140,000 distinct logins to CoStar in September, our second highest month of log-ins this year. Property searches were up 13% compared to the same period last year. Our sales force remains strong and very active, and our attrition rates are at an all-time low. Demand for our new lender product continues to be strong. We now have 230 customers on the CoStar Lender platform, which is more than double what we had this time last year. Our year-to-date net new bookings have increased 45% versus last year. CoStar lender is now helping clients manage over $620 billion of debt or 14% of the outstanding $4.4 trillion in nonsecuritized commercial property debt. And still, we have significant opportunity to expand into the market further. I'm encouraged by continued strong customer engagement on CoStar and the success of these new product capabilities. Our ability to continue to generate solid revenue growth and sell through the current downturn is a testament to the value of CoStar at all points in the property cycle.\nLoopNet revenue was $68 million for the quarter, up 15% year-over-year and slightly ahead of our guidance forecast. LoopNet International revenue for the third quarter was up compared to the same quarter last year as we continue to work towards the launch of LoopNet in France and Spain. Office vacancy rates increased again in the third quarter, now over 13% and in phantom, vacancy rates are dramatically higher, creating countercyclical momentum with the need to advertise empty commercial property space. Signature ad listings in the third quarter were up 16% compared to last year, and we see more customers move up from the basic silver-level ads to the higher-performing LoopNet's signature ads which delivered more traffic and lead flow to their properties.\nLoopNet generated 14 million monthly unique average visitors for the third quarter in a row, an increase of 10% year-over-year. We have a new sales leader in place for LoopNet, [ Brandon Lou ], who has extensive experience leading both CoStar and LoopNet teams and his experience with [ 10x ] as well. We also changed the LoopNet dedicated sales team commission plan to now focus on both sales and service, which will be backed up by our activity metrics and Net Promoter Score tracking capabilities. Since making these changes, sales activities, including customer service meetings have almost doubled from the prior quarter. We continue to expand our dedicated LoopNet sales team while shifting more and more of the direct customer count responsibilities over to LoopNet from the CoStar sales team. I'm confident in the long-term opportunity for continued strong revenue growth in LoopNet.\nSTR revenue growth was 12% compared to the third quarter of last year, with subscription revenue growth accelerating to 22%. STR had another incredible sales quarter with their second highest sales ever growing 156% in the third quarter versus the same quarter last year. We have now reached a record 78,000 hotels participating with historical data and over [ 100 ] -- I'm sorry, over 16,000 hotels providing forward-looking data. The more hotels we have contributing the better data we are able to provide to the industry, which is evidenced by our impressive 97% renewal rate.\nWe've now migrated over 300 customers to the new CoStar Hospitality benchmarking product, up from 60 last quarter with another 200 underway. One customer referred to the new benchmarking product as a \"game changer, saying, \"I grew up with the old STR report and watched its evolution over 30 years. And by far, this is the best thing that could have happened with the tool.\" In total, our plan is to migrate over 900 corporate accounts of 6,000 independent hotels into the CoStar platform and we expect that process will be completed by the end of the second quarter next year. I expect strong double-digit revenue growth to continue for STR for the foreseeable future as more and more hospitality customers see the enhanced value that CoStar information analytics brings to their subscription. [ 10x ] brought [ 1.1 billion ] assets to the platform in the third quarter and achieved a 51% trade rate more than double the trade rate we are currently seeing in the offline transaction space. We continue to see tremendous transaction interest in the platform in the third quarter as we reviewed $4.8 billion in potential assets for sale in the quarter. Unfortunately, bid-ask spreads remain at high levels. leading to only 35% of these potential assets moving through to auctions on [ 10x ] in the quarter.\nThe CRE market continues to face significant headwinds with transaction volumes down 47% in the third quarter as compared to the same quarter a year ago. Historically low levels of transaction volumes are continued -- expected to continue for the remainder of '23 and '24 or at least the first half of '24. It's still early to see an increase in distressed assets on 10x at this point. We continue to see the long-term value in digital transaction platform, in fact both commercial and residential real estate regardless of any current market conditions. We're focused on continuing to improve our technology tools as part of our CoStar integration and believe there are additional performance synergies to be gained by aligning our [ 10x ] sales and marketing activities closer with LoopNet.\nTurning to the real estate economy. The capital markets continue to be stress, as I mentioned, with transaction volumes significantly lower. Values are also down with both office and multifamily prices falling by 16% year-over-year for multifamily and office prices down 30% from their peak. Banks are not lending and now they're shedding CRE loans for their balance sheet. CMBS delinquencies are also trending higher with office delinquencies of 6%, up more than 600% where they were at the end of 2022 and rapidly approaching the 10.5% peak last seen after the last recession. We expect this trend to continue as it took more than 3 years after the conclusion of the great financial crisis for the delinquencies to peak.\nThe office sector already experiencing its worst market conditions ever continued to weaken in the third quarter. Total negative absorption for the year is now 50 million square feet. Since the pandemic began, there has been over 170 million square feet of negative absorption in the office sector, which represents about 30% of all of the positive absorption that occurred in the 10-year recovery period after the last recession. Absorption will likely continue to be negative for some time as most indicators point to continued weaknesses.\nMeasures of workers coming back to the offices have largely been flat, and only slightly up over the past year. Lease renewal activity is well below pre-pandemic levels and new leases now average about 20% less in floor space than pre-pandemic levels. The U.S. hotel sector continues to approach pre-2020 levels in the third quarter, mid-week occupancies rose fueled by group and corporate customers. room rates and occupancy rates are also improved and RevPAR is expected to grow at about 4.5% for the year, even with a potential recession. The industrial and retail sectors continue to perform well. The industrial vacancy rate remains low at 5.3% in the third quarter, and rent growth remained strong as well at 7.5% over the past 12 months. Retail vacancy reached another all-time low at 4.1%, with steady demand, fewer store closures and minimal new supply.\nThe residential sector continues to face challenges from still rising mortgage rates and associated declining home sales, down 15% year-over-year in September. More than 90% of the in-place loans are now below 6% with more than 60% below 4%, leading to very low levels of inventory. The combination of rising prices and mortgage -- rising mortgage rates has pushed affordability to its lowest level since July of 1985.\nIn conclusion, for my part, CoStar Group continues to deliver both double-digit revenue growth and accelerate our performance against our Homes.com residential strategy. I'm very proud of our residential team for hitting a record milestone of 100 million monthly unique visitors to Homes.com in September, achieving the #2 position in the residential marketplaces in the United States and climbing coming off of our 1,290% year-over-year growth rate. I'm also very proud of the success of our commercial real estate teams have had increasing our revenue tenfold over the past 10 years -- 12 years and generating 14% year-over-year revenue growth in a downturn while growing our commercial property adjusted EBITDA to approaching $1 billion annualized as we move into the fourth quarter.\nAt this point, I'm going to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler. Scott, the floor is yours.\n\nScott T. Wheeler\n\nCFO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andy. Great set of results, strong improvements in both investment momentum and clearly, our revenue growth. So let me cover some facts by the service areas to start out. With CoStar, our revenue grew 10% year-over-year in the third quarter, which was in line with our guidance. And you think, of course, this is outstanding growth at a time when everything has pretty much gotten [ pair ] shaped for the property markets with rising interest rates, high inflation, record high office vacancies, only 50% return to office numbers and pretty much a frozen up transaction market. We saw stable improving trends in CoStar's net new bookings in the third quarter as our sales efforts are focused on new product capabilities and high-value portfolio customers like lenders, owners and corporate tenants.\nOur CoStar retention rates improved sequentially in the third quarter to 93%. This includes higher levels of cancellations from bad debt as the property downturn lingers while client-initiated cancellations are actually lower than in prior downturns. Once again, we're seeing that CoStar is proving to be mission-critical to our customers regardless of where we are in the property cycle. So this is our third major down cycle in the last 15 years, starting with the great financial crisis in 2008 and then, of course, the COVID pandemic disruption in '22 -- or sorry, 2020 and most recently now, the high interest and inflation cycle that started in 2021. In each progressive cycle, CoStar's performance has been stronger.\nDuring the great financial crisis, net new bookings went negative and CoStar revenue growth dipped into negative territory for 3 quarters before returning to positive growth. During the COVID disruption, CoStar net new bookings remained positive and revenue growth slowed to only 4% positive growth before returning back up to double digits. The current market environment is much worse economically than in 2020, and we see CoStar's revenue performance being stronger. We continue to invest in the CoStar product and our sales force through the pandemic, and it's paying off. We expect CoStar revenue growth between 10% to 11% for the full year 2023 and in the range of 8% to 9% in the fourth quarter.\nIf market trends continue as they are now, we expect CoStar revenue growth would stabilize around 7% to 8% in the first couple of quarters of 2024 and possibly improving thereafter. Again, this is a very strong performance and certainly above the growth we saw from CoStar in the prior downturns. Apartments.com revenue growth increased to 24% year-over-year in the third quarter to $235 million and Apartments.com is now our single largest business by revenue volume. This is remarkable for a business that did not even exist in CoStar 10 years ago. For those of you that were with us back in 2014 and 2015, you'll certainly remember the acquisition of Little Apartments.com, #5 in the market and the subsequent announcement of a major investment cycle that consumed practically all of our profits at the time.\nFast forward to today, we now have the leading apartments marketplace with the most revenue, the most customers, the highest brand awareness and organic growth at the highest level now at scale than at any time since the first year of the site launch in 2015 and 2016. By my calculations, Apartments.com has added over $10 billion of market cap to CoStar Group. I think we would all agree that the early years of investing our profit in Apartments.com was a very smart thing to do and something we believe we can repeat at an even bigger scale as we invest in our residential markets with Homes.com and now the pending offer to acquire on the market. Properties advertising on Apartments.com increased 15% year-over-year with mid-market as the leading category of the growth.\nOur sales force is approximately 22% larger year-over-year, and their performance continues to fuel the growth. Net new bookings in the third quarter remained strong, but stepped down from the record results of the second quarter for both seasonal reasons, and due to spending capacity limits in some communities that are faced with the unfortunate decision to pay their high interest in rising inflation costs or to pay more in marketing. We expect fourth quarter revenue growth to remain incredibly strong at 24% for Apartments.com and our full yield revenue growth outlook is 23%. LoopNet revenue grew 15% in the third quarter and we're expecting fourth quarter growth of 11% and full year revenue growth in the range of 14% to 15%. This is relatively unchanged from what we talked about last quarter.\nRevenue from Information Services grew 9% in the third quarter with STR and real estate manager subscription revenue posting combined 17% revenue growth. We continue to expect Information Services full year revenue growth to be in the 9% range. We're doing the right thing in information services, deemphasizing and reducing transactional revenue while we focus on grow our subscription revenue across those platforms. Residential revenue came in at $10 million in the third quarter, and we expect full year 2023 revenue of $43 million as we continue to run off the legacy products. The old [ Pro Plus ] products are holding up better than we expected, while the Facebook advertising products decline. I suspect agents are finding that our millions of free leads from Homes.com are a much better source of potential customers than the poor-performing Facebook ads that were sold through Homes.com.\nOther marketplaces revenue was $34 million in the third quarter, down 5% year-over-year as [ 10x ] is still facing the headwinds of the low transaction volume market. Our lands and business for sale marketplace revenues are consistently delivering double-digit growth. As we don't see near-term indications of an upturn in transaction volumes or do we plan for those we expect full year revenue for other marketplaces of approximately $130 million. Looking at profitability. Our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $112 million, slightly below our guidance range of $115 million to $120 million, as we [indiscernible] decision to accelerate investments in our residential strategy.\nTurning to Performance [indiscernible] Our sales force totaled approximately 1,180 people on September 30, an increase of 8% from September of last year and approximately 20 more than last quarter. Our contract renewal rate was 91% for the third quarter of 2023 and with the renewal rate for customers who have been subscribers for 5 years or longer at 96%, with both rates increasing sequentially over the second quarter. I find this particularly impressive given the current state of the property markets. Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 82% for the third quarter of 2023 compared to 80% in the third quarter of 2022. This is primarily attributable to our strong Apartments.com growth. We have a fortress balance sheet with $5.2 billion in cash that is now earning 5% interest. Our net quarterly interest income is pacing at around $55 million.\nTurning to the outlook for 2023 with our offer to purchase on the market expected to close late in the fourth quarter, our guidance does not reflect any financial impact of the potential transaction. We expect full year 2023 revenue outlook in the range of $2.445 billion to $2.450 billion, representing growth of 12% at the midpoint of the range. The modest adjustment to our revenue guidance range is from less favorable property market conditions, primarily in the third quarter. Our commercial business growth rate for the year is expected to be 14%, generating revenue of over $2.4 billion. The company expects revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 in the range of $630 million to $635 million, representing revenue growth of 10% to 11%. The commercial business growth rate for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 12% to 13%.\nWe anticipate adjusted EBITDA for the year in the range of $485 million to $490 million. The fourth quarter of 2023 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $123 million to $128 million. This guidance includes the additional Homes.com investment that Andy mentioned as we prepare for our residential product launch in 2024. Overall, we're excited to be able to deliver 50 straight quarters of double-digit growth. Over the past 10 years, we have built a much more diversified portfolio focused entirely on subscription revenue which makes our growth rates increasingly resilient economic and commercial property cycles. What we are now seeing in the property markets are some of the worst conditions in decades. I suspect this is the first time that many people on this call have experienced high inflation and interest rates like some of us enjoyed back in the '80s and '90s and maybe back in the '70s.\nWhat CoStar has learned and demonstrated over time is it's important to continue to invest in attractive long-term opportunities for revenue growth and TAM extension during downturns when others are shrinking or retrenching. We are once again leaning into our high-growth future with great promising investments like Homes.com and on the market. The overwhelming proof of the success of this strategy is happening now as we continue to deliver double-digit revenue growth in our commercial information and marketplace businesses, which we expect will continue into 2024. Assuming market conditions and trends don't improve next year, we expect continued double-digit revenue growth throughout 2024 in the range of 11% to 12%, exclusive of our residential business and depending on the market transaction. With these impressive growth expectations, we expect to generate over $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA from our commercial portfolio next year.\nWith that, I will now turn the call back over to our call operator to begin the question-and-answer session."

My name is JP and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CoStar Group Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Now Cyndi Eakin, Head of Investor Relations, will lead the safe harbor statement. Cyndi, you may begin.\n\nCyndi Eakin\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations & Controller\n\nThank you, JP. Good evening, and thank you all for joining us to discuss the second quarter 2023 results of the CoStar Group. Before I turn the call over to Andy Florance, CoStar's CEO and Founder; and Scott Wheeler, our CFO, I would like to review our safe harbor statement.\nCertain portions of the discussion today may contain forward-looking statements. including the company's outlook and expectations for the third quarter and full year 2023 based on current beliefs and assumptions.

Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Cyndi. It reminds me of summer camp, \"Gather around the campfire kids. Cyndi is going to read the safe harbor statement again.\" All right. Let's be serious.\nGood evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was $606 million or 13% growth year-over-year. Revenue growth in our Commercial Information and marketplace business was an impressive 15% year-over-year. We continue to deliver strong double-digit revenue growth which, in this case, is particularly impressive during one of the most difficult property markets in decades. I'm pleased to see our portfolio is strong across the board with Apartments.com, CoStar, LoopNet, Real Estate Manager, STR, Lands.com and businesses for sale all delivering double-digit revenue growth.\nWe continue to deliver outstanding sales results with $82 million of net new bookings in the second quarter, our second highest sales quarter ever. I believe we crossed a monumental milestone in June when our residential portal network continued its phenomenal growth and became the second most heavily trafficked residential marketplace in the U.S. Overall, traffic to CoStar Group's websites reached a high of 105 million monthly unique visitors in June, according to Google Analytics.\nEarlier this year, we moved into third place when we surpassed Redfin's first quarter self-reported home and estimated rental site traffic. Then in the second quarter, we moved up again the second place as we had 84 million average monthly unique visitors to our residential portal network, surpassing realtor.com self-reported traffic of 72 million monthly unique visitors from their earnings release on May 11, 2023. CoStar Group's residential network combines residential rental site and homes traffic for sales site traffic, as others do.\nHomes.com is the fastest-growing residential portal with network traffic growing 130% year-over-year in June to 38 million monthly unique visitors [indiscernible] one year after we launched homes.com or within the first year, won't be launching homes.com. Congrats, Jerry, Livie and the whole team and Todd.\nApartments.com once again delivered an outstanding quarter. Apartments.com revenue was $224 million in the second quarter, accelerating to 23% year-over-year growth. The Apartments.com sales team delivered a record net new sales quarter with net sales bookings increasing 84% compared to the same quarter last year. The month of June was our highest sales month ever. We continue to add new customers to our marketplace at a rapid pace and now have over 66,000 paying communities on our network, representing an increase of 12% over the second quarter of last year.\nOur mid-market efforts are contributing thousands of new properties, growing paid subscribers by almost 40% in the second quarter. New construction is also contributing to subscriber growth. 65% of all new 100-plus unit communities are advertising with Apartments.com. And of those advertising, 80% are at the platinum level or higher. Our sales team continues to deliver exceptional results and high productivity. Our sales productivity is up 24% over the second quarter of last year.\nThe number of quality meetings with customers increased by 13% to 155,000 compared to the first quarter. Our Net Promoter Score rose to a very impressive 95%, the highest since the quarter -- first quarter -- I'm sorry, that's the highest since the third quarter of 2020, and a really impressive number. I'm proud to say our team delivered strong performance of the National Apartment Association Annual Conference in Atlanta last month. They were motivated by a surprise appearance by an always entertaining Jeff Goldblum. Our team delivered almost double the sales level of last year's conference. I'd like to extend a special thanks to Paige Forrest, Fred Saint and the whole sales team at Apartments.com for in continuing to produce exceptional results quarter after quarter, month after month.\nIn June, monthly unique visitors for Apartments.com grew 9% year-over-year significantly outperforming the market, which is down approximately 9% year-over-year according to Google. Our 2023 Apartments.com marketing campaign is in full swing. We are reaching renters across all media channels during peak rental season and generating over 2.8 billion media impressions, up 11% over last year. Since the launch of this year's campaign, we're already seeing phenomenal results with unaided awareness for Apartments.com reaching a very impressive 49%. That's the highest level ever. Our data indicates that this level of unaided awareness has never been achieved by anyone in the online rental marketplace category.\nEconomic conditions in the apartment industry continue to create a favorable advertising environment. Apartment vacancy rates on 3-, 4- and 5-star properties continue to rise increasing 220 basis points over prior year to 7.9%. Unit-level deliveries are at all-time highs, and supply will continue to outweigh demand for the foreseeable future. We expect vacancy rates to continue to increase for the next 4 quarters, peaking at around 9% in mid-2024. With favorable advertising conditions, a strong and growing sales force and industry-leading products, we expect to see Apartments.com revenue growth accelerate to 25% through the end of this year.\nOver at Homes.com, we continue to make great progress in implementing our strategy. Traffic to our homes network reached a new high of 38 million unique visitors in June according to Google Analytics, growing 130% and over the same period last year. Sequentially, our Homes.com average monthly unique visitors grew 75% as we continue to grow traffic share towards our next milestone of 50 million unique visitors.\nWith returning users up 416% in June versus a year ago, I believe consumers are appreciating Homes.com's outstanding UX and the ability to contact the listing agents directly and clearly, the ones who know more about the property than some other unrelated agent. According to comScore, Homes.com unique visitors are up 224% in the second quarter over the same quarter last year, while Zillow's traffic is down 5%, realtor.com is down 13% and Redfin is up 4%. I'm pleased with our success growing site traffic on Homes.com to date, and I believe we have a lot of runway ahead as we continue to implement our content, product and marketing plans.\nThis is a marathon and not a sprint. We are clear that we have more and bigger traffic levers to pull to grow traffic over the quarters to come. Our future growth in traffic will come in waves. Any period where traffic lulls, it may just be the trough before a monster wave comes. I'm very confident that 18 months from now, we will have very impressive rankings.\nAlongside our increase in consumer traffic, we continue to focus on agent engagement. We've built an incredible committee of 1.1 million real estate agents on Homesnap Pro with hundreds of thousands of active users each month. We have integrated the top feature set of our Homesnap Pro product into the Homes.com platform and have begun migrating agents over to Homes Pro, our new agent-facing set of tools. Our new Homes Pro product will provide significant benefit to our current home Snap users, including access to 15x the consumer traffic, millions of free leads and additional tools and feature upgrades. With these tools fully integrated, agents for the first time will be able to experience the full value of professional tools integrated with a heavily trafficked, agent-friendly \"you're listing, your lead\" business model.\nIn June, we launched our first installment of proprietary content on homes.com with massive volumes of immersive neighborhood videos, informative write-ups and photographs. We also released a comprehensive set of school profiles, information ratings, all giving us what I believe to be the most complete coverage of schools on any residential property website. We are still in the very early stages of our content strategy, but I'm encouraged by the consumer response to what we've built so far.\nWe recently conducted another round of focus groups in various cities with both consumers and agents and tested our product features and content. I have attended hundreds of focus groups in dozens of cities over the past 3 decades. The consumer and agent response we received them these most recent focus groups is the best I've ever seen, really encouraging responses. I believe we're on the right track. We have much more work ahead to build out the full new Homes.com product offering, but I believe that based upon the focus groups, there will be a very positive consumer response to what we deliver.\nCoStar revenue for the second quarter was $229 million, an 11% increase over the same period last year. That's coming in above our 10% revenue guidance. We're seeing higher levels of sales to new logo accounts, and I'm encouraged by the strong sales results to owners, lenders and corporate users, which grew 134% over the first quarter of this year. Clearly, our efforts to shift our sales team to focus on owner, lender and tenant prospects is paying off. Sales activities to these customer types were approximately 20% higher in the second quarter than the first quarter of this year, and are expected to increase further in the second half of the year.\nAnother positive sign for CoStar was our 92% renewal rate in the quarter, which increased from the 91% renewal rate in the first quarter. Our CoStar Lender product had its best sales quarter ever, with net new sales nearly double the sales results from the first quarter of this year. We've had success selling to financial institutions of all shapes and sizes with a product that's proving far superior to competitive offerings. Our ability to match individual properties to loan portfolios alongside our credit default model are valuable differentiators of CoStar Lender that others simply cannot match. Our clients continue to refer to our solution as the best-in-class and the gold standard. We're still in the early stages of this $300 million market opportunity with 200 customers signed and 5,800 more potential customers ahead.\nIn April, we released property investment fund data into CoStar. The release includes 12,600 investment funds, which we have linked to 70,000 commercial properties in the CoStar database. This new information adds to CoStar's unique data sets, providing the ability to search for funds based on their property portfolio characteristics, transactions and listings. In the 2 months since we introduced the product, we have closed over 100 CoStar sales where the fund data was a critical part of the value proposition.\nIn May, we released our new tenant application, which includes enhancements to our existing tenant location information as well as a new corporate user feature. The new corporate user feature aggregates all locations for the 32,000 largest corporations that occupy 5 or more locations. This product allows users to run a query on a large corporate occupier for example, Walmart, and see all of their locations, the types of buildings they occupy, building details, financial information on the company and credit risk.\nBrokers find this information very valuable as they quickly understand how large tenants utilize space across their portfolios and identify opportunities to serve those companies. I believe the strong pace of new product introductions, alongside the sales team's focus on owners, lenders and corporate users will continue to support strong revenue growth even as we navigate one of the worst points of the current CRE cycle.\nLoopNet revenue was $66 million for the quarter, up 16% year-over-year and in line with revenue growth of 16% in the first quarter. LoopNet continues to be the most highly trafficked commercial real estate marketplace, capturing 14 million average monthly unique visitors for the second consecutive quarter, up 13% year-over-year. According to SEM Rush data for the month of June, LoopNet and LoopNet Canada have 7 and 8x the traffic of our nearest competitors, respectively. Unique visitors to the Canadian network are up 51% year-over-year.\nWhile the LoopNet marketplace remains strong and competitively advantaged, LoopNet's sales growth should have been stronger in the second quarter. We believe the lower sales resulted from a combination of factors and that most of these factors are correctable. These factors include a growing and relatively young sales team a training program, which has room for improvement, a large number of account transitions and a poorly conceived commission plan that drove lower activity levels and a weak customer service, which reduced our renewal rates. Does that sound like a CEO that's not happy with something? That's true.\nCountering that, the climbing commercial real estate vacancy rates did create positive countercyclical demand for leasing solutions similar to the positive results environment we're seeing in Apartments.com. In fact, I was on the phone this morning with Mike, who is one of our more experienced LoopNet sales reps, and he said he's witnessing unprecedented demand for advertising for LoopNet in this severe downturn. He says that office owners who in the past or industrial owners who never considered advertising before in the Internet are now all in trying to drive leads to their troubled leasing assets. We will increase service levels while reinforcing customer retention is a priority in a revised incentive compensation plan.\nDespite the near-term disruption, I remain very confident in the long-term LoopNet growth opportunity in our direct sales team and strategy. Our LoopNet network of international marketplaces delivered strong growth in the second quarter with revenue increasing 35% year-over-year and net new sales up 24%. Our international expansion efforts will continue in the second half of the year as we plan on launching LoopNet in France and Spain, which will run alongside of our Bureau Loco, Business MO and Belbex marketplaces.\nSTR revenue was 11% compared to the second quarter of last year with subscription revenue growing an impressive 14%. For the second quarter in a row, STR achieved record sales results with more and more subscriptions. When we purchased STR in 2019, approximately 60% of STR revenue was subscription-based and 40% was one-off transactional. The STR team has done a great job of transitioning the business to 80% subscription revenue currently. Renewal rates on STR subscriptions are at an amazing 97%.\nIn May, we successfully launched our STR benchmarking product in CoStar and the initial results are encouraging. Our teams have migrated over 60 customers to the benchmarking product in CoStar with another 250 customer migrations in progress. The transition is anticipated to be completed in approximately 1 year, encompassing over 900 corporate accounts and 6,000 independent hotels. The release of the new benchmarking product represents a digital transformation of the beloved and 38-year-old industry standard Star report. The feedback from clients on this integration and enhancement is astounding.\nOne customer referred to it as an epical change. I don't think I refer to anything as epical changes. But owners and operators are thrilled with the new advanced analytics options, data visualizations, abundance of historical data and of course, the trusted STR report. We anticipate this release will open access to new clients as the data is invaluable for asset acquisition, operations and disposition. I'm looking forward to completing the migration to CoStar, which will accelerate our growth into what we see as a $300 million market opportunity.\nCoStar Real Estate Manager signed a number of the world's largest companies to our lease administration and transaction management solutions in the second quarter. Most of these names are confidential, but you'd recognize, for example, the company behind the word processing software that I wrote this on. Year-over-year subscription grew revenue grew 14% in the second quarter. Subscription revenue climbed at 92% of revenue in the first half of '23 versus 87% in 2021. We enjoyed a 100% customer renewal rate in the second quarter.\nToday, 7 out of 10 of the largest U.S. banks are using Real Estate Manager lease accounting, lease administration or transaction management solutions. This by sell continues to experience double-digit growth and is expected to exceed $30 million in revenue in 2023, an important milestone. Quarterly traffic to the BizBuySell network reached an all-time high of 12.6 million sessions in Q2, which is 25% growth year-over-year and lead volume to advertisers was up 30% during the same quarter. BizBuySell is the leading marketplace in the business for sale category.\nOur land business is on track to increase revenue by double digits and to exceed a major milestone of $50 million in revenue. When we acquired Land in Farm and LandsofAmerica, those businesses had $4 million of revenue. So $50 million is an important growth milestone. Implementing our and our playbook, we added LandWatch, combined sites into Land.com network greatly increased traffic exposure for clients and recently added gold and platinum ads. Our investment in product and people continues later this year with the launch of diamond ads and adding sales headcount, which increased 26% year-over-year, and our target is to increase at 50% year-over-year.\nTen-X continues to perform well, while overall CRE market conditions remain challenging. Q1 '23 CRE transactions, commercial real estate transactions, were down 51% year-over-year. and Q2 further declined to 63% year-over-year down. That is the steepest decline since the Great Recession where transaction volumes had declined 66% year-over-year. Bid-ask spreads continue to grow wider due to higher interest rates and constricted debt loan-to-value ratios, and all that's caused upward pressure in cap rates.\nThe overall CMBS delinquency rate rose to 3.9% in June, the highest rate in 14 months and it's expected to grow in 2023 and 2024. We appear to be seeing a very severe significant pretend and extend phase from lenders and distressed assets are coming but it's just a question of when, not if. Ten-X applied its proven principles of syncing value expectations with our seller broker customers to onboard assets with reserve pricing set to current market conditions. For Q2, Ten-X onboarded $1.5 billion of inventory, a 27% increase year-over-year and 2x Q1 '23 volume. And we delivered a solid 52% trade rate, and that compares favorably to the off-line world's 23% trade rate.\nDue to the ongoing bid-ask misalignment, Ten-X over $2.9 billion of potential inventory that was deemed high risk for transaction success because the seller had an unrealistically high opinion of value. So we didn't take those properties on in order to avoid wasting money on underwriting them and lowering our trade rates. We continue to build and improve our platform for the future. The Ten-X sales force grew 36% year-over-year and delivered higher quality high-valued assets in Q2.\nThe average asset value was up 33% year-over-year from $3.5 million to $4.6 million. The average winning bid was up 11% year-over-year from $3.2 million to $3.7 million and the average buyer premium was up 27% year-over-year from 72,000 to 92,000. There was a 53% year-over-year inventory growth in the $1 million to $10 million range which is what we consider Ten-X a sweet spot. We've made significant progress with our technology with the Ten-X platform, now fully integrated in the CoStar ecosystem. Customers can now fully manage their transactions digitally through the marketing auction contracting and closing phases of a sale. Sellers and brokers can now manage their listings and leads in marketing center and buyers can interact with their brokers and sellers via the Ten-X LoopNet and CoStar sites.\nFinally, to lift everybody up, I would -- I thought I would talk a little bit about the commercial real estate economy, really sort of pick things up. Did you know [ tiramisu ] means to lift up Yes. So the capital markets continue to see the impact of rising interest rates. As I mentioned, second quarter sales transaction volumes were down 63% compared to the same quarter and was down across all property types in the commercial real estate markets.\nPrices are also falling, but the lack of real deal activity makes price transparency difficult. The debt market has not yet seen a wave of distress with delinquencies still very low by historical standards, but there has been some movement. The next couple of years will bring more clarity to that market as more than $1 trillion in CMBS debt comes due.\nThe office sector continued to weaken in the second quarter and can now be characterized as the worst it's ever been. Vacancies now sit at 13 -- what a horrible thing to have to say. Vacancy rates now sit at 13.1%, their highest levels ever. However, office space that's no longer occupied by a tenant or is underutilized by tenant is not truly stably leased. Most lenders are not considering space leased that considering space leased but not occupied to be leased, there's got to be a tenant actually in this space before lenders consider at least. Based on that fact, the phantom or true effective vacancy rate is closer to 57% if you assume a 50% tenant occupancy of lease space. That is, by far, the worst vacancy rate in the history of the office industry.\nTenants gave back 40 million square feet in the first half of 2023 with another $100 million forecast to be given back to the remainder of the year. Net absorption was negative again in the second quarter and now totals more than 150 million square feet negative since the pandemic began. Negative absorption was 1/3 of that level in the '28 financial crisis at negative 50 million square feet. So this is much worse than the '08 situation. Conditions will likely not improve anytime soon. We expect vacancy rates continue to arise. Overall sales prices for office abilities are down 5.9% and delinquency rates while still low, have tripled since the end of last year to 4.4% currently. I believe the downward price pressure is much higher than a 5.9% decline and that the quality of office loan collateral is weaker than many presented to be.\nThe hotel sector continues its recent trend of slow growth in the second quarter. Room rates rose at around the level of inflation, having limited potential for improved profitability. Resort destination show signs of slowing growth as consumer spending cooled while hotels and urban markets report improved growth supported by corporate group demand and transient travelers. Higher interest rates have put a damper on construction and deal activity. The industrial and retail sectors continue to be relatively healthy at 4.7% industrial vacancy rate is historically low and annual growth for rent remains very strong. Retail vacancy reached another all-time low with continued positive absorption. Announced store openings continue to exceed store closures. So that's good news.\nThe residential sector continues to face challenges with a 30-year mortgage rates around 7%, monthly prices on the rise in the last 3 months, and affordability is reaching a low not seen since 1986. And creates challenging condition. Total home sales fell 16% year-over-year with more than 60% of the existing mortgage rates below 4% and more than 80% below 5% and rate lock will keep inventory of existing homes low. People are not going to be trading out of those low interest rates. Builders have responded though as single-family housing starts moved higher earlier this year New homes account for 15% of all sales compared to only 10% a few years ago.\nBuilders are offering incentives such as mortgage rate buydowns and price discounts to attract buyers. Still, affordability remains a challenge. So despite that difficult real estate market, CoStar delivered yet another quarter of strong double-digit revenue growth, our second highest sales quarter ever. We exceeded 100 million monthly unique visitors for the first time in June, which was an incredible milestone and demonstrates our ability to deliver successful leading property marketplaces across multiple sectors and across multiple countries.\nOur marketplace networks continue to grow and provide value to our advertising customers as time when vacancies are on the rise. Although the composition of our revenue growth continues to shift with the market dynamics, I'm very confident in our ability to deliver our financial projections for 2023.\nAt this point, I'm going to turn the call over to young Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler.\n\nScott T. Wheeler\n\nCFO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, old CEO, Andy.\n\nAndrew C. Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nNow, now.\n\nScott T. Wheeler\n\nCFO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nI appreciate that introduction. I believe I'm 1 digit younger than you still for another month or 2. Great quarter financially, a lot to cover. So let me jump right into the revenue by our service areas. So CoStar revenue grew 11%, as Andy mentioned, slightly above our guidance at 10% with the strength in our net new sales exceeding our forecast. So we saw a stronger new customer sales in the quarter, particularly to owners, investors and lenders.\nAnd even our broker sales stabilized in the second quarter, we signed almost 800 new broker agreements this quarter. Vast majority of them are in the 1 to 2 broker size category. So that's definitely an improved trend from the last couple of quarters. We expect CoStar revenue growth to be 10% in the third quarter and now between 10% to 11% for the full year, a modest increase from our previous outlook.\nApartments.com's second quarter revenue growth of 23% was in line with our expectations. We had another record sales level for Page and the team. The new property volumes increased 12% year-over-year and volumes in the mid-market category growing much more rapidly at 40% growth year-over-year. We are seeing more and more customers now upgrading to the higher tier ads, particularly the 100 unit and above-unit properties are doing that quite a bit more now.\nOur net add level upgrades are now at or above the levels that we're operating at before the 2021 disruption in the apartments market. We expect that trend to continue. With continued strong sales results, we now expect third and fourth quarter revenue growth of 25% for Apartments.com which is up from the 24% assumed in our last outlook. So our full year revenue growth outlook is slightly up in the range of 23% to 24% for apartments.\nLoopNet revenue grew 16% in the second quarter, consistent with the first quarter of the year, slightly below our guidance of 18%, which is a shortfall of about $1 million. As Andy mentioned, LoopNet sales in the second quarter fell short of our expectations, and we are adjusting our full year revenue outlook for LoopNet to approximately 15% year-over-year revenue growth. LoopNet's third quarter revenue growth is expected to be around 14%.\nRevenue from Information Services grew 9% in the second quarter. STR and Real Estate Manager continued to post strong double-digit revenue growth, particularly in their subscription parts of the business, which we expect to continue through the end of the year. it's really impressive to look at the renewal rates and STR at 97% and Real Estate Manager 100%. Those are very critical products for our customers. We're starting to see more and more of our banking customers move to our new CoStar lender product which shifts a small amount of information services revenue up to the CoStar category.\nAccordingly, we expect revenue growth in the upper single digits for the third quarter and approximately 9% for the full year in Information Services. Our residential revenue came in at $13 million, in line with our expectations. We expect third quarter revenue of around $11 million, in line with our last forecast and full year 2022 fee revenue of $45 million.\nOther Marketplaces revenue was $32 million in the second quarter, up slightly from the first quarter revenue and effectively flat to prior year. Ten-X revenue was lower than expected in the second quarter as the low transaction volumes and deal uncertainty weighed on the results. Ten-X aside, our lands and businesses for sale marketplaces revenue were up 11% year-over-year in the second quarter.\nFor the second half of the year, we're moderating our revenue outlook for Ten-X and assuming a continued low transaction level environment. If for some reason, it improves in the later part of the year, we'll take the upside. We now expect full year revenue for other marketplaces in a range of $130 million to $135 million for the full year, a reduction of approximately $20 million from our prior outlook.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $127 million, above the high end of our second quarter guidance range of $123 million. Favorable performance relates primarily to the timing of our investment spend. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 21%, 1 percentage point above guidance.\nOur sales force totaled approximately 1,160 people in June 30, an increase of 17% from June of last year and approximately 40 sellers from the end of the first quarter. The majority of the increase in the second quarter is in our Marketplace business. Our contract renewal rate was 90% for the second quarter of 2023 with the renewal rate for customers who've been subscribers for 5 years or longer at 94%.\nSubscription revenue on annual contracts was 81% for the second quarter compared to 80% in the second quarter of 2022. We have a rock-solid balance sheet with $5.2 billion in cash. We now earn around 4.8% interest on our cash versus paying 2.8% interest on our debt. Positive net interest income was $52 million in the second quarter.\n2023 outlook. Our full year outlook is now in the range of $2.45 billion to $2.46 billion for revenue, reflecting our adjusted transaction revenue forecast for Ten-X in the second half of the year. Our subscription-based businesses are expected to continue to deliver strong sales and double-digit revenue growth in the second half, and we expect full year revenue growth of 13% at the midpoint of the range for the year.\nThe company expects revenue for the third quarter of 2023 in the range of $622 million to $627 million, representing revenue growth of approximately 12% year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. We're reconfirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year and raising the midpoint of our guidance range. Our revised adjusted EBITDA guidance range is $510 million to $520 million. For the third quarter of 2023, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $115 million to $120 million.\nWell, that does it for me in the financial facts. Let's go back over to our operator, and we can begin the quarterly ritual of question and answers. Back to you, operator."

Revenue for the first quarter of 2023 was $584 million or 13% growth year-over-year, coming in at the high end of our guidance range and above consensus estimates. I'm very pleased with the growth of our commercial information and nonresidential marketplace businesses, which delivered 15% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter. I'm also very pleased with the progress we're making in building the new Homes.com, which I believe will become the best online residential marketplace in the world, bar none.\nWe started the year strong with net new sales of $80 million, our second highest sales quarter ever, and a 17% increase over the first quarter of the prior year. Apartments.com achieved the highest net new sales quarter for the second quarter in a row. LoopNet achieved outstanding results in the quarter with a 100% increase in net new sales over the first quarter of last year. We hit a new high watermark in traffic to our marketplaces in March. Monthly unique visitors totaled $94 million for the month with Apartments.com, Homes.com, LoopNet, Lands, BizBuySell, Belbex, BureauxLocaux, Business Immo and all of our marketplaces, contributing up to tens of millions of unique visitors.\nApartments.com continued its impressive run with another outstanding quarter. Apartments.com revenue was $211 million in the first quarter, climbing to 20% year-over-year for the first time since the first quarter of '21. Net new sales bookings were at an all-time high, breaking the record set just last quarter with an increase of 110% over the first quarter of '22. Apartments.com, while very successful, has millions of apartments that do not yet advertise on the site.\nWe are focused on continuing to grow our sales force to reach this huge potential untapped audience. Our attention to attracting the best talent and excellent onboarding and training of new hires is paying good dividends. Our sales team productivity is up over 40% compared to last year for hires who have been with us less than a year. We are committed to excellent customer service, and that's a big contributor to our success. The apartment sales team conducted close to 140,000 quality meetings this quarter, which is 24% higher than the same quarter last year. Of those 140,000 quality meetings, over 50,000 were in person, a 45% increase over the first quarter of '22. This attention to servicing continues to be well received by our clients as evidenced by our industry-leading Net Promoter Score of 94.\nThe number of properties advertising on our platform continues to expand and is now at a record 64,000 properties. Our customers are selecting higher ad package levels to obtain more leads as evidenced by our average revenue per property increase of 14% over the prior year. The economic fundamentals of the apartment industry continue to move in our favor. The vacancy rate for 3-, 4- and 5-star properties rose another 30 basis points to 7.7% in the first quarter, and net deliveries continue to outpace net absorption in the quarter with twice the units delivered as absorbed.\nDeliveries in '23 are expected to be the highest in over 40 years, and vacancy rates are forecast to increase for the remainder of the year. There are currently over 1 million units under construction, with approximately 750,000 of them being at the top end of the market. Pressure on these assets will be intense throughout 2023 as rent levels moderate. We expect vacancy rates to remain elevated by historical standards. All this could create a jet stream-like tailwind for advertising demand.\nMarch marked the official role to the new 2023 Apartments.com marketing campaign with new TV commercials, streaming videos and streaming audio commercials. Jeff Goldblum as Brad Bellflower was featured during March Madness and all month across top networks like CBS, Bravo, TBS, TNT and more. We launched a new social media campaign, our streaming audio and podcast campaigns have hit the airwaves and engagements are at an all-time high.\nWe anticipate that our 2023 campaign will yield 12 billion media impressions. The early results of this campaign are strong with our first quarter unaided brand awareness for Apartments.com jumping to our highest score ever. Apartments.com continues to attract qualified renters to our platform with an average of over 43 million monthly unique visitors in the quarter, according to Google Analytics. Apartments.com is also benefiting from the addition of Homes.com rental area to its network and the tremendous growth in traffic to Homes.com. Visitors to the homes rental area up 83% since the fourth quarter of 2022, and those visitors delivered approximately 200,000 leads to our paying Apartments.com customers, that's up 124% from just last quarter.\nWith more content than ever before on our network, including unit level details and touring capabilities, our lead quality continues to outperform our competitors. Our mobile sessions were an all-time high in the first quarter with 75% of Apartments.com user sessions conducted on a mobile device. Just 5 keywords now account for 33% of unbranded search activity on these devices. When the top 376 cities in the United States are examined, Apartments.com ranks #1 for all 5 of these terms 99% of the time.\nThe combination of the kickoff of our 2023 marketing campaign, market conditions and our larger and more seasoned sales teams helped continue to drive strong results. In sum, I am very pleased to report that we expect Apartments.com to deliver 22% to 23% revenue growth in 2023.\nI'm very excited about the progress we've made on many Homes.com initiatives in the short period of time. Last year, we laid out the key milestones for Homes.com: grow, monetize and scale. The grow phase focused on increasing traffic, engaging buyers and sellers on our platform. Our initial goal in the grow phase was to achieve 25 million unique visitors, while our goal in the scale phase was to reach 50 million unique visitors. Traffic to our Homes.com network grew dramatically. We reached 27 million unique visitors in March according to Google Analytics.\nMonth-to-date in April, traffic to Homes.com grew 53% over the same period March to date. As of this morning, for the partial month to date, we have already seen 28 million unique visitors to Homes.com network. Unique visitors for our Homes.com network is 88% above March of last year, and traffic to our Homes.com site is up 183% compared to last year.\nWe are now 4x the traffic levels from when we purchased Homes.com almost 2 years ago. By comparison, 2 years after we purchased Apartments.com, we'd only doubled the traffic. As we continue to build Homes.com and combine single-family residential with rental content from Apartments.com, we can now aggregate our traffic across both property marketplaces.\nIn total, monthly unique visitors in March for our Apartments.com and Homes.com network was 72 million according to Google Analytics. For the fourth quarter of 2022, Realtor.com reported 66 million monthly unique visitors, while Redfin reported 44 million average monthly unique visitors. According to comScore, Homes.com unique visitors were up 153% year-over-year in March, Realtor.com's monthly unique visitors decreased by 20%. Zillow's unique visitors were down 5% and Redfin's traffic increased 5% compared to March of last year.\nAlongside our increase in consumer traffic engagement, agent engagement continues to improve. We now have approximately 1.1 million agents registered in Homes.com network, up 37% for the first quarter of '22. Active users are those who visit the site monthly have increased 64% versus last year. I believe the engagement will continue to improve as we're providing millions of free leads to agents that could generate billions of commission dollars for them under our \"your listing, your lead\" business model. In the months ahead, we're intensely focused on product development, generating proprietary content and building consumer traffic. Our team is extremely talented and singularly focused on winning. I wish I could share more detail on some of the great success stories, but I cannot, for competitive reasons. With the progress we've made to date, I remain confident that we're on track to begin monetizing Homes.com advertising product in the later part of this year.\nLoopNet was 63 -- revenue was $63 million for the first quarter, up 16% year-over-year and accelerating from 12% growth rate in the fourth quarter of '22. Our investment in building a direct sales force for LoopNet's paying off. Net new bookings are up 100% year-over-year, which is directly attributable to our larger and more effective sales teams. The productivity for sellers in the first year has increased in each of the last 4 quarters as new reps ramp and become more productive. Sales of new signature ads are up 27% year-over-year. LoopNet captured record traffic in the quarter with 14 million average monthly unique visitors to a network of marketplaces, up 12% year-over-year.\nAccording to Semrush, LoopNet has 8x the traffic of our nearest competitor in March. We're also seeing traffic gains in Canada as our unique visitors for LoopNet Canada in the first quarter are over 5x the unique visitors of our nearest competitor there. These accomplishments and investments reinforce our position as the most popular place to find a space and give me confidence in our ability to achieve our target of 18% to 19% revenue growth in 2023.\nAs we continue to focus on international expansion with our revenues, they are expected to exceed $80 million in 2023. By revenue, our international business now ranks #4, behind Apartments.com, CoStar and LoopNet. We now have over 500 international employees, including 200 researchers and 130 sales representatives. In Europe, we currently operate more than a dozen cities in 5 countries, with aspirations to expand our CoStar and LoopNet products into most of these major markets. Currently, CoStar and LoopNet are only offered in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. We believe there's a $30 billion European market for real estate information, services and marketplaces, which is roughly the same size as our North American market.\nA key step to capturing a significant share of that market is building and selling CoStar and LoopNet on a pan-European basis. One of the core unique competencies of our research operations is our on-the-ground field research operations. Our goal over the next few years is to photograph, map and document all of the commercial properties, 10,000 square feet or larger, roughly 1,000 square meters, in 15 European countries and approximately 36 cities. We will divide each city into 1 kilometer grids and capture all the relevant building inventory in each area. We anticipate capturing information on more than 1.5 million properties with a combined value in the trillions of euros. We have done this before in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. And in each instance, these massive efforts have resulted in a profitable and very valuable information asset.\nCoStar revenue increased $225 million in the first quarter, up 13%. For each month of the quarter, we saw a record number of distinct users in CoStar and in March exceeded 140,000 distinct users. Usage of CoStar and product engagement continues to grow as evidenced by nearly 6.5 million logins in the first quarter, a 26% increase over the last year. During those user sessions, property searches exceeded 20 million each month, and property detail views averaged 15 million a month. Whilst CoStar continues to be the premier product for real estate professionals -- brokers, significant opportunities exist for selling to new customers. We have a 75% plus penetration rate amongst brokerages with 5 or more brokers and continue to prospect smaller firms with an annual revenue potential of $96 million.\nIn addition, our sales teams are focused on owners, lenders and corporations where we have a significant addressable market. We believe we have over 51,000 owner prospects, 10,000 lender prospects and almost 4,000 corporations or 50 or more locations for a total of $1.4 billion in potential revenue. For the first time this quarter, product demonstrations to these aforementioned prospects exceeded those to the broker customers and broker prospects. Overall, we're seeing slightly lower than -- slightly lower net new bookings for CoStar, but still expect double-digit revenue growth in 2023.\nWe've [indiscernible] corporate information on 12,600 real estate investment funds and 70,000 commercial properties within those funds into CoStar. The subfund information helps clients understand who has capital available to invest in the commercial real estate and what sort of product types they want to invest in and where they want to invest. We continue to focus on our banking customers with our lender product. Last month marked the 1-year anniversary of releasing our fully integrated solution for lenders in CoStar.\nSales continued to be strong in Q1, ending our first year by breaking the 150 total client milestone. These clients spend many lender types, including banks, life insurance companies, credit unions and private lenders while ranging in size from $50 million CRE portfolios to over $50 billion CRE portfolios, proving a large opportunity moving forward. Our sales pipeline for lender is strong, and we expect to build on that pipeline as the solution for lenders is uniquely positioned for continued growth in this uncertain environment.\nThe value proposition is unmatched. No other company can connect a lender's portfolio to our rich property level information and provide a fully integrated credit model that assesses refinance risks as well as stress test a portfolio for an economic downturn. We expect continued sales opportunities due to regulators calling for increased portfolio surveillance by CRE-focused lenders for multiple reasons, including the concern over office properties, rising rates, refinancing risks and the threat of a potential economic downturn. I remain confident in our ability to grow CoStar revenue given our mission-critical data, ongoing product enhancements and the continued expansion and diversification of our customer base.\nAlthough overall CRE transaction volume was down 51% year-over-year, Ten-X continues to outperform the market with a solid 60% trade rate, up 3x that of the off-line market and up 51% in the fourth quarter of '22. We also saw the average number of bidders per auction on the platform increased over 3.2 in the first quarter compared to 2.6 in the fourth quarter of '22. In Q1 '23, Ten-X saw the average asset value increased 18% over the last year from $3.3 million to $3.9 million, average winning bid price increased 29% compared to the prior year from $3.1 million up to $4 million, and the average buyer premium increased 35% over the last year from 71,000 to 97,000. I believe this indicates that our expanded sales force is delivering higher quality assets that investors are seeking even in a price-challenged market.\nWith roughly $1.5 trillion of CRE debt maturing in the next 24 months and $700 billion maturing by year-end, we expect the continued interest rate-driven market shift to drive transaction volume up. Ten-X is already seeing an increase in momentum in the second quarter with $1.7 billion of inventory come into the platform, a 44% increase from Q2 of '22.\nTen-X remains the go-to platform for accelerated asset transactions which buyers, sellers, brokers, lenders and special servicers benefit from as the markets continue to shift. Our lands business is focused on creating opportunities for our [ real land ] clients to capture more leads for their priority properties for sale with signature ad opportunities. This business continues its consistent profitable growth with 14% year-over-year revenue growth.\nSTR has achieved a record sales quarter with the highest net new in its history and delivered 14% year-over-year revenue growth on a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of '22. We're on track to launch our new benchmarking product this month and execute our plan of migrating more than 175,000 users to the CoStar platform. This release will open access to new clients, including owners, hotel operators and brands that will enable execution of our integrated strategy.\nOwners will have clearer visibility into asset performance, market performance and competitive landscape. This insight is invaluable for asset acquisition, repositioning and dispositioning. Operators will have access to data and tools to better forecast, budget, yield manage and identify demand drivers and supply implications. Hotel brands will have a full suite to support and develop teams, franchise owners relationships and management contracts. What's not to love about all that?\nOverall, higher interest rates and increased economic uncertainty have reduced transaction volumes in the market and impacted prices since the second half of '22. As I mentioned earlier, transaction volumes declined by over 50% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2023 in the commercial real estate markets. In addition, we're now seeing asset price declines for 7 consecutive months with valuations off by 8% over that time. The office sector continues to show real weakness with vacancy rates reaching almost 13% in the first quarter. Phantom vacancy rate is much higher than that, and it's matching the all-time peak seen after the great financial crisis.\nWith continued weak demand, negative net absorption and other 58 million square feet of deliveries expected in 2023, we expect vacancies to push higher for the foreseeable future. Not surprisingly, delinquency rates on commercial property loans have doubled in the past 3 months to 2.8%, and it's probably and actually higher than that. Overall sales prices for office buildings are down 26% from their peak in Q1 of 2022. Fortunately, our Ten-X platform is well positioned to assist with the recapitalization of those properties as they come to market.\nThe residential housing market remains constrained. Mortgage rates are down from the earlier highs at the end of last year, but affordability is still low by historical standards. Sales of existing homes tipped higher earlier this year after 12 consecutive months of declines. Sales of new homes have trended higher since reaching a bottom last year as builders are offering incentives like rate buydowns to clear inventories. Inventories remain tight, which should prevent values from declining rapidly.\nThe retail sector continues to benefit from reduced store closures, steady demand and minimal new supply. Available retail space fell to a new all-time low of 4.7% during the first quarter, leaving it difficult to find space a strong market. Industrial net absorption has slowed in the first quarter after 2 years of record high net absorption, and tenant demand is beginning to moderate. At 4.3%, the U.S. industrial vacancy rate is half of the levels recorded 10 years ago, and rents have climbed 10% over the last 12 months, still a strong market.\nI'm very pleased with the performance of our business in the first quarter. CoStar continues to grow and remain resilient despite industry headwinds elsewhere. Apartments.com and LoopNet show accelerating countercyclical sales success. I am very optimistic about the progress we're making building traffic and value at Homes.com. We're very pleased to see our array of diverse platforms drawing more than 94 million unique visitors in March, and I look forward to reporting 100 million unique visitors before too long.\nAt this point, I'm going to turn the call over to the very capable hands of our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler.\n\nScott Wheeler\n\nChief Financial Officer, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andy. It's a great way to start the year again. Financially, we are certainly on track, if not slightly ahead, where we expected to be this quarter and for the year, with regards to revenue and our revenue growth outlook, which is a 13% total revenue growth for 2023. Now one of our sell-side analysts recently pointed out that we have logged 50 quarters in a row of double-digit revenue growth, although we actually just completed 48 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth, but who's counting? I actually use my favorite AI tool, which I call an Excel spreadsheet, to go back and figure out how many actual quarters we had double-digit growth. So it was back in 2011. So I am applying AI here at CoStar to our financial results.\n\nAndrew Florance\n\nIt might just be I.\n\nScott Wheeler\n\nChief Financial Officer, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThe question of my I sometimes. So revenue by services, CoStar revenue grew 13% in the first quarter. It was in line with our guidance expectations. CoStar expansion into new customers remain strong with new business sales consistently or slightly above the levels we've seen since mid-2021 after the pandemic. The brokers are certainly facing a tough transaction and leasing environment which dampened new broker sales and renewal rates, primarily among the very small broker shops.\nWe expect that our revenue forecast will reflect the current market conditions, which would have CoStar revenue growing at 10% for the second quarter and for the full year of 2023. For multifamily, we added more than $35 million in year-over-year revenue during the first quarter, on our way to once again achieving 20% revenue growth. Our bigger sales team is giving us the capacity to reach more and more prospective customers that have never advertised for Apartments.com. The number of paid properties increased by 8% in the first quarter of 2023 on a year-over-year basis. This is the largest volume increase we've seen since the second quarter of 2021.\nIn addition, we're seeing more and more customers upgrading to higher-level ads versus those that are downgrading to lower-level ads. This net revenue contribution from the positive ad level mix is now back to the levels we saw last during the pandemic surge, which was the second quarter of 2020, which were certainly good, strong high levels. Looking ahead, we expect these trends to continue with rising vacancy rates and increased productivity from our recent sales force expansion classes. So we're now forecasting revenue growth, as Andy said, of 23% for multifamily for the year and for the second quarter, up from our prior guidance of 20% revenue growth for 2023.\nLoopNet revenue grew 16% in the first quarter, up from 12% revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2022, thanks to the success of our dedicated LoopNet sales team. We expect 18% revenue growth for LoopNet in the second quarter of 2023 with a full year revenue growth that we now expect at the upper end of our 18% to 19% guidance range. Revenue from Information Services increased 12% in the first quarter at the upper end of the guidance range with strong results from STR and revenue contributions from our growing European businesses.\nWe expect revenue growth for both the second quarter and the full year of 2023 to be 10%, slightly above the 7% to 9% full year revenue growth guidance range that we provided in February. Our first quarter residential revenue came in at $13 million as expected. Estimated revenue for the second quarter is around $12 million, with our full year '23 revenue expectations remaining unchanged at $45 million. As a reminder, we've not assumed any revenues from Homes.com advertising products in our 2023 outlook.\nOther marketplace revenue contracted 4% in the first quarter of 2023, which was actually an improvement from the 10% to 13% first quarter revenue decline we expected a few months ago, as the trade rates for Ten-X that improved sequentially in the first quarter providing the extra revenue versus our forecast. We now expect revenue from other marketplaces to grow in the mid- to high single digits in the second quarter, and we're increasing our full year revenue growth estimate to 11% to 12% based on the better-than-expected first quarter results.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $123 million in the first quarter, $7 million above the high end of our guidance range. The outperformance was primarily attributable to our strong revenue performance and the timing of marketing spend in the quarter, which we expect to reverse as we move into our peak marketing season in the second and third quarters. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 21% in the first quarter, 1 percentage point higher than our guidance.\nThe size of the sales force in total remains largely unchanged from where we were at the end of 2022. The Apartments and LoopNet Marketplace teams grew in the first quarter sequentially, offset by modest attrition across the rest of the sales force. Our focus for the rest of 2023 is to continue to increase our sales teams in the marketplace businesses, including Apartments, LoopNet, Lands and Residential. Our contract renewal rates remain in the 90% to 91% range, while the renewal rate in the first quarter for customers who have been subscribers for 5 years or longer remained strong at 95%.\nSubscription revenue on annual contracts increased to 82% for the first quarter of '23, up from 81% at the end of 2022 and 80% a year ago. Both CoStar and Apartments.com have our highest annual subscription concentration percentages. And as these 2 products grow in relative size, we see our total subscription percentage increasing along with it. With a strong start to the year, we are reconfirming our revenue guidance and raising the midpoint of our guidance range. The new revenue range of $2.465 billion to $2.48 billion implies revenue growth of 13% to 14% for the year.\nSecond quarter 2023 revenue is expected to range from $603 million to $608 million, representing revenue growth of approximately 13% at the midpoint. We are also reconfirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance and raising the midpoint of our guidance range. The new adjusted EBITDA forecast range is now $505 million to $520 million. Our investments in the Homes.com residential marketplace are yielding excellent results, and our investment plans remains unchanged from what we communicated in February. For the second quarter of 2023, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $118 million to $123 million, indicating a second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 20%.\nBefore we move to Q&A, I want to reassure everyone that our cash and our investments are safe and sound, with no adverse impacts from the failure of the Silicon Valley Bank and the other recent banking turmoils. We also have nothing related to First Republic Bank, by the way. We maintain a very conservative treasury strategy that keeps our cash with only the strongest financial institutions and in the safest short-term investments. We actively manage our deposits to maximize interest income within the confines of our low-risk investment practices.\nIn the first quarter, our $5.1 billion of cash earned a net interest of approximately 4.1% for the quarter, producing approximately $44 million of net interest income after deducting the interest expense on our debt. Projecting these results for the rest of the year is expected to yield net interest income of approximately $195 million, which is well above our prior estimates. We're raising our outlook for non-GAAP net income per diluted share to include our latest estimate of net interest income. We now expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $1.21 to $1.24, an increase from our prior guidance of around 15%, which is $0.15 per diluted share at the midpoint.\nSo that about wraps it up for me. You can see we're in a very strong financial position as we head into the second quarter. And our growth, our investment and our profit plans are all on track for another great year.\nSo with that, I will now turn the call back over to our operator for a little bit of Q&A. Hannah, back to you."

My name is Matt, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CoStar Group Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Now Cyndi Eakin, Head of Investor Relations, will read the safe harbor statement. Cyndi, you may begin.\n\nCyndi Eakin\n\nSenior VP of IR & Controller, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matthew. Good evening, and thank you all for joining us to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2022 results of the CoStar Group.\nBefore I turn the call over to Andy Florance, CoStar's CEO and Founder; and Scott Wheeler, our CFO, I would like to review our safe harbor statement. Certain portions of the discussion today may contain forward-looking statements including the company's outlook and expectations for the first quarter and full year 2023 based on current beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements involve many risks, uncertainties, assumptions, estimates and other factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those stated in CoStar Group's press release issued earlier today and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the heading Risk Factors.\nAll forward-looking statements are based on the information available to CoStar on the date of this call. CoStar assumes no obligation to update those statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share and forward-looking non-GAAP guidance, are also shown in the detail in our press release issued today, along with the definition of those terms.\nThe press release is available on our website located at costargroup.com under Press Room. As a reminder, today's conference call is being webcast, and the link is also available on our website under Investors. Please refer to today's press release on how to access the replay of this call.\nAnd with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance.\n\nAndrew C. Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & CEO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Cyndi. Good work. That was a fantastic safe harbor. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call.\nTotal revenue for the full year of 2022 was $2.2 billion or 12% year-over-year growth coming in at the high end of our guidance range and above consensus estimates. Our fourth quarter revenue grew 13% on a constant currency basis over the fourth quarter of '21, up to $573 million. This is our 12th year in a row with double-digit revenue growth.\nWe had a phenomenal year in sales. We delivered the highest net new sales ever with 2022 sales reaching $305 million or 41% growth over the net new sales in '21. We delivered exceptional sales results in the fourth quarter as well, with annualized net new sales bookings of $77 million. This is a 15% increase over the same quarter in '21 and our second highest quarterly net sales bookings result ever. Apartments.com had their highest sales quarter ever, exceeding their prior record set in the second quarter of '20 by 25%. So a shout out to Paige Forrest and her entire team at Apartments.com.\nWe substantially increased the size of our sales force in '22, adding almost 300 people net. We had a very strong profit performance in '22 as well. Our full year adjusted EBITDA was $672 million which was also above the high end of our guidance range and consensus estimates. Overall, we had an exceptional year with both strong sales and profit performance while continuing to invest and grow the business.\nApartments.com revenue was $198 million in the fourth quarter, increasing 16% over the fourth quarter of '21 and $740 million for the full year was a 10% increase over the prior year. Apartments.com delivered another outstanding quarter with a record in sales and an increase in net bookings of 177% over the same period last year. 2022 was an exceptional year for Apartments.com. Our efforts to attract talented sales professionals give them world-class training and get them into production paid dividends. We increased the sales force by 40%, adding over 100 sales representatives to the team. At the same time, we were able to increase our sales productivity with monthly net new sales up 187% as compared to '21. The team also conducted 450,000 quality meetings, both with existing clients and potential prospects, the highest number of meetings in our history.\nWe maintained a very impressive Net Promoter Score with our clients of 93%. The Apartments.com brand is stronger than ever. In 2022, we delivered over 1.2 billion visits to our platforms. Our award-winning marketing campaign featuring the wonderful and funny, Jeff Goldblum as Brad Bellflower, inventor the Apartminternet, entertained audiences and delivered over 12 billion impressions across linear TV and our other 130 media channels.\nWe continue to reach renters and potential renters where they consume the most content, including streaming video, audio, social media platforms and through marketing influencers. Our investments keep proving successful with the new all-time high and unaided brand awareness in the fourth quarter and the #1 ranking among our target audience.\nRent Dynamics, a leading CRM platform for Multifamily properties conducted an analysis of over 500,000 rental leads submitted in the fourth quarter '22. They determined that the Apartments.com network converted leads to leases at twice the rate of Zillow. To be clear, this data shows that the community would have to get twice as many leads from Zillow as from Apartments.com in order to provide the community with an equal number of leases. In fact, the same study showed that Apartments.com network provided communities with almost 4x more leases than the Zillow Rental network and over 9x more leases than rent period.\nAs we look ahead, we are well positioned to penetrate the existing -- the estimated $1.4 billion marketing opportunity in apartment buildings, which have less than 50 units, but more than 5. In '22, we more than doubled our sales force dedicated to this opportunity. And in the fourth quarter, we introduced flexible listing plans, the perfect solution for managers who oversee multiple properties in this under 50-unit apartment category. The product allows managers the flexibility to swap properties they advertise at any time based on their current needs and upcoming availabilities.\nI'm proud to say we launched Apartments.com in Canada in the fourth quarter, marking the brand's first expansion outside the United States. Renters in Canada may now search Canadian geographies for apartments, homes, condos and townhomes for rent. Searches can be conducted in English or France. Some of the key clients in the United States have either already moved into Canada or have plans to move in 2023, and we're ready to support them. 42 of Canada's largest property management companies have already provided us with their data on their communities, and we've acquired listing data from the Canadian Real Estate Association. This allows us to present rental listings for various Canadian MLSs on Apartments.com.\nWe have already experienced enormous traffic growth since our recent launch and are positioned at or near the top of organic spot for searches. We believe we are well positioned to penetrate this $600 million estimated Canadian apartment marketing opportunity with our strong brand and unique product offerings.\nThe U.S. macroeconomic conditions continue to support an increase in the demand for advertising. U.S. Multifamily vacancy rates rose another 50 basis points to 7.1% compared to the last quarter. The U.S. and Canadian marketing conditions, along with the strength of our brand and our sales force, give us confidence in our ability to return to 20% annual revenue growth.\nCoStar revenue was $837 million in 2022, up 16% over the prior year, making it an outstanding year. CoStar net new sales were record high and 16% more than our prior highest sales year. Both the North American and European sales teams delivered the highest net new sales ever. We added over 60 new sales representatives to the CoStar team this past year, which is an increase of almost 20% over '21. We're in the final stages of transitioning customers to the global CoStar platform which to date has generated over $40 million in incremental revenue. We launched the CoStar Lender product, which generated almost $6 million already in net new sales in 140 new customers, and we're just getting started there.\nThis quarter, we expect to complete the process of linking over 70,000 commercial properties to 12,600 investment funds or property investment funds, providing our clients with insights into these property fund portfolios. The product will allow a user to search for funds raising capital in those with dry powder invest and gather insights into a fund manager's investment strategy, property type, target country or and/or transaction history. We're about to deliver significant enhancements to our tenant product as well. In the past, our tenant product has provided our users with valuable details on over 5 million tenant locations. With the coming upgrade of tenant will provide users with an aggregate roll-up of all of a given company's locations so that the user can better understand how the most important tenants utilize space across their portfolios and how our clients can best capitalize on these various tenants' space needs.\nCoStar definitely had a tremendous year. I'm confident in our ability to continue to grow at double-digit rates with the strength of our product capabilities, high renewal rates and continued ongoing thoughtful investments.\nLoopNet fourth quarter revenue was $61 million, up 12% over the prior year. Net new sales bookings in '22 set a record for LoopNet. Net new sales in the fourth quarter were up 198% over the fourth quarter of last year and trailing 12-month net new sales were up 56% over '21. We added over 100 sales representatives to LoopNet in '22, which almost quadrupled the size of the LoopNet sales team. With the successful launch of LoopNet in Canada and the U.K., we now have a growing international offering. We have planned launches in France and Spain in '23. Our brand and our product remains strong with traffic to LoopNet network of sites continuing to outperform competition dramatically both domestically and internationally.\nLoopNet now ranks #1 for 129,000 relevant commercial keywords on Google, and we have twice the number of keywords ranked in the top 3 positions than our next closest competitor. In '23, we'll continue to grow the sales force as well as our SEM investment, along with our digital and broad-based media campaigns. The new marketing campaign will be focused on elevating LoopNet brand owners and brokers across a mix of multimedia channels, including linear, digital and social platforms. These marketing efforts will drive leads to our expanded sales force and reposition our -- reinforce our position as the most popular place to find a space. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the progress we've made building out the LoopNet team and its international platform, which gives confidence in our ability to achieve our target of 18% to 19% revenue growth in '23.\nSTR's revenue growth accelerated from single-digit growth in the first quarter of '22 to 12% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of '22 on a constant currency basis. The hotel industry has recovered. And in the U.S., average daily rates and revenue per room are well ahead of pre-pandemic levels. Internationally, the industry isn't far behind.\nCurrent market conditions put us in a great position to launch our new benchmarking product, which we believe will provide incredible new valuable to hotel brands, operators and owners around the world. Our new benchmarking product combines the very best of STR's deep hotel industry acumen and expertise with CoStar's innovative technology and industry-leading software. Users will find an interactive benchmarking platform with areas that preserve the familiarity of the STAR report whilst introducing new features and functionality and analytics charts and graphs to deliver additional insights into their hotels performance. The deep proprietary performance data and user-defined competitive sets aggregates will be available for users to manage their properties set rate and occupancy strategies and optimize performance.\nCoStar now houses an inventory of more than 0.25 million hotels, including 77,000 benchmarking participants in over 180 countries with 175,000 unique users for that information. These users will access their performance data and industry data from 572 hospitality markets, 1,900 submarkets and over 6,000 class segments in their selected currency. Owners will have clear visibility into asset performance, market performance and the competitive landscape. This insight is valuable for asset acquisition, repositioning and disposition. Operators will have access to data and tools to better forecast budget, yield, manage and identify demand drivers and supply implications. Hotel brands will have its full suite to support development teams, franchise and owner relationships and management contracts.\nDuring '23, we'll be migrating those 175,000 users including 900 corporate customers and 6,000 independent hotels to this new digital marketing platform based in CoStar. They've already begun to integrate the outputs with their workflows, and we are experiencing significant product -- and are experiencing significant productivity improvements. In short, we're on track to achieve our goal to effectively utilize a digital product that entire industry relies on and unlock significant new value for our clients. These enhancements will help us to gain further share and penetrate the $300 million addressable hotel market.\nTen-X brought $5 billion in assets to the platform for sale in '22 for an increase of 42% year-over-year. That's the highest level we've seen in the platform since 2012. Ten-X closed $2.5 billion of those asset sales, which is up 16% over last year and the highest level since 2016. This performance was in the face of a significant slowdown in overall commercial real estate sales volumes, which had declined almost 55% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We continue to see consistency in the percentage of non-distressed assets brought to the platform at approximately 80%, indicating that the volume of distressed sales has not yet picked up. Full year revenue for 10x grew 11% year-over-year.\nIn '22, we made significant progress enhancing the platform. We've now fully integrated Ten-X with our CoStar and LoopNet platforms, and that's driving sales and operating efficiencies. We had our first buyer bid on a Ten-X property from within LoopNet last week, and they won the auction for that property. So they're really fully integrated now. With integration, Ten-X is now positioned to handle dramatically higher volumes. We've also doubled our Ten-X sales force since the last year. New Ten-X sales representatives with tenure under 24 months are productive and brought 318% more assets to the platform in '22 than the prior year, and they accounted for 55% of total assets. The commercial property transaction market is in a period of disruption with $93 billion of CMBS loans expected to come due in '23.\nTrade rates continue to reflect the spread in buyer and seller expectations. Ten-X continues to maintain a significant advantage off the old off-line trade rates and exceed -- and we've exceeded those by 81% over the course of '21. So we are in a down market dramatically more effective. A digital platform that can close a transaction within 90 days as compared to the market average off-line of approximately 300 days has a significant advantage and is well positioned for challenging market conditions.\nI'm pleased to report that we're making significant gains in building consumer traffic on Homes.com Unique visitors to Homes.com climbed 130% year-over-year in January, according to Google Analytics. Our SEO traffic to Homes.com increased 78% month-over-month in January. According to comScore, January '23 over January '22, our Homes.com traffic increased 100%, while comScore indicated Realtor.com was down 15%, Zillow was down 6%, and Redfin was relatively flat at about 6%.\nIn total, our Homes.com network had approximately 24 million unique visitors in January according to Google Analytics. We still have a lot of work to do here but we have a clear road map and have our heads down focused on building the best residential real estate portal in the United States. Our team is excited to be working on this. They're highly motivated and committed to the mission. We believe that given our progress in building traffic to date, we'll be in a position to begin monetizing Homes.com in the later part of this year. We now have over 1 million agents registered on our Homes.com platform, which is an increase of 33% over last year.\nDuring the year, we successfully integrated the back ends of Homes.com and Homesnap platforms into 1 efficient residential technology stack. We're making significant progress executing on \"your listing, your lead\" strategy. While other sites are injecting their agents into the home buyers' search experience, somewhat awkwardly, we offer a friction-free environment connecting buyers directly to the listing agents who know the property and the home best that the buyer is interested in. We're also presenting consumers with hundreds of thousands of highly qualified potential buyer agents for free based upon those buyer agent skills and experiences rather based on how much the buyer agent is willing to give up in commission to the portal.\nWe believe that we offer a dramatically better consumer experience than do sites that try and take a commission split from the inquiries buyers submit. I've used some of these competing sites myself and submitted leads on properties I'm interested in. The experience is remarkably awful. The moment you submit a lead and for months afterwards, you've been bartered with [cold] costs from countless agents who have questionable qualifications. We believe that Homes.com offers a significantly improved consumer experience over that competition.\nNot only do we believe we offer a superior consumer experience for buyers, we also believe we are much better aligned with real estate agents. The competing models use all the agents listings in a market to funnel monetized leads to just a very small percentage of agents. So some of these competing models are diverting all the agents leads to a small number of agents who are paying the portal. In their model, these few agents pay a huge fees and the vast majority of agents get little value, if not downright disadvantaged by these competitors. We believe that by respecting \"your listing, your lead,\" we can serve all the agents better. We are not just providing value to the agents with a listing though. We're making it easier for buyers to find agents who have expertise and experience that are the best match for the needs of those buyers and facilitating connecting with them and collaborating with them without us trying to again inject ourselves in the process inappropriately.\nOur product development and research teams have now released a robust agent directory featuring hundreds of thousands of agents and extensive media to enhance their profiles. Our agent collaboration tools are up and running. We've had tremendous feedback from both agents and consumers.\nThe interactive experience replaces the historically inefficient e-mail and text communications back and forth between agents and homebuyers. We've successfully previewed this new Homes.com at the National Association of Realtors Convention in November, where we demonstrated our product to close to 2,000 agents and we received very positive feedback across the board.\nRevenue for Residential segment was $74 million in '22, which was roughly flat compared to revenue in '21. As we mentioned on our last call, this is legacy Homesnap revenue, mostly selling social media and search engine advertising to agents. We believe that this revenue is less strategic and less sticky than the revenue we'll generate from a high-intent marketplace like Homes.com. We have effectively transitioned most of our sales resources to other higher yield marketplace as we continue to deemphasize the Homesnap products in favor of future Homes.com revenue. In the later part of the year, we'll begin to bring more sales resources back on to the Residential segment in the Homes.com product.\nOur planned investment into marketing to drive traffic to Homes.com will increase later in the year as we approach the point where we are ready to monetize Homes.com. As you've heard us say before, CoStar is always assessing opportunities to maximize shareholder value, including strategic acquisitions. And the discussions announced last month by News Corp with respect to a potential sale of Move, Inc., the operator of Realtor.com, were part of that ongoing effort. While we typically do not comment on potential acquisition opportunities.\nIn light of News Corp's prior announcements, we are confirming here at this point, CoStar Group is not acquiring Realtor.com. We have tremendous respect for the people behind Realtor.com and for the National Association of Realtors. But again, I need to make it clear. At this point, CoStar Group is not acquiring Realtor.com. We continue to believe that Homes.com's business model and our principles are well aligned with the interest of NAR members and real estate agents generally.\nTurning to the real estate economy. The office sector continues to show weakness with vacancies up 13 of the past 14 quarters and now stands at 14.6%. Availability rates are much higher at 18.5%. Many second-generation office properties are now in significant distress. We expect to see many of these owners with no choice but to hand the keys back to the bank. We're well positioned to assist in recapitalizing those properties on Ten-X as they come to market.\nI do believe that there is hope of recovery in the out years for office though. A recent Castle Index reading showed a possible shift in momentum as office usage climbed over to 50% mark over the pre-pandemic levels. That means that for the first time since the pandemic, more people are working in an office than are working at home. I believe that's because people are more productive, efficient and in touch when they work together in person. I also believe that teams work together are more competitive.\nWhile we expect vacancies to continue to rise and office properties continue to be negatively impacted in the near term, we see the continued return to work trend as a positive sign for the office sectors future. With 1.3 million office-using jobs added since the beginning of the pandemic, and negative 118 million square feet of absorption over the same time period, there may be significant pent-up demand for office space.\nThe industrial sector posted a healthy fourth quarter and the sector is seeing an unprecedented amount of new supply due to the high levels of demand for goods seen since the beginning of the start of the pandemic -- or since the start of the pandemic. The sector's vacancies are at half of their long-term average. The retail sector exhibited the strongest fundamentals in the fourth quarter and was the only asset class to see vacancies decline. Relatively strong demand and relatively low supply are both a continuation of trends we've seen since the beginning of the pandemic.\nDemand has outpaced new supply for 7 consecutive quarters leading to a fourth quarter of vacancy of 4.2%, the lowest retail vacancy rate ever recorded. So it would appear that the death of retail real estate was only a rumor. The residential housing market is continuing to see softness. Home prices soared during the pandemic due to cheap money, but now mortgage rates have climbed over 7%, as you likely know. In combination, this has resulted in terrible affordability issue at levels not seen in more than 30 years. With buyers being priced out of the market and existing homeowners being discouraged from moving due to having financed at historically low rates, existing home sales have fallen for the 11th consecutive month, an overall drop of 38%.\nWe've recently celebrated our introduction to the NASDAQ 100 and the S&P 500. That's probably connected to the fact that we've now achieved 12 straight years of double-digit revenue growth. 2022 was our highest net new sales bookings year ever, and we now have over 1,100 productive sales representatives, executing on many of our significant market opportunities. We published our second environmental and social and governance report, which you can find in the Investor Relations sector of our website, highlighting our ESG goals and accomplishments for '22. We are now reporting our baseline greenhouse gas emissions.\nInside CoStar Group, we continue to prioritize being a leader in sustainability. We have a hybrid or electric fleet of over 200 research vehicles, we select LEED certified or ENERGY STAR rate of buildings for most of our 80-plus offices. We have facilitated over 30 million virtual tours through Apartments.com, LoopNet, Homes.com land marketplaces thereby potentially avoiding massive amounts of carbon that would have been created by people driving for traditional physical property tours. We've also increased the transparency of our human capital disclosures, including publishing both our EEO-1 and pay gap analysis. I am extremely proud of our diverse and equitable workforce, I'm encouraged by all that we've done and all that we're still poised to do in making CoStar Group as sustainable, transparent and a diverse as company as can be.\nOur 2022 employee engagement scores climbed to a well above average 83%, which is the highest engagement scores we've ever obtained. We're also proud to have a highly engaged workforce, which is reflected in our low average monthly voluntary turnover rate of just 1.6%, which is way below the professional and business services industry rate of 3.3%.\nSo with that, at this point, I'm going to turn the call over to our approximately 83% engaged Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler.\n\nScott T. Wheeler\n\nCFO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andy. I think I'll get through about 83% of my script, and then I'll turn off the mic, how does that sound?\nActually, I think you are probably increasing or you brought down our turnover rate given your tenure here at the company. So thank you for that contribution.\nSo as Andy talked to a lot of this, so that 2022 is certainly a very strong year for the business, particularly in light of all the economic uncertainty we've had with inflation and higher interest rates, continued fears of recessions. You've seen so many technology companies, particularly property technology companies that have seen steep revenue declines and their cost cutting in this past year. But fortunately, that certainly is not our CoStar situation. We've pointed this out many times before over the years, but it certainly worth repeating.\nOur business model is extremely resilient to economic and transactional fluctuations. We have mission-critical information, countercyclical marketplaces, a disciplined subscription revenue model with 90-plus percent renewal rates, and we have a monstrous balance sheet. All in all, we're coming out of '22 stronger than ever. It's important and strategic, I believe, at this time for us to continue to invest in our biggest growth opportunities is similar to our strategy in 2015 when we increased investment levels to build Apartments.com, which we believe is now the undisputed leading rental marketplace in the United States and soon Canada. More on that later.\nSo financially, in the fourth quarter and in 2022, we certainly crushed it all around. We beat our revenue goals every quarter, topping the high end of our guidance range once again in the fourth quarter. Our $2.18 billion of revenue for the year is well above the initial forecast that we communicated at the beginning of 2022. Our organic revenue growth rate was 12% for the year.\nProfit results for 2022 also came in above expectations with fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Our Commercial Information and Marketplace businesses delivered strong operating leverage, improving margins by 300 basis points in 2022 to get within 1% of our established 40% margin goal for the year, and we made excellent progress with our residential investment program while spending less. Overall, we ended the year with $672 million in adjusted EBITDA, which was 15% above the middle of the guidance range that we set out to start the year. We're determined to repeat and improve upon our '22 performance in '23 using the same strategic formula. Our focus is on accelerating revenue growth in our Commercial Information and Marketplace businesses while delivering cost productivity, operating leverage and strong margins. This commercial business engine is expected to provide increased profit levels and cash flow to fund our growth investments, most notably our Homes.com Residential Marketplace expansion.\nWith regards to revenue performance and outlook in our various businesses, I'm going to have to give my MVP vote this year to Apartments.com. Our Multifamily revenue growth continued to accelerate throughout 2022 ending the year at 16% in the fourth quarter, up 5 percentage points from 11% revenue growth in the third quarter. We see positive signs in both volume and ad level mix. The number of properties advertising on the Apartments.com network continues to grow, and we're now at a peak level of over 62,000. As vacancy rates increase, we see more properties moving up ad levels to increase their exposure and their lead volumes creating positive revenue mix. We expanded our sales force in '22 by 40% in Apartments.com and we certainly expect these new sellers to increase their productivity in 2023. So we expect revenue growth to increase to 19% in the first quarter of 2023 and 20% for the full year for Apartments.com. That's truly an amazing comeback this past year for the team, and the best is still ahead.\nCoStar revenue grew 15% in the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year, in line with our previous guidance. CoStar's '22 revenue growth rate was 7 percentage points higher than that of 2021 on the strength of our sales efforts and the global product upgrade initiative, which to date has contributed approximately $40 million of revenue to CoStar.\nFor full year 2023, we expect CoStar revenue growth to moderate somewhat to 12% as the global product upgrade campaign nears completion and our CPI renewal pricing is expected to soften throughout the year with the rates of CPI. We expect CoStar revenue growth in the first quarter of 2023 to be approximately 13%.\nLoopNet revenue grew 12% in the fourth quarter and 11% for the full year of 2022, in line with our guidance. Over the past 12 months, we've increased our LoopNet sales team by over 100 heads with 2/3 of those hires joining us in the last 6 months. Our LoopNet dedicated sales team made a significant contribution to the increase in net new bookings of over 50% for the year. As our new sellers ramp up their experience and productivity in the year ahead, we expect further increases in LoopNet sales.\nWe expect first quarter 2023 LoopNet revenue growth in the 14% to 16% range and full year growth around 18% to 19%. Residential revenue was $16 million in the fourth quarter and $74 million for the full year, up slightly from the $73 million guidance we previously provided. We now estimate that the revenue of approximately $45 million will be in 2023 for Residential, a reduction of around $30 million. Half of that reduction is revenue from the concierge lead scrubbing product with another 25% of the decline resulting from the annualization of Homes.com and MLS revenues that we discontinued in 2022.\nHomesnap Pro and Pro+ continue to perform well with over 1 million registered users and nearly 500,000 active agents on the platform. We expect Residential revenue of approximately $13 million in the first quarter. We've not included estimated revenue from Homes.com advertising products at this time in our 2023 forecast. We'll provide further updates as we make progress throughout the year.\nOther Marketplace revenue was $38 million in the fourth quarter of '22, a growth rate of 8% year-over-year. Our lands for sale and business for sale marketplaces continue to perform well growing 17% in aggregate in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nTen-X continues to generate solid revenues despite the significant disruption in the transaction markets, with fourth quarter revenue up slightly over the fourth quarter of 2021. Ten-X revenues are expected to trend lower in the first half of 2023 on a sequential and year-over-year basis before recovering in the second half of the year with stronger growth. We expect the lands and businesses for sale marketplaces to continue to deliver strong double-digit growth in 2023. Overall, we expect full year 2023 revenue growth of 10% to 11% in our other marketplaces sector with Q run revenue down in the range of 10% to 13% year-over-year on lower 10x transaction revenue expectations. Information Services revenue grew 12% in the fourth quarter and 11% for the full year of 2022 ahead of our 10% guidance.\nFor 2023, we expect first quarter revenue growth of 10% to 12% and full year growth in the range of 7% to 9%. Our sales force totaled approximately 1,130 people at the end of the year, an increase of 300 sales reps over the ending 2021 sales teams levels. We're already seeing strong contributions from our new sellers in the booking results, and we expect this sales investment to produce revenue growth acceleration in 2023 and beyond as they become more productive over time.\nWe intend to continue to selectively grow the sales force in 2023, albeit at a little slower pace than in 2022 with a focus primarily on Apartments.com and LoopNet, both of which are expected to benefit from the positive countercyclical effects of lower occupancy levels. Our contract renewal rates remain in the 90% to 91% range that we communicated last quarter, while the renewal rate in the fourth quarter for customers who have been subscribers for 5 years or longer remained strong at 95%.\nSubscription revenue on annual contracts continues to climb and was 81% for the fourth quarter of 2022, up from 77% in the previous year and up 3 percentage points sequentially from third quarter of 2022. These improvements reflect modest increases in both Multifamily and LoopNet and a positive mix effect of winding down some of those unattractive legacy products in the Residential sector.\nSo looking ahead to 2023, we expect revenue to range from $2.46 billion to $2.48 billion, an increase of approximately $290 million at the midpoint of the range, implying annual growth rates of 13%. First quarter 2022 revenue is expected to range from $575 million to $580 million representing revenue growth of 12% year-over-year at the midpoint. Now the big question around here is who's going to reach the $1 billion revenue run rate first? Will it be CoStar or Apartments.com. It's going to be exciting to watch as we get into the second half of the year and down the home stretch into the fourth quarter.\nWith our biggest commercial businesses of CoStar Apartments.com and LoopNet growing in the strong double digits with bigger sales teams, we expect revenue growth rates to accelerate for our Commercial Information and Marketplace businesses from 13% in 2022 to 15% organic revenue growth in 2023.\nWe plan to operate our Commercial Businesses in 2023 to deliver similar adjusted EBITDA levels as we achieved in 2022 on a margin perspective in order to provide growth capital for our Homes.com Residential Marketplace investments. 2023 adjusted EBITDA is expected in the range of $500 million to $520 million, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA margin rate of approximately 21% for the year. First quarter 2023 adjusted EBITDA is expected in the range of $111 million to $116 million, indicating a margin of 20% at the midpoint.\nAs we move through 2023, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins in the 20% range during the second and third quarters of 2023 with fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to improve modestly to around 22% to 23%. Included in our 2023 outlook are a number of our most important strategic investments for the future growth of the company. As Andy talked through, we're making significant progress with regards to our Homes.com Residential Marketplace, we plan to increase our investment levels in 2023. Our investments continue to be focused on product development, content creation and building consumer traffic on Homes.com.\nGrowing our sales force across all of our major businesses is another important area of investment. The majority of the new sales resources in 2022 were added in the middle of the year, the cost of which carries over to 2023 along with the added investment in new sellers that we plan to add this coming year. We expect a great return on every salesperson and are more than happy to carry the investment at this point ahead of when they become fully productive. Closely aligned with the growth of our sales team is our plan to invest in fresh marketing campaigns in both Apartments.com and LoopNet with so many new sellers. We plan to provide the necessary marketing air cover to generate quality sales leads for our sales team.\nFinally, with regards to areas of growth investment, we plan to continue our European expansion in order to build the pan-European LoopNet marketplace and increase information content for CoStar expansion. So in summary, I'm very encouraged by the exceptional results we delivered in 2022 at a time when the markets and interest rates and inflation all created a healthy dose of economic volatility.\nOur team is laser-focused on our most meaningful growth investments while producing strong sustainable profit levels in our established commercial businesses. With the early success and increased momentum in our Homes.com Residential Marketplace, I remain confident that we are on pace to achieve the long-range targets we set last year of $5 billion in revenue and $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA in the year 2027.\nSo thanks to the entire CoStar team for a fantastic 2022, and I look forward to our next update in a couple of months. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Matt, so we can start the Q&A session. Matt, over to you."

My name is Bailey, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everybody to the CoStar Group Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)\nNow Cyndi Eakin, Head of Investor Relations, will read the safe harbor statement. Cyndi, you may begin.\n\nCyndi Eakin\n\nSenior VP of IR & Controller, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bailey. Good evening, and thank you all for joining us to discuss the third quarter 2022 results for the CoStar Group. Before I turn the call over to Andy Florance, CoStar's CEO and Founder; and Scott Wheeler, our CFO, I would like to review our safe harbor statement.\nCertain portions of the discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook and expectations for the third quarter and full year 2022 based on current beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements involve many risks, uncertainties, assumptions, estimates and other factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements.

All forward-looking statements are based on the information available to CoStar on the date of this call. CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nReconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call include EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share and forward-looking non-GAAP guidance are also shown and detailed in our press release issued today, along with the definition of those terms.

Please refer to today's press release on how to access the replay of this call.\nAnd with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance.\n\nAndrew C. Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & CEO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Cyndi. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This is our 97th consecutive earnings call.\nTotal revenue for the third quarter grew 13% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to $557 million, coming in at the high end of our guidance range and above consensus estimates. We delivered exceptional results in the third quarter with annualized net new sales bookings of $76 million, a 62% increase over the same quarter in 2021. This is our second highest quarterly net sales bookings number ever. Adjusted EBITDA was $153 million for the quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and consensus estimates. As a result, we're raising our full year outlook for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA.\nApartments.com surged, turning in the highest sales month ever in September and its second highest sales quarter. Year-to-date, net new sales for Apartments.com are up 192% over the prior year. Apartments.com revenues were $190 million in the third quarter, increasing 11% over the third quarter of '21. We are now back to double-digit revenue growth and expect the growth rate to improve in the fourth quarter.\nTight multifamily market conditions have been a headwind for Apartments.com, but are now shifting and may, in fact, become a strong tailwind. Vacancy rates rose to 6.1% in the third quarter, an increase of 40 basis points from the last quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarterly increase in the vacancy rate, and we are now only 40 basis points below the historical long-term average vacancy rate.\nUnit absorption rates dropped to 52,000 units in the third quarter from 67,000 units in the second quarter. This is the lowest absorption rate in the past 11 quarters. At the same time, though, unit deliveries increased from the second quarter to 122,000, which is at the higher end of historical averages. With the number of units under construction nearing all-time highs and absorption moving towards all-time lows, vacancies are expected to rise further in coming quarters, which we believe will increase the demand for advertising. The Apartments.com sales force delivered absolutely outstanding results in the third quarter. Good work, Paige and team.\nOur gross sales productivity per rep was 91% versus the same quarter last year, reaching an all-time high. With 60,000 apartment buildings on the platform, we have now reached an all-time high for participation. Given that we are still very early with relatively low market penetration in this opportunity, we continue to hire aggressively and have increased the sales force by 26% since the end of last year. We plan to continue growing the team over the next year or so until we have doubled the sales force.\nOur nationwide ad campaign has delivered over 12 billion media impressions and led to an all-time high in consumer brand awareness. Apartments.com continues to provide the highest quality consumer traffic to our customers. We believe that a specific purpose site such as Apartments.com delivers higher-intent leads. We also believe that third-party lead analysis shows that our leads convert to leases at significantly higher rates than any of our competitors. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the strong performance of our Apartments.com marketplace and sales team and have increasing confidence in our ability to return to 20% revenue growth.\nRevenue for CoStar was $213 million in the third quarter, representing a 17% increase over the same quarter a year ago on a constant currency basis. CoStar sales results increased 55% in the trailing 12 months compared to the trailing 12-month sales in the same quarter a year ago. We surpassed 180,000 subscribers in the third quarter and continue to maintain high renewal rates at 93%.\nOur consistent double-digit revenue growth and high renewal rates for CoStar are a result of ongoing product investments that broaden the capabilities of CoStar and allow us to reach new customers. Integrating STR hotel data opened up hospitality investors as customers, while our new lender product makes 6,000 medium and large lending institutions great prospects to become customers. We literally have dozens of major potential product enhancements on our product road map, which we will continue to deliver -- which will continue to deliver revenue growth opportunities for the next decade or more.\nThe next product enhancement on the CoStar roadmap involves adding information on 12,600 commercial property investment funds that invest almost $3.6 trillion in commercial properties around the world. These investment funds hold over 70,000 commercial properties. Over the past year, our research team has been linking the investment fund's property information to properties in CoStar and adding properties in countries that are currently not in our data sets. Approximately 70% of the investment fund properties are in the United States, Canada and the U.K., while the remaining 30% expand our property coverage throughout the rest of the world.\nFor the first time, these fund investors will have new detailed analytics on their property portfolios through CoStar. They'll be able to access information like historic sales comps, leasing history, pricing, vacancy rates and other important details to help understand their portfolios better. In addition, brokers and owners looking to sell properties will be able to clear the investment fund data to determine which funds still have dry powder and are looking to invest in properties that are similar to theirs.\nI believe this new investment fund capability unlocks significant potential revenue opportunity. The investment fund product is scheduled to release in CoStar in the first quarter of 2023. We believe that there is significantly more revenue opportunity ahead for CoStar so we're continuing to grow our CoStar sales force to better capture that opportunity. We've added over 50 new sellers so far this year and plan to continue to expand both in the U.S. and internationally. As we add to our sales teams, we've seen productivity levels increase as well.\nAverage gross sales per rep are higher this year than in any single quarter in the past 5 years. With our strong product development capabilities and continued investments in our sales team, I'm confident in our ability to sustain strong double-digit growth in CoStar for many years.\nLoopNet third quarter revenue was $59 million, up 13% over the prior year on a constant currency basis. Net new sales bookings for LoopNet in the third quarter are up 99% over the third quarter of last year, just 1 percentage point shy of being up 100% year-over-year. We'll try harder next time.\nOur sales team is now producing consistent, strong sales results every month. Over the past 6 months, we've produced more net sales bookings than we did in all of 2021. I'm very encouraged by the progress that Dave Mele and his team are making as we grow our dedicated LoopNet sales force, which is now 3x the size it was from the beginning of the year. We have now surpassed 100 dedicated sales reps.\nThe result is that dedicated LoopNet sellers now account for roughly half of all the LoopNet sales, and the CoStar sales force is delivering the other half. This is an improvement from a year ago when our dedicated LoopNet sales team produced roughly 1/3 of LoopNet sales. In the long term, we want to free up the CoStar sales force to focus more effort on CoStar as it approaches $1 billion in revenue.\nTraffic to our LoopNet network of sites reached a high in the third quarter, averaging approximately 13 million unique visitors per month. We now hold the #1 keyword rank across 130,000 commercial real estate search terms and soar to the #1 position 97% of the time across 10,000 of the highest-performing U.S. commercial real estate search terms.\nOur Space for Dreams media campaign has proven very successful, delivering over 200 million impressions across TV, social media and the web in the third quarter. We continue to expand LoopNet internationally with plans to launch loopnet.co.uk across the United Kingdom in early November. Following our successful launch of LoopNet in Canada in the first quarter, we believe there is significant brand efficiency, revenue, profit advantages in operating a multinational property marketplace.\nWe estimate the potential revenue for digital commercial property advertising in the U.K. to be well north of $100 million, which up to this point is largely untapped. Loopnet.co.uk will bring together the market-leading traffic position of Realla, with a proven international LoopNet brand. We intend to redirect traffic from Realla to LoopNet and sunset Realla. It's been a very successful site.\nAs our CoStar clients in the U.K. are renewing their annual CoStar contracts, our sales force is working with them to add LoopNet advertising to their service. Today, many of the listings on Realla have been free in order to build traffic, but our goal is to convert many to pay on LoopNet over the course of the next 18 months.\nFollowing the launch of LoopNet in the U.K., we'll turn our attention to rolling out LoopNet in France, Spain and Germany in 2023. We're really excited to deliver the first multinational commercial real estate marketplaces, and we believe it will have huge appeal. We believe that the LoopNet opportunity is in excess of $1 billion as we extend across Europe.\nOur Ten-X digital auction platform performed very well in the third quarter despite a significant slowdown in overall CRE sales volumes due to the disruption caused by surging inflation and the rapid increase in interest rates. While CRE transactions were down in the market by almost $30 billion in the third quarter, the volume of properties brought to the Ten-X platform increased 88% over the prior year. Consistent with prior quarters, over 80% of the assets brought to the platform through Ten-X are still market rate performing assets, and less than 20% of the assets are distressed properties. I expect a significant increase in distressed properties in the quarters to come.\nClearly, the commercial property transaction market is in a period of disruption, with buyer and seller expectations not yet on the same page. Buyers are quick to recognize price drops, but sellers are slower to accept reality. The result is an overall drop in sales volume across the board. As expected, we are seeing a drop in the rate that properties brought to the platform actually end up selling, what we call the trade rate. The Ten-X trade rates rose to highs of 75% in the fourth quarter of 2021, and have since dropped 27% to around 55%. Nevertheless, Ten-X continues to be a more effective way to sell properties, because in the same time period, we saw traditional off-line trades dropped from 42% from a 43% trade rate to a 55% trade rate.\nThe Ten-X platform trade rate went from outperforming off-line sales by 74% in a stable market to outperforming off-line sales by 120% in a dislocated market. We believe the buyer-seller dislocation is a near-term event that will resolve itself over the next 2 to 3 quarters. Generally, once buyer and seller's expectations align again, sales volumes increase and distressed sales grow significantly. Currently, distressed sales rates are at multiyear lows, but believe they will significantly climb in the intermediate term.\nIn 2008, the year of significant economic dislocation, there were only about 2,900 distressed commercial property sales, and distressed sales took years to peak with about 16,000 distressed sales in 2012. Year-to-date, similar to 2008, there's only been about 2,178 distressed sales. I would not be surprised if the number of distressed property sales quadrupled over the next few years, creating significant revenue opportunity for Ten-X.\nWe've made a major investment to integrate Ten-X into CoStar and LoopNet, and we have dramatically increased the size of the Ten-X sales force. In the next few months, we'll complete all those integration efforts of Ten-X, enabling significant scale efficiencies. I believe the platform has never been stronger and is ready to handle a surge in activity. Regardless of where we are with the economic cycles, we're building Ten-X for the long term. I'm confident our Ten-X digital platform will become the industry standard for fast, efficient property transactions, both for performing and distressed assets. Regardless of the economic cycle, Ten-X will be ready.\nOur residential business continues to perform well, with third quarter revenue of $19 million. Registered agents for our Homesnap Pro and Pro+ products have grown to over 958,000 at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 23% over the same quarter last year. We're getting close to 1 million registered agents. Registered agents for Citysnap are also growing rapidly. We now have approximately 70% of the Real Estate Board of New York agents registered to use Citysnap, and we only launched the product a little over 3 months ago.\nTraffic to Homes.com continues to grow, with average monthly unique visitors for the third quarter, up 52% compared to the third quarter of 2021. Site visits to Homes.com were up 83% of the same period last year according to Google Analytics. The greater increase of visits to visitors show deeper -- shows deeper engagement with the site. I'm encouraged by the rapid improvement in consumer traffic. We do have a long way to go, but we're tracking just where we were with traffic growth on Apartments.com at the same time. And Apartments.com was a very successful launch. According to comScore, September 2022 over September 2021, Homes.com visits grew 27%, while in the same time period, Zillow fell 22% and Realtor fell 30%.\nAs we communicated before in previous earnings calls, our residential product strategy is centered around a Homes.com marketplace that advertises the home as opposed to just advertising agents. We believe consumers that search for properties for sale in a marketplace like Homes.com have higher intent than consumers who are served home-for-sale ads randomly across social media or the Internet. Our objective is to partner with the 1.5 million agents in the United States in support of \"your listing, your lead\" approach and enable consumers and any agent to collaborate digitally throughout the home buying or selling process.\nWe're focused on building complete coverage of residential listings throughout the United States, as well as developing unique proprietary content by leveraging the skills and capabilities of our awesome nationwide research organization. Overall, we're making great progress developing Homes.com across all these strategic areas, and are looking forward to showcasing a number of our agent-focused product features at the upcoming National Association of Realtors Convention in early November. In fact, I believe we have a big product release Thursday or Friday of this week, if you want to check out some of the incremental upgrades at the end of the week. With rising interest rates and a rapidly cooling residential property market, I believe now is the perfect time to invest in a marketplace that's designed to help consumers and their agents advertise and sell properties faster and at a higher price. Deteriorating market conditions may well create a tailwind for our business model.\nThe majority of Homesnap's revenue is from reselling social media and search engine advertising to agents. We believe that this revenue, while it's good revenue, is less strategic, less durable and just playing less of it than the potential revenue generated by a potentially successful high-intent marketplace like Homes.com. This is a lesson we've learned from our experience with Apartments.com, ForRent, LoopNet and other marketplaces we operate.\nIn the coming quarters, we're going to deemphasize selling Homesnap Concierge and Homesnap Pro+ and temporarily shift those selling resources to our marketplaces, Apartments.com and LoopNet. Our sales teams will gain new skills and become even more well-rounded sellers across multiple marketplaces. After a brief transition period, we believe that we will generate more revenue overall with a shift in sales force allocation. As we have communicated previously, when we have built critical traffic mass for Homes.com, we will then reallocate or allocate significant selling resources to Homes.com.\nThere is a potentially interesting development in the residential industry I want to briefly mention. We're closely monitoring ongoing antitrust litigation involving residential listing associations, or MLSs, and one that's currently pending in the Western District of Missouri. A class of home sellers allege that NAR and brokerage defendants created and enforced anti-competitive rules that require home sellers to pay a nonnegotiable commission to the broker representing the home buyer, resulting in inflated buyer-side brokerage commissions. To date, the plaintiffs have had some success defeating a motion to dismiss and succeeding class certification. The case is scheduled for trial in February. If the plaintiffs in this case or other similar cases succeed, this could have a significant adverse effect on residential marketplaces that rely primarily on broker sharing commission revenue models.\nOur residential sales strategy should not be impacted as we are focused on a property advertising model. I do not believe that judgment for the plaintiffs would significantly adversely impact most residential agents because most do both seller and buyer representation, and the judgment would just shift fees from the buyer representation business to the seller representation business. More on that in February.\nThe rise in interest rates over the past 7 months is certainly weighing on real estate, driving prices down and reducing sales volumes. The slowdown has been broad-based across property types and geographies. Office vacancy rates continue to climb as companies continue to recover from the pandemic and a significant number but minority of workers continue to work from home. In the third quarter, vacancy rates rose to 12.4%, and that's approaching historic highs.\nInflation-adjusted rents are well below normal levels and rent growth is at a 10-year low. Net absorption has been negative for 7 of the last 10 quarters. Office vacancy will continue to rise and rents will continue to likely experience negative pressure. However, each quarter, millions more office workers are returning to working in person because of the significant advantages of in-person collaboration.\nAccording to Kastle security (sic) [Kastle Systems] in January of this year, usage of office space was only about 16% of the prepandemic levels. But by last week, office usage had tripled this year to 49%. So from 16% at the beginning of the year to 49% now. That's a pretty fast climb. The trend is obvious. Traditional office using white collar employment is continuing to grow, which means there's more underlying demand. And as more and more people return to the workplace, the new office construction starts are very, very low. This suggests that while we're -- while in the short term, the office market will be very soft and there may be significant distress, there may be a significant rebound 2 to 3 years out. I believe that CoStar, LoopNet and Ten-X can function very well in this sort of volatile economic environment.\nThe story of the industrial sector is very different. Industrial vacancy fell to 3.9% in the second quarter, the lowest rate seen in the sector's history, but ticked higher in the third quarter as developers responded to robust demand. New completions expected in 2023 exceed any annual amount delivered in the last 30 years. Despite these numbers, the sector remains remarkably healthy.\nNet absorption in the retail sector drifted lower in the third quarter, although slowing demand has outpaced new supply for 6 consecutive quarters, leading to the third quarter vacancy of 4.3%, the lowest retail vacancy rate recorded. Tight vacancies have given rise to some of the strongest rent growth in history, with the third quarter nominal rent growth of 4.5%.\nAs the Federal Reserve battles inflation, mortgage rates are rising to their highest level in years. Combined with double-digit home price gains over the past 2 years, affordability has deteriorated to levels not seen in more than 30 years. With buyers being priced out of the market, home sales are tumbling and prices are falling.\nDespite the market uncertainty, I believe CoStar is well positioned to sustain our revenue growth and profit through a potential economic cycle. We have proven to be very resilient in previous downturns, which I believe is a direct result of our diversified product mix, loyal customer concentrations, mission-critical products and a strong predictable subscription model. We have a loyal and exceptional team of leaders and employees working together in our offices, resulting in the best employee retention rates we've seen in years, if not decades. We're expanding our sales capabilities and geographic reach, unlocking new customer segments and revenue opportunities. Our balance sheet has never been stronger, and we view a downturn as the perfect time to go shopping.\nMore than 3 decades ago, while I was still a college student, I founded CoStar in a dorm room with an ambitious vision of digitizing the world's real estate. That first year, we realized a paltry revenue of $7,000. But CoStar was in the right place at the right time. There is almost $200 trillion of real estate in the world, and leading that effort to digitize it can unlock massive value. This mission has drawn imaginative investors and energized colleagues who brought life to the vision. Year-by-year, decade-by-decade, we've consistently and persistently grown those paltry revenues into the impressive billions.\nThis quarter, we achieved an accomplishment almost no company ever achieves, we made it to S&P 500. We're also proud and grateful to be here. We're here because of a remarkable group of colleagues who are committed to this mission of digitizing the world's real estate, empowering all people to discover properties, insights and connections, all of which improve people's businesses and lives. Going forward, we are now single-mindedly focused on reaching the S&P 100.\nAt this point, I'm going to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler.\n\nScott T. Wheeler\n\nCFO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andy. You sounded great today. I'm not sure if it's the microphone, but I hope you're in as good a voice in the Q&A session.\nWell, third quarter certainly was another great quarter, a great way to start our first earnings release in the S&P 500. I definitely agree, we're well positioned strategically and financially regardless of economic volatility and the external market conditions. Certainly encouraged by our strong performance across all of the information and marketplace products in our portfolio.\nLet's start with CoStar as the product revenue grew 17% on a constant currency basis in the third quarter and 16% in total after considering the devaluation of the British pound. Over half of our revenue growth in CoStar is from new customers, which speaks to the success of the new product introductions that Andy talked about. CoStar product revenue has grown at least 15% every quarter this year, and we expect 15% revenue growth to continue in the fourth quarter, which is 16% on constant currency basis.\nMultifamily revenue growth in the third quarter was 11%. The number of properties on our platform is growing, and we also see positive underlying trends in our ad sales mix. Customers upgrading to higher value ad packages is once again outpacing the value of properties downgrading to lower-priced ads. With strong sales momentum and an improving economic backdrop for advertising on Apartments.com, we now expect multifamily revenue growth of 16% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the full year of 2022.\nLoopNet revenue grew 13% in the third quarter on a constant currency basis, in line with our guidance expectations. We expect fourth quarter revenue to grow, to trend similarly to the third quarter at 12% to 13%, with full year revenue growth of 11% to 12%. Revenue from Information Services grew 14% in the quarter -- in the third quarter, ahead of our 11% guidance estimate on revenue, primarily as a result of STR revenue favorability. Both Real Estate Manager and STR each grew double digits in the third quarter. We expect full year 2022 revenue growth of 10% in Information Services, unchanged from our prior guidance.\nResidential revenue decreased 22% overall for the third quarter of last year, as expected, due to the runoff of the acquired nonstrategic revenue from Homes.com. On an organic basis, excluding Homes.com, revenue grew 13% in the third quarter. Subscription revenue grew 44%. Our expectation for full year 2022 residential revenue remains unchanged at $73 million.\nDuring the third quarter, we made a strategic decision to eliminate certain usage fees related to agent access to the Homesnap Pro application. The Pro version of the Homesnap application is now free to all agents in our multiple listing service network. As a result, we accelerated $16 million of amortization in the third quarter for intangible assets that were recorded as part of the purchase accounting for the Homesnap acquisition.\nOther Marketplaces revenue grew 12% in the third quarter of 2022, led by continued strength in our lands and business for sale marketplaces. Ten-X revenue growth slowed in Q3 as a result of the market dislocation that Andy discussed. We adjusted our Ten-X fourth quarter forecast to reflect a continuation of this trend. As a result, we now expect revenue growth in our Other Marketplaces sector to be 10% in the fourth quarter and 17% for the full year of 2022.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $153 million, exceeding the high end of our third quarter guidance range by $13 million. Total costs in the third quarter were lower than our forecast as a result of investment spending levels in our residential products. We are leveraging more of our existing internal research teams to build out our content, resulting in higher quality content. We are now hiring full-time residential research teams, not contractors, which results in lower investment spending levels this year.\nOur marketing investment was also lower than our forecast in the third quarter, a trend we expect to continue through the end of the year due to our strong traffic. Our revised estimate for the incremental 2022 residential investment spending is now in the $125 million range compared to the $180 million to $200 million previously communicated.\nOur sales force has eclipsed 1,000 sellers for the first time, totaling 1,090 salespeople at the end of the third quarter. We added a total of 115 sales reps in the third quarter, which is the second consecutive quarter growing sales headcount by more than 100 people. Year-to-date, our sales team has grown 32% compared to the beginning of 2022, with Apartments.com, LoopNet and CoStar increasing the most in terms of total heads added. We expect to add a net 300 sales heads in 2022.\nAlthough it takes 12 to 18 months to get a return on a new salesperson, when fully productive, these 300 new sellers can produce approximately $70 million to $80 million in subscription revenue every year, and this is revenue that renews at over 90%. Over 5 years, this has the potential to generate almost 500% return on the cost of this investment. Clearly, from a financial perspective, the faster we can grow our sales distribution channel against a market that is worth tens of billions of dollars, the better off we will be.\nOur contract renewal rate was 90% in the third quarter of 2022, slightly below the 91% renewal rate in the second quarter of 2022. This is a trailing 12-month metric that has fluctuated between 90% and 91% over the past 3 quarters, anchored by CoStar at 93% and multifamily at 90% in the third quarter. Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 79% for the third quarter of 2022, 4 percentage points higher than the third quarter of 2021, reflecting the strong recovery in Apartments.com this year.\nTurning to the outlook. We expect full year 2022 revenue to range from $2.175 billion to $2.18 billion, which represents an increase at the midpoint of the range by $5 million and implies an annual growth rate of 12% at the midpoint. Organic constant currency growth is expected to be 13%. We expect fourth quarter revenue to range from $566 million to $571 million, representing revenue growth of 12% to 13%.\n2022 full year adjusted EBITDA is expected to range from $665 million to $670 million, which is an increase of $48 million from our previous guidance at the midpoint. This increase is a result of efficiencies realized in our residential investment program in both content generation, resourcing and marketing spend.\nFourth quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $176 million to $181 million, indicating a margin of 31% at the midpoint. Overall, we're in a very strong position financially as we move through the final months of 2022. We are on track to exceed the growth and profitability targets we set for the business back in February. Our balance sheet is in great shape, and provides us a significant amount of funding flexibility to pursue our long-term growth strategies.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Cyndi.\n\nCyndi Eakin\n\nSenior VP of IR & Controller, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nI'm actually going to turn it back over to the conference operator, so they can introduce the question.\n\nScott T. Wheeler\n\nCFO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nSounds like a plan. Over to you, Bailey."

My name is Austin, and I will be your moderator for today. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Cyndi Eakin with CoStar. Cyndi , please proceed.\n\nCyndi Eakin\n\nSenior VP of IR & Controller, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good evening, and thank you all for joining us to discuss the second quarter 2022 results of the CoStar Group. Before I turn the call over to Andy Florance, CoStar's CEO; and Scott Wheeler, our CFO, I'd like to review our safe harbor statement.

Please refer to today's press release on how to access the replay of this call.\nAnd with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance.\n\nAndrew C. Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & CEO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Cyndi . Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Cyndi and Scott are in our Washington, D.C. office tonight, and I'm joining you from our London office, a little bit later in the evening.\nWe delivered outstanding results in the second quarter, setting our third quarterly sales record in a row. Annualized net new sales bookings were $84 million in the second quarter, a 66% increase over the same quarter in 2021. Our 3 main products, CoStar, Apartments.com and LoopNet all have exceptional sales quarters, growing a combined 81% on a year-over-year basis.\nTotal revenue for the second quarter of '22 was $536 million, growing 12% year-over-year and coming in above the high end of our guidance range of consensus estimates. Our subscription revenue in the quarter grew to $428 million and clients subscribing for 5 years or more renewed at 97.8%.\nAs we ramp up our investment in our residential product strategies, we continue to deliver strong profit results, with adjusted EBITDA of $159 million in the second quarter, well above the high end of our guidance range and consensus. As a result, we will raise our full year 2022 revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance.\nRevenue for our CoStar product was $207 million in the second quarter, representing a 17% increase over the same quarter a year ago. CoStar net new sales bookings increased by 60% in the second quarter, making the last 4 quarters the highest sales quarters on record. The trailing 12-month sales level as of June 30 is 145% greater than the same period 12 months prior.\nOur consistent strong revenue and sales performance for CoStar is the result of a steady stream of product innovations that deliver expanded capabilities and increased customer value. Over the past few years, we've added hospitality data, integrated CMBS data and analytics, launched a new lender product and opened up full multinational reach for our CoStar customers. We continue to grow our subscriber base and now have 177,000 CoStar professional users. This quarter, we crossed over 40,000 subscribing sites. CoStar's ASP continues to climb as we transition more and more of our customers to our global solutions.\nOverall, I'm very confident in our ability to sustain our current levels of strong double-digit revenue growth for CoStar Group. I think I've been saying that for 30 years.\nApartments.com turned in an outstanding performance in the second quarter with net new sales bookings up 138% compared to the second quarter of last year. This is the second highest quarterly sales ever for Apartments.com. Sequential growth in sales was 35% in the second quarter of this year, which makes this the third quarter in a row of improving sales results.\nApartment vacancy rates have increased at a rapid pace throughout the first half of 2022, climbing -- quickly climbing from the all-time low vacancy rates for the third quarter of '21 that were suppressing demand for apartment advertising. Vacancy rates for 3-, 4- and 5-star properties were up 60 basis points to 5.7% in the second quarter from that all-time low of 5.1% in the third quarter of '21. We're now only 80 basis points below the historic pre-pandemic vacancy rate average for that class of properties.\nWe believe we'll be back to historic average vacancy rates in the next several quarters. One of the drivers there is demand for apartments has stalled in the second quarter of '22, with absorption of only 67,000 units. That is a dramatic 74% drop from the 260,000 unit absorption level in the second quarter of '21. New apartment construction deliveries are expected to reach record levels this year. The forecasted 415,000 unit deliveries are on par with the highest levels recorded since the mid-'80s. Tampa and Phoenix, for example, will add over 25,000 units while absorption in these markets is projected to be 1/3 of new supply. The need to fill these newly constructed apartments building clearly increases demand for Apartments.com.\nWith raising vacancy rates, the number of properties advertising on Apartments.com increased sequentially in the second quarter of '22, continuing the positive trend that began in March of this year. In addition, cancellation rates have improved by approximately 20 basis points since the end of last year.\nOur Apartments.com sales force delivered outstanding results in the second quarter. Sales productivity per person increased 64% year-over-year and is at an all-time high. With post-pandemic restrictions behind us, we're once again focused on in-person meetings with our customers and our prospects.\nIn the second quarter of '22, our field sales team conducted an impressive 55,000 in-person meetings with our clients, and that's up 35% from the first quarter of this year. This has always been a relationship-based industry and our in-person meetings are the most effective way to build customer satisfaction and demonstrate the value of our products.\nTraffic to our Apartments.com network improved sequentially as we ramped up our advertising campaign, starring Jeff Goldblum as Brad Bellflower, which delivered over 4 billion impressions in the second quarter alone. I am very happy with the outstanding results our Apartments.com team is turning in, and I'm increasingly confident that our positive sales momentum will result in double-digit revenue growth in the second half of this year.\nTurning to CoStar Real Estate Manager. The product line continues to grow the Fortune 2000 and global customer base of CoStar adding 23 major new customers in Q2. Subscription revenue grew 15% in the first half of 2022 over the same period in '21. We're on path to have the Real Estate Manager product integrating to CoStar by 2023. This will significantly increase revenue opportunity for CoStar by connecting the Fortune 2000 tenant organic customer base of Real Estate Manager with the power of the CoStar network.\nLandsofAmerica, our rural land marketplace, is focusing on 3 key growth initiatives. These initiatives include growing the field sales team, introducing Signature ads and launching Land.com. We've grown our sales force at Lands by 16% year-to-date. Last year, LandsofAmerica began offering gold at Signature ads similar to the differentiated Signature ads at Apartments.com and LoopNet offer. This quarter, Lands launched platinum Signature ads. Our standard ads cost $22.75 per month on average. Our gold ads average much higher number at $359 per month and the platinum ads averaged $599 per month.\nSince the recent launch, we sold 932 Signature ads.\nGrowing the sales force and introducing premium exposure listings helped drive 34% year-over-year revenue growth this quarter in the LandsofAmerica business. Later this quarter, we will redirect LandsofAmerica.com to our URL Land.com to harness the power of the simple, memorable and valuable domain. Lands.com will then join category definers like Apartments.com and Homes.com.\nLoopNet had the strongest sales quarter in years, with net new sales bookings growing 43% of the same quarter last year. Second quarter revenue was $56 million, up 10% over the prior year. I'm encouraged to see our efforts to build a LoopNet sales force are progressing well. Year-to-date, we've grown the dedicated LoopNet sales team by 95%. We've built a strong infrastructure with regional sales management team and a strong training program.\nOur training and onboarding process is much more effective now that we're able to train and onboard together in person. As a result, our new sales team is delivering 100% more sales in their 6 months in production than when compared to the LoopNet sales team we onboard remotely during the pandemic.\nTraffic to our LoopNet network of sites remained strong in the second quarter, averaging approximately 12 million unique visitors per month. We have an order of magnitude more traffic than our closest competitor. That gap between LoopNet and our next closer traffic competitor widened by 1 million unique visitors during the second quarter. So we're pulling away even further.\nThis demonstrates the effectiveness of our SEO, the quality of our content, the strength of our brand, the quality of site design, the performance of the site and the impact of our Space for Dreams advertising campaign, which generated 253 million impressions in the second quarter.\nWe believe that LoopNet will deliver significantly more value to customers, users and shareholders as an international platform. Trillions of dollars cross many borders to invest in commercial real estate. An international platform has significant scale advantages in software development, both in functionality and cost per user efficiency. We recently invested to relaunch LoopNet in Canada under LoopNet.ca. The number of monthly unique visitors on the Canadian LoopNet network has surged 45% year-over-year. That investment has significantly widened our competitive lead in Canada against the next closest CRE site Spacelist.ca.\nAccording to Semrush, in June of '21, the LoopNet network had 48% more traffic than did Spacelist.ca. This June, the LoopNet network has pulled away and has 233% more traffic than the Spacelist.ca. So a 4, 5x advantage. We're now investing significant energy into launching LoopNet in the U.K., France, Spain and Germany and the rest of Europe in that order. In fact, I believe our President of LoopNet, I just saw him on the video screen in France just now.\nWe currently own leading CRE marketplaces across the U.K., Europe, with Realla in the U.K. and BureauxLocaux in France and Belbex in Spain. When we compete, we will have one code base for LoopNet globally and redirect when we're complete with the integration. We'll have one code base for LoopNet globally and we'll redirect traffic from our family of European platforms into LoopNet. Users will build and use LoopNet to search for investments or properties to lease from Madrid to Paris or London to New York or San Francisco or Vancouver or more.\nA property owner with an industrial facility at Heathrow will be able to appropriately market to robust audience as it may need that warehouse from around the world with just one placement on LoopNet.com. Conventional wisdom is that real estate marketplaces are local product and lack cross-border value or synergy. I believe this couldn't be further from the truth. It is just assumed because few have made the effort to try and do it.\nWhen we released CoStar in the U.K. in 2012 and rolled our predecessor offering focus into CoStar, our revenues in the U.K. doubled in the years that followed. About half of CoStar users today now have global subscriptions that can easily access data across borders. 15,800 U.S. users accessed data in Canadian properties this year, 1,200 Canadian users are accessing data in U.S. properties. 7,600 U.S. users are accessing information on U.K. properties and 2,300 U.K. users are accessing data on U.S. properties. In total, just under 20% of all users have accessed tens of millions of property views across borders with CoStar. We intend to release international LoopNet in the U.K. in the fourth quarter.\nI'm grateful to be a small part of such an exciting and challenging product with a great team executing this work.\nOur CoStar Risk Analytics business continued to gain momentum with strong growth driven by the recently released CoStar for Lenders solution. Since release in February, we signed 66 clients, of which 42 were added in Q2. We believe this growth rate will continue to accelerate with investment in our dedicated sales team, the next phase of product innovation and marketing. The strategy behind CoStar for Lenders is to offer a highly scalable, fully integrated solution that is essential to market participants by supporting their risk management, regulatory requirements, loan production, strategic decision-making.\nThe CoStar lender value proposition meets the requirements of our initial client base, which are diverse, including banks, credit units, dust lenders, private lenders and life insurance companies, of which the CRE portfolios range from as small as $10 million up to huge $50 billion portfolios.\nBizBuySell, our leading business for selling marketplace is having a great year. Revenue grew 27% year-over-year with investments in sales and marketing, driving strong increases in listing supply and buyer demand. We are realizing tremendous synergy between LoopNet and BizBuySell. Visits to BizBuySell subscriber listings displayed on LoopNet increased 54% in the first half of the year. Reported sold business comps increased 19% in the first half to 4,754 business comps. Thousands of business owners leverage these comps every month to get an estimate of their businesses' value.\nBizBuySell counts some of the largest franchise brands among its customers, including 7-Eleven, [Lincoln Mufflers], the UPS Store, Jiffy Lube, Checkers, Jackson Hewitt and many more, open the door to deeper relationships across other CoStar Real Estate products.\nSTR continues to grow revenue and add new hotels contributing data, while the hotel industry recovers from the global pandemic. STR now has an all-time high of almost 75,000 hotels contributing data on a monthly basis. There are still 1,500 hotels that previously participated and are currently closed due to COVID and half of those are in Asia. STR revenues year-to-date are up 10% year-over-year.\nWhen CoStar acquired STR at the end of 2019, subscription revenue was 60% of total revenues. With focused effort, subscription revenue year-to-date is now 77% of total revenues. STR is currently migrating its benchmarking product into the CoStar platform. Customer migration will begin at the start of 2023. At the conclusion of the product rollout, the expectation is to be in a position to double STR revenue through sales of benchmarking to new customers and upgrade existing customers. STR will also be better positioned to introduce CoStar to new hospitality customers once the benchmarking product is in the CoStar platform. That introduction has already begun with STR selling CoStar to hospitalities companies such as Sonder, Hopper, Vista Indianapolis, Atrium Hospitality and Highgate Hotels.\nTen-X continues to perform with high volume of assets being brought to the platform, which exceeded $2 billion in the first half of 2022 or 33% over the first half of '21, and the highest level of activity since '15, 2015. As mentioned last quarter, we launched our Ten-X marketing program for '22 called Battle of the Bids, which is a gamification of the Ten-X bidding process, in which people can guess the price at which a real estate property will be sold on Ten-X and have a chance to win millions of dollars in cash prizes. Nearly 13,000 brokers and owners have played the game, adding approximately 12,000 new Ten-X accounts.\nThe bidding power on Ten-X is reaching record levels. When a potential bidder registers to bid on Ten-X, we check to ensure that they have sufficient funds to buy the properties they bid on. The amount we prove for them is their proof of funds. In the second quarter of '22, total proof of funds reached $11.7 billion, up 144% from $4.8 billion in the second quarter of '20 when we acquired Ten-X.\nOur residential business continues to perform very well. Second quarter revenue in residential was $20 million, an increase of 40% on an organic basis compared to the second quarter of '21. Our Homesnap business continues to focus on expanding age engagement and sales of our Pro+ products while we develop our Homes.com marketplace. Registered agents for our Homesnap Pro product totaled 880,000 at the end of the second quarter, an increase of 17% over the same quarter last year. Revenue from our Pro+ product grew an impressive 46% year-over-year, while our Concierge Pro+ product grew 175% versus the second quarter of last year.\nAgents continue to spend more and more in our residential products, with average agent spend increasing 42% on a year-over-year basis. It's important that we continue to grow our sales force to reach more agents and prepare for the launch of our Homes.com product next year. We've successfully established our direct sales force to support the Pro+ product, and I'm encouraged by the initial sales productivity of that team. We have plans to expand this team to over 100 dedicated sales representatives by the end of '22. In the second quarter, we grew that team by almost 50%, including adding field-based sales agents who are having some real success.\nOur research efforts are off to a good start as we build proprietary content for Homes.com around playgrounds, neighborhood schools and other features that are important to consumers. From a standing start, we have successfully engaged over 1,000 photographers, writers, editors, voice talent and video editors across the country. So far, we have produced content on over 70% of the largest residential markets in the U.S. We expect our rich original data and media content will produce significant organic search results that will be a product differentiator from our competitors.\nWe successfully launched Citysnap in June in coordination with our partners at the Real Estate Board of New York. For the first time, New York renters, buyers and brokers now have a single real-time source for all available Real Estate Board of New York listings. Better yet, all of an agent's listings appear for free on Citysnap. The launch of Citysnap was well received by the agent community in New York City and in only a few short weeks, over 37% of the Real Estate Board of New York agents have registered to use Citysnap.\nCitysnap reached the #1 spot on the top new category in Google Play and is off to a strong start. As with any new product launch, this is only the beginning, version 1.0. We're planning a regular pace of product releases, focusing on optimizing the user experience and adding more valuable content, which we feel is the key differentiator for CoStar Group. Yesterday marked the formal launch of our Citysnap consumer marketing campaign. Our marketing campaigns are designed to deliver hundreds of millions of media impressions across streaming video, audio, digital, social and out-of-home media. Just before this call began, I got a word that we reached our first 1 million users of Citysnap.\nTo realize our many growth initiatives, it's imperative that we continue to attract and retain the best talent for CoStar Group, even Scott Wheeler. We've had tremendous headcount growth -- I was just checking to make sure Scott is still listening. We've had tremendous headcount growth over the past 6 months, surpassing 5,400 team members for the first time in our company history.\nOur strategic goals of building our residential platform, international expansion and growing our sales teams have been extremely successful. Over the first half of the year, we've welcomed more than 1,000 new team members across multiple areas and around the globe. A big contributor to our increased headcount is the creation of hundreds of new jobs in our residential business. Thousands of skilled photographers, drone pilots and content writers have applied to CoStar Group with hopes of being able to take part in documenting their cities, park, schools and neighborhoods and beautiful homes as we prepare our Homes.com relaunch later this year.\nOur new team members have listed a variety of reasons that they decided to come to CoStar Group, including our positioning as an innovative industry leader, our high-performing and fast-paced work environment, the opportunity to build new businesses and products and services for our customers. However, the top reason most new hires mentioned when joining CoStar is the people they get to work with and learn with here. While CoStar offers flexibility to our colleagues, we predominantly work on our mission together in the office, and we thrive in that environment. We believe that working together, rather than on a broad screen, is becoming competitive edge.\nFor example, and an example of many, the very talented and valuable new colleague, Leslie Hall joined CoStar Group in May to grow our HR business partner function after a successful 26-year career at another very well-known and respected Washington-area company, that is still all remote despite maintaining millions of square feet of empty premium office space. She said, \"I've built a career in HR because I love partnering with people solving business problems.\"\nShe goes on to say, \"After 2.5 years of remote working on Zoom, I missed the in-person collaboration in connection with business leaders and employees. You simply cannot maintain meaningful and sustainable relationships virtually over the long term.\" She was impressed with the caliber of people she met during the interview process and their commitment and enthusiasm for CoStar. We are thrilled to welcome Leslie and 1,000 other new colleagues to CoStar this year.\nWhen we first returned to the office last year, that was difficult for some of our colleagues and initially our retention rate dropped. But surprisingly, now that we're back together in the office, our retention rates are climbing to some of the highest levels we've ever seen. According to Kastle Security, while many workers in the U.S. have returned to working together in the office, most have not, many think that workers and companies that do not work with their colleagues in person do not form meaningful connections to their companies.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this pandemic induced great resignation. Overall private industry attrition trends remain very elevated, 3.1%. Real estate attrition is slightly lower, 2.8%.\nI'm pleased to report that we are experiencing the opposite. Our attrition rates continue to improve and are now the best they've been in years. In fact, our attrition rate is now less than half of the private sector's turnover rate. In the most recent 60-day trending, employee retention rate is an impressive 98.5%. We are retaining the best talent at CoStar Group. The average tenure for technology companies is 3 years. CoStar Group is a clear leader with an average tenure well above both -- well above tech or real estate or private sector and is approaching an impressive 5 years, so 5 years compared to tech average 3 years. We're retaining employees 60% longer than the average company.\nWe've been deliberate in our execution of employee retention initiatives, including leadership development programs, management training, career mobility and promotions. In addition, we've enhanced our already strong suite of employee benefit offerings to adapt the needs of our people in the current environment. Our approach is proving particularly successful with regard to our sales force as we are simultaneously growing 5 different sales teams, all of which have the potential to add significant growth capability to the company.\nFor the first half, we've grown our sales team by a net 150 sellers. That's the fastest we've ever grown, an increase of 18% since the end of '21 or the beginning of '22. This is the largest half year organic growth in sales resources we've ever achieved. I'm carefully watching the growing productivity of these new salespeople we're onboarding. We have invested carefully in our training programs with talented and committed trainers.\nI'm pleased to report that while it does take time to ramp up these new salespeople to full productivity, we're exceeding our historic ramp-up success rate. Our commitment to in-person collaboration, coupled with our investments and our people have us well positioned to continue to grow the business as well as execute our strategic objectives.\nThe commercial real estate markets are entering a period of potential disruption as the U.S. economy adjusts to these higher levels of inflation, raising interest rates and lingering pandemic effects. With office vacancy rates climbing to 14%, we're now observing the highest nationwide vacancy rates in 30 years. The gap between future availability rate and current vacancy is growing, suggesting a bit more pain ahead in vacancy.\nOffice leasing continues to lag precrisis levels, central business districts are particularly challenged as more office space is being returned, contributing to slower recoveries. According to Kastle Systems, the percentage of people returning to office has remained at around 40% with only modest increases in recent months. During this persistent softness in the office market, CoStar continues to outperform and our LoopNet, Ten-X products are countercyclical should the office market deteriorate further.\nIndustrial properties are experiencing the opposite of office properties. Industrial properties are maintaining record occupancy, double-digit rent growth and booming construction. Retail leasing held steady near post-pandemic highs in the second quarter, while new development remains sparse. The retail now -- market is now reporting tighter conditions than prior to the pandemic as the amount of retail space available for lease fell to the lowest level in over a decade. Store openings remaining -- are remaining on pace to significantly eclipse store closures this year.\nTransaction volumes for commercial real estate properties continue to reach new highs over $216 billion traded during the second quarter, leading to a second quarter record and a record-breaking first half of the year. Price depreciation continues across all asset classes with industrial multifamily leading and retail and office lagging. So far this year, distressed commercial property sales remain low, encompassing only 1,300 assets representing less than 1.5% of all sales.\nCMBS delinquencies at 30, 60 and 90 days continue to decline in the second quarter. We anticipate that the rise in interest rates will create difficulties with loan maturities and refinancing in the months and years ahead. According to a leading CMBS mortgage servicer, request for loan extensions increased 38%, request for loan restructuring to increase 21% in the second quarter. An increase in delinquencies could represent a significant revenue opportunity for Ten-X.\nWell, after those brief remarks, I'm going to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler.\n\nScott T. Wheeler\n\nCFO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andy. I love those brief remarks, and I'm happy to report to everyone on the call that I'm still retained with CoStar even after that script, and I'm awake and listening. Part of the statistics.\nInteresting that 5-year retention on customers is 98%. And we have a retention rate of our employees, 98% with an average tenure of 5 years. Is that art imitating life in CoStar? Was that what you would say? I know that's fascinating.\n\nAndrew C. Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & CEO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nHotel California you can check in, but you can never leave.\n\nScott T. Wheeler\n\nCFO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThat's why I stay around here. Facts are amazing. All right. Let's talk about our revenue by our services. And Andy reported, CoStar is growing 17% in the second quarter. Price and new sales volumes each are contributing roughly half of that revenue growth. So we expect revenue growth in the 16% to 17% range in the third and fourth quarters, and the lower end of the range is really a result of some negative FX movements as the dollar strengthened around 10% to 15% over the past year against the pound. So on an organic currency adjusted basis, we're going to keep that 17% going in the second half.\nOur second quarter multifamily revenue grew 6% in [last] guidance, and that most definitely represents the turning point for Apartments.com. Revenue growth will increase going forward. The sales levels have continued to improve in each quarter since the third quarter of 2021. And the total number of properties advertising on our network increased sequentially in the second quarter compared to the first quarter this year. We expect third quarter revenue growth of 11% and fourth quarter growth of 14% in multifamily. This increase to our prior full year revenue estimate, we now have full year revenue growth of 9% in multifamily.\nLoopNet revenue grew 10% in the second quarter, also in line with our expectations. The net new bookings increased 43% year-over-year as we've increased both our LoopNet and our CoStar sales staff, both of which sell LoopNet very effectively. We expect this trend to continue through the remainder of the year, increasing our third quarter revenue growth to 13%. This results in an increase in our full year revenue growth estimate to a range of 11% to 12%.\nInformation Services revenue grew 10% in the second quarter, a little ahead of our guidance. Real Estate Manager continues to post solid double-digit growth, and STR is now back to double-digit revenue on a constant currency basis, which is really a great recovery news for STR even before global hotels have all recovered from the pandemic. In addition, we added Business Immo to our Info Services revenue, which we acquired at the beginning of the second quarter. For the third quarter, we expect revenue growth of 11%, and we're increasing our full year expectation for Information Services revenue growth to 10%.\nResidential revenue increased 11% over the second quarter of last year. And organically, excluding the effect of the wind down of the [nonstrategic] revenue from Homes.com, revenue grew around 40% in the second quarter on a like-for-like basis, as Andy mentioned. We now expect full year 2022 revenue of $73 million in residential, which is above our prior guidance of $70 million. Revenue growth for the second half of the year will be down 20% to 25%, again as a result of the Homes.com revenue in the second half of 2021 that was wound down and no longer exists in the second half of 2022.\nPutting that aside, the year-over-year growth in our Pro+ subscription product is expected to be around 35% in the second half of the year, which is where we remain our focus in growing our sales force. The other market revenue grew [17%] in the second quarter of 2022 as expected, with lands and business for sale marketplaces posting growth rates of 25% or more. Ten-X performed well in the quarter against our strategic [goals], increasing the volume of assets as well as the bidding power on the demand side of the marketplace. We expect the other marketplace to grow around 18% for the full year of 2022.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $159 million, $31 million above the high end of second quarter guidance range. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 30% compared to 31% in the second quarter of '21. Approximately 10% of the favorable adjusted EBITDA is from revenue outperformance, while 90% was from comparability, primarily all of which relates to the timing of our investments in content development for our residential product.\nWe're off to a good start mobilizing our content teams across the country, and they're going to produce tens and thousands of pieces of proprietary content. Our initial second quarter spending forecast on this effort contemplated a very steep spending ramp in the second quarter, which in hindsight, I must say, too aggressive.\nAccordingly, we've shifted around [$50 million] of our second quarter cost favorability to the second half of the year. The ramp up in content development will continue. Also, our existing field research team is doing a great job contributing more residential content than we had anticipated. This is much more efficient outcome and it lowers our incremental costs. If this trend continues, we could even see additional investment favorability in the second half of the year. So overall, we estimate our 2022 residential investment levels now in the $180 million to $200 million range.\nOur sales force totaled approximately 975 people in -- on June 30, an increase of [105] sales reps from the end of last quarter and an increase of only 150 reps from where we began the year. It is the largest increase our sales force in a quarter or a half year. And it's a well-balanced increase across all of our major product areas.\nContract renewal rate was 91% for the second quarter of 2022, similar to the 91% renewal rate in the first quarter of this year. Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 80% for the second quarter of 2022, compared to 77% this time last year and consistent with the first quarter of this year.\nTurning to the outlook, we expect full year 2022 revenues to range from $2.165 billion to $2.18 billion, an increase of approximately $12.5 million at the midpoint of the range, implying an annual growth rate of 12% at the midpoint. Organic growth, excluding the revenue runoff from the Homes.com products, is expected to be 13%.\nThird quarter 2022 revenue expected in a range from $552 million to $557 million, representing growth of 11% year-over-year at the mid. Once again, organic growth, excluding those pesky running off Homes.com legacy revenues, is expected at 12%. The 2022 full year adjusted EBITDA is expected now to be in the range of $610 million to $630 million, which is an increase of $20 million from our previous guidance. Roughly half of the increase is improvement in our revenue outlook with the other half the result of lower forecasted residential levels that I just mentioned.\nFor the third quarter 2022, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $130 million to $140 million, indicating a margin of 24% at the midpoint. With regards to capital allocation, our strategy remains unchanged. With interest rates on the rise and economic uncertainty and market volatility, we see valuations moderating with regards to acquisition opportunities. Our balance sheet is in great shape, and we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities should they arise in the near future.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Cyndi to orchestrate the anxiously awaited Q&A session. Cyndi , back to you.\n\nCyndi Eakin\n\nSenior VP of IR & Controller, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Scott. I would like to ask participants to keep one question and one part, please. I'll turn it over to Austin, if you could please open up the line for questions."

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the CoStar Group to report financial results for first quarter 2022. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Gene Boxer, General Counsel of CoStar Group. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nGene Boxer\n\nGeneral Counsel & Corporate Secretary, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Blue. Good evening, and thank you all for joining us to discuss the first quarter 2022 results of the CoStar Group.\nBefore I turn the call over to Andy Florance, CoStar's CEO and Founder; and Scott Wheeler, our CFO, I would like to review our safe harbor statement.

Please refer to today's press release on how to access the replay of this call.\nAnd with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance.\n\nAndrew C. Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & CEO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gene. You did that brilliantly. I think everyone on the call is left inspired. So good evening, everyone. And thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call.\nWe had a really strong start to 2022 with our highest ever quarterly sales booking at $68 million, which increased 31% year-over-year in the first quarter. Both revenue and profit are ahead of forecast. Our CoStar product turned in its best sales quarter ever, driving our overall outperformance and is expected to grow at or above 15% year-over-year for the rest of 2022. Apartments.com delivered great sales results with net new sales bookings up 36% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of '22 was $516 million, representing a 13% year-over-year growth rate. Our profit performance was equally strong with adjusted EBITDA of $178 million in the first quarter, an increase of 12% year-over-year and $18 million above the high end of our February guidance. As a result, we are raising our full year '22 revenue, adjusted EBITDA and EPS guidance. Mr. Wheeler will give you more details on that.\nCoStar flagship product produced $199 million in revenue in the first quarter. The CoStar sales team grew annualized net sales 96% over the prior year. This latest sales performance makes the last 3 quarters of CoStar sales the top 3 sales quarters for CoStar on record.\nOur CoStar sales team has never been more productive. In the first quarter, we achieved the highest CoStar net sales output per person in our history. We added 20 new sellers to the team so far this year and intend to continue expanding our sales teams in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. I look forward to the day when we'll be able to tell you about hiring CoStar sales people in Germany, space -- Spain and France, not space, before long. We are building dedicated industry experts within the broader CoStar sales group to focus exclusively\n(technical difficulty)\nand we'll continue for the next 18 months or so.\nWe released our new CoStar lender product in February and are seeing a very positive response from the market. In the short time since we launched the product, we've added over $1 million in annual revenue, and the operating pipeline is building rapidly. I must modestly say our clients are referring to the solution in terms of best-in-class, the gold standard and, even modestly, the best product we've ever seen.\nThe lender solution's early success can be attributed to its unique ability to connect the client's loan portfolio to CoStar's industry-leading property information, Market Analytics, and to COMPASS, one of the most mature credit default models in the industry. The system delivers a live look at institution's loan concentration risk, current expected credit losses and stress testing, among many other functions. The result is an unmatched, more efficient platform for strategic lending decisions and risk management.\nOur initial banking customers have found the product very straightforward, simple and easy to use. The ability to generate sophisticated stress testing results with just a few clicks saves almost a week of work. Customers tell us they love all the loan concentration charts because the analytics are so much better and fully automated when compared to lesser competitive products.\nOf course, we're in the very early days of introducing the lender product, but I'm very encouraged with the market reception results so far. We are currently operating with a dozen or so specialized dedicated sales team members, and we fully intend to expand our sales and product implementation teams in the months ahead. With at least 6,000 potential customers in the U.S. alone, we have a long way to go to realize what we see as a market opportunity for CoStar of well over $300 million.\nI believe our impressive CoStar results are built on a well-balanced combination of new product innovation, proprietary data and research and a highly productive sales team. Our customers are enjoying the expanded capabilities that we add to CoStar every year and continue to renew subscriptions at rates above our long-term historical averages.\nWe continue to work hard on expanding our international business. Earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of Business Immo, France's premier real estate new service. In France, you say Business Immo. Business Immo is known for its impactful online real estate news that attracts over 300,000 unique visitors each month. The publication boasts over 2,000 subscribing companies and 100,000 followers on social media. Business Immo's product portfolio also includes training, education and industry conferences.\nBusiness Immo is an important addition to CoStar Group's growing global news team, which offers daily coverage across the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany; and HotelNewsNow, our international hospitality industry news service. With over 235,000 subscribers and 19,000 articles published in 2021, CoStar's award-winning news is one of the largest international real estate news networks in the world.\nBusiness Immo reaches a large professional audience in France of brokers, developers, owners and the like, and BureauxLocaux reaches the tenant audience in France. By combining these 2 audiences into 1 premium media buy, we believe that we can capture a large and meaningful share of the properties -- property market's advertising spend in France.\nFrance is one of the most important real estate markets in the world with an estimated $40 billion in annual investment transaction value, and I believe the number will ultimately prove to be a lot larger than that. With the acquisition of Business Immo this year alongside the BureauxLocaux property marketplace, which we purchased last year, we're very excited about the potential this market holds for us. These 2 well-respected online property websites, combined with Belbex in Spain, Realla in the U.K., CoStar in the U.K. and Thomas Daily in Germany, directly support our goal of building out the premier online European marketing solutions and information solutions. We remain focused on offering both CoStar and LoopNet integrated and seamlessly across the U.K., Germany, France, Spain and eventually other European markets.\nIn the first quarter, we launched the first international version of LoopNet, rolling out loopnet.ca in Canada. Loopnet.ca delivers a tailored and localized Canadian search experience, including custom Canadian content, French Canadian language capability and acceptance of Canadian currency -- most importantly, acceptance of Canadian currency. We are seeing strong traffic growth in Canada with LoopNet dossier reaching traffic levels almost twice that of the nearest competitive site after less than 2 months in the market. LoopNet in Canada is only the beginning as the site architecture and international capabilities of the Canadian version of LoopNet will be the foundation of a first-ever pan-European, pan-Americas commercial real estate marketplace.\nApartments.com sales picked up strong momentum with bookings up 36% sequentially in the first quarter of '22. Revenue for Apartments.com was $175 million in the first quarter, growing 6% year-over-year with strong margins. Properties advertising on our platform increased in March over February, which is the first sequential increase in advertised property volumes since about the middle of '21. This increase, along with rising vacancies and improving pricing, makes me increasingly confident that we've turned the corner over last year's high occupancy headwinds. As you might recall, last year, we saw demand for apartment rental surge and then vacancy rates suddenly dropped to a 20-year low -- record low of just 4.8%.\nAbsorption was 700,000 units in '21, which is extremely high and is more double the 5-year pre-pandemic average. The dramatic drop in vacancy rates pushed national rent growth to a record high of 11% on a year-over-year basis in '21, made it a tough environment to sell advertising, but we still sold a lot of advertising. In the first quarter, '22 absorption moderated dramatically from 187,000 units 12 months ago to 54,000 units during the first 3 months of this year.\nAt the same time, deliveries of new units increased, resulting in the first quarter vacancy rates rising 10 basis points to 4.9%. Current projections for '22 show demand dropping to pre-pandemic levels with new rental unit deliveries expected to exceed demand. And vacancy is therefore expected to rise past 5% by the end of this year, resulting in more modest annual rent growth of about 6%, 7%. This is still elevated by historical standards, but we see the supply of new units continue to grow during the year in '23, which we expect will create excellent, high-value advertising opportunities for Apartments.com.\nSearch activity on Apartments.com continues to trend near record levels, indicating a robust spring and summer rental season. Traffic in the first quarter increased 13% over the first quarter of last year, which is the strongest first quarter traffic on record for the Apartments.com network.\nNot only did traffic increase, but quality leads generated for advertising clients increased 18% on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter. Our sales team is doing a great job selling and renewing businesses at higher price levels, resulting in a cost per lead for the first quarter of '22 coming in at about the same level as it was in the first quarter of '21.\nApartments.com continues to attract more and more renters, while our market data indicates the traffic declined year-over-year for a number of our competitors. With tighter market conditions putting pressure on revenue for our smaller competitors, we believe that the marketing budgets in SEM of those competitors are shrinking and will negatively impact their traffic. We believe this will result in fewer leads for their advertising customers, which will make Apartments.com a more attractive advertising alternative.\nIn early April, we launched Apartments.com's most comprehensive marketing plan ever. Jeff Goldblum returns for his eighth year as the Apartminternet founder, Brad Ballflower, with great new TV and social video spots that play off of recent cultural headlines with themes such as billionaires going up in the space. Our ads also focus on what matters most to renters that want to add more space, change location or change lifestyle to fit their post-pandemic situations.\nIn total, we expect the campaign will deliver over 10 billion media impressions. We'll run 20,000 commercials on top prime time shows, premieres and finales as well as major sporting events. Importantly, we know now more than ever that renters are consuming media primarily through streaming video and audio platforms, a little less on Netflix recently. As such, we are doubling our investment in video-on-demand, streaming audio and social media with a huge presence on top platforms such as HBO Max, Paramount, Hulu, Peacock, YouTube, iHeartRadio, Spotify, Pandora and many others.\nWith the new campaign, Apartments.com will also connect with renters like never before through custom content and unique creative developed specifically for renters' favorite social and digital video platforms, including TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Facebook. We plan to launch several new social series developed in partnership with top-tier influencers across all renting categories, including DIY projects, pet life, apartment tours, apartment living tips and tricks and more.\nOur advertising is increasing in its effectiveness as we are able to deliver our highest first quarter levels of traffic and unaided brand awareness while proactively managing our spend below prior year levels. In the first quarter of this year, our field sales team delivered their highest net sales productivity since the end of 2020 with our mid-market sales team also having their highest productivity on record in the first quarter. So the sales teams are doing really quite well. I mean very impressive work there.\nI believe our ability to once again meet safely with customers and prospects face-to-face is also fueling our sales success. In the first quarter of 2022, our field sales team conducted over 40,000 separate in-person meetings.\nWith a great first quarter to start the year in Apartments.com, I believe the combination of our leading brand position, an improving market environment, better pricing and a growing productive sales force puts Apartments.com in great shape, delivered double-digit revenue growth in the second half of this year. And the fact that we have Paige Forrest makes it a slam dunk.\nLoopNet first quarter revenue was $54 million, up 11% over the prior year. We saw record traffic in the quarter with more than 11 million average monthly unique visitors to LoopNet network. March was our highest traffic month ever with 11.8 million unique visitors.\nUser engagement on LoopNet is also increasing with users reading more than 250,000 articles on LoopNet in January, another new high-water mark. The continued increase in users and engagement on LoopNet demonstrates the value of the marketplace, the quality of our content and the effectiveness of our marketing programs.\nOur LoopNet marketing activities produced inbound sales leads up 76% in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter '21. The Space for Dreams marketing campaign that we developed in '21 continues uninterrupted into '22. In the first quarter of '22, the campaign delivered an estimated 93 million impressions across linear TV, social media and direct digital channels. The Space for Dreams campaign runs through the end of September and is expected to deliver more than 400 million impressions.\nI'm confident our marketing program this year will keep LoopNet top of mind with tenants and investors when they search for a space, which underpins our substantial competitive traffic advantage. We continue to increase our dedicated LoopNet sales force, and we added 25 new sales professionals so far this year.\nTen-X's revenue was up 42% year-over-year in the first quarter. Seasonally, the first quarter tends to be lower in terms of property transactions. However, this year, the value of properties brought to the platform was up over 90%. Ten-X sold approximately $575 million in assets in the first quarter of '22, the best first quarter performance in over 5 years. For the fifth quarter in a row, the critical trade rate, which is total assets sold as a percentage of total assets brought to the platform, came in an impressive 70%.\nOne of the successful strategies contributing to the sales growth is the new pricing structure we introduced a little over a year ago. The new tiered pricing model lowered the transaction fee on asset sales as the value of assets increased but preserved strong margins. As a result, in the first quarter of this year, the average size of assets sold in the platform increased 32%, with the value of the properties sold at $10 million or more increasing 4x to the prior year level. In addition, the volume of assets sold on the platform increased 37% in the first quarter of '22. Together, the property size and volume improvements account for almost 70% of the traffic -- of the revenue growth.\nWe continue to build out the Ten-X sales team with the number of sales reps increasing by 20% since the end of last year. Our goal is to grow the team by another 50% by the end of '22. We launched our Ten-X marketing program for '22 called Battle of the Bids in the first quarter. Battle of the Bids is a gamification of the Ten-X bidding process in which people can guess the price at which a real estate profit will be sold on the platform with a chance to win millions of dollars in cash prices. Our goal is to drive broad brand awareness and platform participation. The first round of competition was played during our April 11 to 13 Ten-X auction with 6,800 registered players participating.\nSince we launched marketing for the first round, active web sessions on Ten-X are up 22%. The promotional campaign generated 7.3 million impressions in a little over a month. New Ten-X accounts are up 32% year-over-year in the first quarter. With the round 2 starting tomorrow, registered participants are already 30% higher than round 1.\nOverall, we are well on our way to building a highly effective digital transaction capability with Ten-X that I believe will become the preeminent global digital trading platform. This year, we are on track to grow revenue by 20%. And we believe by the end of next quarter, we will have fully integrated the Ten-X platform into the CoStar environment, giving us additional scalability.\nOur Residential business is performing very well to start the year. We're successfully growing subscription sales and revenue and building out the residential products vision we shared with you earlier. First quarter revenue in Residential was $18 million, an increase of 63% compared to the first quarter of 2021. It's a small number, but you have to start somewhere, and we see growth in the future.\nRevenue from our Pro+ product increased approximately 60% year-over-year, while our Concierge Pro+ product was approximately 4x higher this year versus the first quarter of last year. The direct sales team selling our Pro+ product is delivering excellent results as our first quarter net new sales bookings for Pro+ subscription is up 120% over the first quarter '21. We intend to continue growing our Pro+ sales team to approximately 100 sales reps by the end of the year in order to increase our agent penetration and engagement on the Homesnap platform.\nOur product design and development teams are building the product capabilities that will, for the first time, directly connect homebuyers and sellers to their agents, enabling great online collaboration. Using the \"your listing, your lead\" approach, we are building tools that will directly connect interesting buyers to selling agents along with complete agent directory for potential homebuyers to use in selecting the right agent for them.\nBehind the scenes, we intend to relaunch the Homes.com website in June on top of a modern integrated technology platform. Although not directly visible to Homes.com users, this is an important step that brings the best technology for traffic scalability and speed to Homes.com. We are leveraging the success from Apartments.com and other high-performance marketplaces to make this possible.\nOur research team is busy building the proprietary content around neighborhoods, schools and parks and other features that consumers told us are important to them when they're shopping for the best place to live. So far, we've produced hundreds and hundreds of videos with tens of thousands of more in the works. We believe this rich content will produce significant organic search results and will be highly informative and engaging to consumers as they research the best place to live.\nTraffic to Homes.com improved significantly in the first quarter of '22, with monthly visitors growing 55% compared to the first quarter '21. Even more encouraging, site visits improved over 70% since we acquired Homes.com, increasing at a much faster rate than Apartments.com did during the same post-acquisition period. Unique visitors to our overall residential network, including both Homes.com and Homesnap, increased 125% from the first quarter of 2022 over the first quarter of '21.\nWe are preparing to roll out Citysnap at the end of this year as part of our arrangement with the Real Estate Board of New York. Citysnap will provide consumers a powerful home search app and website customized for New York City, along with connectivity to our Homesnap suite of tools for property agents. For the first time, New York renters and buyers and their brokers will have a single real-time source for all available listings in the city.\nWe have partnered with a leading New York advertising agency to develop a marketing campaign for Citysnap with messaging that will reinforce the unique joys of living in Manhattan and highlight how Citysnap addresses the pain points of finding a place to live in New York. You will soon see Citysnap all over New York City as we have designed our marketing plans to deliver hundreds of millions of media impressions across streaming video, audio, social and physical media. We anticipate millions of visits to Citysnap site and app as a result of our media campaign.\nOverall, I'm very happy with the progress of our residential initiatives, and we remain on track for a full launch of the new Homes.com marketplace in '23.\nWinding up by a quick look at the economy, the CRE economy. The office market does continue to struggle with vacancy rates at all-time highs, anemic absorption, rental rates at all-time real dollar lows. Sales volumes are low and cap rates are rising. It doesn't sound rosy, but our LoopNet product is well positioned to help owners and brokers reach tenants and buyers in this tough market. Ten-X is well positioned to help owners and lenders exit the investments they must exit in this tough market, and the new CoStar lender product is an excellent tool to help lenders navigate the risks they may encounter in this tough market.\nThe apartment market is beginning to cool with demand moderating, vacancies rising. Rent growth is still strong, but with new construction booming, rent growth is going to slow into next year with further increases in vacancy rates, which sets a stage for a strong sales environment for Apartments.com.\nRetail leasing is rising as store openings are outpacing closures, allowing vacancy rates to compress to lower and lower levels. Retail property owners have much reason to remain confident as net absorption, rent growth and investment activity are building on momentum from last year. The national industrial vacancy rate fell to a record low in the first quarter, fueled by strong leasing activity as tenants rapidly expand their distribution networks to accommodate increasing consumer demand for faster home delivery.\nSpeculative construction continues to rise and competition for limited space is driving record rent growth. The hefty construction pipeline offers fertile ground for additional LoopNet revenue as more developers seek to maximize their marketing exposure during lease-up. We set some of our highest price points ever for LoopNet marketing in '21 and '22 for industrial speculative properties. The industrial market right now is white hot.\nIn the hospitality sector, leisure and weekend demand continue to act as the main drivers for the U.S. hotel sector recovery. Room rates are trending at an all-time high as occupancy and RevPAR are recovering. Business travel demand is gaining momentum.\nSo with that, I'm going to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, the man you all respect and rely on, Scott Wheeler.\n\nScott T. Wheeler\n\nCFO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andy.\n\nAndrew C. Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & CEO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nYou're welcome, Scott.\n\nScott T. Wheeler\n\nCFO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nExcellent rendition to the script this evening. So another really strong financial quarter. Key metrics, net new bookings, revenue, adjusted EBITDA, all growing double digits, great start, and our outlook is improving. Now that's not bad considering that we're in a volatile economic environment. So it's great to have a high renewing subscription model to rely on when the global economy becomes a little less predictable.\nSo revenue grew 13% in the first quarter versus the first quarter of 2021 with 4 of our 6 service categories growing in the strong double digits. CoStar revenue grew 15% in the first quarter, continuing its growth acceleration and consistent with our guidance. For context, CoStar revenue grew 10% in the third quarter of last year, 13% in the fourth quarter of 2021, 15% in the first quarter of 2022, and we expect CoStar revenue growth of 17% in the second quarter of 2022. This is a trend I really like. We now expect full year 2022 revenue growth of 16% for CoStar, up from our prior expectation of 15%.\nMultifamily revenue for the first quarter increased 6%, consistent with the fourth quarter last year and in line with our guidance. Revenue growth year-over-year is pretty much all price-driven as advertised property counts have moderated since the middle of last year, and ad level mix is a bit lower from the downgrades over the past few quarters, although in the recent quarter, the net upgrades have passed the net downgrades. So that's a positive sign for our outlook. We expect second quarter revenue growth to remain at 6%, and our full year revenue estimates remain unchanged at 8% to 9% range with double-digit growth expected in the second half of the year for multifamily.\nLoopNet revenue grew 11% in the first quarter, which was consistent with the guidance we provided in our last call. Second quarter revenue is expected to grow 10%, and our full year 2022 outlook remains unchanged at 10% to 11%.\nRevenue from Information Services grew 7% in the first quarter, also in line with our guidance. And for the second quarter, we expect revenue growth to approximate 8% as hospitality market conditions are improving. Full year expectation for Information Services has revised up slightly to the high end of our previous range at 9%.\nResidential revenue increased 63% over the first quarter of last year. Revenue from products that are expected to be part of our long-term strategy, like Pro+ subscriptions, grew 62% in the first quarter on a like-for-like basis. Additionally, first quarter subscription revenue doubled versus the year ago quarter. Very good and positive momentum for our new sales force in the residential sector. Our full year 2022 revenue expectation remains unchanged at $70 million.\nOther Marketplace revenue grew 31% in the first quarter of 2022, driven by the strong growth from Ten-X, and we expect revenue from these marketplaces to grow 20% in 2022 as we had easier comps in the first quarter of this year.\nOn to profitability. Our net income was $89 million in the first quarter, an increase of 20% from the first quarter of 2021, and our effective tax rate was 26% for the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $178 million, a 12% year-over-year increase, $18 million above the high end of our guidance. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 34% compared to 35% in last year's first quarter.\nThe outperformance in adjusted EBITDA compared to guidance was driven by lower personnel and marketing costs as well as a bit higher than projected revenue. Roughly 1/3 of the lower operating costs are timing-related with the rest flowing through to our increased guidance for 2022. We saw good productivity in our marketing costs, particularly as we leverage scale across our various platforms that are now marketing as we go into the new season.\nOur sales force totaled approximately 870 people on March 31, an increase of roughly 45 heads from the end of last year. The largest sales force increases this quarter were in LoopNet, followed by multifamily and Ten-X. We're focused on expanding our sales resources in all of our businesses and have doubled our number of sales recruiters since the beginning of this year.\nOur contract renewal rate was 91% for the first quarter of 2022, up from the 90% rate in the first quarter of last year and down slightly from the fourth quarter renewal rate of 92%. So this renewal rate fluctuated within this 90% to 92% range over really the last 5 quarters, and it changes slightly due to product mix and whether the growth rates of CoStar or Apartments are moving in different directions. The renewal rate for the first quarter of 2022 for customers who've been subscribers for 5 years or longer was a record 98%. Got to love that.\nSubscription revenue on annual contracts was 80% for the first quarter of 2022, which is the highest rate since the middle of 2020. The improvement in subscription revenue concentration is primarily from more multifamily customers committing to annual agreements.\nSo for the outlook for 2022, we expect the full year revenue in a range of $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion, an increase of approximately $5 million at the midpoint of the range, implying an annual growth rate of 11%. Organic growth, excluding the revenue runoff from the legacy Homes.com product is expected to be 12%. Second quarter 2022 revenue is expected to range from $529 million to $534 million, representing revenue growth of 11% year-over-year at the midpoint.\nFull year adjusted EBITDA for 2022 is expected to range from $585 million to $615 million, which is an increase of $15 million from our prior guidance, with $5 million of the improvement from revenue and the rest from cost efficiencies, primarily from leveraging our scale across the marketing spend, as I mentioned earlier. For the second quarter of 2022, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $123 million to $128 million, indicating a margin of 24% at the midpoint during the typical high point of our marketing spend for the quarters.\nRegarding our longer-term goals, for the great start to 2022 and our new residential investments progressing as planned, we remain confident in our ability to reach both the 2022 as well as the 2027 long-term financial goals that we announced at our last earnings call in February.\nSo before I turn the call back over to our operator for this much anticipated Q&A session, I would like to remind everyone, our question-asking audience, that you'll get one question and one question only. So I know that you've been thinking about it long and hard, and you're going to make this question count.\nSo with that, I will now turn the call back over to our operator to begin the questions."

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to Bill Warmington, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nWilliam Arthur Warmington\n\nVP of IR, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Blue.

Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & CEO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call.\nTotal revenue for the full year 2021 was $1.94 billion, which is a 17% year-over-year growth rate and above the high end of our guidance range given in late October. Fourth quarter revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $507 million, crossing through an important milestone of a $2 billion run rate for the first time.\nDecember 2021 was our best sales month ever. November, December and January were 3 of our 4 strongest sales months ever. Net bookings of $67 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 were a new all-time high for us, up 37% year-over-year and 43% sequentially. Our trailing 12-month bookings in the fourth quarter was $217 million, growing 18% year-over-year. This is a significant acceleration from the trailing 12-month bookings growth of 6% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2021.\nOur profit performance in 2021 was also very strong. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $647 million, an increase of 17% and 27% above the high end of our guidance. 2021 was a solid year of growth and expansion for CoStar Group. We made significant investments in the CoStar product, and our unified platform overcame significant overhead market challenges Apartments.com. And we expanded our LoopNet and Ten-X businesses and established a solid foundation in the residential property sector.\nOur addressable market continues to grow every year, and our estimation now approaches $100 billion TAM globally. A couple of weeks ago, I ran across our TAM estimate from the year 2003, and that indicated a global TAM of $1.6 billion. At that point, our total revenue was under $75 million. What a difference we've seen in 20 years is our revenue is now bigger than we estimated the total TAM global to be in 2003. It took us 16 years to go from 0 to $100 million revenue run rate in 2003, another 14 years to get to $1 billion annualized revenue in 2017 and only 4 years to surpass $2 billion revenue run rate. $5 billion, here we come.\nCoStar revenue was $723 million for the full year 2021, up 9%. CoStar's year-over-year revenue growth accelerated throughout 2021. We started the year with a 4% year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2021, and it climbed until we exited at 13% in the fourth quarter. The strength is coming from a combination of record sales rep productivity, continued product upgrades, price escalations on subscription renewals and strong renewal rates.\nNet bookings in the fourth quarter of 2021 grew 3x versus the fourth quarter of 2020 and matched our all-time high quarter in the third quarter of 2021. The CRE sales team is firing on all cylinders, delivering all-time high productivity in 2021, up almost 40% versus 2020.\nIn 2021, we began upgrading the 18,000 accounts who were using subsets of CoStar's full product offering. This program is very popular with our customers. And by the end of January, we have converted about 5,700 accounts to the full global CoStar product. Our original estimate was that the upgrade program would contribute $30 million to $40 million in incremental revenue over a 12- to 18-month period.\nThe adoption rate, however, has been stronger than we expected. So we expanded the number of accounts to upgrade to include appraisers, owners, government agencies and many others. This raises the number of upgradable accounts from 18,000 to 21,000. As a result, we believe our original estimate that the upgrade opportunity would generate $30 million to $40 million is likely not to exceed $50 million.\nAfter having suspended price increases on CoStar subscription renewals during the pandemic, we restarted normal renewal rate increases in the third quarter of this year. Even at these higher price points from annual renewals and upgrades, clients continue to see strong value in the CoStar product, and we see that in multiple metrics.\nOur accelerating revenue growth, for example, is coming from a combination of both volume and price. We're finding that as we upgrade accounts, we're often increasing their number of users. And our user count is now over 170,000 subscribers. In addition, our renewal rate for CoStar remains very strong. 94% in the fourth quarter of 2021, well above the historic average of 92.4%.\nOur sales team has put a significant effort into strengthening our relationships with our clients. We see that effort pay off as our Net Promoter Score has been increasing. And as it does, so does our renewal rate.\nWe believe that the launch of our new lender product on February 8 sets up another long-term growth driver for CoStar. Feedback, while the products in beta has been extremely positive, is a truly revolutionary product that reverses the traditional flow of data in the industry. In the past, most lenders pulled data manually from multiple sources. CoStar lender, in contrast, automatically connects their loan portfolio to CoStar's industry-leading research market analytics and our proprietary COMPASS credit default model. The COMPASS credit default model is the most mature in the industry. And this makes this solution unique as the best source for portfolio surveillance, concentration risk, stress testing, current expected credit loss, CECL, supporting loan originations and underwriting. So we're very excited about this new product.\nWe have a dedicated and trained sales team that will be focused on upgrading CoStar's over 1,000 existing lender clients and engaging 6,000 other prospective lenders across the industry. With FASB's second round effective date for CECL fast approaching in January of 2023, we feel our solution is well timed. There are literally thousands of institutions in the U.S. without an answer for CECL in place with this deadline approaching. Because CoStar offers lenders a range of solutions, it positions us favorably versus the competition.\nWe continue to invest in long-term growth opportunities for CoStar, and that includes international expansion. To support our growth across Central Europe, we've begun hiring managers and teams of photographers for Spain, France and Germany. These teams will be supporting both our CoStar and marketplace assets as we begin the process of deepening our industry data in the largest European markets.\nOverall, I feel very good about our growth momentum for CoStar and expected growth in 2022 to move above the historical 12% to 14% growth range to around 15% year-over-year. I believe CoStar has a $10 billion global market opportunity in which we are less than 10% penetrated today.\nApartments.com sales bookings rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter, climbing $20 million over the third quarter driven by improved sales execution and price realization in the face of a continued ultra-low vacancy market. Apartments.com generated $675 million of revenue in 2021, up 13% year-over-year. Revenue growth in the fourth quarter was 6%, in line with our guidance of mid-single digits growth.\n2021 was a good year for Apartments.com franchise. Average monthly unique visitors in the fourth quarter of 2021 were 25 million, up 17% year-over-year. That is 2.5x rent past average monthly unique visitors in the fourth quarter of '21, 10x apartment lists, 17% higher than Zillow's rental network and 11x Zumper. Leads delivered by Apartments.com grew 46% in '21 and 27% in the fourth quarter.\nTo keep this marketing momentum going, in the first quarter of '22, we will be releasing a new ad campaign featuring Gold Bloom in 5 new TV spots and 8 new social video campaigns. When you see these new campaigns, I think you'll -- these new spots, I think you'll agree with me that is some of the best work our team has produced to date. I look forward to having them out there.\n2021 was a great year for our Multifamily customers with record rent growth of 11.3% and a vacancy rate of only 4.6%, the lowest ever recorded. '22 is expected to have rent growth of 6.5%, which would be the second best year on record with higher but still very low vacancy.\nThe strong industry backdrop for apartment owners, combined with a superior advertising value demonstrate their site traffic and leads, position Apartments.com to execute on our new pricing strategy. As a result, cost per lead has begun to improve, and we saw a significant improvement in net bookings in the fourth quarter of '21 over the third quarter of '21.\nClient losses have been minimal. The strong net bookings momentum, combined with modest improvements in the macro backdrop, gives us confidence that Multifamily will be able to return to double-digit organic revenue growth in the second half of '22. We estimate Multifamily is a $7 billion revenue opportunity for us in the U.S. And we believe that Apartments.com is well positioned to pursue that opportunity through unit penetration and demonstrated pricing power.\n'21 was a very successful year for the LoopNet franchise. Full year revenue of $208 million in '21 grew 15%. The Space for Dreams campaign delivered 2.2 billion media impressions in '21. Unique visitors globally grew 22% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of '21, and the LoopNet CRE network traffic was 10x the level of the network nearest competitor. Signature ad growth continued to be very strong, up 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of '21.\nWe continue to focus on expanding our sales distribution strength and are currently very close to our year-end '21 sales headcount goal of [50] and continue to aggressively recruit salespeople for LoopNet. In '22, we plan to continue the Space for Dreams campaign, support the industry and driving exposure for our advertisers.\nWe expect LoopNet's revenue growth to continue in that 10% range for the first half of '22 while we continue to build out a dedicated LoopNet sales team. I feel confident that we have never had stronger leadership, a better product road map, more innovative marketing, stronger technology and better traffic than we have now. That's why I believe that LoopNet is well positioned for strong growth going forward. We remain excited that LoopNet has the industry-leading position in what we believe is in the early days of a $4 billion to $5 billion revenue opportunity.\nTen-X had a strong year in 2021, the division's first full calendar year as part of CoStar Group. Ten-X sold $2.2 billion in gross merchandise value in 2021, up 47% year-over-year and the company's best since 2016. In the fourth quarter of '21, Ten-X sold $727 million in gross merchandise value, up 39% year-over-year, the company's best quarter since the fourth quarter of '15.\nFull year '21 revenue of $57 million grew 7% year-over-year. While total sales in the platform is climbing, it does not translate as quickly to revenue because we've lowered our fees to drive more high-margin volume and to play an industry role at greater scale. We're investing in significant site and process automation to be able to process these higher volumes at high margins.\nTen-X continues to sell more and close more. Trade rate, which is total assets sold as a percentage of the total assets brought to the platform, has improved from 54% in 2019 to 66% in '20 and 73% in '21. And this has happened while we've been expanding the buyer base significantly.\nWe estimate that Ten-X is a $4 billion revenue opportunity. To pursue that TAM, we're aggressively growing Ten-X' sales team currently up to 54 people. These new salespeople have been incredibly productive. In the first quarter '21, new sales reps didn't add any new deal -- it didn't any deals in the quarter. In the second quarter, they delivered 5% of the deals. In the third, they delivered 20%. In the fourth, they delivered almost 1/3 of the deals.\nIn addition, the research team in Richmond, which is in constant contact with brokers and principals who can benefit from Ten-X, has begun to contribute deals to the Ten-X pipeline.\nWe've opened round 1 of the battle of bids 2022, a gamification of the Ten-X bidding process in which people can guess the price at which a real estate property will be sold with a chance to win up to $3 million in cash prizes. Our goal is to drive broad brand awareness and platform participation. We think we've created a really fun gamification of the CRE sales process that will bring the Ten-X story live and engage tens of thousands of key prospects.\n'21 was our first full year in the residential property sector. We generated $75 million of revenue. Homesnap revenue grew 52% year-over-year on a pro forma basis in '21 driven by our larger direct sales force of 60 people. In the fourth quarter of '21, Homesnap grew registered users by 12% year-over-year to 786,000 agents as Homesnap Pro Plus paying subscribers grew 29% year-over-year to 68,000.\nOur acquisition of Homes.com in May of '21 was very popular with agents as we implemented a your listing, your lead product approach and double the site traffic year-over-year in the fourth quarter '21. That's right. We doubled the site traffic in the fourth quarter of 2021. Sounds familiar.\nOur strategy for transforming this massive TAM into revenue involves 3 phases: grow, monetize and scale. By grow, I mean, first, we're going to focus on increasing traffic and engaging buyers and sellers in our platform. By monetize, I mean we'll begin to introduce (inaudible), which increase visibility for the clients and provide enhanced product features. And by scale, I mean moving into the phase where we stratify ad offerings to provide additional flexibility for agents and continue introducing more product features.\nPhase 1, growing traffic is our focus today. We have a track record of success in building organic SEO in our marketplaces, including Apartments.com, LoopNet, Realla, BizBuySell, Belbex and Lands of America and more. How do we do it? By building easy-to-use technology with sound SEO structures and with features and content to people value.\nFor Homes.com, that means building a system that breaks down the wall between real estate agents and home buyers. 93% of homebuyers shop for their home on the Internet, and 90% of homebuyers use an agent to help find a home. Agent and buyers need to share information and feedback about home listings, but that's difficult today because they operate in 2 separate essentially closed and disconnected systems. Agents use their local MLS, which buyers have limited or no access to. Buyers use various real estate portals, but those portals are generally trying to get those buyers to use the portal small group of agents. So they're not effectively open buyer-agent collaboration tools across the industry.\nIn fact, in essence, the structure was designed specifically to prevent transparency and collaboration. After watching hundreds of hours of interviews and focus groups, I can tell you that the thing that consumers and agents want that they're not getting and that what we can provide is collaboration.\nHomesnap is going to change that by enabling agents and buyers to share listings and feedback about those listings. By empowering agents with professional collaboration tools, we think it's possible to bring millions of buyers into our platform.\nThe other takeaway from our interviews with consumers and agents is they want to be able to research the neighborhoods and parks that are important to them when they're considering a new home. We'll be creating powerful and professionally produced rich media and content of neighborhoods, parks and condo buildings across the United States.\nThe other thing that Homes.com will do is support your listing, your lead by enabling potential homebuyers to easily contact the listing agent at no cost that agent. We believe that signees free leads to listing agents will increase the usage of Homes.com and Homesnap by all agents and provide a dramatically better user experience for buyers out there shopping.\nWe expect phase 1 of the product will be ready to go at the end of '22, with a full launch in the first quarter of '23. That said, you won't need to wait until end of '22 to see our residential strategy in action. You will see a microcosm of our residential strategy when we launched Citysnap in New York in July.\nIn October, we announced a partnership with the Real Estate Board of New York to create the first ever consuming facing -- consumer-facing search website and mobile app for New York City's residential listing service. Similar to Homes.com, Citysnap will connect potential buyers and renters with listing agents consistent with our your listing, your lead philosophy and make collaboration possible through access to Homesnap's suite of tools. It will also feature promoted listings for residential real estate for the first time, similar to what we do with Apartments.com and many other real estate portals in other countries do.\nWe believe that residential is a huge opportunity for CoStar Group. So enlarged, in fact, that we believe our residential revenue will 1 day eclipse the revenue we generate in the commercial property sector. We estimate the U.S. opportunity for residential is $72 billion, and the global opportunity is $210 million, not $200 billion, $210 billion, 3x the U.S. opportunity.\nWe believe that we can grow our residential revenue to $1 billion over the next 5 to 7 years as part of our new long-term revenue goal of $5 billion in revenue by the end of '27. At that scale, we would expect our adjusted EBITDA margins to be at or above our 5-year target of 40% based on the success of similar residential marketplace businesses around the world.\nIn order to achieve this goal, we plan to increase our level of investment in the residential business by approximately $200 million in '22. The majority of this investment is funded by the significant cash generation of our existing business as we still expect to generate over $605 million in adjusted EBITDA in '22, net of that residential investment.\nI'm excited to make significant progress this year and believe we have a unique opportunity to add another $1 billion revenue platform plus to our portfolio.\nIn December, we announced plans to build a 2-building 750,000 square foot corporate campus by James River in Richmond, Virginia to complete -- be completed by '24. Richmond is a vibrant growing affordable city with a great quality of life and 10 colleges and universities in the area that are both our research partners and our talent pool feeder. At CoStar Group and in Richmond, we are proud to employ amazing people who create and provide the best products, information, analytics and marketplaces that power the real estate industry. We strive to set the standard for accuracy and precision in everything we do because our clients rely on this data to conduct hundreds of billions of dollars in transactions. This type of exacting standard requires discipline, determination, commitment. And people of CoStar Group take great pride in their ability to deliver at this level. We provide our people with world-class industry training, enable them to advance professionally and enjoy long rewarding careers with CoStar Group. It does involve in measuring our performance and our work and having KPIs like any organization should have.\nLike any company, we have people who decide demands of our environment is not for them, and that's fine. For most who choose to leave, they're able to leverage the CoStar Group fundamental training, go on to enjoy productive careers in commercial real estate in other industries or continue their education. The real estate industry attrition rate in '21 was 32.8%, but our attrition was slightly higher at 36.6%, about 300 basis points or so. The key difference between CoStar Group and the rest of the industry is that we achieved a 99% employee vaccination rate, and our employees have returned to working safely back in the office.\nAs you know, that's very rare. Our staff is more productive back in the office. Collaboration, innovation is stronger. And training is much more effective. We do have a tiny vocal minority of disgruntled former employees who do not want to return to work. But despite that, we would take the same responsible long view direction again. Now that we're back in the office, our attrition rate has returned to normal, and over the past few months has, in fact, settled below the industry average. As hard as it was to return to the office, we're glad we've done it and feel for the companies that still have to cross that challenging bridge.\nWe continue to believe that Richmond is a great center of excellence from which to grow our talent employee base that is supporting the real estate industry around the U.S. and across the world.\nEarlier today, we published our first sustainability report, which you can find in the Investor Relations section of the CoStar Group website. It's a very exciting piece. Thank you, Bill.\nAt CoStar Group, we're committed to supporting ESG principles both inside and outside of our company. Inside CoStar Group, we have quietly been a leader in sustainability for decades, converting our fleet of nearly 200 research vehicles from gasoline to hybrid and then eventually to electric. We select LEED certified or ENERGY STAR rated buildings for most of our 800 -- I'm sorry, our 80-plus offices and reducing total annual data center energy consumption despite significant company growth.\nOutside of CoStar Group, we help millions of consumers and real estate professionals achieve their sustainability goals. We pioneered creating transparency around building energy consumption when we were the first to widely publish building rate energy ratings. The CoStar information analytics product provides all subscribers with data in green rated buildings so they can identify locations that are ENERGY STAR bream and LEED certified. In addition, we funded the Journal of Sustainable real estate to support academics who study the value of building and investing in sustainable real estate. My colleagues and I have authored economic articles analyzing financial benefits from building and leasing and sustainable buildings. And those papers have been recognized with Best Paper Awards.\nThe United Nations estimates that buildings and construction account for 36% of global final energies and 39% of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. We believe CoStar Group is part of the solution to that problem, and we're focused on that. Our Apartments.com, Homes.com, LoopNet and lands marketplaces enable people all over the world to digitally visit properties for lease or sale without the environmental impact of physically driving to them.\nAs you're aware, the economic recovery persists, but concerns about the virus inflation, the prospect of raising interest rates way on the near-term outlook. Supply constraints and labor shortages are also prevalent, which is further challenging business operations, driving costs and prices higher. As a result, consumers are facing decades high inflation, which is weighing on sentiment and potential spending. But in an inflationary environment, real estate can be a safe haven.\nIn hospitality, in hospitality, leisure demand continues to drive the U.S. hotel recovery. Key metrics, including rooms, sold, occupancy, ADR and RevPAR are all either at or slightly above prepandemic levels, which is great news. Business travel, meanwhile, remains constrained as conferences are hampered by the latest variant of the coronavirus. Transaction volume ended the year at record levels, a signal of investors' long-term optimism for hospitality's recovery.\nIn retail, strong consumer spending continues to support a resurgent retail environment. Foot traffic in physical locations has rebounded, especially in open-air shopping centers. Not surprising. Retailers have responded to the increase in consumer spending, and leasing volume is back to prepandemic levels. Notably, store openings outpaced store closures, helping to drive net absorption to its highest level since 2017. As a result, rents grew by 2.8%, the strongest pace seen in over a decade. Headwinds for the sector do remain, including waning fiscal support and higher inflation, supply chain disruption, labor shortages as well as an overhang of retail supply in certain segments.\nIn industrial, that sector continues to benefit from the boom in consumer spending and the heightened need for enhanced supply chain networks. Expansions among e-commerce and big-box logistics firms continue to fuel record leasing activity, which is up 60% from prepandemic levels. Despite a record amount of speculative supply under construction, there's little risk of overbuilding given such strong demand. Vacancy hit a record low of 4.2%, propelling rent growth to a record 8.6%.\nIn the office sector, uncertainty is still the prevailing theme of the sector. But after 2 straight quarters of improving leasing activity and slight positive net absorption, the national office market has started to stabilize, were showing signs of stabilization and is likely in the early stages of recovery. However, significant headwinds and questions remain.\n(inaudible) subletspace remains a drag on the office markets recovery, though office users are increasingly turning to sublet leases for their space needs. It's still a tenant market. And while we've seen marginal increases in occupancy and space rents, such an improvement masks the higher concessionary environment, which is weighing on owner revenue. LoopNet could help those owners get a great lease now.\nThe national multifamily market is expected to normalize in '22, but the sector remains in historically strong position. Search activity at Apartments.com reached record levels in '21, thanks to pent-up demand and regional shifts in migration in favor of Sunbelt markets. Record-setting demand is pushing vacancy rates to new lows. In turn, multifamily owners and managers are benefiting from record setting rent growth. Developers are working to deliver new product to meet unrelenting demand, especially in the Southeast.\nCommercial real estate investment across the board is hitting record levels led by unquenchable interest in multifamily and industrial assets. Retail and office volume is making traction approaching prepandemic levels. Meanwhile, volume was up in virtually every major metropolitan area. Pricing is trending higher in all property types. Distressed sales remain a small portion of overall activity, underscoring the prevailing health of the CRE industry.\nAt this point, I'm going to turn the call over to our brilliant Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler.\n\nScott T. Wheeler\n\nCFO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nExcellent. Thank you, Andy.\n\nAndrew C. Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & CEO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nScott T. Wheeler\n\nCFO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nI thought I've achieved a brilliant category today. Hope you think so after reading all these numbers. Certainly appreciate the comments and the great performance of the business in 2021. And obviously, it sounds like there's no shortage of great opportunities ahead of us. Actually, I particularly enjoyed your throwback charts that you sent me from that 2020 sales conference when you have that (inaudible) TAM from 20 years ago of $1.6 billion. That had grown to -- in 2016, when I joined, it was $6 billion we thought it was at that point. And now only 5 years later, we're talking about $100 billion TAM size. So I think that's pretty amazing. Anyway, enough of that giant global TAM mumbo jumbo. Let's talk some financials.\nSo fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA results were better than expected, both ahead of our consensus. $4 million ahead for revenue and $28 million beat on profit. That was a great way to end the year.\nOur fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 38%, demonstrating the strong operating leverage inherent in our business. Our overall organic revenue growth rate was 11% for 2021, continuing a trend of 10 straight years of double-digit or greater organic revenue growth.\nCoStar revenue grew 13% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year of 2021, in line with our previous guidance. Our many product enhancements and our successful shift to a global CoStar platform has resulted in increased demand and improved pricing. We anticipate that this positive growth trend will continue and expect both first quarter and full year 2022 revenue growth of 15% for CoStar.\nMultifamily revenue grew 6% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the full year of 2021, also in line with the guidance we provided on our last call. As Andy mentioned, we saw Multifamily sales levels improved sequentially in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2021, although we're not quite back yet to the level of sales we generated in the early part of 2021. Accordingly, we expect revenue growth rates to remain in the mid-single digits in the first half of 2022 for Multifamily before improving to double-digit growth rates in the second half of 2022. Full year growth rates for revenue in Multifamily will still be around 8% to 9% for the full year of 2022.\nLoopNet revenue grew 13% in the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year of 2021. Our CoStar sales team continues to sell an amazing amount of CoStar. That results in less sales of LoopNet at the lower end of our expectations as we build out our dedicated LoopNet sales team. Regardless, we'll still grow LoopNet revenue double digits even with a smaller sales team. For 2022, we expect LoopNet revenue growth in the low double digits fluctuating around the 10% to 11% range throughout the year. Admittedly, this is a cautious outlook until our new dedicated sellers ramp up to full production later in 2022.\nInformation Services revenue grew 6% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year of '21, in line with our guidance. We expect revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits in the first half of 2022, improving to the low double digits in the second half of the year as conditions improve in our hospitality industry. Overall, we expect 2022 revenue for Information Services to grow 8% to 9% year-over-year.\nOur residential business delivered $21 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021, slightly ahead of our guidance, with nearly all of the revenue coming from Homesnap products as we complete the wind down of the legacy Homes.com revenue. Homesnap's pro forma revenue growth was more than [60%] in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nFor 2022, we expect residential revenue to be around $70 million, representing growth of approximately 15% year-over-year after adjusting for the runoff of Homes.com product revenues. As we move into 2022, we've identified specific residential products that are expected to be part of our long-term growth strategy. These products include the Homesnap Pro Plus agent subscriptions, Homesnap listing ads and Homesnap Concierge Pro Plus lead management subscriptions, all of which, in aggregate, generated revenue of $55 million or 70% of the 2021 residential revenue. These continuing strategic products are expected to grow around 25% in 2022. By the end of the year, these products are expected to represent over 95% of the residential revenue.\nOther marketplace revenue was $35 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, well ahead of our guidance estimate of $32 million to $33 million, on the strength of a big finish to the year for our Ten-X platform. In 2022, we expect continued strong growth from Ten-X, along with our lands and businesses for sale marketplaces, all of which are expected to grow around 20% for the year. In total, our other marketplace sector is expected to achieve revenue growth of 20% in 2022, which compares favorably to the 10% pro forma revenue growth rate we had in 2021.\nNet income was $93 million in the fourth quarter and $293 million for the full year of 2021. Our effective tax rate was 30% for the fourth quarter and 28% for the full year. Included in this effective tax rate for 2021 were onetime increases, primarily from international tax restructuring that will support our future growth. Without these restructurings, our effective tax rate would have been approximately 24% in the fourth quarter and for the full year.\nLet's cover a few performance metrics, starting with our net new sales bookings. We achieved [$67] million of net new bookings in the fourth quarter and $217 million for the full year. Just like to say that again, but Andy covered all that cool stuff. And our record sales level for the quarter, so I will...\n\nAndrew C. Florance\n\nFounder, Director, President & CEO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\n$217 million.\n\nScott T. Wheeler\n\nCFO, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\n$217 million. Great. Our sales force totaled approximately 825 people at the end of the year, and they certainly had an exceptionally productive fourth quarter with that record sales result. The fourth quarter number is down approximately 25 compared to the third quarter of 2021 as a result of attrition in the Homes.com sales team that joined us in mid-2021.\nWith increased confidence in our ability to train new sellers and visit our customers in person this year, our 2022 outlook includes expansion plans across all of our major sales teams. In January of 2022, we added over 35 new sellers to the ranks, so we're off to a strong start.\nOur contract renewal rate was 92% for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2021, unchanged from the third quarter of 2021. The current renewal rate is 200 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2020, with both CoStar and LoopNet improving year-over-year. Renewal rate for the fourth quarter of '21 for customers who have been subscribers for 5 years or longer was 97%, up 200 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020 and consistent with the second and third quarters of this year.\nSubscription revenue on annual contracts was 77% for both the fourth quarter and the full year '21, slightly below the fourth quarter of 2020, but slightly higher than the third quarter of this year. These modest fluctuations are a result of improvements in Multifamily, along with increased residential and LoopNet signature ad revenue, which tend to have shorter duration subscription contracts.\nNow for our 2022 outlook. We expect 2022 revenue to range from $2.145 billion to $2.165 billion, an increase of approximately $210 million at the midpoint of the range, implying an annual growth rate of 11%. Organic growth, excluding the revenue runoff from those legacy Homes.com product, is expected to be around 12%.\nBefore I cover the 2022 adjusted EBITDA outlook and investments, I'd like to highlight the exceptional results we continue to see in our commercial real estate focused product areas, which includes CoStar, Multifamily, LoopNet, Information Services and our other marketplace businesses.\nA few years back, at the end of 2018, we set ambitious growth goals to reach $3 billion in run rate revenue by the end of '23 and 40% adjusted EBITDA margins for that year. As a reminder, our $3 billion in run rate revenue goal was comprised of both organic revenue growth of 12% to 14% per year, approximately $600 million to $700 million of new revenue from acquisitions.\nSo how have we performed against these goals? Well, with regards to the organic revenue growth, our performance is right on track in that 12% to 14% revenue growth range for the years 2019 through our 2022 outlook. This highlights the strength and resiliency of our product portfolio as we certainly did not anticipate the significant pandemic revenue slowdown in CoStar in 2020 or the current low vacancy market environment in Multifamily that impacts the growth of that business.\nRegarding acquisition-related revenue, we added a little over $200 million in acquired revenue since 2018. In that time, we've certainly passed on deals that many times that amount given what I consider to be unrealistic valuations and the difficulty of acquiring in a remote work environment. By my estimation, we could have spent around $4 billion to $6 billion of capital to acquire the level of revenue we had assumed in our targets. But rather than chase deals at those high prices, we elected to forego a number of opportunities and focus organically, which currently provides a much better return currently for our shareholders.\nWith regards to our profit target of 40% adjusted EBITDA in 2023, we now expect to achieve that goal 1 year ahead of schedule and are forecasting 40% adjusted EBITDA for 2022 in the commercial real estate focused product areas.\nAs we've either accomplished or on track with our current long-term goals, we believe it's time to establish new long-range goals as the old goals don't include our recent expansion into the residential property market or the great opportunity we see there. I will get to the new goals in just a minute.\nSo our adjusted EBITDA outlook for 2022 is comprised of 2 important components. One is the cash generation, and the second is deploying that capital for our growth investments. First, to cover cash generation, we expect to generate approximately $170 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA in 2022 from the 12% organic revenue growth forecast. This added profit reflects approximately an 80% incremental margin drop-through on new revenue, pretty consistent with what we've done in the past.\nThe second component is deploying capital towards our top growth initiatives. First, we plan to invest approximately $20 million in 2022 to expand our many sales forces as well as extend our international footprint in Central Europe. More significantly, as Andy discussed in his remarks, we plan to invest in content, technology and marketing to support our residential expansion strategy. Operating costs and investments for residential, which totaled approximately $100 million in 2021, are expected to increase by around $200 million to $220 million to a range of $300 million to $320 million in 2022. A little over half of that increased investment is focused on proprietary content research with the remaining amount earmarked for marketing and software design and development.\nSo when we combine the cash generation of $170 million with the total investment range of $220 million to $240 million, the result is adjusted EBITDA outlook for the year in the range of $565 million to $605 million. Our adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 20% -- 27% at the midpoint of that range. First quarter 2022 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $155 million to $160 million, indicating a margin of 31% at the midpoint. As we move through 2022, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins in the low 20% range during the second and third quarters of '22 during the peak marketing and research season. Fourth quarter '22 adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to improve to around 30%.\nI'll wrap up today with a summary of our new long-range targets that I mentioned earlier. These new targets incorporate the significant growth opportunity as well as the required investments for our success in residential market strategy. Our new long-range target is to achieve a $5 billion in revenue and $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA in the year 2027. Implicit in this target is an overall 17% compounded annual revenue growth rate.\nOur goal is to generate revenue from residential products in the range of $700 million to $1 billion in 2027, which would replicate, if not improve upon the success we've demonstrated with our Apartments.com investments. We believe the market size and opportunity in residential is significantly larger than in Multifamily, and we would anticipate investment levels in residential during the early years to increase before becoming profit accretive in a few years.\nFortunately, we have a very large and profitable commercial product portfolio that we expect will generate over $800 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2022 and will soon grow to over $1 billion per year. By the end of our long-term target horizon, I would expect adjusted EBITDA margins from the commercial real estate focused product areas of our business to approach 50%.\nWith that, I'd like to add a thanks to all of our amazing and hard-working CoStar colleagues for a fantastic 2021. And I certainly look forward to 2022 and what we can accomplish together in those years ahead.\nSo I'll now turn the call back over to Bill and our operator as they're going to lead us in a [raising] rendition of stump the chops. Bill, back to you.\n\nWilliam Arthur Warmington\n\nVP of IR, CoStar Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Scott. Blue, would you please assemble the queue for Q&A? (Operator Instructions) Go ahead, Blue."

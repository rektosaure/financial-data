At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on BD's Investor Relations website, investors.bd.com or by phone at (800) 839-2383 for domestic calls and area code +1 402 220-7202 for international calls. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Adam Reed, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nGood morning, and welcome to BD's earnings call. I'm Adam Reed, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at bd.com. Earlier this morning, BD released its results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2025. The press release and presentation can be accessed on the IR website at investors.bd.com. Leading today's call are Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Chris DelOrefice, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. You can read the disclaimer in our earnings release and the disclosures in our SEC filings on our Investor Relations website. Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be made on a year-on-year basis versus the relevant fiscal period. revenue percentage changes are on an adjusted FX neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Beginning October 1, we began operating under our previously disclosed new BD segment structure that includes medical Essentials, connected care, biopharma systems and Interventional and a fifth Life Sciences segment comprised of Biosciences and Diagnostic solutions. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures are included in the appendices of the earnings release and presentation.\nWith that, I am pleased to turn it over to Tom.\n\nThomas E. Polen\n\nPresident, Becton, Dickinson & Co.\n\nThank you, Adam, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, our Q4 and full year performance was in line with the preliminary results we announced last month. During our prepared remarks today, Chris and I will provide additional context on the drivers of our performance. I'll also provide an update on the immediate steps we are taking to accelerate our strategy as we transition into new BD, and I'll conclude with our fiscal '26 guidance and outlook on Q1, after which we'll take your questions.\nWith that, let's jump in. Q4 revenue of $5.9 billion increased 7% and 3.9% organic. New BD delivered strong organic growth of 4.9%, accelerating 90 basis points sequentially. For the full year, record revenue of $21.8 billion increased 7.7% and 2.9% organic. New BD grew 3.9% organic. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $3.96 for Q4 and a record $14.40 for the full year, which represents 9.6% earnings growth including a 2-point impact from tariffs. We also returned $2.2 billion to shareholders, inclusive of a $1 billion share buyback. Earlier this morning, we announced our 54th consecutive year of dividend increases.\nDuring the quarter, we had a greater-than-anticipated impact in macro areas we've been closely monitoring, specifically farm systems vaccines and Biosciences academic and government research. Vaccines are approximately 20% of our farm systems business. While we plan for a slowdown in Q4, further reductions in demand evolved rapidly late in the quarter as most Q4 vaccine demand typically occurs in September and continues into Q1 and Q2. In our biosciences business, research funding remains subdued, but sales in the U.S. and EMEA continued to improve sequentially, led by strong demand for our new fax Discover platform.\nIn Diagnostic Solutions, the business returned to positive growth in the quarter as [ BD Bactec ] utilization continued to recover. Together, Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions delivered flat growth for the quarter, excluding the impact of discontinued platforms. Outside of these 2 areas, we delivered strong growth across a broad range of the portfolio, demonstrating new BD's attractive profile with over 90% consumables revenue and a strong cadence of new innovation. This includes high single-digit growth in BD Interventional driven by double-digit growth in PureWick and advanced tissue regeneration.\nWe delivered double-digit pro forma growth in advanced patient monitoring, which in the first year of integration, performed well ahead of our deal model and is on track to continue this momentum in fiscal '26 and beyond. In Farm Systems, Biologics grew high single digits, driven by GLP-1s, and MMS had a record quarter for Alaris pump installations, including several new competitive wins, solidifying our leadership position now and for years to come as we complete our fleet upgrade in FY '26.\nOur BD excellence operating model helped to drive strong P&L leverage throughout the year with adjusted gross margin up 140 basis points, fueling 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, while we invested in selling and innovation which will continue to be our engine for growth in the new BD. This supported robust 9.6% adjusted diluted EPS growth, inclusive of tariffs while we also delivered on our full year goal to reach a record 25% adjusted operating margin. While we are navigating specific transitory market dynamics that are expected to continue into fiscal 2026, we have strong business fundamentals, high confidence in our continued long-term mid-single-digit growth profile and a proven track record of delivering value through periods such as this.\nWe are acting with speed to optimize our performance during this time and emerge stronger. We've already begun implementing decisive actions to accelerate our strategy as we create the new BD with a focus on boldly advancing BD excellence across our commercial and innovation organizations while identifying cost optimization opportunities to reinforce our commitment to long-term profitable growth.\nLet me highlight 3 specific initiatives underway. First, as part of accelerating our focus on commercial excellence, we're rearchitecting our operating model to build a more focused, agile vertical organization. This includes commercial teams directly aligned with each business unit to best support customer needs, drive share gains and accelerate growth. We're also taking immediate action to expand our sales force in targeted high-growth markets, investing an incremental $30 million to capitalize in areas that either are or have the potential to grow in the high single digits or double digits. These include opportunities such as the recent VA reimbursement for PureWick at home and new surgery innovations launching in Europe and a 15% increase in both the PI and APM sales forces.\nFinally, we've announced that Mike Fell's role has been expanded to include the newly created position of Chief Revenue Officer. Michael will apply his expertise in BD excellence to accelerate our initiatives to become a best-in-class commercial organization to deliver incremental growth. Michael will remain President of Life Sciences until the close of the RMT with Waters. Second, over the last several years, we've built positions in multiple attractive markets and are investing to capture opportunities and new product innovation.\nGoing into FY '26, we've moved nearly $50 million of corporate costs into R&D and the businesses to fuel future innovation and growth in attractive high-growth markets, such as tissue regeneration, PureWick adjacent markets, biologic drug delivery and connected care. Additionally, we focused investments behind planned new product launches, including our recently launched [ BD NCADA AI-enabled ] platform that unifies BD device data into 1 intelligent ecosystem, and our next-generation BD Pyxis Pro medication dispensing platform as well as new planned launches in APM, MDS, UCC, surgery and MMS.\nWe are pleased we also recently received 510(k) clearance for HemoSphere Stream, our continuous noninvasive blood pressure monitoring module, an impressive clearance in less than 30 days paves the way for commercial launch in 2026. Third and finally, we initiated a 2-year $200 million cost-out program, proactively addressing stranded corporate costs with approximately half expected this year.\nBefore I turn it over to Chris to provide additional color on our performance. On behalf of the leadership team, I want to take a moment to thank Chris for his leadership, hard work and dedication to BD over the past 4 years. I'm confident the CFO transition ahead will be seamless and wish Chris well in his new endeavors.\nWith that, I'll turn it to Chris.\n\nChristopher J. DelOrefice\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Tom. Before I begin, I want to take a moment to thank the entire team at BD. It has been a privilege and a career highlight to serve as the CFO of this company and getting to work hand-in-hand with our talented and committed colleagues to advance the world of health. I am proud of the accomplishments we achieved together that enabled us to deliver against our BD 2025 strategy, including the meaningful work to advance the margin profile of BD while simultaneously transforming our portfolio that has us well positioned for the future. I look forward to partnering with [indiscernible] and my entire leadership team to ensure a seamless transition as BD enters its next phase of value creation.\nLet's pivot to our performance results, starting with revenue. Organic growth was led by high single-digit growth in BD Interventional with strong performance across our growth platforms. This includes double-digit growth in UCC driven by PureWick and high single-digit growth in surgery led by our advanced tissue regeneration platform, including continued strong adoption of [ Phasix ] resorbable mesh. Growth in PI reflects strength across the oncology portfolio and [indiscernible].\nIn BD Medical, mid-single-digit organic growth was led by APM, which grew double digits on a pro forma basis with strong growth across all product lines. We feel really good about the momentum in APM continuing into FY '26, which will be further supported by significant sales force expansion currently underway. MDS also delivered a strong quarter with solid mid-single-digit growth in our Vascular Access Management portfolio. In MMS, we achieved a record sales quarter for our [ Alaris ] pump installations and we feel good about our strong backlog of committed contracts in dispensing.\nLastly, in Farm Systems, strong performance in Biologics continued with high single-digit growth driven by GLP-1s, this was offset by lower demand for vaccine products. In BD Life Sciences, GS returned a positive growth in the quarter with a greater than 300 basis point improvement in growth sequentially, driven by our molecular platforms and continued recovery in [ BD Back tech ] utilization, which exceeded 85% of historical levels in the U.S. In B2B, as Tom shared, research spending remains subdued, but sales continue to improve sequentially in the U.S. and EMEA led by demand of our new fax Discover platform. As a combined unit, and DS increased approximately low single digits on a reported basis and was approximately flat on a currency-neutral basis, excluding the impact of discontinued platforms. Rounding out the Life Sciences segment, solid growth in specimen management was driven by the BD Vacutainer portfolio, partially offset by China market dynamics.\nTurning to the P&L. In Q4, as Tom shared, we continued strong execution down the P&L with momentum from BD excellence while investing in key growth areas. We delivered adjusted gross margin of 54.2% and adjusted operating margin of 25.8%, including an impact from tariffs of about 140 basis points. Adjusted diluted EPS of $3.96 grew 3.9%, including a 6-point tariff impact. For the full year, adjusted gross margin of 54.7% and adjusted operating margin of 25% increased by 140 and 80 basis points year-over-year, respectively, inclusive of absorbing about a 40 basis point impact from tariffs. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $14.40, which represents strong growth of 9.6%, including a 2-point tariff headwind.\nWe continue to execute against our cash flow and capital allocation strategy with fiscal '25 free cash flows of $2.7 billion. Underlying free cash flow was strong overall and in line with our long-term target and inclusive of Alaris remediation, tariffs and other discrete payments, free cash flow conversion was 64%. We ended the fiscal year with net leverage of 2.8x and made progress towards our net leverage target of 2.5x.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Tom.\n\nThomas E. Polen\n\nPresident, Becton, Dickinson & Co.\n\nThanks, Chris. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing the Waters transaction. The combination of our Biosciences and Diagnostic Systems business with Waters continues to be a significant strategic and financial opportunity to unlock value for our investors. Our teams are partnering exceptionally well to set up a successful combination and momentum for the new company. Last month, we received FTC clearance and remain on track to close around the end of the first quarter of calendar year 2026, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.\nWe've begun executing our new BD strategy and the work we've done since establishing BD 2025 has set the foundation for the long-term sustainable success of the new BD. During this period of strategic progress, we delivered $5.4 billion of organic growth, the most substantive period of organic growth in BD's history. We created multiple new growth platforms achieved best-in-class adjusted gross and operating margin expansion near the top of our peer group and increased adjusted operating margin to 25% in FY '25, a record level for BD with more room ahead.\nWe see a clear opportunity to drive further commercial momentum. New BD will be a pure-play med tech company with a deep innovation pipeline in attractive markets and a best-in-class consumables revenue profile of over 90%. Our growth strategy is supported by BD Excellence, a differentiated capability we've created that is driving gross margin improvement operating effectiveness, cash generation and fueling reinvestment in innovation and commercial capabilities.\nTo give some color on the benefits we're seeing, in fiscal 2025, consumables quality hit record highs with a 50% reduction in manufacturing nonconformances. Further, we delivered world-class gross productivity improvements of over 8% in our plants this past year. These productivity gains enabled more production with less CapEx and achieving the lowest CapEx to revenue ratio in over a decade. We expect momentum to continue in FY '26. We also plan to deliver an enhanced capital allocation strategy that prioritizes internal investment, share repurchases and a reliable and increasing dividend with focused tuck-in M&A in targeted high-growth markets. all with the focus on steadily increasing ROIC.\nWe expect to significantly improve free cash flow conversion, excluding onetime impacts resulting from the Waters transaction, including OUS tax payments. We continue to see share repurchases as a value-creating opportunity given our view of the intrinsic value of BD. We plan to execute another $250 million share buyback this quarter in addition to it using at least half of the $4 billion in cash proceeds from the Waters transaction following the closing with the balance for debt repayment.\nIn summary, we see new BD delivering consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth over the long term with margin expansion driven primarily by gross margin fueled by our BD Excellence business system.\nMoving to our fiscal '26 guide. I'll start with our guidance for [ holdco BD ] and then provide color on our expectations for new BD post the Waters transaction. We're taking a prudent and transparent approach with our guidance framework. This includes low single-digit revenue growth as our starting point for the year and includes the following assumptions: First, regarding Aleris capital installations. fiscal '26 is the last year of our 3-year remediation commitment. We expect sales to remain strong and above our historical run rate. However, compared to FY '25's record install levels, this creates a headwind to growth of over 100 basis points.\nSecond, we expect China to decline in the mid-teens. As government policies, including volume-based procurement continue, which will impact growth by about 100 basis points. Our assumptions include China VBP reaching 80% coverage of our portfolio by the end of FY '26. Third, we are assuming reductions in vaccination rates will continue to drive conservative ordering patterns in farm systems vaccines. As we've said, vaccines are about 20% of Farm Systems revenue and our guidance assumes a decline of approximately 25%, which is an impact to growth of about 50 basis points.\nExcluding vaccines, we expect farm systems to grow mid- to high single digits. [indiscernible] The combined headwinds from these 3 factors impacts about 10% of BD revenue. Across the remaining 90% of the portfolio, we expect to drive mid-single-digit growth, including continued strength across our BDI, Connected Care and Medical Essentials portfolios fueled by commercial investments and our strong innovation pipeline. We're confident in delivering overall mid-single-digit growth over the long term as these dynamics exit, and we continue to advance our strong core business fundamentals. Based on current spot rates, currency is estimated to be a tailwind to revenue of about 90 basis points.\nMoving down the P&L. We expect continued strong adjusted operating margin consistent with FY '25 of about 25%. This includes absorbing an incremental $185 million or 80 basis points year-over-year headwind from tariffs, in line with what we've previously communicated. Excluding tariffs, the primary driver of margin expansion is expected to continue to come from gross margin, powered by BD excellence along with some leverage in shipping and G&A. For tax, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 14% and 15%. Given these considerations, we are setting our initial adjusted diluted EPS guidance in a range of $14.75 and to $15.05.\nExcluding the year-over-year tariff headwind, we expect EPS growth at the midpoint to be high single digits, which is the right way to think about our business longer term. As you think about fiscal 2026 phasing, we expect Q1 revenue to be down low single digits due to the items we covered. This includes a tough year-over-year comparison Biosciences, which also reflects prior year licensing revenue dynamics before we move to easier comparison periods beginning in Q2 and order timing in our Medical essentials portfolio. We expect Q1 adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85, inclusive of tariffs, which we anticipate will be most prominent in Q1 and continue through Q3, and about a 5-point headwind to the tax rate due to a prior year comparison.\nI'll now provide some context for how to think about new BD for the full fiscal year following the deal closing, which is expected to be around the end of the first quarter of calendar year 2026, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. We expect New BD's FY '26 revenue growth and margin profiles to be similar to HoldCo. This includes BDB and DS revenue and operating income moving to Waters along with conveyed costs. and a half a year of TSA income. Below operating income on a pro forma basis, we expect NewCo's tax rate will be about 200 basis points higher, driven largely by mix. Collectively, including the use of the cash distribution proceeds associated with the transaction and a higher tax profile, based upon projected close timing, we expected new BD pro forma adjusted EPS growth to be over 200 basis points higher than HoldCo.\nIn summary, as we close out fiscal 2025, we are excited to start the next chapter of BD. As we navigate transitory headwinds in contained areas, our broader portfolio is doing well, and we are actively investing in high-growth, high-margin areas. Combined with actions underway to unlock the untapped commercial potential in the new BD portfolio and reallocate resources, we are building the mechanisms to emerge stronger. We are confident in our long-term mid-single-digit growth profile and our ability to outperform our served markets. With the upcoming combination of biosciences and diagnostic solutions with Waters as a near-term catalyst, and an attractive capital allocation strategy, we are well positioned to deliver value for our shareholders, both in the near and long term.\nWith that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you please assemble our queue."

[Operator Instructions].\nI will now turn the call over to Greg Rodetis, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations.\n\nGreg Rodetis\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to BD's earnings call. I'm Greg Rodetis, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at bd.com. Earlier this morning, BD released its results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. The press release and presentation can be accessed on the IR website at investors.bd.com.\nLeading today's call are Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Chris DelOrefice, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following this morning's prepared remarks, Tom and Chris will be joined for Q&A by our segment presidents, Mike Garrison, President of the Medical segment; Mike Feld, President of the Life Sciences segment; Rick Byrd, President of the Interventional segment; and [ Bilal Musson ], President of our Future Connected Care segment.\nBefore we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. You can read the disclaimer in our earnings release and the disclosures in our SEC filings on our Investor Relations website. Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be made on a year-on-year basis versus the relevant fiscal period. Revenue percentage changes are on an adjusted FX-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures are included in the appendices of this earnings release and presentation.\nWith that, I am pleased to turn it over to Tom.\n\nThomas E. Polen\n\nPresident, Becton, Dickinson & Co.\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, in Q3, we sequentially improved growth across the company. We accelerated commercial initiatives and increased our organic growth trajectory through market headwinds. We continued our strong track record of executing BD excellence to drive gross margin upside. Additionally, we fulfilled our commitment to announce a definitive agreement to separate our Biosciences and Diagnostics business through a transaction that we believe will unlock meaningful value for our shareholders.\nTurning to details of the quarter. Revenue grew 8.5% to $5.5 billion or 3% organic. New BD organic growth was 4%. Our BD excellence lean operating system remains a flywheel for value creation, delivering Q3 adjusted gross margin of 54.8%, up 50 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin of 25.8%, up 60 basis points year-over-year, and supported delivering $3.68 in adjusted diluted EPS, each exceeded our expectations.\nAs we communicated last quarter, we've been taking actions to accelerate revenue growth. This includes further investing in growth opportunities by adding selling and marketing resources, capitalizing on new product launches and continuing to drive BD excellence to optimize product supply. The combination of these actions has already begun delivering results, as you saw play out in a number of key areas.\nFarm Systems improved sequentially to nearly 5% growth as we delivered another quarter of double-digit growth in Biologics. BDI accelerated to nearly 7% growth in the quarter with double-digit growth in UCC and mid-single-digit growth in PI and surgery. APM delivered double-digit pro forma growth ahead of our deal model. As expected, growth in both BDB and DS increased sequentially by approximately 250 basis points. This performance allowed us to deliver sequentially improved growth across the company through continued market headwinds in China, certain subsegments of farm systems such as vaccines and the life science research market.\nBuilding off our Q3 performance, we reaffirmed our organic revenue guide range for the year and raised our earnings guidance $0.18 at the midpoint.\nTurning to an update on several strategic initiatives. As committed last month, we announced that we entered into an agreement to combine our Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business with Waters through a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust. We strongly believe that Waters is the right partner and firmly believe in management's strategy and ability to unlock the value of these assets. The transaction is progressing well towards an expected closing around the end of the first quarter of calendar year 2026.\nWe're pleased to have named Brooke Story to lead BD's Integration and Separation Management office. Brooke has most recently led the integration of Edwards Critical Care, which she will continue to oversee as part of our expanded scope. Her rich experience, including her tenure as President of the Diagnostics business, makes sure the ideal choice for this role.\nUpon closing, new BD will be established as a scaled pure-play medical technology company with uniquely leading positions and a best-in-class consumable revenue profile of over 90%, a deep innovation pipeline and strong margin expansion fueled by BD excellence. The company's strong growth and earnings profile will be supported by enhanced capital allocation with an emphasis on share buybacks as we continue to pay competitive dividends and execute focused tuck-in M&A.\nAs previously communicated and aligned with our emphasis on share buybacks, we intend to use at least half of the approximately $4 billion cash distribution from Waters to buy back shares, with the balance for debt repayment as we continue to progress toward our 2.5x long-term net leverage target.\nMoving to an update on our innovation pipeline. We had some great launches and milestones this quarter, as investment decisions we made at the start of BD 2025 are now advancing to market. In BD Life Sciences, BDB's innovation super cycle continued in Q3. We saw strong traction with the successful launch of FACSDiscover A8, which features breakthrough spectral and real-time cell imaging technologies and has exceeded our sales targets since launch. We're also launching our first made in China for China clinical analyzer this quarter. BDB's R&D pipeline includes over 25 new product launches across instruments, reagents and informatics as well as continued expansion in the high-growth single-cell multiomics segment.\nIn DS, as blood culture momentum continues, we are excited about the next-generation Bactec launch in fiscal 2026, which is expected to drive renewal of legacy systems and accelerate share gains. In Molecular, innovation remains focused on leveraging the increased BD MAX installed base with continued growth of IVD revenue per system. Most customers today use just under 3 assays, while top users adopt 5 or more of our 14 assay menu. Our commercial team is focused on driving further menu adoption supported by the upcoming launch of several new assays in 2026.\nAlso in molecular, our BD core platform is addressing a new $1 billion market for HPV testing. And last week, we submitted to FDA the first ever at-home self-collection kit for HPV screening using a simple dry swap. We expect approval in mid-FY '26.\nToday, in the U.S. Approximately 30% of women have not been screened as recommended, and this population represents over 60% of cervical cancer deaths. We believe at-home self-collection can significantly improve access to screening, and play an important role in reversing still rising deaths from cervical cancer.\nMoving to BD Medical. We recently announced that our BD Libertas wearable injector has entered into first -- into its first pharma-sponsored clinical trial. This device is being used for self-injection of complex biologic drugs by patients at home rather than going to an infusion clinic. We also announced another BD sponsored studies that 100% of study participants would likely use the Libertas device if prescribed. Separately, we continue to expand signed agreements for GLP-1s, now reaching over 70 signed agreements for GLP-1 biosimilars. Biologics now represent 50% of total farm system sales, and we are exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on the wave of new molecules coming to market over the next decade.\nMoving to our portfolio of Connected Care solutions. Within MMS, we began limited commercial release of our new BD Pyxis Pro, completing installs at several customer sites with our BD Incada Enterprise AI software to follow this quarter. Pyxis Pro is our first redesigned hardware platform and includes multiple new features designed to improve nurse workflow, enhanced drug availability for patients and transform productivity using artificial intelligence. Pyxis Pro is our first product line to feed data into our new Incada AI platform and will be followed by Alaris, HemoSphere Alta monitor and other devices, creating future data sets, which will be unique in our industry. While still very early in our introduction, we are looking forward to this innovative journey over the next coming years.\nFollowing the APM acquisition, we immediately began investing in capabilities to develop increased connectivity and interaction between our Alaris infusion system and our HemoSphere Alta high hemodynamic monitoring system, recognizing that critical care nurses can spend 50% of their time manually adjusting infusions today. We're advancing through early milestones in our innovation process with prototypes now working in lab models. We have a strong cadence of new solutions under development across Connected Care that BD is uniquely positioned to deliver. And I'm pleased to have Bilal Muhsin, EVP and President, of our future Connected Care segment with us on the call today. Bilal joined BD in July from Massimo and is known for his deep knowledge of the sector, a strong track record of transformative innovation and its commercial focus on driving growth. This is an exciting next step in our journey to becoming the new BD, and I look forward to Bilal's partnership.\nIn MDS, we recently received FDA clearance for CentroVena One, our rapid insertion central catheter, and we're on track to launch this quarter. This is BD's first entry into the $500 million central line market, and CentroVena is designed to transform the efficiency and safety of insertion and reduce the risk of serious complications. In our BD Interventional segment, an advanced tissue regeneration platform, we continue to expand indications for Phasix with the EU launch of the world's first resorbable scaffold with broad indications to prophylactically prevent incisional hernias. With more than 2.5 million laparotomies performed annually across the U.S. and Europe, incisional hernias affect an estimated 30% of patients and up to 50% among high-risk populations. These preventable hernias often lead to a cycle of complications such as recurrence, surgical site infections and reoperations. The U.S. clinical trial is ongoing, with full patient enrollment anticipated in FY '26.\nLastly, our BD Excellence operating system continues to be a key enabler of our strong margin execution, and is expanding our competitive advantage in manufacturing, streamlining internal processes and optimizing our supply chains in today's tariff environment. In Q3, customer service levels measured as on-time in-full deliveries or OTIF, reached their highest level in over 5 years and continued positive momentum into Q4. Over the last 2 years, BD Excellence has been used to reduce manufacturing waste by more than 35%, and OEE or efficiency of equipment is up significantly, creating capacity to produce an additional 2.5 billion units on the same production lines. We continue to be in the early innings of BD Excellence and see a long runway ahead across operations, commercial, R&D and process excellence.\nThis also applies to our Life Science businesses, which were being separated, where BD Excellence has accelerating momentum and margin expansion initiatives are progressing well. We'll be transitioning these capabilities to Waters to continue this progress.\nIn closing, we achieved our objectives in Q3 and are fully engaged in executing our commercial initiatives to ensure we accelerate organic revenue growth through market dynamics. Simultaneously, we are focused on closing the transaction with Waters that will position BD for its next chapter of long-term success.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nChristopher J. DelOrefice\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Tom. Starting with our Q3 revenue performance. Revenues of $5.5 billion grew 8.5% or 3% organic. New BD organic growth was 4%. Regionally, total company organic growth was led by performance in the U.S. and Greater Asia outside of China, partially offset by China. In BD Medical, as we expected, [indiscernible] showed sequential improvement with 4.8% growth as we anniversary the impact of customer inventory destocking and delivered another quarter of double-digit growth in biologics driven by increased orders for GLP-1s. We continue to monitor market dynamics as volatility in subcategories such as generic anticoagulants and vaccines remain.\nMMS delivered solid mid-single-digit growth as we continue to secure competitive wins at several large health systems in the quarter across both infusion and dispensing and are tracking ahead of our goals for upgrading and securing our Alaris installed base.\nMDS grew low single digits as volume growth in Vascular Access Management and hypodermics in the U.S. was offset by ongoing change in clinical practice following the fluid shortage and volume-based procurement pressure in China as expected.\nAPM delivered 13% pro forma growth in the quarter. This was driven by strong commercial execution, incremental selling investment made as part of our acquisition thesis and new product innovation, including the recent launch of the HemoSphere Alta monitor.\nOur Interventional segment delivered nearly 7% growth in the quarter, with 12% growth in UCC, supported by the recent launches of PureWick Flex at Home and PureWick Mail, which continued to outpace the new product ramp of PureWick Female. Surgery delivered mid-single-digit growth, driven by double-digit growth in our advanced tissue regeneration platform from incremental investments in our Phasix sales force, our recent Phasix umbilical launch and continued adoption of GalaFLEX for plastic and reconstructive surgery.\nPeripheral Intervention also grew mid-single digits. Our focus on commercial execution and new accounts and the creation of a dedicated women's health sales team all contributed to improved sequential performance in the business.\nLastly, in BD Life Sciences as expected, Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions decreased low single digits with each demonstrating significant sequential positive momentum of approximately 250 basis points in the quarter. We expect continued positive momentum into Q4. In BDB, reagents and service, which represented about 75% of BDB revenues in Q3 grew a healthy mid-single digits, excluding the impact from the planned exit of a legacy platform. This was offset by a year-over-year decrease in instrument sales, driven by continued market dynamics in China and Europe. Sequentially, research instruments improved in the U.S. and EMEA by approximately 40% and 80%, respectively, driven by the launch of the FACSDiscover A8 with sales well ahead of our initial plans and strong demand heading into Q4.\nWhile research funding in Europe continue to be constrained within our prior expectations, the U.S. is showing early signs of stabilization in the academic and biopharma end markets.\nWhile year-over-year performance in Diagnostic Solutions reflects the decrease in our point-of-care business and in back tech due to the previous supply disruption, we are very encouraged by the sequential improvements that played out and expect the business to return to growth next quarter. In Q3, Bactec utilization increased over 20 percentage points sequentially, exiting the quarter at over 80% of historic levels and already in line with our Q4 planning assumptions. BD MAX IVD continued to grow double digits amid favorable reimbursement dynamics playing out in the molecular diagnostics space that are a growth tailwind for this platform. As these positive trends continue to take hold and temporary growth headwinds continue to fade, the Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business is on a sound trajectory back to its historic mid-single-digit plus growth rate. Rounding out the Life Sciences segment, year-over-year growth in specimen management was led by the BD Vacutainer portfolio, partially offset by China market dynamics.\nTurning to the P&L. We continued strong execution down the P&L and as a result, exceeded both our adjusted margin and earnings targets with Q3 adjusted operating income growing double digits and adjusted diluted EPS growing 5.1% to $3.68. We delivered strong adjusted gross margin of 54.8% and adjusted operating margin of 25.8%, which increased by 50 and 60 basis points year-over-year, respectively. Gross margin expansion continued to be primarily fueled by momentum in BD Excellence driven by manufacturing productivity, waste improvement and network optimization.\nFurther leverage in operating margin was driven by active management of shipping and G&A costs while investing in selling and marketing to drive growth. Regarding cash and capital allocation. Year-to-date free cash flows were approximately $1.7 billion, which increased sequentially by $1 billion. BD Excellence continue to drive productivity gains, allowing us to leverage capital expenditures. We also realized sequential cash benefits from improved collections and the timing of payables. This was partially offset by increased inventory levels and cash payments related to tariffs.\nWe ended the quarter with net leverage of 2.8x and continue to make progress towards our 2.5x net leverage target. We also see share repurchases as a value-creating opportunity given our view of the intrinsic value of BD. We expect to complete our $1 billion buyback by the end of September, which is ahead of our original commitment.\nMoving to our updated fiscal '25 guidance. Building off our Q3 performance, we reaffirmed our currency-neutral revenue guidance, including total revenue growth of 7.8% to 8.3% and organic revenue growth of 3% to 3.5%. While uncertainty from market headwinds continue to persist, we expect year-over-year organic growth to improve sequentially in Q4. This improvement is largely driven by the expected contribution from APM's organic growth and continued momentum in Bactec as well as a favorable comparison to the prior year in [indiscernible].\nRegarding foreign currency, based on current spot rates for illustrative purposes, we now expect translational FX to be immaterial or approximately a $10 million increase year-over-year to revenue. We raised our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.18 at the midpoint to a range of $14.30 to $14.45. This reflects growth of about 9.4% at the midpoint, which is an increase of approximately 1.4%, compared to our prior guidance and reflects strong Q3 performance and incremental Q4 investments in selling and marketing to accelerate our organic growth trajectory. Based on current spot rates, we expect the FX impact to EPS to be about neutral for the full year. Our EPS guidance continues to include an estimated tariff impact of about $90 million or 2% to EPS growth for the full year, which as a reminder, is predominantly weighted to Q4.\nFor the full fiscal year, given the strength of our continued gross margin expansion, including additional investments in selling and the impact from tariffs, we remain on track to deliver our goal of 25% operating margin by 2025. As you think about the full year impact of tariffs in fiscal 2026, the landscape remains fluid, but based on policies in place today, we currently anticipate a full year 2026 tariff impact of around $275 million. This is a notable improvement compared to initial expectations and reflects the results of our team's ongoing active mitigation efforts and tariff rates that moderated on a net basis since our last update.\nIn closing, we remain focused on navigating the current environment to deliver on our revenue and increased earnings commitments while positioning BD with continued momentum beyond 2025.\nWith that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you please assemble our queue?"

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on BD's Investor Relations website, investors.bd.com, or by phone at (800) 839 2385 for domestic calls and area code plus +1 (402) 220-7203 for international calls.\n[Operator Instructions] I will turn the call over to Greg Rodetis, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations.\n\nGreg Rodetis\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to BD's earnings call. I'm Greg Rodetis, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at bd.com. Earlier this morning, BD released its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The press release and presentation can be accessed on the IR website at investors.bd.com.\nLeading today's call are Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Chris DelOrefice, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nFollowing this morning's prepared remarks, Tom and Chris will be joining for Q&A by our segment presidents. Mike Garrison, President of the Medical segment; Mike Feld, President of the Life Sciences segment; and Rick Bird, President of the Interventional segment.\nBefore we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. You can read the disclaimer in our earnings release and the disclosures in our SEC filings available on the Investor Relations website.\nUnless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be made on a year-over-year basis versus the relevant fiscal period. Revenue percentage changes are on an FX-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. Tariff commentary is based on tariff policies as of April 30 and does not include any of the tariffs that have been announced, but currently are delayed or threatened, and we note that international trade policies, trade restrictions and tariffs are rapidly evolving, and there can be no assurance as to how the landscape may change and what the ultimate impact on our guidance and results of operations will be. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures are included in the appendices of the earnings release and presentation.\nWith that, I'm pleased to turn it over to Tom.\n\nThomas E. Polen\n\nPresident, Becton, Dickinson & Co.\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. My comments this morning will focus on our Q2 results and the strategic actions we are taking to not only navigate the near-term environment with agility, but to ensure BD is best positioned to deliver long-term value.\nStarting with our Q2 results, revenues came in below our expectations, growing 6% or 0.9% organic. This performance was largely attributable to market dynamics concentrated in life sciences, which reflects the change in research funding policy versus what was initially anticipated as well as a slower return to normal levels of blood culture testing in our diagnostics business. We are not satisfied with this quarter's top line growth and is not reflective of the mid-single-digit growth we have been consistently delivering over the last several years. I will share more on the decisive actions we are taking, including specific investments to reaccelerate organic sales growth in this dynamic market.\nImportantly, we were able to offset these challenges to exceed our adjusted EPS growth expectations as we continue to consistently execute and deliver strong performance down the P&L. Specifically, we delivered adjusted gross margins of 54.9%, which increased year-over-year by 190 basis points. Our strong margin performance is being fueled by momentum in BD Excellence, with now 4 consecutive quarters of strong gross margin expansion. We continue to scale BD Excellence across the organization, including nearly tripling the number of kaizens year-on-year, with over 600 completed year-to-date. As planned, we are now beginning to embed this system in our R&D and commercial operations, and just held our first-ever BD Excellence Leadership Summit 3 weeks ago.\nWe continue to see BD Excellence as a key catalyst to drive gross margin expansion over the next 5 years and support increasing growth investments in commercial programs and R&D. Chris will take you through our results in greater detail. However, I'd like to provide some additional color on our Q2 revenue performance. First, Bioscience performance was impacted by further reduction in global research funding. At the start of the year, our forecast assumed a depressed, but stable environment with modest improvement throughout the year. Q1 was directly aligned with those assumptions. However, as given changes in government policy, including the cuts to U.S. research grants announced in February, it's become clearer that pressure on research spending increased in Q2 and will likely persist through FY '25.\nThis has largely impacted research instrument sales. However, where instrument funding is available, our win rate has been strong, driven by high interest in our innovative FACS portfolio. And we are pleased that effective in April, we received our first export license to resume selling our high-parameter flowcytometers to China, following the U.S. government ban imposed in early January.\nFinally, on the reagent side, we are seeing continued growth, which we see as a good signal that customers are continuing to advance their research. We believe this business remains well positioned for growth as the market begins to stabilize.\nThe other key area where we experienced challenges was diagnostics with softness in our back tech blood culture business. If you recall, we experienced supplier challenges late last year. Our team has done a great job working with the supplier to get back to full production, and we have returned to historical inventory levels. However, customers who had been operating under allocation last year took conservation actions within the standard of care guidelines and have been slower than expected to move back to prior testing levels. We are partnering with our customers to accelerate this readoption.\nGiven these dynamics, we are adjusting our full year revenue guidance and now expect to deliver 3% to 3.5% organic growth. We don't take this change lightly and are acting decisively to address items within our control, and drive upside in areas of momentum to accelerate growth. Specifically as planned, Pharm Systems returned to growth in Q2, giving us confidence in second half growth where we expect performance to keep building driven by biologics and increased orders for GLP-1s. We're investing behind Alaris' strong momentum, and APM continues to be a key growth catalyst, which will contribute to organic growth as we anniversary the acquisition in Q4. We believe our interventional business is well positioned to deliver strong growth in the second half, fueled by continued momentum and additional commercial investments in PureWick and Phasix and our recent launch of Phasix Umbilical. Our innovation funnel is robust, and we have several new product launches planned in the back half, including FACSDiscover A8 and Central Vina 1, our rapid insertion central catheter.\nTurning to earnings for the balance of the year. Before considering the impacts of tariffs, strength down the P&L, including strong margin performance, is enabling us to offset our updated revenue expectations. Chris will go into greater detail on our updated guidance, including our tariff assumptions, but I'd like to provide some context for how we're navigating the current environment. First, we have a strong track record of effectively navigating macro challenges, including COVID and the supply chain and inflation headwinds that followed, driven by our advanced supply chain capabilities, regionalized manufacturing footprint and scaled leadership positions. We are applying these same strengths and operating approach to proactively navigate tariffs.\nSecond, BD is the largest U.S. manufacturer in med tech, with a U.S. network of 28 plants that produce over 10 billion devices each year. This puts BD in a strong position with nearly 80% of our U.S. revenue currently sourced from our U.S. manufacturing network or tariff exempt sources. To further strengthen our position and commitment to ensure a resilient U.S. health care system, today, we announced our intent to invest $2.5 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next 5 years.\nLooking at imports, less than 1% of U.S. revenue is sourced from China. Given this structure and current tariff policies, our most significant tariff exposure comes from China tariffs placed on products manufactured in the U.S. and exported to China. We are committed to leading through this challenge and are proactively driving mitigation actions that have already significantly reduced near-term tariff risk. As a result, we assume $90 million of tariff expense in FY '25.\nThird, we have identified and begun to act on additional steps to further mitigate the impact of tariffs beyond FY '25. These actions include shifting supply flows, optimizing supplier locations and leveraging dual sourcing options across our network. For example, we ship certain products such as vacutainers and flush from the U.S. to China that can also instead ship from our European plants to China, or we can accelerate transition to our China flush plant. As a global med tech leader, we remain committed to serving China's health care system and patients and to preserving our relationships and business.\nFinally, related to tariffs, we immediately put G&A focused cost containment measures in place. and are taking a balanced approach on pricing that recognizes the current cost pressures while closely partnering with our customers during this time of uncertainty.\nBD Excellence is also a differentiated capability in this environment as it enables us to protect margins and preserve investment to support innovation and growth.\nTurning to other key strategic initiatives. The separation process for our Biosciences and Diagnostics business is advancing well and on schedule. As we have shared previously, we believe this is a unique opportunity to create value, and interest has only increased since we announced the separation in February. We remain committed to maximizing shareholder value, and we'll share more details on the specific form of the transaction this summer.\nWe continue to make meaningful pipeline advances across several of our higher growth markets. In BD Interventional, we continue to expand into new advanced tissue regeneration applications with the launch of Phasix ST Umbilical, the first and only fully absorbable hernia solution designed specifically for umbilical hernias, one of the most common abdominal wall hernia procedures. The launch is off to a strong start.\nIn BD Medical, we continue to advance our connected care strategy and last week received the next 510(k) clearance for BD Alaris enhancements, including cybersecurity updates and clearance of the EtCO2 module. We also recently launched BD Nexus, our next-generation infusion pump designed for the EMEA region.\nFinally, in Life Sciences, we are on track to launch the first BD FACSDiscover analyzer, the A8, in just a few weeks, bringing our spectral and real-time imaging technology to an even wider range of scientists and applications. The feedback from pilot customers has been extremely positive.\nIn closing, we are acutely focused on managing our company to navigate the near-term environment and deliver improved growth levels in the back half of the year. The separation of our Biosciences and Diagnostics business remains on track, and we believe we will be well positioned as a pure-play med tech leader focused on attractive categories shaping the future of health care. BD Excellence has good momentum, a long runway of opportunity and has the potential to drive strong margin accretion and fuel investments in R&D and commercial. We believe this will enable BD to deliver sustainable, consistent profitable growth.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nChristopher J. DelOrefice\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Tom. Starting with some further insight into our Q2 revenue performance. Revenue grew 6% or 0.9% organic, As a reminder, organic growth includes a previously disclosed headwind of about 150 basis points from the outsized prior year licensing comparison in BDI, with the largest impact in UCC, followed by PI.\nAs Tom discussed, performance in Life Sciences was the main driver of lower-than-expected Q2 organic growth and resulted from lower Biosciences instrument demand, given changes in government policy focus and a slower recovery in our back tech blood culture business.\nOutside of Diagnostics and Biosciences, organic growth in our med tech business was 1.9%, which includes a headwind of approximately 170 basis points from the prior year licensing compare. Alaris performance remained strong, and we are pleased with the recent new clearance. We realized strength across many other key platforms. This includes double-digit growth in biologics, primarily GLP-1s, which led to Pharm Systems returned to growth this quarter, which is trending in line with our expectations for the full year.\nIn UCC, PureWick delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth with continued adoption of the male and female portfolios. PureWick male had its strongest quarter post launch, and PureWick Flex also continued its strong trajectory in the acute and direct-to-consumer at-home channel. In surgery, our hernia transformation strategy to move the standard of care from synthetic mesh to our Phasix bioresorbable mesh continue with strong market adoption and double-digit growth.\nLastly, underlying growth was strong across all PI platforms in the U.S., partially offset by volume-based procurement in China.\nRegionally, total company organic growth was led by performance in the U.S., Greater Asia outside of China and Latin America that was partially offset by a decline in EMEA and double-digit decrease in China as expected.\nTurning to our P&L results. We executed down the P&L, delivering well leveraged earnings growth and exceeding both our adjusted margin and earnings commitments, with Q2 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.35, growing 5.7%. We delivered strong adjusted gross margin of 54.9% and adjusted operating margin of 24.9%, which increased by 190 and 60 basis points year-over-year, respectively. Margin expansion continued to be fueled by momentum in BD Excellence driven by manufacturing productivity, supported by improved OEE, waste and network optimization. This enabled growth investments across SSG&A and R&D.\nRegarding cash and capital allocation, year-to-date, free cash flows were approximately $625 million. This reflects the timing of planned onetime cash payments. BD Excellence continues to drive productivity gains, allowing us to leverage capital expenditures. We've made strategic investments in inventory in the quarter to optimize the impact of tariffs within the year. As a reminder, our cash generation is weighted to the second half, given the timing of tax and other payments. And while we expect tariffs to have a modest impact on cash in the second half, we expect continued progress against our deleveraging commitments.\nWe ended the quarter with net leverage of 2.9x, which was in line with our expectation.\nWe also continue to see share repurchases as a value-creating deployment of capital, given our view of the intrinsic value of BD and remain committed to deploying $1 billion towards share repurchases by the end of the calendar year with $750 million repurchased year-to-date.\nMoving to our updated fiscal '25 guidance. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we remain focused on driving areas of momentum while reflecting the latest macro dynamics. We now expect currency-neutral total revenue growth of 7.8% to 8.3% and organic revenue growth of 3% to 3.5%. As we think about the quarterly split, we expect year-over-year organic growth to improve sequentially in Q3 to nearly 3% and further in Q4 due to the benefits of the key growth drivers Tom referenced earlier in his remarks as well as easing comps.\nRegarding foreign currency, based on current spot rates for illustrative purposes, we expect a headwind to revenue from translational currency of approximately $20 million for the full fiscal year, which is an improvement of approximately $230 million from our prior guidance view. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2025 total revenues to be in a range of $21.8 million to $21.9 billion.\nFor tax, we now expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 14% and 14.5%.\nBefore considering the impact associated with tariffs, we are maintaining our adjusted EPS of $14.30 to $14.60, which represents 10% growth at the midpoint inclusive of absorbing an FX headwind of about $0.05 or 40 basis points for the full year. Our strength down the P&L, largely driven by gross margin improvement, is fully offsetting the earnings impact, associated with our revised organic sales growth. There continues to be a high degree of uncertainty on the future of the tariff environment. We are focused on executing our strategy while also taking every action to mitigate tariffs and have made significant progress to date. Incorporating the mitigating actions we have taken and continue to execute, we estimate remaining tariff expense of about $90 million this fiscal year or $0.25, predominantly weighted to Q4. As a result, we now expect adjusted diluted EPS and to be in the range of $14.06 to $14.34, which reflects growth of about 8% at the midpoint, including a tariff impact of about 2%.\nFinally, as you think of Q3 margins, we expect continued strong adjusted gross margin levels or about flat year-over-year. Given our planned increases in selling and R&D investments, while maintaining G&A cost discipline, Q3 adjusted operating margin is expected to be about 24.5%.\nIn closing, we are focused on navigating the current environment to deliver our revenue with compelling adjusted EPS growth, inclusive of tariffs while positioning BD with continued momentum beyond 2025. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you please assemble our queue?"

Welcome to today's conference call to discuss BD's First Quarter fiscal 2025 Earnings and BD's announcement of its intent to separate BD's Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business from the rest of BD. At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on BD's Investor Relations website investors.bd.com or by phone at 1 (800) 839-2486 for domestic calls and area code (402) 220-7223 for international calls. [Operator Instructions].\nI will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Rodetis, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nGreg Rodetis\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to BD's earnings call, I'm Greg Rodetis, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at bd.com. We have a lot of exciting news to discuss today. Yesterday afternoon, we issued 2 press releases. The first discusses our first quarter results of fiscal '25. The second announces our intention to separate B's Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business. The press releases and accompanying presentations can be accessed on the IR website at investors.bet.com. For the purposes of today's call, we have posted a combined presentation and we'll be providing slide reference queues to assist you in following along with our prepared remarks.\nIn connection with the separation announcement, the company has decided to postpone its Investor Day previously scheduled for February 26, 2025, to allow BD to focus on the transaction. The company expects to provide a comprehensive update on strategy and outlook in the future closer to the separation. Leading today's call are Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Chris DelOrefice, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nFollowing this morning's prepared remarks, Tom and Chris will be joined for Q&A by our segment presidents, Mike Garrison, President of the Medical segment; Mike Feld, President of the Life Sciences segment; and Rick Berg, President of the Interventional segment.\nBefore we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. You can read the disclaimer in our earnings release and disclosures in our SEC filings available on the Investor Relations website. Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be made on a year-over-year basis for a solvent fiscal period. Revenue percentage changes are on an FX-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures are included in the appendices of the earnings release and presentations.\nWith that, let's turn to Slide 5, and I am very pleased to turn it over to Tom.\n\nThomas E. Polen\n\nPresident, Becton, Dickinson & Co.\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We have a number of significant updates to share on how we are creating value through our BD 2025 strategy. This includes yesterday's announcement of the planned separation of our Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business, our strong Q1 results, updated fiscal 2025 guidance and progress on our innovation pipeline. So let's jump right in.\nStarting with our Q1 results. We continue to demonstrate strong execution, exceeding each of our financial goals. This includes 9.6% revenue growth or 3.9% organic. We delivered 370 and 340 basis points of adjusted gross and operating margin expansion, respectively and 28% growth in adjusted diluted EPS to $3.43.\nChris will provide more color on our Q1 results, but I'd like to take a moment to thank our team, whose execution and momentum of BD Excellence is powering continued strong margin expansion, earnings and cash flow performance. We returned over $1 billion to shareholders in Q1. This includes $300 million in dividends and a $750 million accelerated share buyback, which we see as a value-creating action based on our view of BD's intrinsic value. With strong operational performance in Q1 and confidence in the year, we affirmed our full year currency neutral and organic revenue growth guidance. Our Q1 outperformance enables us to derisk growth expectations for the second half and also raised the midpoint of our reported EPS guidance despite incremental translational currency impacts.\nMoving to Slide 6. Innovation is core to our growth strategy, and we continue to make strong progress against our pipeline. I'd like to share an update on some key milestones. In BD Medical, we continue to progress our connected care strategy and as planned, submitted the next 510(k) for our BD Alaris infusion system that enables over-the-air software updates and includes a new EtCO2 module, BD Alaris is the only infusion system with an integrated EtCO2 module, enhancing patient safety by monitoring their respiratory system and pausing the pump when necessary to reduce the risk of opioid overdose. The pace and impact of innovation also continues to be strong in advanced patient monitoring, where we received 510(k) clearance on the next-gen HemoSphere Alta Monitor and the new Swan IQ and ForeSight IQ smart sensors. In BDI, we continue to advance our strategy in advanced tissue regeneration and expand into new applications. Most recently, we received EU approval for the prevention of incisional hernias using the Phasix resorbable mesh. This makes Phasix the first resorbable mesh with a broad indication for preventing incisional hernias. Our U.S. trial remains underway. We also enrolled the first patients in our GalaFLEX Capsular contraction prevention clinical trial. This product is BD's first in a series of new innovations using our resorbable biomaterial to improve outcomes in patients undergoing breast surgery.\nFinally, in Life Sciences, we continue to advance our strong cycle of innovation and remain on track to launch the first BD Fax Discover analyzer, the A8 in the second half of this fiscal year. Additionally, in our molecular diagnostics portfolio, we're continuing to advance our position in the $2 billion high-volume molecular testing market. Our Baton Clarity HPV assay is the only test with extended genotyping to be FDA-approved for self-collection and we're seeing accelerating sales funnel momentum as a result of recent changes in U.S. cervical cancer screening guidelines and increased U.S. reimbursement.\nBefore I turn it over to Chris to provide further color on our financials and outlook, I want to again express my appreciation of our team's strong work in advancing our BD 2025 strategy, a strong quarter and for what's ahead. Chris?\n\nChristopher J. DelOrefice\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Tom. Echoing Tom's comments, I'm truly excited about our plan to separate Biosciences and diagnostic solutions, it's an exciting next step in our strategy that we believe can unlock significant value for both new BD and Biosciences and Diagnostic solutions. Both businesses will be positioned to thrive in their respective markets and deliver value for all stakeholders, shareholders, employees and of course, our customers and the patients they serve.\nLet me start on Slide 7 and our Q1 results. Strong execution drove revenue, margin and earnings ahead of our expectations. Q1 revenue grew 9.6% and were 3.9% organic. Organic growth was led by tech business with about 5% growth driven by volumes and share gains across core devices, and strong performance in our growth platforms, including double-digit growth in PureWick, peripheral vascular disease and phasic. Diagnostic Solutions grew modestly as strength in lab automation and momentum in BD MAX molecular platform, IVD assays was partially offset by reparatory season timing. Q1 performance also reflects the expected decline in Biosciences, given market dynamics, the reduced research funding in China and the U.S. Regionally, total company organic growth was led by strong performance in the U.S. and was partially offset by the decrease in China, predominantly in Biosciences.\nTo allow time to share our perspective on the separation of Biosciences and diagnostic solutions and have sufficient time for Q&A, please refer to the slides accompanying today's call for additional performance details by segment.\nTurning to our P&L results. Q1 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.43 in grew 28%, driven by strong operational performance ahead of our expectations and the timing of a discrete tax item that was contemplated in our full year tax rate. Consistent with our commitments we delivered strong margin to start the year with adjusted gross margin of 54.8% and adjusted operating margin of 23.6%, up 370 and 340 basis points year-over-year, respectively, both ahead of our expectations and fueled by momentum and BD excellence. Strong margin performance continued to enable outsized investments in selling and R&D to drive growth. Regarding cash and capital allocation. Free cash flow of approximately $600 million was in line with our expectations and was impacted by the timing of planned onetime cash payments. Full year cash flow continues to be in line with our prior expectations.\nIn the quarter, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders, including dividends, and a $750 million accelerated share repurchase. Cash and short-term investments at December 31 totaled $728 million. We ended the quarter with net leverage of 2.9x and are on track to meet our deleveraging commitments.\nTurning to Slide 8 and our updated fiscal '25 guidance. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we remain focused on driving areas of momentum and continue to monitor transitory market dynamics, notably in China and Biosciences research funding levels. We are maintaining our currency-neutral total and organic revenue growth guidance. Regarding foreign currency, based on current spot rates for illustrative purposes, we expect a headwind to revenue from translational currency of approximately $250 for the full fiscal year which is an increase of approximately $200 million from our prior guidance view. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2025 total revenues to be in a range of $21.7 million to $21.9 billion.\nFor tax, we now expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 14% and 15.25%. On the strength of our Q1 performance, particularly our margin execution and our confidence in the full year, we are increasing the midpoint of our fiscal 2025 adjusted reported EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted reported EPS of $14.30 to $14.60, which reflects growth of 10% at the midpoint. Our updated EPS guidance reflects an operational increase of $0.175 that is absorbing $0.15 of estimated incremental translational currency. As you think about phasing over the balance of fiscal '25, the following are some considerations. Q1 revenue performance allows us to further derisk our second half growth by about 25 basis points. Our expectation for the first half organic revenue growth remains largely unchanged versus our prior expectations with some timing of revenues shifted into Q1. As a reminder, Q2 includes the comparison to prior year licensing revenue, which creates a headwind of nearly 150 basis points. Excluding licensing, our Q2 organic revenue growth expectation reflects sequential acceleration that is around the midpoint of our full year organic guidance range. We expect strong gross and operating margins in Q2 and with solid sequential improvement in adjusted operating margin were about flat year-over-year, inclusive of absorbing the planned licensing comparison. Our updated expectation for Q2 adjusted EPS reflects timing impacts from our updated translational FX assumptions and a tax rate of about 16.8% and which assumes a ratable rest of year tax rate.\nIn summary, our strategy is demonstrating strong momentum, and we are delivering on our commitments.\nI will now turn it back to Tom, starting on Slide 10 to provide further detail on the exciting news announcing our intention to separate our Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business.\n\nThomas E. Polen\n\nPresident, Becton, Dickinson & Co.\n\nThank you, Chris. Building off our strong performance in the quarter, I'd like to share more details about our plan to separate BD's Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business to enhance strategic focus, drive growth through targeted capital deployment and unlock significant value for what will become the new BD and the separated business. This separation decision was the result of a comprehensive business portfolio evaluation launched in early 2024. And this is the next natural step of our evolution, building on the strong foundation and momentum of BD 2025 and the high-growth platforms we've built and have been scaling. The new BD will be well positioned as a pure-play med tech company with leading positions in large, attractive end markets. With this added focus, we're excited about the opportunity for new BD to drive concentrated capital deployment in high-impact R&D as well as growth accretive M&A, which positions us to deliver differentiated and durable growth rates in med tech. At the same time, we're also excited about the opportunity for Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions to realize its full market potential as a pure-play leader in life science tools and diagnostics continuing to accelerate growth through its strong innovation pipeline and industry-leading solutions.\nAs we turn to Slide 11, let me start by setting some context on why this is the next natural step in our evolution, building on the strong foundation and momentum of BD 2025. Over the past 5 years, we've been transforming into a faster growing, more profitable organization positioned at the forefront of long-term growth trends. We've been systematically increasing our WAMGR and long-term growth by intentionally shifting our portfolio mix towards higher growth markets and executing against a strong innovation pipeline. In fact, by the end of this year, we're on track to have more than doubled new product revenue since the launch of BD 2025. We established and honed our M&A and divestiture capabilities. deploying about $7 billion in capital to complete 20 value-creating transactions since 2020. These include the spin-off of eMBECTA, the sale of our Surgical Instruments business, the Mueller and the acquisitions of the Edwards Life Sciences Critical Care product group, ProdaSystems, StrobMedical, TFA and others. We created an embedded BD excellence simplifying our operations and enabling us to deliver on aggressive long-term margin expansion markets. Through our disciplined capital deployment strategy, we've built significant balance sheet capacity and strengthen cash flows, allowing us to both invest in our business and return capital to shareholders through competitive dividends, value-creating tuck-in M&A and share repurchases. This was all achieved while advancing our quality systems and putting customer centricity at the heart of how we plan and operate throughout BD. We've achieved 70% reduction in nonconformances and a 25% reduction in field actions since launching BD 2025.\nMoving on to Slide 12. We have also built and have been scaling multiple new growth platforms as part of BD 2025. These platforms are directly linked to the most critical areas of health care, such as connected care and new care settings and addressing chronic diseases and are some of the platforms which will reshape our growth profile for the long term. Over 25% of BD revenue now comes from platforms that are growing high single digits or more and this is just the beginning as we continue to expand our exposure to higher growth categories.\nMoving to Slide 13. We are well on track to exceed every financial target established at our 2021 Analyst Day. And we have outperformed historical averages. In November 2021, we targeted a base organic revenue CAGR of 5.5% plus through 2025. Based on the midpoint of this year's guidance, we expect to deliver 5.9%. We targeted an increase of base operating margins by 400 basis points through 2025. And in fiscal year 2022, we increased the target to 540 basis points. We are on track to deliver 560 basis points of margin expansion to margins of 25% plus. We also targeted double-digit base adjusted EPS CAGR and now expect to be well over double digits at 13.8%.\nOn to Slide 14. This track record creates momentum as we move into our next phase of value creation and positions both new BD and the Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business to focus and win in attractive growth categories. Let me start by sharing a perspective on the profile of the new BD. The new company will be a med tech leader with scale and global reach across the $70 billion plus addressable market growing at about 5%. Each day, new BD will touch more patients than any other med tech company in the world, including over 90% of patients admitted to a U.S. hospital. We expect new BD will have an accelerating growth profile attractive margins and a best-in-class recurring revenue profile of over 90%. The separation will also enable enhanced focus with targeted investment and a tailored capital deployment strategy towards attractive high-growth categories. This will be complemented by our strong execution, driving continued margin expansion and cash generation through BD excellence. As I look over at the Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business, it's expected to be a leader across an attractive $22 billion-plus addressable market, growing at mid- to high single digits. We expect the business to have a highly attractive growth and margin profile with more than 80% revenue. It will also have an opportunity to further accelerate its strong innovation pipeline in markets with significant growth potential and realize its full market potential as a pure-play life science tools and diagnostics business.\nTurning to Slide 15. Let's go deeper on the new BD a $17.8 billion med tech leader.\nOn to Slide 16. We plan to organize new BD into 4 operating segments, each being market leaders in attractive end markets with significant headroom for growth.\nFirst, Medical Essentials will consist of our medication delivery solutions and specimen management businesses that truly represent the backbone of health care delivery. These are our products such as IV catheters, picks, flush, syringes, IV sets and blood collection systems. We are the market leader in each of these spaces, manufacturing tens of billions of devices each year, resulting in durable recurring revenue and strong cash generation.\nSecond, Connected Care will include our Medication Management Solutions business, which includes our pharmacy automation platform and our advanced patient monitoring business with millions of smart devices that use automation, artificial intelligence and analytics to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of patient care and creates compelling growth potential in new areas.\nThird, biopharma systems will bring a new name and increased focus to our Pharmaceutical Systems business unit, which is the global leader in biologic drug delivery developing and manufacturing drug delivery devices for the pharmaceutical industry. Biopharma systems is uniquely positioned to enable the transition to more biologics, including GLP-1 treatments, and capitalize on the large growth potential of pharmaceutical industry trends as more drug launches rely on patient self-injection.\nFourth is the Interventional segment, which will include our Urology and Critical Care, peripheral intervention and surgery businesses that advance the treatment of high-burden chronic conditions such as urinary incontinence, peripheral vascular disease, cancer, and tissue reconstruction, all of which are high-growth categories with attractive margin profiles and meaningful headroom for new innovation. We'll share more about timing of this new segment structure as we near completion of the transaction.\nOn to Slide 17. We have an exciting and robust innovation pipeline across the new BD segments with a significant number of $50 million-plus revenue opportunities, fueling above-market performance. The new BD will have a meaningful runway for additional new innovation and growth, both organically and through growth-accretive tuck-in M&A.\nIn conclusion, as we turn to Slide 18, New BD will deliver a durable and differentiated mid-single-digit growth profile supported by attractive end markets and best-in-class recurring revenue. We will continue to systematically increase WAMGR through disciplined capital allocation and our BD Excellence operating system will continue to enable investments in growth and meaningful margin expansion, with the majority being realized from gross margin. And our targeted financial profile will support strong earnings growth and value creation.\nLet's move to Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions on Slide 19. We are excited by the opportunity this separation has to unlock meaningful value for customers, the business and shareholders.\nTurning to Slide 20. The opportunity here is an attractive $22 billion-plus addressable segment. The businesses have strong portfolios and pipelines and are positioned well for growth. Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions operate in a market growing mid- to high single digits, with more than 80% recurring revenue an expected 30% adjusted EBITDA margins.\nNow turning to Slide 21. Each of these businesses are leaders in large attractive markets. Biosciences had $1.5 billion in FY '24 revenue, addressing a $7 billion-plus market with 6% to 7% category growth. Diagnostic Solutions had $1.8 billion in FY '24, addressing a $15 billion-plus market with about 6% to 7% category growth.\nAs we turn to Slide 22, a Biosciences is the undisputed pioneer that created the modern field of flow cytometry, helping scientists revolutionize our understanding of cell biology in the fields of cancer, infectious disease and immune health and enabling countless breakthrough therapies. Scientists and clinicians around the world continue to rely on our flow cytometry platforms and to enable the next generation of discoveries, including through our new fax Discover flow cytometry platform. Biosciences has a very strong innovation pipeline of future fax Discover instruments new antibodies, dies and assays. This includes continuing to scale our single-cell multiomics platforms with a significant increase in commercial head count to support strong double-digit growth. Moving to Diagnostic Solutions. This business is a pioneer in microbiology research and clinical diagnostics with multiple world firsts in advancing the diagnosis of conditions such as sepsis, TB, COVID and other infections and in applying robotics and AI to advance infectious disease testing. This primarily comprised of our microbiology and molecular diagnostics platforms. which both have strong innovation pipelines. Our molecular portfolio is among the leaders in the high-growth molecular market and is anchored by the BD core high throughput and BD MAX medium throughput systems. Our BD core plus our Onclarity HPV assays offer a complete paradigm shift in cervical cancer screening, and it starts with the ease of self-collection. Overall, this business is well positioned to create value under multiple types of separation structures where the investments and deployment of capital are entirely focused on the life science industry.\nTurning to Slide 23. Now I want to talk more about the milestones of the separation.\nMoving into Slide 24. In terms of the form the separation could take. We are committed to exploring all opportunities to execute the separation in a manner that maximizes shareholder value. Separation options include a Reverse Morris Trust, sale, spin-off or other transactions. We expect to announce more specifics on the separation plans by the end of fiscal 2025 and are targeting to complete the transaction in fiscal 2026. As the company pursues the separation, we remain focused on execution and continuing to operate the Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions businesses. and the other BD businesses consistent with our BD 2025 strategy, including continued investments in commercial growth, innovation, M&A, and other initiatives that are part of the company's multiyear strategic operating plan.\nFinally, turning to Slide 25. We are excited about what the future holds for new BD and the Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions businesses. As we established 2 strategically aligned entities with mission-critical portfolios to maximize impact.\nIn summary, we believe the separation has the potential to unlock value through simplification, enhanced focus and tailored investment in capital allocation. We believe new BD will have an enhanced strategic focus in growth-oriented portfolio that positions the company for long-term value creation. And as a pure-play life science tools and diagnostics business, we believe biosciences and diagnostic solutions will realize its full market potential while continuing to accelerate growth. In the meantime, we continue to execute against our fiscal year 2025 plan as seen in our Q1 performance.\nThank you for joining and for your continued interest and support. I look forward to our next chapter and to sharing more specific details upon formalizing the core of the transaction DI. With that, we'll open it up to questions."

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on BD's Investor Relations website at investors.bd.com or by phone at (800) 839-2385 for domestic calls and area code +1 (402) 220-7203 for international calls. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Greg Rodetis, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nGreg Rodetis\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to BD's earnings call. I'm Greg Rodetis, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at bd.com. Earlier this morning, BD releases results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The press release and presentation can be accessed on the IR website at investors.bd.com.\nLeading today's call are Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Chris DelOrefice, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following this morning's prepared remarks, Tom and Chris will be joined for Q&A by our segment presidents: Mike Garrison, President of the Medical segment; and Rick Byrd, President of the Interventional segment.\nBefore we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. You can read the disclaimer in our earnings release and the disclosures in our SEC filings available on the Investor Relations website. Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis versus the relevant fiscal period. Revenue percentage changes are on an FX-neutral basis unless otherwise noted.\nReconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures are included in the appendices of the earnings release and presentation. Specifically, during the quarter, we recorded accruals resulting from recent developments relating primarily to the Italian government medical device payback legislation, which essentially relates to years prior to the current fiscal year. We are presenting adjusted revenues, excluding the impact of these accruals.\nWith that, I am very pleased to turn it over to Tom.\n\nThomas E. Polen\n\nPresident, Becton, Dickinson & Co.\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We continue to make excellent progress advancing our BD 2025 strategy. This quarter demonstrates the durability of our portfolio and strength of new innovations, delivering mid-single-digit organic revenue growth of 5.2%. Growth was broad-based and reflects strong volume and share gains across the portfolio. Our team executed very well through transitory market dynamics in BDB and [ PS ] and macro factors in China.\nWe continue to grow above the market and believe we are extremely well positioned as these markets recover. We have growing momentum from our BD Excellence operating system that enabled us to deliver significant sequential and year-over-year adjusted gross margin increases. This drove strong operating margin expansion contributed to over 18% adjusted earnings per share growth and is allowing us to raise our earnings guidance once again. Our team's excellent execution also drove over 100% year-to-date growth in free cash flow, reaching over 80% free cash flow conversion year-to-date, with margins, earnings and cash flow all ahead of plan.\nAs a reminder, our strategy consists of 3 pillars: driving growth through innovation and tuck-in M&A, simplifying through BD Excellence, and empowering our organization with the capabilities and systems to deliver on our strategy. I'd like to provide updates on each of these this morning.\nStarting with our growth pillar and the Critical Care acquisition. Things continue to progress well towards a successful close and as we've gotten to know more members of their team, we only become more excited to welcome them to the BD family. Critical Care significantly advances our connected care strategy to use AI and digital tools to help clinicians deliver more efficient and higher quality care. Additionally, it adds a high-growth business that is immediately accretive to margins and earnings.\nTurning to several of our most significant long-term growth drivers. To begin with, our connected medication management strategy has strong momentum, with Q3 setting another new all-time record for the number of Alaris pumps shipped in a quarter. The scale of upgrading our fleet is unprecedented, and I'm very proud of the work our teams are doing to support our loyal customer base and deliver ahead of our commitments. Customer feedback has been very positive, and we gained a market position in the quarter. We are now back at our historical quarterly run rate of about $100 million and have built a healthy committed contract backlog, which puts us in a position to be above our historical run rate for FY '25.\nOur connected medication management portfolio, which includes Alaris, is just one example of how BD is at the forefront of combining AI, automation and robotics to improve the core processes that run health care. Through our strategy, BD is advancing our leadership in automating the pharmacy, the medication management process and the microbiology lab. Today, BD has a $4 billion-plus business in health care automation and informatics AI, and we'll increase this to over $5 billion as we complete the acquisition of Critical Care. This expands BD in the smart critical care space and creates new opportunities to combine AI-driven monitoring with systems such as infusion technologies to simplify nursing workflow and improve patient care.\nLooking ahead to 2030, we view health care process automation and informatics AI as having the potential to become a business exceeding $7 billion as we continue to build more connected, automated and intelligent solutions to transform the core processes underlying care delivery.\nTurning to other key platforms. Q3 was the 28th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our PureWick platform. In our recently launched next-generation female external catheter, PureWick Flex, is expected to support this continued momentum. PureWick Flex delivers improved performance for a wider range of body types, both in acute and home care settings. Given the incredible response from the first PureWick Flex users, we couldn't be more excited about the impact this will have on patients and their providers. As I think about PureWick overall, we see this as having the potential to become a $1 billion franchise by 2030, continuing its double-digit growth momentum.\nWe're also advancing our impact in immune health in oncology, continuing the super cycle of innovation within BD Biosciences, which positions it well as a long-term growth driver. Coming off the landmark BD FACSDiscover S8 Cell Sorter launch in FY '23, we recently released additional 3 and 4 laser configurations, which contain the same new-to-world BD SpectralFX and BD CellView technologies, enabling new discoveries in a broader range of fields. We expect to continue our innovation cadence with our FY '25 launch of the BD FACSDiscover A8 Analyzer, which will provide customers high-throughput sample analysis with the same innovative technologies.\nThe combination of BD FACSDiscover and our BD RealBlue and RealYellow reagents were used in the world's first 50 color flow cytometry experiment, which was published this year in the Journal of Cytometry. This serves as a testament to these groundbreaking new technologies.\nThe immune health and oncology space [ remains ] a primary focus for research and as the market returns to growth, we believe a leading technology and portfolio position us well to capitalize on future opportunities in this space.\nFinally, within our Pharmaceutical Systems business, in Q3, biologics drug delivery continued to grow double digits. Biologics now represent over 40% of our total Pharmaceutical Systems revenue and we see it as a significant growth opportunity, including GLP-1s.\nSince the start of BD 2025, we've been implementing a strategy to enhance our innovation leadership, expand our manufacturing scale and prioritize quality excellence to be the preferred partner for biologic drug delivery. And we believe that no other company in med tech is better positioned than BD to capitalize on this trend.\nFirst, the majority of biologics that use a prefilled syringe have and continue to be launched in the BD [ device ]. Since 2023, BD has been the chosen partner for 19 out of the 23 new biologic drug approvals that use a prefilled syringe. Second, as we consider the significant clinical potentials of GLP-1s, the strength of BD's innovation in this category, and our previously announced capacity expansion, we view GLP-1 drug delivery as a potential $1 billion product category by 2030.\nToday, we serve multiple market leaders, have device contracts with multiple novel GLP-1 therapies advancing through clinical trials and beyond novel molecules, we now have over 40 signed GLP-1 biosimilar agreements across our [ pen ], auto-injector and syringe platforms. We are actively supporting biosimilars for early generation GLP-1s that are entering the market over the next 12 months.\nOutside of GLP-1s, our customers are working to develop next-generation biologics that have the potential to revolutionize care and conditions like Alzheimer's, certain immunological disorders and types of cancer. Many of these are extremely complex molecules and proteins that will involve significantly greater volumes for injection and higher viscosity compared to therapies presently available in the market.\nAt the same time, we see the trends to enable patient self treatment that point to the need for wearable on-body injectors. We've developed the BD Libertas and BD Evolve wearable injectors to support the unique delivery needs of these therapies. We're actively supporting multiple customers testing their pipeline molecules with our wearable solutions and have provided product to support their clinical trials. While this is a longer-term opportunity that we expect to develop in line with drug development time lines, we believe we are well positioned for this future trend and are getting very positive feedback on our platforms.\nMoving to our simplification strategy and BD Excellence. First, let me express my gratitude to everyone in our organization who is accelerating BD Excellence through our global supply chain, through the completion of over 500 Kaizen events this year. I especially like to thank those working in our manufacturing plants and warehouses to improve product quality and reliability for our customers this year while delivering double-digit improvements in both waste reduction and production yield. We are seeing the outcomes of BD Excellence in accelerating margin progression and delivering strong cash flow.\nOur plans to reduce our manufacturing network by over 20% remain on track. And as we are consolidating our plant architecture, we're investing in smart factories. Our top 30 sites are already accelerating performance, leveraging smart automation and digital capabilities such as predictive analytics. We're excited about the opportunity to further accelerate manufacturing productivity through the combination of BD Excellence and our smart factory strategy.\nThe momentum in our simplification programs, including BD Excellence, positions us for success as we finish FY '24 and as we look ahead to FY '25 and beyond.\nLastly, we continue to empower our organization through strong corporate responsibility and recently issued our FY '23 Corporate Sustainability Report. Notably, in FY '23, we reduced Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, 18% versus our FY '19 baseline, surpassing our goal of 13%. We doubled the number of sites using green electric power and solar power and we reduced our water usage by 21% and waste by 18% over the same time frame.\nIn summary, we delivered above-market mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and significant margin expansion and cash flow generation. On the strength in the quarter, we are once again raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for fiscal 2024 and believe we are well positioned for continued strong financial performance next year. We have leadership positions in many of the most significant trends reshaping health care, positioning us well in FY '25 and beyond.\nI'll now turn it over to Chris to review our financials and outlook.\n\nChristopher J. DelOrefice\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, the quarter's results reflect strong performance across multiple parts of our portfolio, even amid the previously noted transitory market dynamics and macro factors. Importantly, with strong execution of our BD Excellence programs, we exceeded our margin, earnings and cash flow goals.\nI'll now provide some further insight into our adjusted revenue performance. Q3 revenue grew 5.2% organic, driven by volume growth and share gains. Regionally, over 90% of our revenue, which includes our 3 largest geographies, grew 6% plus organic. This strong performance was partially offset by a decrease in China from continued market dynamics. BD Medical growth was led by MMS with exceptional performance in infusion systems, driven by the BD Alaris return to market and higher utilization of infusion sets, partially offset by a tough prior year comparison in dispensing. Broad volume growth and share gains across our MDS consumable portfolio in developed markets also contributed to the segment's growth.\nPharm Systems had another quarter of increasing demand with double-digit growth in prefilled devices for biologic drugs, primarily GLP-1s. This growth was offset by transitory market dynamics across the industry, including expected customer inventory destocking. BD Life Sciences performance was led by IDS with high single-digit growth in specimen management, which reflects both increased utilization and customer upgrades to higher-value products to provide an enhanced patient experience. The segment's growth was partially offset by transitory market dynamics in biosciences that resulted in lower market demand for instruments. Given our leading portfolio in instruments and reagents, we significantly outperformed the category in the quarter.\nStrong organic growth in BD Interventional was led by high single-digit growth in UCC with continued momentum in our PureWick franchise, delivering another quarter of double-digit growth. Surgery delivered another strong quarter across all 3 major platforms with double-digit organic growth across advanced repair and reconstruction, infection prevention and biosurgery. We continue to make excellent progress with conversion to our bioresorbable Phasix technology, which we see as a durable contributor to future growth. BDI performance was also supported by peripheral intervention with double-digit growth in peripheral vascular disease that was partially offset by a decrease in oncology, driven primarily by market dynamics in China.\nNow moving to our P&L. We realized strong sequential and year-over-year margin improvement with adjusted gross margin of 54.3% and adjusted operating margin of 25.2%, both above our expectations. The gross margin year-over-year increase of 170 basis points was primarily driven by increased productivity and cost improvement from our BD Excellence initiatives, and moderating inflation. Our operating margin increased by 220 basis points year-over-year, driven by the increase in gross margin and healthy operating expense leverage with expenses increasing slightly on a dollar basis year-over-year.\nAs a result of these items, we exceeded our Q3 operating income and adjusted diluted EPS expectations, resulting in adjusted diluted EPS of $3.50, which grew double digits or 18.2% on a reported basis.\nRegarding our cash and capital allocation, I'm really pleased with our strategic choices and the execution on cash flow. As a result, year-to-date free cash flow increased $1.2 billion year-over-year to $2.2 billion reflecting continued improvement in working capital, including continued inventory optimization, planned phasing certain cash flow items, and the ability to leverage our capital expenditures as we benefit from BD Excellence productivity gains.\nWe remain focused on free cash flow conversion and are on track to deliver another double-digit step improvement in fiscal year '24, with our year-to-date free cash flow conversion above 80%, and we remain well positioned to achieve our long-term cash goals.\nNet leverage improved to 2.4x, and cash and short-term investments totaled $5.3 billion, inclusive of about $3.4 billion in proceeds from the February debt refinancing and the Critical Care acquisition financing in June.\nMoving to our updated guidance for fiscal year '24. The detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can be found in our presentation. As we look ahead, we are confident in a strong close to fiscal year '24. We remain focused on driving multiple areas of momentum and share gains across our portfolio, including Alaris.\nFor the full year, even with this broad-based momentum, it is prudent for us to reflect the latest market dynamics, which others are also experiencing. As a result, we now expect organic revenue growth to be 5% to 5.25% for the full year. Based on the strength of our margin performance, we were able to absorb the revised organic revenue growth guidance and are raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range to $13.05 to $13.15 on a reported basis. This reflects an increase of $0.05 at the midpoint and $0.10 at the bottom of the range.\nWe believe we are well positioned to achieve our updated adjusted operating margin guidance of over 50 basis points improvement which implies full year adjusted operating margins of over 24%. We continue to expect margin acceleration in Q4, driven by our BD Excellence and continuous improvement efforts and continued expense leverage on our expected strong revenue performance, including Alaris.\nLooking ahead to fiscal year '25. While it's too early to provide guidance as we are in our planning process, I can offer the following thoughts. We are continuing to monitor dynamics in select markets. Even in an environment where these dynamics continue to exist, we are confident in delivering strong performance, particularly our ability to exceed our 25% adjusted operating margin goal and deliver double-digit EPS growth, given the increasing benefit to gross margin from accelerating BD Excellence momentum. We think 10% EPS growth would be a good starting point for fiscal year '25, including Critical Care and the expected impact of Pillar 2.\nSo in summary, based on the durability of our portfolio and momentum in Alaris, we are confident in delivering another year of strong growth. Our team's execution supported overdelivering on our margin expectations. And as a result, as we enter Q4, we are on track to exceed our full year margin improvement goals, deliver another year of double-digit free cash flow growth and once again increase our fiscal year '24 earnings outlook. Our strategy is demonstrating positive momentum and we remain well positioned to continue to deliver on our BD 2025 value creation objectives.\nWith that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you please assemble our queue?"

Margin performance drove adjusted EPS ahead of our expectations and consistent with our plan, we delivered very strong cash flow and are on track to deliver another year of double-digit free cash flow growth. These results give us the confidence to once again increase our FY '24 adjusted guidance.\nTurning to our BD2025 strategy. We continue to execute well on the actions we outlined at our Investor Day to drive profitable growth and value creation. This includes advancing our innovation pipeline, which supports our durable 5.5% plus targeted growth profile. One such area is the strong cadence of new innovation across our connected medication management suite, which delivers many unique benefits to our customers.\nQ2 was the second full quarter since clearance of our new Alaris system and first half Alaris sales have already eclipsed our total FY '23 performance. Our return to market is ramping faster than initially planned, which wouldn't be possible without our manufacturing team who have executed extremely well in scaling Alaris production. Q2 set an all-time record in both the number of BD Alaris pumps manufactured and the number of pumps shipped in the quarter to upgrade our customers to the cleared version of the pump.\nWe have also seen acceleration of committed contracts, inclusive of competitive conversions as health systems value the capability of Alaris and look to standardize their fleet. This offers confidence in the planned second half contribution to growth and will support momentum heading into FY '25. The Alaris 510(k) clearance is just the beginning. As we have shared, we are excited about our innovation road map, and we are planning upcoming Alaris 510(k) submissions to further strengthen our capabilities, like best-in-class interoperability with over 800 live sites, introduce a steady flow of new customer innovations and ensure continuous compliance.\nExamples such as over-the-air technology for efficient software updates and continued advanced cybersecurity are planned in the next submission later this calendar year. Beyond Alaris, we have a market-leading connected medication management portfolio across inventory management, compounding pharmacy automation, medication dispensing and infusion and are excited about future innovations and development.\nThis includes new medication dispensing and informatics innovation, including the next generation of our Pyxis dispensing platform, which innovates on our hardware design and will advance our cloud connectivity. We continue to scale our BD Health sites informatics platform now live in over 1,000 sites and have upcoming launches to integrate hospital medication data from Pyxis with non-acute medication data from our Med bank and Med keeper platforms, to bring visibility to medication flows across the customers care network.\nIn Q2, we made meaningful progress achieving other key R&D milestones, including several in our peripheral vascular disease platform, which is one of our key growth areas. Longer term, these technologies are each expected to deliver over $50 million in incremental fifth year revenue and will broaden our leadership in the $5 billion PVD category that is growing high single digits.\nIn our venous portfolio, we have now enrolled over 60 patients in our Arch pivotal IDE for our BD Liberty Tip stent graft. This novel self-expanding covered stent improves the standard of care for portal hypertension. Building on our success in launching venous products that help deliver better clinical outcomes for patients and strengthening our presence in the venous market.\nIn our arterial portfolio, we enrolled the first patient in our Agility pivotal IDE study for our low-profile arterial stent graft, a differentiated technology that minimizes access site complications with precise stent placement that could provide an important new treatment option for over 18 million patients with peripheral arterial disease in the U.S. alone.\nWe also filed our SiON SFA pivotal IDE submission with the FDA for our new sirolimus DCB for the treatment of PAD. We see this new alternative drug platform as a key growth catalyst for both SFA and below-the-knee applications. We are also executing well on our simplification strategy to drive margin expansion. We are seeing growing momentum as we scale our BD Excellence operating system and build world-class lean management systems and culture throughout BD. This drove strong Q2 performance in areas such as waste reduction and production efficiency, contributing to our margin goals.\nOur focus on cash flow also continues to deliver positive results, generating about $1.1 billion in free cash flow in the first half. This strong start to FY '24 positions us to deliver double-digit growth in free cash flow for the full year. It also enables continued execution of our disciplined capital allocation strategy including accretive M&A opportunities in higher-growth categories and opportunistically returning cash to shareholders.\nLastly, our teams around the world continue to make advancements on our corporate sustainability strategy. We were recently named among Fortune Magazine's Most Innovative Companies list, a testament to our 70,000 associates who work every day to deliver innovation that meaningfully advances the standard of care around the world. We continue to forge partnerships that expand access to these critical innovations. And most recently, we announced the first ever option in Singapore for women to self-collect a sample for cervical cancer screening in the privacy of their own home.\nIn summary, we are delivering accelerated revenue growth, are executing ahead of our plan on Alaris and driving strong margin performance with a growing contribution from BD excellence. We once again raised our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for fiscal 2024 and believe we are well positioned to achieve our BD2025 goals. I'll now turn it over to Chris to review our financials and outlook.\n\nChristopher J. DelOrefice\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we executed well on our performance goals in Q2. As expected, we delivered strong acceleration in our revenue growth, we exceeded both our margin and earnings goals and delivered very strong free cash flow growth.\nI'll now provide some insights into our revenue performance in the quarter. Q2 revenue was $5 billion, with organic growth of 5.7%, driven by strong volume. Growth was led by double-digit growth in BD Interventional with low single-digit growth in BD Medical and BD Life Sciences. Total Q2 revenue growth of 4.7% reflects the divestiture of our surgical instruments platform.\nRegionally, organic growth was driven by the U.S., partially offset by expected market dynamics in China. In BD Medical, growth was led by medication management with strong performance in infusion systems driven by the BD Alaris return to market and mid-single-digit growth across our Medication Delivery Solutions portfolio in the U.S. and EMEA.\nStrong demand in our pharmaceutical systems, prefilled devices for biologic drugs offset transitory market dynamics across the industry, including customer inventory destocking. BD Life Sciences performance was led by integrated diagnostic solutions with high single-digit growth in our microbiology platforms and mid-single-digit growth in specimen management, which offset a comparison to the prior year and transitory market dynamics in select segments in Biosciences.\nBD Interventional Organic growth was led by continued strong growth in UCC with continued momentum in our PureWick franchise, delivering another quarter of double-digit growth, along with related licensing revenue. Surgery delivered another strong quarter with double-digit organic growth, supported by global adoption of our Phasix resorbable scaffold.\nLastly, growth was supported by peripheral intervention with double-digit growth in our peripheral vascular disease platform, where we continue to drive market penetration with our rotor atherectomy system and our venous portfolio. The quarter's performance reflects the breadth of the BD portfolio that delivers a durable growth profile.\nNow moving to our P&L. We realized strong sequential margin improvement with adjusted gross margin of 53% and adjusted operating margin of 24.3%, both above our expectations. For adjusted gross margin, our simplification and BD excellence initiatives are continuing to drive net cost improvement and sequentially, as planned, we saw a reduced impact from prior year inventory reductions that increased cash flow, driven by strong SSG&A, expense reductions and leverage, our adjusted operating margin increased sequentially by 410 basis points and year-over-year by 160 basis points with Q2 being above our fiscal year '23 full year margin.\nAs a result of these items, we exceeded our Q2 operating income and adjusted diluted EPS expectations resulting in adjusted diluted EPS of $3.17, which grew double digits or 10.8% on a reported basis. Regarding our cash and capital allocation. Year-to-date free cash flow increased more than $900 million year-over-year to over $1.1 billion. This reflects continued improvements around working capital, including our actions to optimize inventory levels, continued discipline around capital investments and leveraging our fixed asset base as a result of the benefits from our BD Excellence operating system.\nWe remain focused on free cash flow conversion and are on track to deliver another double-digit step improvement in FY '24 and remain well positioned to achieve our long-term cash goals. With our strong cash flow, year-to-date, we returned over $1 billion in capital to shareholders, including dividends and $500 million in share repurchases.\nWe improved our net debt position ending Q2 with a net leverage ratio of 2.6x. Our cash and short-term investments balance was almost $3.2 billion, inclusive of about $2 billion in proceeds from debt refinancing during the quarter that will be utilized to repay maturing debt over the balance of the calendar year. Collectively, this positions us well to capitalize on accretive value-creating tuck-in M&A.\nMoving to our updated guidance for fiscal year '24. The detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can be found in our presentation. As we look ahead for the balance of the year, we remain focused on driving areas of momentum, including Alaris and continue to monitor transitory market dynamics. For the full year, we are maintaining our organic revenue growth guidance range of 5.5% to 6.25%.\nBased on our Q2 margin performance, we are raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range to $12.95 to $13.15 on a reported basis, which is an increase of $0.11 at the midpoint. Strong delivery in Q2 positions us well to achieve our second half earnings growth targets.\nRegarding foreign currency, based on current spot rates, the impact of currency has moved modestly since our last update. And for illustrative purposes, we see an additional headwind of approximately 40 basis points to full year revenue from translational currency impacts.\nAs you think of the second half of fiscal '24, the following are some considerations. First, regarding revenue, the midpoint of our guidance reflects about 7.5% second half organic sales growth with nearly 250 basis points contribution from Alaris and just over 5% growth in the remainder of the BD portfolio. We expect Q3 organic growth of at least 6% with Q4 further accelerating, driven in part by Alaris momentum and improving grow-over dynamics in China.\nFor the full year, our assumptions imply just over 100 basis points revenue contribution from Alaris or at least $300 million in FY '24 revenues. Second, we are well positioned to achieve our updated adjusted operating margin guidance of at least 50 basis points improvement, which implies full year operating margins of at least 24%. We expect Q3 adjusted operating margin will be modestly higher than Q2, given the strong performance in this quarter.\nWe continue to expect margin acceleration in Q4, driven by our BD excellence and continuous improvement efforts and continued expense leverage on expected strong revenue performance, including Alaris. Lastly, we expect our tax rate to be ratable across Q3 and Q4 at about 15% when considering the midpoint of our updated full year guidance range.\nIn summary, based on the strength of our portfolio and momentum in Alaris, we have clear line of sight to deliver our fiscal year '24 revenue guide and another year of strong growth. Our team's execution supported over delivering on our margin expectations. And as a result, as we enter the second half, we are on track to achieve our full year margin improvement goals and once again increased our fiscal year '24 earnings outlook. Additionally, we remain well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit free cash flow growth, which increases our capacity to support additional value-creating opportunities, including M&A.\nOur strategy is demonstrating positive momentum, and we remain well positioned to continue to deliver on our BD2025 growth objectives. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you please assemble our queue?"

[Operator Instructions].\nI will now turn the call over to Greg Roditas, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations.\n\nGreg Rodetis\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to BD's earnings call. I'm Greg Rodetis, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. On behalf of the BD team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at bd.com.\nEarlier this morning, BD released results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our business, strategy and performance. The press release and presentation can be accessed on the IR website at investors.bd.com. Leading today's call are Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Chris DelOrefice, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide highlights of our performance and the continued execution of our BD 2025 strategy. Chris will then provide additional details on our Q1 financial performance and our updated guidance for fiscal 2024. Following the prepared remarks, Tom and Chris will be joined for Q&A by our segment presidents. Mike Garrison, President of the Medical segment; Dave Hickey, President of the Life Sciences segment; and Rick Byrd, President of the Interventional segment.\nBefore we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. I encourage you to read the disclaimer in our earnings release and the disclosures in our SEC filings, which are both available on the Investor Relations website. Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis versus a relevant period. Revenue percentage changes are on an FX-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. When we refer to any given period, we are referring to the fiscal period unless we specifically note it as a calendar period. I would also call your attention to the non-GAAP reconciliations included in the appendices of the press release and earnings presentation.\nWith that, I am very pleased to turn it over to Tom.\n\nThomas E. Polen\n\nPresident, Becton, Dickinson & Co.\n\nThanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported our results for the first quarter. Overall, we executed Q1 as expected. Total revenue growth was largely in line with our expectations. And on the bottom line, adjusted EPS was ahead of our expectations due to good execution on our margin goals through our BD Excellence operating system and the timing of a discrete tax item. Also consistent with our plan, we delivered very strong growth in cash flow that positions us well to deliver another year of growing free cash flow double digits. I want to thank our team of over 70,000 associates for the strong execution, agility and unrelenting determination to deliver for our customers, patients and shareholders. These results give us the confidence to increase our FY '24 guidance.\nTurning to our BD 2025 strategy. During Q1, we continued to execute well against the 5 actions we outlined at our Investor Day to drive profitable growth and value creation. This includes continuing to advance our innovation pipeline, which supports our durable 5.5% plus targeted revenue growth profile. We remain focused on advancing innovation in high-growth areas. Anchored against 3 irreversible forces, we see reshaping health care today and over the next decade, connected care, new care settings and chronic disease.\nSpecifically in Q1, we made meaningful progress achieving several key R&D milestones for technologies that position BD as key enablers of care shift to new settings. In our PureWick portfolio, which is now the market's leading platform for noninvasive urine management, in a $1 billion market growing double digits, we started our randomized clinical trial pilot for PureWick female to generate evidence to support future at-home reimbursement. Our PureWick program is progressing well, and we remain on track to launch our next-generation female external catheter later this fiscal year, which will provide a better patient experience and a more dignified way for women to manage their urinary incontinence.\nIn Q1, we received 510(k) clearance for our new BD MiniDraw capillary blood collection system. Based on a recent study, 2/3 of patients prefer MiniDraw's fingerstick collection in a retail setting over a previous experience with a traditional venous blood draw. Since it does not require a phlebotomist, MiniDraw can expand access to sample collection for several routine blood tests to new settings such as retail clinics and pharmacies.\nAnd lastly, in molecular diagnostics, we initiated clinical trial enrollment for the BD [ Eliance ] point-of-care molecular platform and our first assay a rapid CT/GC test for in-office testing and treatment. BD [ Alliance ] enables BD to enter into the high-growth molecular point-of-care market. We continue to see molecular diagnostics as a strong growth catalyst as evidenced by double-digit growth this quarter in our BD COR and BD MAX platforms, where we continue to leverage our growing installed base through menu expansion with more than 20 assays currently available on BD MAX. Both next-gen PureWick and BDMini Draw are on track to launch later this fiscal year, and we anticipate our first 510(k) submission for the BD [ Eliant ] system and our first assay this fiscal year as well.\nRegarding Alaris, servicing our customers and bringing all Alaris pumps in the field up to the cleared standard remains our priority. Customer response has been very positive with strong momentum engaging with customers. And while it is still early in the process, I'm pleased with our progress and as we recently shared, we now believe $200 million is the floor on revenue in fiscal '24. We are also executing well on our broad simplification strategy to drive margin expansion and a double-digit base EPS CAGR through FY '25. This includes accelerating adoption of our BD Excellence operating system, which focuses on the application of lean principles to drive excellence everywhere, every day across our plants and business and is driving productivity gains across our operations.\nIn FY '23, we held 18 week-long Kaizen events. in Q1 FY '24 alone, we executed as many, a trajectory which will continue through the rest of FY '24. We've deployed this mindset outside of our factories driving greater efficiency through the organization at all levels. Our BD Excellence operating system is an important new capability we're building to drive a world-class culture of continuous improvement and lean management throughout BD. We also progressed our Project Recode initiatives, including our network optimization effort to drive plant efficiencies.\nWe have multiple site consolidations either completed or underway to reduce our footprint by approximately 20%. The combination of BD excellence with our Reco network architecture program is supporting our FY '24 goals contributing to our plan for 25% operating margins in FY '25 and also now providing visibility for continued margin expansion beyond FY '25. We're also seeing our systematic focus on cash flow, continuing to yield results. Through working capital efficiencies and our BD Excellence operating system, driving more efficient CapEx spend, we delivered over $850 million in operating cash flows in Q1. This strong execution to start the year positions us well to deliver double-digit growth in free cash flows in FY '24 and positions us to capitalize on M&A opportunities in higher growth categories and opportunistically return cash to shareholders.\nLastly, our teams around the world continue to make meaningful advancements on our ESG strategy. Just last week, we announced a collaboration with the Kenyan Government to advance access to critical cancer diagnostics for women in Kenya through self-sampling furthering our commitment to expanding health equity and access around the world. We see the power of this self-sampling model is applicable across other underserved markets as well as in the U.S. In summary, I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q1 and the solid margin execution, which enables us to raise guidance for fiscal 2024. With strong progress of our innovation pipeline and growing momentum from BD Excellence and our simplification programs, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our BD 2025 goals.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance and outlook.\n\nChristopher J. DelOrefice\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we executed well against our performance goals in Q1, and Q1 revenue growth was largely as we expected, and I'm pleased to share we exceeded both our margin and earnings goals and delivered strong cash flow that positions us well to support our double-digit free cash flow growth goal. I'll now provide some insight into our revenue performance in the quarter. Additional detail can be found in today's earnings announcement and presentation.\nQ1 revenue was $4.7 billion, with organic growth of 2.4% that was driven by high single-digit organic growth in BD Interventional and solid growth in BD Medical with China market dynamics playing out as expected. partially offset by a decline in BD Life Sciences, which was impacted by the comparison to the prior year respiratory season. As expected, China and respiratory were the primary drivers of Q1 revenue growth under indexing our full year goal. The respiratory season alone impacted total company growth by about 150 basis points.\nRegionally, organic growth was driven by the U.S., EMEA and Latin America, partially offset by the expected decline in China. Total Q1 revenue growth of 1.6% reflects the divestiture of our surgical instruments platform. Turning to the segment performance, BD Medical revenue totaled $2.2 billion in the quarter, growing 2.4%, driven by growth in Medication Management Solutions and pharmaceutical systems. Mid-single-digit growth in MMS was led by strong performance in dispensing driven by innovations in our BD Pyxis portfolio that are improving nursing workflows and efficiencies.\nIn our infusion business, we are pleased with our strong progress bringing the BD Alaris infusion system back to the market and continue to expect Alaris to ramp over the course of the year. Infusion also reflects strong demand for IV SES. Performance in pharmacy automation reflects the comparison to an outsized quarter in the prior year and the timing of planned capital installations. Growth of 3.4% in Pharmaceutical Systems was in line with our expectations and was led by strong double-digit growth in prefilled devices for biologics and as expected, was partially offset by customer inventory dynamics, including a slowdown in demand for anticoagulants.\nGrowth in Medication Delivery Solutions was about flat and slightly ahead of our expectations. Our Vascular Access Management strategy continues to drive strong performance, particularly in catheter solutions. As expected, MDS growth was impacted by market dynamics in China, including volume-based procurement, which continues to play out within our expectations. BD Life Sciences revenue of $1.3 billion declined 2.5%, which reflects a decline in IDS as a result of a tough comparison in the respiratory season worth nearly 500 basis points. It was partially offset by strong growth in Biosciences.\nPerformance in IDS reflects the tough comparison in respiratory testing that was partially offset by high single-digit growth in our microbiology platforms and double-digit growth in molecular IVD assays on both our BD MAX and BD COR platforms.\nBiosciences grew 5.7% as expected, despite a strong comparison in the prior year. performance was driven by strong mid-single-digit growth in our research and clinical platforms that reflects double-digit growth in research instruments driven by strong demand for our recently launched BD FACS Discover S8 [ cells ] order and double-digit growth in clinical reagents as we continue to leverage our growing installed base of FACSLyric and FACSDuet solutions.\nBD Interventional revenues totaled $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 4.7% and 8.4% organic, which excludes the impact of the surgical instruments divestiture. BDI organic growth was led by surgery and UCC. In surgery, double-digit organic growth was led by continued market adoption of our leading Phasix resorbable hernia products in our advanced repair and reconstruction portfolio and strong demand for our ChloraPrep infection prevention solution. High single-digit growth in urology was led by strong double-digit growth in our PureWick chronic incontinence solutions with continued strong demand in both the acute care and home care settings. Mid-single-digit growth in PI was in line with our expectations and reflects growth across the portfolio. It was partially offset by the expected timing of distributor orders.\nIn our peripheral vascular disease platform, we continue to drive market penetration with our Rotarex atherectomy system and our venous portfolio. Performance in our oncology business was driven by growth in biopsy including strong market acceptance of our recently launched BD [ Trek ] Powered Bone Biopsy system. Now moving to our P&L.\nAdjusted gross margin of 51.1% and adjusted operating margin of 20.2%, were ahead of our expectations due to good execution on our margin improvement goals across our portfolio of simplification initiatives and strong SG&A expense leverage. R&D spend was in line with our expectations. In addition, as we previously shared a discrete tax item that was contemplated in our full year tax rate was realized in Q1. As a result of these items, we exceeded our Q1 operating income and our adjusted diluted EPS expectations, resulting in an EPS of $2.68.\nRegarding our cash and capital allocation. Q1 cash flows from operations totaled over $850 million. This reflects continued improvements around working capital, including good management of inventory levels continued discipline around CapEx investments and leveraging our fixed asset base as a result of the benefit from our simplification programs and BD Excellence operating system. We remain focused on free cash flow conversion and expect another step improvement in FY '24. As we execute against our BD 2025 strategy, we also remain well positioned to achieve our long-term cash conversion target of around 90%.\nBeyond our investments in growth, we returned $775 million in capital to shareholders, including dividends, and $500 million in share repurchases. We ended Q1 with a cash balance of $1.2 billion and a net leverage ratio of 2.7x.\nMoving to our updated guidance for fiscal '24. For your convenience, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can also be found in our presentation. Based on our Q1 performance, including the strong momentum in many parts of our business and progression of our margin improvement initiatives, we raised the midpoint of our FY '24 organic revenue growth guidance and raised our adjusted EPS guidance, increasing the midpoint by $0.09. The increase to adjusted EPS reflects Q1 operational outperformance and a small improvement in FX. As a result, we now expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 5.5% to 6.25%, which increases our midpoint to slightly above 5.8%. We now expect adjusted diluted EPS, including the impact of currency to be in a range of $12.82 to $13.06, which reflects about $12.94 at the midpoint.\nRegarding foreign currency, based on current spot rates for illustrative purposes, currency has improved modestly and for the full year is now estimated to be a headwind of approximately 25 basis points to total company revenues and approximately 360 basis points to adjusted EPS growth on a full year basis.\nAs you think of phasing over the balance of fiscal '24, the following are some considerations. First, we continue to expect organic sales growth to be higher than our full year range in the second half, partially driven by the expected ramp in Alaris along with the easing of prior year comparisons such as China. Second, our updated guidance reflects an improved margin cadence over the balance of the year.\nSpecific to Q2, adjusted gross margin is in line with our prior expectation and continues to reflect significant sequential improvement given the lessening impact from inflation, prior year inventory reductions and FX. We now expect Q2 adjusted operating margin to expand by 25 to 50 basis points year-over-year, driven by our continued margin improvement efforts and continued leverage in SG&A. Third, the discrete tax item was largely a shift from Q2 and results in revised phasing of our full year effective tax rate. Based on this timing dynamic, we currently expect our Q2 tax rate to be nearly 17% and we expect strong operating performance to offset the tax phasing impact. And as a result, there are no changes to our expectations for Q2 adjusted earnings per share. Lastly, we remain confident in delivering about 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement for the year.\nAs a reminder, the first half inventory impact is transitory and behind us as we exit Q2. And as FX and inflation moderate at a meaningful rate through the back half, coupled with a continuation of the first half margin improvement, we expect to deliver from our strong simplification portfolio we can naturally achieve our second half margin goals.\nIn summary, based on the strength of our portfolio and new innovation, we have clear line of sight to deliver our FY '24 revenue guide which at the midpoint is above our 5.5% plus target and results in a 3-year CAGR of nearly 7% growth. I'm pleased with the continued strong execution by our talented organization to start the year which supported over delivering on our margin and operating income goals and increasing our earnings outlook. With a strong quarter of cash flow, we remain well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit free cash flow growth which increases our capacity to support additional value-creating opportunities, including M&A. We remain well positioned to continue to deliver against our BD 2025 strategy and financial targets.\nWith that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue?"

Polen\n\nPresident, Becton, Dickinson & Co.\n\nThanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported our results for the fourth quarter and full year of FY '23, a year characterized by strong differentiated performance driven by our BD 2025 strategy in action, impactful new innovations and our diversified business portfolio designed to help our customers navigate today's challenging environment.\nThe diversification of our portfolio offers both durability through our leading positions and consistent demand for products essential to everyday patient care and strong growth through a purposeful shift into higher-growth markets, anchored against 3 irreversible forces we see shaping health care: connected care, new care settings and chronic disease.\nAdditionally, we have built capability and fostered a culture of operational excellence, where we make disciplined and strategic capital allocation choices, proactively address macro headwinds through our simplification programs and execute with speed and agility, all of which have and continue to play a key role in delivering strong consistent performance. This unique profile can be seen in both our current and 2-year performance and where our purposeful shift into higher growth markets has enabled us to drive the plus side of our targeted 5.5% plus revenue growth profile.\nIn FY '23, we delivered 7% base revenue growth with base organic growth of 5.8%. Our team drove significant margin expansion and delivered $12.21 in adjusted EPS, which represents double-digit currency-neutral growth of 11%. Over the past 2 years, we have made excellent progress toward our BD 2025 financial targets, delivering a 7% base organic revenue CAGR and 390 basis points of operating margin expansion. We are now over 70% of the Wave 2 and tracking ahead of our 25% adjusted operating margin target by FY '25.\nAs a result, on the bottom line, we delivered an implied base EPS CAGR of 20% currency neutral. We also ended FY '23 with strong execution of our strategic priorities. First, we delivered our #1 priority, obtaining FDA clearance for the updated BD Alaris infusion system. Post clearance, our priority remains remediation, scaling up manufacturing and engaging with customers on the many benefits of the updated system that include advanced cybersecurity, wireless connectivity and other clinical and patient safety upgrades.\nWe are confident in our remediation plan and have begun the process prioritizing our existing customers. We are making good progress with active contracting and shipment of our first units to customers taking place ahead of schedule at the end of September. We are excited to deliver the benefits of the updated Alaris system to our customers and their patients, including the power of one integrated infusion platform with a centralized user interface for all major types of infusion, as well as the value added through interoperability and other innovations that connect data from Alaris, Pyxis and the rest of our medication management offering into the industry's only end-to-end solution for safer, simpler and smarter medication management from the pharmacy to the floor, to the bed side.\nThe clearance of the BD Alaris infusion system gives us further confidence in our ability to achieve our BD 2025 strategy and financial targets. Second, we significantly advanced our innovation pipeline, launching 27 key new products that benefit researchers, providers and patients, integrating AI, robotics and other advanced technologies. Our products are helping researchers gain deeper insights faster, like our FACSDiscover S8 Cells Sorter with CellView image technology and FACSDuet premium sample preparation system, which apply novel technologies like high-speed cell imaging and liquid handling robotics, and our BD Horizon real yellow and real blue reagents, which were developed using AI guidance.\nOur pharmacy automation business continues to grow double digits and it's helping our customers serve patients more efficiently and with fewer errors across various care settings. Our robotic microbiology platform, BD Kiesrta, hit record sales this year, and we continue to drive strong double-digit growth in our BD COR and BD MAX molecular platforms, leveraging our growing installed base through menu expansion that includes our new vaginal panel and our Onclarity HPV assay thin prep on BD COR and now greater than 20 assays on BD MAX.\nWe continue to enable the care shift in new settings, including at home, through innovations such as our PureWick system franchise for urinary incontinence that we expanded to include solutions for male patients. PureWick Male has been one of the fastest ramps of a new product in our history and continues to exceed our expectations. Given the strong adoption, we have now designated this as a greater than $50 million incremental growth opportunity.\nPharmaceutical Systems, which achieved 13 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, continues to empower the delivery of new biologics, many administered by patients at home, such as the growing drug class of GLP-1 for diabetes and weightloss and other molecules, which will be delivered through our self-injection solutions. We are playing an increasing role in addressing chronic diseases like peripheral arterial disease and improving outcomes in tissue reconstruction.\nThis year, we expanded the impact of new products such as our rotor ex atherectomy system, Venovo venous stent system and Venclose RF ablation catheter, helping to address an area of high unmet need for the 10 million patients each year who are suffering from venous disease.\nIn Surgery, our teams accelerated the growth of Phasix mesh to allow more patients to benefit from tissue repair performed with our resorbable synthetic biomaterial. And of course, we continue to drive a relentless focus on improving clinician and patient satisfaction with PIVO Pro and BD Nexiva with near port IV access, a core element of our One-Stick hospital Stay vision that enables needleless blood draws, which is a major satisfaction for patients.\nAnd BD Pyxis ES 1.7.4, which now fully integrates our C2 Safe system into the Pyxis ES platform, enabling security and automated controlled substance management for pharmacists. I'm really pleased with how our R&D team executed in FY '23. Again, reaching a new record level of on-time milestones and launches.\nOur enhanced focus on programs with the potential to move the needle in terms of growth has positioned us well to drive our WAMGR expansion. We are on track to buttonhole target of over 100 new product launches by FY '25 and our new product revenue contribution target, as outlined at Investor Day, creating a new wave of margin-accretive growth for BD.\nThird, in addition to our investments in R&D, our tuck-in M&A strategy has been very impactful. Targeted in higher-growth markets, M&A is complementing the plus side of our 5.5% plus growth profile and also contributing to growth on an organic basis as we anniversary those assets. This includes our acquisition of Parati Systems, which is part of our pharmacy automation business that is growing double digits. At nearly $700 million in revenue, BD Pharmacy Automation is one of the largest robotics and health care process automation businesses in med tech, focused on improving pharmacy labor efficiency and reducing errors. There's never been a greater need for these solutions.\nFourth, we continued our simplification initiatives in FY '23 and actively managed our portfolio, divesting our surgical instrumentation business and executing a program of strategic portfolio exits, allowing us to continue to reallocate our resources into more strategic, higher growth areas and further reduce complexity across our company. We also progressed our Project Recode network and SKU rationalization programs, exiting more than 2,300 incremental SKUs in FY '23 and are pleased that we have now streamlined our portfolio by 20% compared to 2019, achieving our goal laid out at Investor Day 2 years early.\nWe are seeing the benefits in our manufacturing plants and in our simplified portfolio with customers. We will continue to advance this initiative as we keep executing BD 2025. In addition, we initiated our operating model simplification initiative to reduce our organizational complexity and increase agility. As a result, we were able to absorb continued outsized inflation during the year as planned and advanced operating margins towards our 25% target.\nAnd lastly, we strengthened our balance sheet, inclusive of executing on our planned inventory reductions and maintaining a disciplined and balanced capital deployment framework. This allows us to support organic and inorganic investments in growth while returning capital to shareholders.\nWe've just announced our 52nd consecutive year of dividend increases, continuing our long-standing recognition as a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, a distinction that reflects the consistency and reliability of our dividend policy.\nLastly, I'm also very pleased with how we've advanced our ESG strategy and goals. In July, we published our 2022 ESG report, which provides details about our strategy and progress against our 2030 plus commitments. Highlights include progress in health equity and diversity as well as improving our environmental footprint, which included a reduction of Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 10% and having generated 34% of our electric power from renewable energy.\nIn FY '23, we submitted our GHG emission reduction targets to the science-based target initiative for verification. I'm quite excited by our innovative circular economy pilots we did this past year. They were the first of their kind in our industry. Recycling medical waste, like used syringes and back containers, and converting these materials back into usable resins. We'll be advancing this work further in FY '24 as we continue to tackle end-of-life GHG emissions and seek to lead circular economy innovation within our industry.\nWe also continue to pioneer products and solutions that address health and equities like our efforts to detect HPV infections and diagnose cervical cancer through at-home sample collection. We're proud that our progress continues to be recognized externally, with BD most recently named among the 100 Best Corporate Citizens by 3BL and among the top 2 in the health care equipment and services industry.\nBefore I turn it over to Chris, I'd like to provide some perspective on the macro environment and BD 2025 as we look forward to FY '24. Starting with the macro environment. The complexity facing all companies will likely persist and, in some cases, is accelerating. With China responding to economic pressures and elevated levels of geopolitical uncertainty occurring in multiple markets, inflation has moderated from the peak high levels overall, but remains elevated compared to pre-pandemic norms, including higher labor rates in transportation and manufacturing, higher costs of energy and certain raw materials.\nWhile there continues to be a heightened degree of macro uncertainty ahead into FY '24, consistent with what we have done in the past several years, we have positioned BD to deliver strong performance through this environment. As we move forward, you can expect to see continued execution of BD 2025 with a focus on the bold actions that position BD strategically for the future. These include continuing to advance our strong organic portfolio of programs in high growth spaces that are transforming health care. This includes launching another 25 key new products, including our Phasix ST umbilical product that will provide patients a reliable alternative to permanent mesh, bringing the benefits of our bioresorbable Phasix material into one of the most common abdominal wall hernia procedures.\nThe BD multimodality vacuum-assisted biopsy, Vice, which is expected to be the first VAB system designed to work across all 3 imaging modalities of ultrasound, CT and MRI, allows our customers to consolidate capital equipment, standardize consumables and simplify physician and nurse training. Our next-generation PureWick incontinence solution for the hospital and the home will be launching in FY '24. And our FACSDiscover S8 Cells Sorter 3 and 4 laser configuration that will expand our new-to-world cell-sorting instrument to the mid-parameter segment to help more researchers drive new discoveries. We'll also launching our Libertas 5 mL device that will provide a wearable option for higher viscous drugs that tend to require longer dosing times.\nAnd finally, our BD Nexus next-generation infusion pump for Europe. These are just a few examples of the 25 key new product launches planned for FY '24. We will also continue to simplify our organization this year to enable operational excellence and agility, fuel investment and deliver on initiatives that will help us achieve our 25% adjusted operating margin goal in FY '25. This includes our Project Recode initiatives, where our network optimization efforts will start generating savings in FY '24, as we drive plant efficiencies and our operating model efforts where we are seeing positive early results from outsourcing certain back-office functions.\nAs we accelerate our focus on BD Excellence, our unique business performance system, we will increase the adoption of lean principles beyond manufacturing with pilots outside of operations this year. I see our BD excellence system as an important new lever we're building as we look ahead and think about our strategic plans beyond BD 2025.\nAnd lastly, we expect to continue our balanced approach to capital deployment. This includes ongoing transformation of our portfolio by deploying capital towards larger tuck-in acquisitions and in higher growth categories, we can scale and leverage to support our growth and margin goals.\nAs I said at the top of the call, in fiscal 2023, our teams demonstrated exceptional agility and strong execution, advancing our BD 2025 stage. We are delivering consistent, durable performance in a challenging environment, which we expect to persist several years to come. Our continued track record, combined with our growing pipeline and shift into higher growth markets, is propelling us into a more innovative leader. It is making a profound impact on advancing health care globally.\nWe are advancing into FY '24 with clarity, focus and a growth mindset as we seek to do great things for those who rely on us: our customers, patients, associates and shareholders.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance and outlook.\n\nChristopher J. DelOrefice\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Tom. We delivered strong, consistent results this fiscal year, which reflect the diversity of our portfolio and our BD 2025 strategy in action. Beginning with our revenue performance.\nWe delivered $5.1 billion in revenue in Q4, exceeding our expectations with base organic growth of 7% and total base growth of 6.3%, which reflects the impact from the surgical instrumentation divestiture.\nFor the full fiscal year, we delivered $19.4 billion in revenue with base organic revenue growth of 5.8%, that is 100 basis points higher than our initial guidance. Total base revenue growth was 7%, driven by strong performance in BD Medical and BD Interventional. Base revenue growth was strong regionally as well with high single-digit growth in EMEA and Latin America and mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. and Greater Asia despite low single-digit growth in China.\nOur revenue performance continues to be supported by our durable core portfolio and an increasing contribution from higher growth spaces that are driving the plus side of our targeted 5.5% plus revenue growth profile. We also continue to benefit from the organic contribution from tuck-in acquisitions we anniversaried, which was about 40 basis points for the full year.\nOver a 2-year period, we drove a strong base organic revenue CAGR of about 7%, which is well above our long-term target. Let me now provide some high-level insight into each segment's performance in the quarter. Further detail can be found in today's earnings announcement and presentation.\nBD Medical revenue totaled $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, growing 6.2% with strong performance in Medication Management Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems. BD Medical performance reflects a decline in medication delivery systems resulting from softness in China driven by market dynamics, including some impacts from volume-based procurement. This was partially offset by strong performance in catheter solutions in North America and Europe through continued execution of our vascular access management strategy.\nMMS delivered exceptional growth of 13.7%, driven by double-digit growth in both dispensing and pharmacy automation as customers focus on solutions which improve workflows and efficiencies and help pharmacies address rising costs and labor shortages.\nPharmaceutical Systems delivered another quarter of double-digit growth of 10.6% and driven by continued strong demand for prefillable solutions for biologics, partially offset by a slowdown in China exports of anticoagulants. BD Life Sciences revenue totaled $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Excluding COVID-only testing, Life Sciences base revenues grew 3.8% driven by strong double-digit growth in Biosciences.\nLife Sciences base business growth reflects IDS based business growth of 0.6%, driven by continued adoption of our BD Kiestra microbiology lab automation solution and strong IDAST instrument placements and continued growth of our molecular IVD assays, leveraging the BD COR system and our expanded BD MAX installed base.\nGrowth was partially offset by the comparison to prior year COVID-related recovery in China and a decline in specimen management that was driven by distributor and customer stocking in the prior year. BDB grew 11.7%, driven by strong demand for our recently launched BD FACSDiscover S8 Cells Sorter that is enabling an entirely new level of biological depth of speed, ease of use and solution integration for researchers across fields like immunology, cancer research and cell biology.\nBDB's performance also reflects strong growth in clinical reagents, leveraging our increasing installed base of FACSLyric analyzers and FACSDuet automation. BD Interventional revenues totaled $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, growing 9.6% and 12.8% organic. The strong double-digit organic growth was driven by surgery growth of 5% or 15.1% organic which excludes the impact from the divestiture of the surgical instrumentation platform of 10.5 percentage points.\nOrganic growth reflects strong market adoption of our leading Phasix hernia products in our advanced repair and reconstruction portfolio and strong demand for our ChloraPrep infection prevention solution. PI grew 11.7%, which reflects strong performance in peripheral vascular disease driven by global penetration of the rotor atherectomy system and our venous portfolio in China.\nGrowth was aided by improved supply and distribution stabilization in EMEA following a new ERP implementation in fiscal '22. Urology grew 11.7%, primarily driven by continued strong demand for our PureWick chronic incontinence solutions in both the acute care and alternative care settings.\nNow moving to our P&L. Q4 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.42 reflects strong double-digit growth of 24% or 25% on a currency-neutral basis. Gross margin increased 20 basis points to 52.6%, and as anticipated, we delivered very strong margin improvement with adjusted operating margin of 25.4%, up 340 basis points.\nAs expected, margin improvement was driven by leverage on our strong revenue performance, our ability to offset outsized inflation lower SSG&A driven by our simplification initiatives, moderated R&D expense as a percent of sales due to investment timing and a favorable comparison to last year's COVID profit reinvestment.\nFull year adjusted diluted EPS of $12.21 grew 7.6% or 11% currency neutral. This includes delivering an additional $0.14 of currency-neutral earnings versus our original guidance. Additionally, we absorbed almost 400 basis points associated with reduced COVID-only testing, combining base currency-neutral EPS growth of approximately 15%.\nFor the full year, gross margin of 53.5% was flat to the prior year to site absorbing over 200 basis points of outsized inflation and cost of goods sold. Operating margin of 23.5% was up about 90 basis points or 110 basis points when excluding the 20 basis point impact from the accounting treatment of an employee benefit-related item, exceeding our margin goal for the year. The employee benefit item is recorded in G&A and is fully offset in other income with no resulting impact to EPS.\nWhile delivering our margin goals, we also maintained investment in R&D at 6% of sales or about $1.2 billion to advance our pipeline of innovation programs that will support our strong growth profile in fiscal year '24 and beyond.\nAs anticipated, we've made significant progress towards achieving our pre-pandemic margin improvement goals. Our FY '23 adjusted operating margin is ahead of our 2019 spin adjusted margin which is particularly significant given it includes overcoming 500 basis points or almost $1 billion of outsized inflation in the past 3 years.\nOver the next 2 years, we remain well positioned to return to our targeted 25% operating margins. Regarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totaled approximately $3 billion in FY '23. As expected, cash flow accelerated over the back half of the year and was strongest in Q4 due to normalization of working capital, including continued moderation of our inventory balances. We remain focused on free cash flow conversion and as anticipated, delivered a step-up in FY '23 with free cash flow increasing by over $600 million.\nWe are planning another step improvement in FY '24 and expect free cash flow to increase double digits. This will be achieved through further duration of inventory levels by the end of the year and continued discipline around CapEx investments through focused prioritization and areas of targeted reduction both of which we expect to more than offset cash investments to support the Alaris remediation.\nAs we execute against our BD 2025 strategy, we remain well positioned to achieve our long-term cash conversion target of around 90%. Beyond our investments in growth, we paid down over $700 million in debt this fiscal year and returned $1.1 billion in capital to shareholders through dividends. We ended the year with cash balance of $1.4 billion and a net leverage ratio of 2.6x. This is our strongest net leverage position since FY '21, which positions us well to capitalize on opportunities to accelerate our investment in higher-growth categories through our tuck-in M&A strategy.\nMoving to our guidance for fiscal '24. For your convenience, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can also be found in our presentation. As demonstrated by our results over the past 2 years, BD has the ability to deliver strong performance in the most challenging times. Our performance reflects strong execution of our BD 2025 strategy, the benefit of our diversified and durable portfolio our simplification and outsized cost improvement programs and bold, purposeful capital allocation and investment decisions, all further optimized by our ability to execute with agility.\nAs we look to fiscal '24, while the macro landscape has evolved since our last earnings call, I'm pleased to share we remain committed to the revenue growth profile we previously outlined. And at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to deliver another year of organic growth of our 5.5% plus profile. Let me share some of the key puts and takes contemplated in our guidance.\nFirst, we see strong momentum in many parts of our business. We have 6 key areas in our portfolio now totaling over $5 billion or 25% of sales that we expect to deliver high single to double-digit growth. These include our farm systems pre-fillable syringes, which are benefiting from the strong trends in biologics; our bioscience business; our peripheral vascular disease platform; our Medication Management Systems business, including pharmacy automation and infusion, given the recent Claire Delaris pump; urinary incontinence supported by our PureWick franchise; and finally, our molecular diagnostic platforms.\nThis allows us to deliver strong results despite some heightened macro dynamics affecting many industries, most notably in China, along with increasing risk and complexity as the result of the war in the Middle East and other geographies.\nSpecific to the health care industry, providers continue to feel the pressure of elevated inflation and labor dynamics. And while they remain very focused on cost and working capital management, our portfolio has proven to be more resilient in this type of environment, given BD's essential role in the health care ecosystem in our ability to transform health care processes and drive efficiencies.\nAs it relates to BD, the largest headwind we anticipate from these macro dynamics is in our China business, where we see market softness and increased levels of volume-based procurement predominantly impacting our MDS business along with some impact in systems and reduced demand as our Chinese pharmaceutical customers export business slow.\nAs a result, we are projecting China to be flat to modest growth in FY '24, which creates nearly a 75 basis point headwind to our revenue growth this year. Taking these factors into account, we expect to deliver base organic growth of about 6% at the midpoint, which is consistent with the view we provided on our last earnings call. We still expect COVID-only testing to step down from the $73 million reported this year and result in a headwind to organic growth of over 25 basis points. This brings the midpoint of our total organic growth to 5.5% within our 5.25% to 6.25% range.\nTo help simplify our reporting, unless there's a significant change in the COVID-only testing market. Effective this year, we will no longer be reporting base organic growth that excludes COVID-only testing However, it was important to give us context with our initial guidance. As a reminder, while the sale of the surgical instrumentation platform that closed in Q4 FY '23 does not impact our organic growth will have nearly a 75 basis point impact to total revenue growth in FY '24 and is accounted for in our total currency-neutral revenue growth guidance of 4.5% to 5.5%.\nMoving to margins and earnings. We plan to deliver another year of strong growth, including progressing our adjusted operating margin towards our FY '25 goal of 25% and while generating cash flow improvements to support our strong and reliable growth profile. On gross margin, we expect to be about flat year-over-year on a reported basis, including the impact of currency headwinds of approximately 75 basis points.\nExcluding the impact of currency, we expect gross margin to improve with our simplification strategy more than offsetting 150 basis points of headwinds from outsized inflation of about 100 basis points and another 50 basis points from inventory reduction efforts that occurred in FY '23 and that we plan to further moderate down by the end of FY '24, which will improve cash flow.\nThe value from simplification programs continue to be driven by our Recode network optimization, SKU rationalization and operating model simplification programs. Additionally, our BD Excellence program, which focuses on the application of lean principles is driving productivity gains across our operations. As it pertains to OpEx, we anticipate SG&A expense leverage on strong revenue performance and continued benefit from our operating model simplification programs.\nAfter 3 consecutive years of investing in R&D at over 6% on average, in FY '24, we anticipate a consistent year-to-year dollar spend R&D that is needed to advance our pipeline, which will result in some modest leverage. As a result, we expect adjusted operating margin to improve by around 50 basis points on a reported basis over the 23.5% reported in FY '23, primarily driven by SSG&A leverage. This puts us well on track to achieve our 25% margin goal by FY '25.\nFor tax, assuming no major legislative or regulatory changes, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 13% and 15%. As a reminder, it would not be unusual for our tax rate to fluctuate on a quarterly basis given the timing of discrete items. Given all these considerations, we expect adjusted EPS growth before the impact of currency of 8.25% to 10.25% or 9.25% at the midpoint. This includes absorbing about a 75 basis point headwind from the divestiture of the surgical instrumentation business and as a result, implies double-digit earnings growth, excluding the divestiture of 10% at the midpoint and within a range of approximately 9% to 11%.\nLet me now walk you through the estimated impact from currency. As a reminder, we manage our business and provide guidance on a currency-neutral basis to best represent underlying performance, but provide perspective on currency using current spot rates, consistent with what other companies are discussing in their forward outlook, we are accounting for a headwind to our reported results as we translate currency to a stronger U.S. dollar, along with normal FX translation, given our global manufacturing and distribution footprint, we also faced the impact of currency fluctuations in our P&L, including the impact from the sourcing, timing of inventory production and movements throughout our network.\nSince our last call in August, the U.S. dollar significantly strengthened against most major currencies, and the change over this time period accounts for nearly 2/3 of the expected FX impact. Additionally, as it relates to sourcing from Mexico, where we have a large manufacturing footprint, the dollar weakened versus the peso by about 10%, taking the average rate over the last 4 months ending in October versus the average over the first 9 months of fiscal year '23 with the peso achieving peak rates that in that timeframe have not been seen in well over 5 years.\nBased on current spot rates, for illustrative purposes, currency is estimated to be a headwind of approximately 75 basis points to total company revenues and approximately 375 basis points to adjusted EPS growth on a full year basis. All in, including the estimated impact of currency, we expect revenues to be between approximately $20.1 billion to $20.3 billion and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $12.70 to $13, which represents growth of 4% to 6.5%.\nAs a reminder, currency can fluctuate over time, and it would not be prudent to deviate from our investment profile that is resulting in consistently strong base organic growth, which is delivering an expected 3-year base organic CAGR of about 6.8%, well above our 5.5% plus growth profile. We continue to deliver margin improvement, resulting in earnings growing 1.3x the rate of sales. And with our focus on improved cash conversion, we expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth.\nAs you think of fiscal '24 phasing, the following are considerations for Q1 in context on how revenue and margin will index through the remainder of the year. As it relates to Q1, we expect organic revenue growth to under-index the full year by over 200 basis points, and we expect a decline in adjusted EPS versus the prior year of about $0.55 to $0.60.\nThere are 3 key items to consider. First, sales is driven by the prior year base and COVID-only respiratory testing comparison, along with the market dynamics in China. These impacts are about equally weighted and primarily impact the IDS and MDS business with a modest impact in farm systems associated with China.\nWe also expect Alaris revenues to ramp over the year and be weighted to the second half. Second, we expect operating margin to decline by around 350 basis points on a reported basis in Q1 with 200 basis points driven by inventory-related FX dynamics and another 200 basis points from the negative absorption impact from our planned inventory reductions, which we expect to partially offset through our simplification and cost mitigation initiatives while also overcoming outsized inflation.\nLastly, we had a discrete tax item in Q1 of last year that creates a negative comparison. As you think about the remainder of the year, we expect organic sales growth to be higher than our full year range in the second half, partially driven by the ramp-up of Alaris. We expect our Q2 margins to expand significantly on a sequential basis, resulting in year-over-year operating margin being nearly flat on a reported basis or slightly up on a currency-neutral basis.\nIn closing, we are very pleased with our performance this past year, particularly given our ability to navigate another year of significant macro complexity and inflationary pressure. The momentum in our durable and strong portfolio, along with our track record of successfully executing and delivering against our commitments, gives us confidence in our ability to continue this momentum into FY '24 and create long-term value for all of our stakeholders.\nLet me take a moment to thank our talented employees across BD, who through growth mindset and an unwavering commitment to our purpose are core to delivering this performance. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue, please?"

With that, I am very pleased to turn it over to Tom.\n\nThomas E. Polen\n\nPresident, Becton, Dickinson & Co.\n\nThanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported another consecutive quarter of broad-based strong financial performance and significant progress advancing our innovation pipeline. Before we detail our quarterly performance, I want to highlight the 510(k) clearance we received on July 21 from the FDA for the updated BD Alaris infusion system. This has been our #1 priority since launching BD 2025, and we're pleased to deliver this important milestone.\nFor more than 20 years, infusion pumps have represented the backbone of hospital operations. Over that time, Alaris was the first product that connected all patient modules into 1 integrated system and the first platform to introduce medication safety software, which led the way to interoperability with electronic medical records. And later with the launch of BD HealthSight, Alaris again led the way with integration into the full suite of BD end-to-end connected medication management solutions from the pharmacy to the administration of drugs at the patient's bedside.\nToday, the Alaris system continues to advance new levels of innovation with enhanced cybersecurity protection, the latest wireless capabilities and new features that enable various aspects of medication management and ultimately help clinicians deliver the best care. In short, we're proud of the Alaris Power of One that makes medication management safer, simpler and smarter.\nWith this clearance, we address all open recalls with the latest hardware and a new version of software as well as provide important cybersecurity updates. We can now focus on bringing the updated system to the market, ensuring our installed base is upgraded so customers can realize the full benefits of our latest technology.\nAs we return to market, we will start with upgrading or replacing the hardware and software of Alaris system devices in the U.S. market with priority towards our existing customers. Given the breadth of our footprint, this effort will happen over a multiyear period.\nJust 2 weeks into clearance, we are well prepared. We immediately took action have contacted nearly all of our customers. We activated a dedicated team with daily stand-ups and have completed product training for our service teams on the Clear Alaris system. As we previously shared, we are prepared for clearance and our return to market. We have invested in and developed plans for operational capacity, and we've strengthened our supply chain.\nWe have now activated those plans, which were dependent on clearance and are moving quickly to help ensure we can reliably supply our market-leading BD Alaris system and deliver for our customers. In parallel, we continue to engage with the FDA on how we intend to execute our remediation plans, which includes a combination of upgrades and replacements. We'll provide more information as we progress.\nBefore I move on, I would like to thank our customers for their loyalty and patience as we work through this challenging period. Our teams are ready and committed to provide the high-quality service and partnership that you've come to expect from us. And on behalf of the entire BD leadership team, I want to extend our deep appreciation to the BD associates who work tirelessly to bring the updated BD Alaris system to market for their ongoing commitment to quality and ensuring we achieve this milestone in the right way, in line with our values. We'd also like to thank the FDA for their rigorous review and engagement as we went through the clearance process.\nTurning to our quarterly financial results. Our strategy and purposeful investments in innovation are driving consistent higher growth and fueling strong results and momentum. Our results are indicative of our leadership position in our durable core and intentional shifts towards higher growth end markets in a highly motivated and talented global team whose focus on execution is helping our customers provide more efficient and effective care.\nWe delivered another quarter of outstanding results with 7.9% base revenue growth or 6.3% base organic and double-digit adjusted earnings growth. Once again, our results reflect our strategy and action and our strong, consistent growth profile, which gives us the confidence to increase our FY '23 organic growth rate. We also continue to make strong progress improving our on-time milestones and launches to another record level this year.\nStarting with a few examples of our recent launches. In our Medical segment, we introduced the BD Preview 2 system, a first-to-world technology that magnetizes the tip of certain existing BD catheters and allows them to be seen under the preview ultrasound device. The software then guides clinicians to enter the vasculature with first stick success. This novel approach enables BD peripheral IVs to deliver new value to patients and providers.\nIn our biosciences business, we are seeing a super cycle of innovation this quarter with 3 key new product launches. In mid-May, we began shipping the BD Fax Discover S8 cell sorter. Our customers are utilizing this new standard in flow cytometry to unlock life-changing discoveries across immunology, cancer research and cell biology by uncovering more detailed information about cells and how they interact that was previously invisible.\nThe first installations are complete. Customer feedback has been excellent, and we are seeing strong demand. We also launched the BD Rhapsody HT Express, which enables access to the fast-growing single-cell multi-omics market with a high throughput research solution. The HT Express can process up to 320,000 cells per run. Eightfold the throughput of the BD Rhapsody platform, while leveraging Rhapsody's micro well designed to ensure high-quality results for all cell types.\nAnd most recently, we announced the launch of the BD Fax Duet premium sample preparation system, a new robotic system to automate clinical flow cytometry enabling the only walk-away automation for both HIV and leukemia and lymphoma testing. And in our BDI segment, we launched the BD Trek powered bone biopsy system, expanding our presence in oncology beyond the manual biopsy market.\nThe BD Trek system allows for faster sampling with sizes to accommodate a variety of procedural needs. Our differentiated offering enables the ability to collect large intact samples while providing the clinical versatility to biopsy delicate areas that require precise targeting as well as bones that require power.\nWe've also achieved several crucial development milestones this quarter. These include 510(k) submission of the Site Right 9 ultrasound system, which is part of our vascular access management strategy. The Site Right 9 was developed to be the first integrated system that combines catheter and ultrasound navigation into a single device to simplify workflow, capital management and training for clinicians for the placement of BD Pyxis.\nIn our IDS business, we are expanding the strategy for our Baton Clarity HPV franchise to enable patients to self-collect samples with the aim to promote health care equity by making cervical cancer screening accessible to women who historically haven't participated or have had limited access to testing. This is already in use across Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand. Clinical trials are set to start in India, Africa and the U.S. later this year. We are proud of this work and its ability to advance our efforts to reduce health care and equities around the world.\nAnd in our PI business, we submitted and received IDE approval for our TIPS venous stent graft and are on track to enroll the first patient in Q4. Used in the liver, this novel self-expanding covered stent continues to expand our leadership position and build on our success in launching venous products that help deliver better clinical outcomes for patients. These launches and milestones are good examples of accelerated levels of innovation across our business and how we are strengthening our position in attractive end markets across our portfolio.\nWe continue to simplify our company through programs across our manufacturing network and operating model while actively managing our portfolio. As such, we recently completed the divestiture of our surgical instruments platform. This value-creating transaction supports the achievement of our BD2025 financial goals and further advances the BDI segment's focus on high-growth end markets.\nThis divestiture allows us to focus BD surgery strategic investments in advanced repair and reconstruction and surgical complications, which are driving results and helping to address unmet needs in health care. Proceeds from the sale strengthened our cash and net leverage position and support our tuck-in acquisition strategy.\nWe also continue to make progress on our other simplification initiatives, including the reduction of 20% of our SKUs by FY '25, ongoing network architecture optimization and our operating model initiatives to transition certain BD shared service center activities to a third party to optimize our back-office processes and services.\nLooking externally, let me share some perspective on the macro environment. Overall, the macro environment is in line with our view that challenges will persist, not escalate. However, uncertainty remains. We continue to monitor various factors, including how health systems, governments, distributors and suppliers are managing inflation, inventory and other supply chain dynamics.\nBroadly speaking, inflation is moderating, but is still elevated. The supply chain has continued to stabilize, and we're very pleased with our progress to reduce back orders. We expect to exit the year at prepandemic levels, which is enabling us to shift our focus to reducing raw material and some finished goods inventory, which is contributing to our cash flow improvement.\nWhile overall procedure volumes are healthy, our portfolio has been more durable and less impacted by significant short-lived fluctuations in procedure volumes. Overall, the capabilities we have built and the durability of our portfolio have positioned us well.\nBefore I turn it over to Chris, I'd like to share an update on our ESG strategy and goals. We recently issued our 15th annual ESG report that details our progress on the 4 pillars of our ESG strategy, company health, human health, community health and planet health. The FY '22 report highlights our notable progress in energy and waste reduction, health care access and diversity.\nKey achievements include a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 10% from an FY '19 baseline, an increase in the number of locations using renewable energy, the establishment of product recycling pilots around the world and completion of our baseline assessment for Scope 3 emissions. The report also highlights our ongoing work in advancing health equity in under-resourced communities and the product solutions and programs we're investing in that directly address these in equities. BD has always played a tremendous role in addressing health disparities and access to health care around the world, and we're proud of our continued focus in this area.\nWe are also proud to receive continued recognition for our commitment to talent and creating an inclusive culture. Most recently, we were recognized as the best place to work for disability inclusion for the fifth consecutive year, achieving a top score on the Disability Equality Index and we were named to U.S. News & World Reports inaugural Best Companies to Work for list.\nIn summary, we continue to deliver consistent strong results. Our teams are working unwaveringly to achieve key milestones that sets us up for continued growth and consistent performance. And this quarter is another reflection of our focus and determination in achieving our BD2025 goals.\nWe continue to grow, simplify and empower BD and evolve into an agile, innovative medical technology company with a durable compelling growth profile. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance and outlook.\n\nChristopher J. DelOrefice\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Tom. Echoing Tom's comments, our BD2025 strategy is driving consistent performance in an outsized growth profile. We are advancing our innovation pipeline and delivering against our revenue, margin, and EPS goals. We're also making progress strengthening our balance sheet with lower inventory and net leverage, consistent with the commitments we made.\nWith strong year-to-date results, we are well on track to achieve our updated FY '23 guidance. And with the addition of Alaris' return to market, we are increasingly confident in achieving our BD2025 long-term targets of 5.5% plus organic revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth.\nBeginning with some color on our revenue performance. We delivered strong Q3 base revenue growth of 7.9% or 6.3% organic. Base organic growth includes growing over prior year respiratory testing sales which negatively impacted base growth by approximately 100 basis points.\nAdditionally, our tuck-in acquisition strategy continues to enable profitable growth with organic growth from acquisitions that have anniversaried contributing about 40 basis points in the quarter and are expected to contribute 50 basis points for the full year. COVID only testing revenues were $8 million in the quarter, which, as expected, declined from $76 million last year.\nRevenue growth was strong across BD Medical and BD Interventional with growth of 12.2% and 8.1%, respectively. As expected, BD Life Sciences revenues declined due to lower COVID-only testing revenues compared to the prior year. Life Sciences base revenues, which exclude COVID-only testing, were about flat, given the comparison to prior year respiratory testing sales that negatively impacted base growth by about 400 basis points.\nOn an underlying basis, Life Sciences base revenues grew approximately 4%. Total company base revenue growth was strong across all regions with high single-digit growth in the U.S. and internationally, including strong double-digit growth in China. Strong performance in our Medical segment reflects execution of our growth strategies across our key end markets. This includes an MDS where we continue to drive growth in Vascular Access Management with our BD PosiFlush vascular care and PIVC catheter solutions.\nIn Medication Management solutions, our investments in high-growth areas like pharmacy automation are driving strong growth, led by our Parata acquisition and BD ROWA. Our MMS dispensing platform reported double-digit growth, reflecting our continuous innovations in BD Pyxis, including the BD HealthSight portfolio.\nAnd in Pharma Systems, in the higher-growth pharma and biotech drug delivery end market, our capacity expansion investments and strong leadership position in prefillable solutions with BD Hypak and newer innovations in products such as BD-Neopac, PDF Avax and BD Hylok are driving our 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, while supporting the increased demand in high-growth categories like biologics.\nLife Sciences base business growth was about flat and approximately 4% underlying when adjusting for the respiratory testing sales comparison. This reflects execution of our growth strategies across our key end markets, including microbiology, molecular diagnostics and single-cell analysis. It was partially offset by impact of some U.S. distributors destocking in specimen management.\nIn our IDS business, double-digit growth in microbiology reflects demand for our BD Kiestra lab automation solution, including continued adoption of the IdentifA and total Modular track solutions and strong demand for our blood culture and IDAST reagents.\nContinued strong growth in molecular IVD assays reflects leverage of BD COR and the incremental BD MAX installed base. In Biosciences, high single-digit growth was driven by our clinical business with strong double-digit growth in cancer reagents, leveraging the growth in our installed base of fair analyzers and adoption of FactsDuet automation.\nPerformance in Research Solutions reflects continued strong growth in research reagents enabled by our innovative BD Horizon dies. Strong performance in our Interventional segment reflects execution of our growth strategies across our key end markets, including advanced repair reconstruction, PVD and incontinence, where our newer innovations in high-growth areas are continuing to contribute nicely to growth.\nOur Surgery business unit delivered strong double-digit growth driven by continued market adoption of Pyxis hernia resorbable scaffold and our PI business unit, double-digit growth in peripheral vascular disease was driven by broad-based strength across the portfolio, including global penetration of Rotarex.\nIn our UCC business unit, high single-digit growth was driven by strength across the portfolio, including strong double-digit growth of our PureWick solutions for addressing chronic incontinence in both the acute and alternate care settings and double-digit growth in Endourology. Further details regarding each segment's performance in the quarter can be found in today's earnings announcement and presentation.\nNow moving to our P&L. We reported Q3 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.96, which included gross margin of 52.6% and operating margin of 23%. Operating margin improved 100 basis points year-over-year and includes an unfavorable 100 basis point impact from the accounting treatment of an employee benefit-related item that gets recorded in G&A and is fully offset in other income with no resulting impact to EPS.\nExcluding this item, operating margin increased 200 basis points and was ahead of our expectations driven by strong execution against our margin improvement initiatives. Foreign currency was a 50 basis point headwind to both gross margin and operating margin.\nGross margin performance reflects leveraging our strong revenue growth and the benefit of our simplification and inflation mitigation initiatives that enabled us to overcome 200 basis points of outsized inflation. Our Q3 margin drivers are aligned with what we have been anticipating throughout the year, which is that most of the full year margin improvement will come from SSG&A expense leverage.\nQ3 SSG&A expense increased about 4% year-over-year. Excluding the employee benefit-related item, we drove about 150 basis points of leverage in SSG&A, which reflects shipping efficiency and good leverage in selling and G&A expense. As expected, R&D as a percentage of sales of 5.9% and normalized back towards our expected full year average of about 6% in Q3, given our spending was over-indexed in the first half.\nIn summary, we continue to execute well and fully delivered our Q3 operating margin goal with operating improvement, excluding the employee benefit item nicely leveraged by 200 basis points. Below operating margin, the improvement in other income reflects the offset to the employee benefit-related expense recorded in G&A.\nOur tax rate in Q3 was 15.7% and due to benefits realized that were not previously contemplated. Regarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totaled $1.7 billion year-to-date, as expected, operating cash flows improved substantially in Q3, including a reduction in inventory from the prior quarter.\nWe anticipate a continued normalization of working capital in Q4, including further improvements in our inventory balance as we trend toward levels that are closer to the prior year. We ended Q3 with a cash balance of approximately $1 billion. During the quarter, we repaid over $1 billion in debt maturities, utilizing the proceeds from the February debt refinancing. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 2.9x. We continue to move towards our net leverage target of 2.5x.\nIn summary, we executed well against our cash and net leverage improvement goals this quarter. We remain committed to enhancing our cash conversion and net leverage positions and expect more progress in Q4, including benefiting from the net proceeds from the divestiture of our surgical instrumentation platform which will increase our capacity to deploy cash towards tuck-in M&A.\nMoving to our guidance for fiscal '23. For your convenience, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can also be found in our presentation. Starting with our updated revenue guidance before the divestiture of the surgical instrumentation platform. Given our strong third quarter performance, we are raising the midpoint of our base revenue guidance by 25 basis points to 7% and we now expect base revenues to be between 6.8% and 7.1%. This includes increases in the midpoint of both organic and inorganic revenue growth and reflects strong third quarter organic performance as well as inorganic momentum driven by our Parata pharmacy automation solution, demonstrating our strong execution and M&A integration capabilities.\nInorganic revenue is now expected to contribute approximately 135 basis points to full year base revenue growth. For the full year, base organic revenue growth is now expected to be 5.5% to 5.8%, which continues to reflect strong fourth quarter organic revenue growth of about 6%. Our guidance continues to include the impact of strategic portfolio exits, which has moderated slightly from our original assumption.\nFinally, adjusting for the impact of the recently completed surgical instrumentation divestiture. Adjusts our updated base revenue growth guidance by 20 basis points to a range of 6.6% to 6.9% to reflect net inorganic revenue adjustments to base growth of approximately 115 basis points. Our increased base organic revenue growth guidance of 5.5% to 5.8% is not impacted.\nOver a 2-year period, we are driving strong base organic revenue CAGR of about 7%, which is well above our long-term target. Our segment-specific growth assumptions have not changed. For COVID-only testing, our guidance only includes year-to-date revenues of $56 million. All in, we expect reported revenues to be approximately $19.3 billion, which is an increase from our previous guidance of $19.2 billion to $19.3 billion.\nRegarding the Alaris 510(k) clearance. As previously disclosed, we expect to ramp our return to market in our infusion business over time with our existing customers and remediation taking first priority. As we scale our manufacturing capacity and ensure we are taking the necessary actions to deliver our products in the right way, we are well positioned to engage with customers and execute as quickly as possible.\nHowever, we do not expect any material incremental revenue contribution from Alaris for the remainder of FY '23, and we expect to begin a more regular rhythm of shipment and installation of devices and recognizing revenue as we progress through FY '24.\nWithin our FY '23 guidance range, we expect to absorb any initial investments beyond the sales and service organizations we retained to successfully support our return to market. Regarding our assumptions on earnings, we continue to expect operating margins to improve by at least 100 basis points for the full year. We are executing as planned and have line of sight to our targeted margin improvement.\nBelow operating income, our assumption regarding interest other remains unchanged. We have lowered our effective tax rate guidance to be between 13% and 13.5%. The midpoint of our updated tax guidance range is essentially equivalent to our FY '22 actual effective tax rate of 13.3% and as a result, is not incrementally contributing to FY '23 EPS growth.\nOur adjusted EPS guidance range of $12.10 to $12.32 remains unchanged but reflects absorbing a $0.02 negative impact from the divestiture of our surgical instrumentation platform and a $0.05 negative impact from the latest FX rates. We are raising our base business earnings forecast by $0.07 based on our strong third quarter performance, including consistent execution of our margin goals, offsetting the impact of the divestiture and FX.\nOn a currency-neutral basis, we now expect adjusted EPS growth of about 10% to 11.5% and driven by very strong mid-teens base business growth of approximately 14.5% to 16%, an increase of 50 basis points from our prior expectation. As a result, given our strong growth and execution on a year-to-date basis versus our original guidance in November. We've increased our adjusted base business earnings per share by about $0.27, and which added 225 basis points to growth, resulting in the 14.5% to 16% growth on our base.\nThis also includes absorbing another year of outsized inflation of about 200 basis points. These strong base business results enabled us to fully absorb an increased earnings headwind and associated with the loss of COVID-only revenue as well as lost earnings associated with the recent surgical instrumentation divestiture and still increase our total FXN growth rate by 75 basis points to 10% to 11.5% double-digit earnings growth.\nAs you think about Q4, the following are a few key considerations. We've outlined more detail in the accompanying presentation slides. First, our increased organic guidance continues to reflect strong growth of about 6% in Q4. As a reminder, we've now anniversaried the acquisitions of Parata and MedKeeper.\nSecond, as you think about margins, as we've described throughout the year, most of the full year improvement is expected to come from SG&A expense leverage with the balance from slight improvement in gross margin which has been muted year-to-date because of outsized inflation. For operating margin, we continue to expect significant year-over-year margin expansion in Q4. However, versus our last update in May, the amount of expansion needed has been reduced by about 75 basis points, and thus, we derisked our Q4 delivery.\nThere are several factors driving Q4 operating margin, including expense leverage, on expected strong revenue performance, inflation mitigation actions to offset outsized inflation and cost of goods sold, SSG&A expense reductions driven by the timing of spend and the full quarter impact of our more recent simplification initiatives.\nAlso, R&D as a percentage of revenue will continue to moderate lower to about 5% of sales, resulting in full year spend of about 6%. Finally, there is also a favorable comparison to the prior year reinvestment of COVID-only testing profits.\nAs we look ahead to FY '24, we remain confident in our ability to deliver against our BD2025 strategic and financial goals. While it is premature to commit to specifics, I can offer the following thoughts as we look ahead. As discussed, we continue to operate in a macro environment that remains uncertain and an inflationary environment that has moderated but remains elevated.\nWe are especially focused on monitoring how various governments such as China respond to economic and other dynamics. With that said, med tech in general has proven to be much more durable during times of uncertainty, including economic downturns. And certainly, BD has a proven strategy and has demonstrated not only the ability to be resilient but to deliver strong growth in earnings during the most challenging times.\nOur market-leading portfolio, strong innovation pipeline, continued shift into high-growth end markets and track record of execution gives us confidence in delivering against our 5.5% plus target next year. With respect to Alaris, we are excited to shift our focus and reengage with our customers. The clearance of Alaris offers much needed certainty to our stakeholders. As previously noted, it increases our confidence in executing against our BD2025 targets. Just 2 weeks after clearance, it would be premature to provide a range of expected revenue in FY '24. However, consistent with what we've shared we expect to ramp revenues back to our pre ship hold level of approximately $400 million over time.\nOur focus will be replacing and upgrading pumps for our existing customers. At this juncture, knowing we have some level of Alaris revenue in our FY '23 base of around $100 million, we would anticipate a modest level of revenue above that, which could result in about a 50 basis point tailwind to growth in FY '24.\nAs a result, based on current assumptions and the macro environment factors I mentioned we are monitoring, our base growth with Aleris would be approximately 6%. We will share more about other assumptions across our portfolio when we solidify our FY '24 plans. As a reminder, if you look outside of our base business, in FY '23, we have realized nearly $60 million in COVID-only revenue.\nBased on current dynamics, we would not expect material revenue in FY '24 and which results in an expected headwind of about 30 basis points that you need to adjust for. Additionally, the sale of the surgical instrumentation platform will have nearly a 75 basis point impact to total growth. This does not impact our organic growth, which should be considered in your total FX revenue growth.\nWe will true up for currency when we provide FY '24 guidance in November. Regarding earnings, we remain confident in our double-digit earnings growth profile of about 10% currency-neutral EPS growth. This includes absorbing the reduction to earnings associated with lower COVID-only testing revenue and the divestiture impact. Combined, these items are worth about 125 basis points. We will share more details when we give our guidance, but given we expect to finish FY '23 at 70% of our 25% operating margin goal by '25. At this point, we are tracking ahead of our 2025 margin goals.\nImportantly, this gives us the flexibility to deliver on our margin goals while investing to maximize growth and deliver on our double-digit earnings growth target. As we finalize our plans, we will look at optimizing the ratio of growth versus margin increase that delivers against these goals.\nIn summary, we see our value proposition as differentiated and importantly, have consistently executed against our commitments, which gives us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver against our future goals. In closing, we are consistently delivering multiple periods of outsized financial performance.\nI would like to thank our associates around the world who are working hard to deliver on our purpose and help us achieve these results. As we look forward and as reflected in our FY '23 guidance and our progress towards our BD2025 long-term targets, we are well positioned for continued growth. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue?"

Polen\n\nPresident, Becton, Dickinson & Co.\n\nThanks, Francesca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported another consecutive quarter of strong financial performance and significant progress advancing our innovation pipeline. The results we have been delivering for multiple periods reflect our strategy and action. We are now about halfway through our BD2025 plan to accelerate growth and simplify and empower our company, and I'd like to share how our team's strong execution of our strategy is driving our performance and will enable continued momentum through 2025 and beyond.\nWe have made purposeful and strategic investments which we're seeing contribute to consistent higher growth and strong financial performance. We have been and remain very intentional with how we are deploying our capital towards higher growth spaces and are pleased with the significant progress we continue to make increasing our WAMGR. These actions have evolved BD into an agile, innovative and durable medical technology company with a compelling growth profile. Our innovation mindset is driving higher product development velocity and super cycles of innovation in many of our businesses through a focus on the most impactful programs, improved milestone achievement and launch excellence.\nTo highlight a few examples of our strategy and investments and how they're fueling strong results and momentum, first, in [ farm ] systems. Through the start of our BD2025 journey, we made a bold decision to invest $1.2 billion in additional capacity. Today, we're seeing this capacity investment, along with several new innovations we've brought to market, paying off as we are ideally positioned to enable delivery of the large wave of biotech drugs coming to market. We've built [ farm ] systems into a $2 billion growth platform with 11 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. With over 70% of the top 100 biopharma companies using BD's portfolio and 6x the capacity of the nearest competitor, we are well positioned to continue delivering strong growth.\nSecond, during COVID, we also made several strategic reinvestments of certain COVID-only testing proceeds, particularly in our B2B business which is one of the areas with a super cycle of new breakthrough innovations coming to market over this in the next several years. We've already begun to see acceleration from some of the early new launches, notably in biopharma for cell therapy and immuno-oncology research. We're looking forward to the upcoming launch of our FACSDiscover S8 Cell Sorter that was previously featured on the cover of the journal, Science. The S8 combines advanced spectral flow cytometry with novel CellView image technology, By combining the power of high-parameter spectral flow cytometry with an unprecedented picture of a cell and its inner workings, we are defining a new standard in flow cytometry which will empower scientists to unlock life-changing discoveries across fields like immunology, cancer research and cell biology. We recently shipped our first early access BD FACSDiscover S8 and we remain on track for launch later this quarter.\nWe've also already begun launching a new family of spectrally optimized BD Horizon reagents that, together with the FACSDiscover S8, will create a unique spectral solution inclusive of instruments, dies and informatics that only BD can offer.\nThird, as you know, we have been very purposeful in increasing tuck-in M&A to drive scale within high-growth adjacent markets and have built strong M&A capabilities to successfully integrate assets. Our most recent acquisition of Parata Pharmacy Automation Solutions continues to exceed our expectations, and we're already seeing an early impact from revenue synergies. The Parata acquisition expanded our offering to establish BD as a leader in pharmacy automation and created a new growth platform with revenues in excess of $0.5 billion growing double digits. This is an attractive growing market that uses automation to address a number of the critical issues faced by our customers such as wage inflation, labor attrition, pharmacist burnout and the need to reallocate pharmacists' valuable time to clinical care. Parata is just one example of the successful tuck-in acquisitions we've made over the last several years. These acquisitions are currently contributing about 30 basis points to our organic growth rate this year. And once Parata annualizes, we expect that contribution will increase to about 50 basis points.\nLastly, we continue to build on our strong competency of serially innovating on and expanding the application of new technologies we develop or acquire. This is exemplified in our Urology and Critical Care business, where our acquisition of PureWick continues to provide significant benefits to patients and is also an impactful growth driver for UCC. We've already launched the home version of PureWick Female, which continues to be very well received and is aligned with our focus on providing solutions and new care settings. And at the end of FY '22, we launched PureWick Male, the newest product in our planned portfolio expansion for managing incontinence. PureWick Male provides nurses with a noninvasive option for urine management in men, enabling early catheter removal and reduced risk of infection. We are receiving exceptional customer feedback, and the adoption of PureWick Male is exceeding our expectations. We have multiple additional R&D programs in the pipeline to continue to expand our solutions in incontinence.\nThese are just some of the examples of key investment decisions we have executed to strengthen our business, contributing to our performance today and over the long term.\nTurning to our quarterly financial results. We are seeing the strength of our BD2025 strategy and action across all businesses and geographies in our Q2 performance. We delivered another quarter of outstanding results that exceeded our expectations with 8.7% base revenue growth and double-digit currency-neutral earnings growth. While we are excited by what we have achieved to date, we have much more to look forward to.\nLet me provide a few examples of how we progressed our pipeline this quarter, starting with our recent launches. In our BD Medical segment, we launched our [ Power Me ] midline catheter in China. And by the beginning of March, it was being used in the first patient. [ Power Me ] was designed by our R&D center in China for China, and we're excited about the opportunity it creates to develop a new category of vascular access in China. In our Life Sciences segment, we're really excited about how the BD COR platform is expanding us into the high-throughput, high-growth molecular diagnostics market. In Q2, we received 510(k) clearance for our new Vaginal Panel on BD COR, the world's first microbiome-based PCR assay that uses a single swab and test to simultaneously detect the 3 most common causes of vaginitis infections, enabling targeted cost-effective treatment. And in our BDI segment, we launched our [ Highlander 014 PTA balloon ] in Q2. Highlander is the first and only noncompliant fiber-based balloon designed to treat peripheral artery disease in below-the-knee anatomy. We are proud to be leading in this space, building on our history of continuous innovation in the higher-growth PVD market.\nWe've also hit several crucial milestones this quarter. These include regulatory submissions of the [ Pevo Pro ] as well as [ BD Next Eva ] with near port IV access, which are core elements of our one stick hospital stay and vascular access management strategy in our MDS business. In our Biosciences business, we completed the early access program for our BD Rhapsody HT Xpress, and in fact, I'm pleased to report that just in the last few days, we announced the launch. The HT Xpress a single cell analysis system that increases the throughput of the BD Rhapsody platform eightfold while maintaining compatibility with our existing single cell assays and reagents. This new instrument enables access to the fast-growing translational single-cell multi-omics market with a high throughput research solution.\nAnd in our surgery business, we completed testing for our Phasix ST Umbilical product to support a 510(k) submission later this fiscal year. Phasix ST Umbilical is designed to provide patients a reliable alternative to permanent mesh, bringing the benefits of the category-leading bioresorbable Phasix material into one of the most common abdominal wall hernia procedures. Phasix ST Umbilical will be the first fully resorbable product customized for open umbilical repairs, which represents the majority of umbilical procedures. This is another example of a technology we acquired and are now expanding and accelerating the growth of. These launches and milestones are good examples of how we are strengthening our position in attractive end markets across our portfolio.\nWhile we advance our growth strategy, we also remain focused on our #1 priority to bring the Alaris pump back to market. We are confident in the resources invested in our submission, the team and leadership tasked to prioritize this and that we will get clearance. As we have stated in the past, the relaunch of Alaris is included in the BD2025 strategic plan. And while we cannot predict clearance time lines, we can ensure that we are prepared for the relaunch with the proper operational capacity and functional capabilities so that we can provide our customers with the best experience. As a reminder, we've launched an updated Alaris pump in several international markets and continue to receive very positive feedback from customers.\nIn Q2, we continued to simplify our company with programs across our manufacturing network, our portfolio and our operating model. We made further progress on our Recode portfolio simplification program, which reduces SKUs in order to improve customer service and focus on the most important products needed to deliver care. We remain on track to remove 20% of our total portfolio by 2025, having achieved more than half of these SKU reductions thus far. In addition, we have numerous initiatives underway to consolidate our manufacturing footprint, improve cost and service while delivering on our ESG goals to address climate change and carbon neutrality.\nEarlier this year, we expanded our Recode initiative to include our operating model to drive efficiency and effectiveness and simplify our organization to improve agility. These actions resulted in us reducing our overall headcount by about 2% this year. We also recently made the strategic decision to partner with a leading business process and professional services firm and are transitioning certain BD shared service center business processes. They will be working to optimize our back-office processes and services using automation, data and process excellence that they have implemented very successfully with other large companies. Collectively, our simplification programs are a core part of our strategy to drive efficiency and enable impactful growth.\nTo share some perspective on the macro environment. Overall, the environment continues to stabilize and is in line with our view that challenges will persist, not escalate. While we're seeing signs of inflation cooling off, it is still more than twice the historical average. We see continued labor pressure with different market dynamics impacting hiring and increasing wages for certain roles, particularly in our supply chain organization. Across raw materials, some categories such as resins used in finished goods are beginning to show signs of stabilization. But overall, they have not come down universally and remain well above prior cost levels.\nIn terms of supply availability, we have seen significant improvements across materials, supplies and labor, which are driving our back order reduction, leading us to recover towards prepandemic supply levels. Broadly speaking, we are seeing stabilization and continued overall procedure volume recovery and volume momentum. Specific to China, we delivered strong performance despite some impact from increased COVID cases in the region and reduced hospital capacity that carried into Q2. We experienced a strong recovery in March and remain well positioned for continued growth in China.\nOur strategy has proven to enable strong results in some of the most challenging times. And by successfully navigating the macro environment, we are distinguishing BD and remain well positioned to deliver continued strong performance.\nBefore I turn it over to Chris, I'll provide an update on the progress our team is making to advance our ESG strategy and goals. We continue to be proud of our leading focus on reducing the environmental impact of our product portfolio, and we recently announced the launch of our new circular economy pilots in several regions. We are partnering with health care facilities and waste management companies to recycle user materials, including BD syringes in the U.S. and BD vacutainers in Denmark.\nIn addition to launching our 2022 cybersecurity annual report in early Q2, we also established the BD Cybersecurity Risk Committee, which serves as the management level governance body for oversight of all cybersecurity risk across the company. The committee is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and its members include cybersecurity leaders across enterprise, manufacturing and product cybersecurity as well as key functional leaders.\nWe are also proud to receive continued recognition for our ongoing commitment to talent and culture. Most recently, we were named a noteworthy company for the fourth straight year in Diversity Inc.'s annual ranking of the top U.S. companies for diversity. We look forward to providing further updates on the commitments, disclosures and progress on the 4 pillars of our ESG strategy: company health, planet health, community health and human health as we publish our 15th annual ESG report later this year.\nIn summary, I'm proud of our progress and the positive impact our associates are delivering for our customers and patients around the world. Our purposeful and strategic investments in attractive end markets are driving higher growth and creating value. Our innovation mindset is improving our pipeline execution and launch excellence and creating the most exciting product pipeline in the company's history. Our simplification efforts are reducing complexity and driving business process excellence and agility. Our increased guidance for fiscal '23 reflects our strategy and action, strong execution by our team and a strengthened growth profile. We will continue to increase investments to support profitable growth through 2025 and beyond.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance and outlook.\n\nChristopher J. DelOrefice\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Tom. Echoing Tom's comments, our BD2025 strategy is driving consistent performance and demonstrates our strong growth profile. With our year-to-date performance, we are well on track to achieve our FY '25 long-term targets.\nBeginning with some color on our revenue performance. We delivered strong Q2 base revenue growth of 8.7% or 7% organic. This includes growing over prior year flu-COVID combination sales, which negatively impacted growth by over 200 basis points, and an impact from onetime strategic portfolio exits of about 50 basis points. Adjusting for these impacts, organic volume growth was in the strong mid-single digits at nearly 6%. In addition to the inorganic revenue contribution from M&A, we continue to drive organic growth from acquisitions that have anniversaried, which was about 30 basis points in the quarter. COVID-only testing revenues were $16 million in the quarter, which, as expected, declined from $214 million last year.\nTotal company base business growth was strong across BD Medical and BD Interventional with growth of 12.2% and 9.3%, respectively. Base revenue growth in BD Life Sciences of 2.2% includes a negative impact of about 800 basis points due to the comparison to higher combination flu-COVID testing sales last year attributable to the Omicron wave, coupled with the timing of this year's respiratory season that peaked earlier than normal during fiscal Q1 and then declined. Base revenue growth was strong across all regions,with high single-digit growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth internationally, including 9% growth in China. For the full year, we expect to deliver high single-digit growth in China.\nOur growth continues to reflect consistent performance of our durable core portfolio and our shift into attractive and higher growth end markets. Strong performance in our Medical segment reflects execution of our growth strategies across our key end markets. This includes our durable COR, where we continue to drive growth in Vascular Access Management with our BD Posiflush and Catheter Solutions. In Medication Management Solutions, our investments in high-growth areas like pharmacy automation are driving strong growth, led by our Parata acquisition and BD ROWA. In our dispensing platform, continuous innovations in BD Pyxis, including the recent launch of BD Pyxis ES 1.7 and the BD HealthSight portfolio drove double-digit growth. And in [ farm ] systems in the higher-growth pharma and biotech drug delivery end market, our capacity investments and newer innovations and products such as BD Effivax, BD Hylok and BD Neopak are driving continued double-digit growth.\nStrong underlying performance in our Life Sciences segment reflects growth in our durable core and specimen management and execution of our growth strategies across our key end markets, including single cell analysis, microbiology and molecular diagnostics. In our IDS business, growth in microbiology reflects demand for our BD Kiestra lab automation solution including adoption of the recently launched IdentifA and total modular track solutions. Double-digit growth in molecular IVD assays reflects continued leverage of our large installed base. In Biosciences, high-teens growth was driven by new innovations in BD Horizon dyes and our expanded antibody portfolio that drove double-digit growth in research reagents and continued strong demand for our BD FACSymphony flow cytometry analyzers.\nStrong performance in our Interventional segment reflects execution of our growth strategies across our key end markets, including advanced repair and reconstruction, PBD, oncology and incontinence. Our newer innovations in higher growth areas are all contributing nicely to growth. Our surgery business unit delivered strong double-digit growth with continued market adoption of Phasix hernia resorbable scaffold, driving double-digit growth in advanced repair and reconstruction and double-digit growth in biosurgery that was aided by Arista. In our PI business unit, the relaunch of Venovo and global penetration of Rotarex are driving high single-digit growth. In our UCC business unit, high single-digit growth continues to be driven by strong double-digit growth of the PureWick franchise that was aided by the recent launch of PureWick Male. Across BDI, procedure volumes were also strong in the quarter, contributing to growth, particularly in our Surgery business unit. Further details regarding each segment's performance in the quarter to be found in today's earnings announcement and presentation.\nNow moving to our P&L. We reported Q2 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.86, which included gross margin of 54.2%, which was slightly ahead of our expectations, and operating margin of 22.7% that was in line with expectations. Our margin performance reflects leveraging our strong revenue growth, the benefit of our simplification and inflation mitigation initiatives and strategic portfolio exits that enabled our ability to more than overcome nearly 200 basis points of outsized inflation, which was in line with our expectations. Gross margin also reflects negative FX, which was slightly higher than anticipated.\nSSG&A expense increased 5% year-over-year. Half of the SSG&A increase was driven by the unfavorable impact of an employee benefit-related item that gets recorded in G&A and is offset in other income with no resulting impact to EPS. Excluding the employee benefit-related item, we drove about 50 basis points of leverage in SSG&A with shipping growth in line with revenues and good leverage in selling expense.\nAs expected, our phasing of R&D continues to be weighted to the first half of the year with R&D as a percent of sales of 6.5% in Q2. Our R&D investments are aligned to our long-term growth strategy and have been a catalyst to increased velocity of product development. In summary, we continue to execute well and fully delivered our Q2 operating margin goal with operating improvement, excluding the employee benefit item nicely leveraged by 80 basis points, including absorbing a 30 basis point headwind from lower COVID-only testing. Our tax rate in Q2 was lower than anticipated due to the timing of certain discrete items that were contemplated to occur during the year.\nRegarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totaled $584 million year-to-date. Operating cash flow reflects an elevated inventory balance that has enabled our strong performance and ability to meet peak demand and support our customers' needs while navigating the complexity of the macro environment. We remain focused on reducing our inventory balance and have several initiatives underway to do so. As a result, while we saw peak inventory levels during the quarter, we exited the quarter with positive progress towards reducing inventory. We expect inventory to continue to decline over the balance of the year with the most prominent reduction expected in Q4 to levels similar to the prior year. We're also driving more effective capital expenditures for the full year and expect expenditures to be similar to the prior year.\nWe ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $2 billion, which includes the proceeds from debt refinancing during the quarter that will be utilized to repay maturing debt over the balance of the year. We ended Q2 with a net leverage ratio of 3.1x. We expect to pay down our commercial paper over the balance of the year and move towards our net leverage target of 2.5x. As the year progresses and we build cash, we will increase our capacity to deploy cash towards tuck-in M&A.\nMoving to our guidance for fiscal '23. For your convenience, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can also be found in our presentation. Given our quarter performance, we are confident in raising the midpoint of our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. The strength of our base revenue growth and consistent execution of our margin goals is enabling our ability to offset lower COVID-only testing revenues and the latest FX rates while reinvesting in the business to drive future growth.\nStarting with revenues, I will provide some insights into some of our key guidance assumptions. First, we are well positioned for strong growth across our 3 segments,which are delivering at or above our expectations, and thus, we are increasing our base revenue guidance. On a currency-neutral basis, we now expect base revenues to grow 6.5% to 7%. This is an increase of 50 basis points at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 5.75% to 6.75% and is driven by our Q2 revenue outperformance and the confidence we have in our team's continued strong execution and our consistent growth profile.\nFollowing our strong FY '22 growth of 9.4%, we again increased our revenue guidance in FY '23, which at the midpoint brings our 2-year average growth to about 8% or 7% organic, which is well above our 5.5% plus target. Increased base revenue guidance includes both higher organic and inorganic growth expectations for the full year. We now expect inorganic revenue to contribute approximately 125 basis points of base revenue growth for the full year, which is an increase of 25 basis points driven by the strong execution of Parata. Organic based revenue growth is now expected to be 5.25% to 5.75%, an increase of 25 basis points at the midpoint. Both our base revenue and base organic revenue growth continue to include a reduction of approximately 100 basis points resulting from our planned onetime strategic portfolio exits.\nWhile we aren't providing segment-specific guidance, we are on track to deliver strong performance across our segments this fiscal year, in line with our long-term planned commitments. We expect Medical segment growth to be above the total company range, which includes the acquisition of Parata, Life Sciences growth to be below given strong prior year comparisons and Interventional to be above the total company range. For COVID-only testing, we are now assuming about $50 million in revenue versus our previous expectation of about $50 million to $100 million, driven by the reduced testing volumes as a result of the early peak and rapid decline of the respiratory season. All in, we are increasing our reported revenue guidance by approximately $50 million at the midpoint to a range of $19.2 billion to $19.3 billion compared to $19.1 billion to $19.3 billion previously.\nRegarding Alaris, we continue to only model shipments related to medical necessity in line with fiscal '22 demand.\nRegarding our assumptions on earnings, we continue to expect operating margins to improve by at least 100 basis points for the full year. We are executing as planned and the actions required for the year to drive margin improvement remain unchanged. Our focus on driving profitable revenue growth, combined with the significant simplify actions in place, including the previously planned operating model programs that we recently announced, gives us the confidence that we will again deliver meaningful margin expansion this year while absorbing about 200 basis points of outsized inflation and the incremental decline in COVID-only revenue, which has a higher margin profile.\nBelow operating income, our assumptions regarding interest other remains unchanged, and we have narrowed our effective tax rate guidance to 13.25% to 14%. We expect adjusted EPS to be between $12.10 and $12.32, which represents an increase of $0.015 at the midpoint. This reflects a base business increase of $0.115 that is driving our ability to offset incremental headwinds of approximately $0.05 each from COVID-only testing and foreign currency. Our adjusted EPS guidance reflects currency-neutral growth that is around double digits and within a range of approximately 9.5% to 11%. This includes very strong mid-teens base business growth of approximately 14% to 15.5%, which is over 100 basis points higher than we previously anticipated and is driving our ability to absorb the decline in COVID-only testing.\nOur updated guidance reflects significant progress towards delivering the BD2025 financial targets we laid out at our Investor Day, including: a strong 2-year organic base revenue CAGR of about 7%, which is well above our 5.5% plus long-term target; at least 380 basis points or about 70% of our targeted 540 basis points of base operating margin expansion toward our targeted 25% margin levels in FY '25; and a strong high-teens 2-year base business EPS CAGR, which is also well above our double-digit long-term target.\nAs we think of fiscal '23 phasing, let me provide some comments for you to consider as you model out the balance of the year. We've outlined more detail in the accompanying presentation slides, but the following are key areas to note. First, regarding base revenues, the midpoint of our updated guidance continues to reflect strong organic growth of about 6% in the second half of the year. We expect organic growth to be fairly ratable over the quarters with some different prior year comparisons in each quarter. As a reminder, we will anniversary the inorganic contribution from the Parata and Medkeeper acquisitions in Q3, which means that Q4 base revenue will be all organic.\nSecond, as you think about margins, as we have described throughout the year, most of the full year improvement will come from SSG&A expense leverage with the balance from slight improvement in gross margin, which is muted because of outsized inflation in fiscal year '23. We've seen that play out over the first 2 quarters where gross margin was slightly below the prior year margin in Q1 and slightly above in Q2. We expect a similar dynamic in Q3 where you should be slightly ahead of the prior year's 52.6%. For operating margin, our expectation is for Q3 year-over-year margin improvement, similar to our full year operating margin expansion expectation and slight improvement sequentially from the 22.7% in Q2. R&D as a percent of revenue will moderate down towards our expected full year average of about 6% in Q3, while Q4 will be the low at about 5% of sales.\nLastly, the midpoint of our full year effective tax rate guidance indicates an estimated tax rate of about 16.5% for the balance of the year, which is best to assume occurs evenly in Q3 and Q4 as the exact timing of any other discrete items is hard to predict. In closing, as we approach the halfway point, our BD2025 strategy has consistently delivered multiple periods of strong financial performance. As we look forward and as reflected in our FY '23 guidance and our progress towards our BD2025 long-term targets, we are well positioned for continued growth.\nWith that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue, please?"

I will also call your attention to the basis of presentation slide, which defines terms such as base revenues and continuing operations.\nWith that, I'm very pleased to turn it over to Tom.\n\nThomas E. Polen\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered another quarter of strong performance in Q1. Our results reflect the momentum of our BD2025 strategy, which we are driving through a powerful combination of innovation and strong execution.\nWe exceeded our revenue and earnings expectations in Q1 despite market disruption in China and continue to drive consistent durable performance in our base business, with revenue growth of 5.2% and $2.98 in adjusted diluted EPS. Our results are a testament to the continued relentless focus by our team of talented associates who are delivering BD products and solutions that are enabling our customers to provide high-quality, cost-effective care to patients around the world.\nIn Q1, we continued to make excellent progress driving all 3 pillars of our strategy to accelerate growth, simplify the company and empower our associates. Our growth continues to reflect consistent performance of our durable core, which has become known as the backbone of health care, and our continued shift into attractive and higher-growth end markets through investments in both R&D and tuck-in M&A. These higher-growth transformative solutions are focused in the 3 areas we see reshaping health care and where we are currently investing approximately 60% of our R&D. And that's in smart connected care, enabling new care settings and improving chronic disease outcomes.\nToday, we have what I believe is the most exciting innovation pipeline in the history of the company. And through our investments, we are systematically increasing the WAMGR across our portfolio and supporting our strong growth profile. I'll highlight a few of the end markets that are driving our growth and some of the key products recently launched and in our pipeline that we're excited about.\nOur Medical segment is focused on improving medication delivery across a wide range of settings, making it safer, simpler and smarter across end markets that include: Medication management solutions, pharmacy automation, pharma and biotech drug delivery and vascular access management, where we recently launched PosiFlush SafeScrub, consistent with the expected launch timing we shared on our Q3 FY '22 call.\nA prefilled flush syringe with an integrated disinfection device, PosiFlush SafeScrub is designed to simplify nursing workflow and enhance compliance with infection prevention guidelines. It's a good example of how we're driving continuous innovation that extends our leadership in our durable core and within the broader $9 billion vascular access management market.\nAnother milestone in our vascular access portfolio was clearance of our new PowerMe Midline Catheter by the Chinese regulatory agency, NMPA. This was designed by our R&D center in China for China and is our first midline in this geography and offers up to 30 days of continuous venous access while reducing patient complications. We're excited about the opportunity PowerMe creates to help develop a new category for vascular access in China, and we look forward to the expected launch later this quarter.\nOur BD Life Sciences segment provides solutions from sample collection and discovery to diagnosis, and serves dynamic end markets, like single cell analysis, clinical microbiology, point-of-care and the molecular diagnostics market, where we continue to advance our strategy of menu expansion with initial sales outside the U.S. of our BD MAX respiratory viral panel, or RVP.\nThis multiplex respiratory panel detects COVID-19, flu A and B and RSV in a single test and is an ideal solution for endemic respiratory testing. This aligns to our strategy to accelerate our growth in the $4 billion molecular diagnostics end market that's growing about 9%. The RVP panel is currently under FDA EUA review for U.S. launch.\nWe also continue to progress our strategy in blood collection at the point of care. Point of care is one of the fastest-growing categories in diagnostics today that we believe will accelerate as diagnostic testing migrates to new and more convenient care settings, such as retail clinics and pharmacies and even the potential of at home.\nOur BD MiniDraw capillary blood collection system is a disruptive innovation that enables collection of a high-quality blood sample without a venipuncture and is designed to provide a better patient experience across a broad range of care settings. We remain on track for 510(k) submission by the second half of FY '23.\nOur BD Interventional segment, which provides solutions for chronic disease management, serves end markets that dramatically improve people's lives, such as oncology, incontinence, advanced repair and reconstruction and the $5 billion peripheral vascular disease market, a space that's growing about 6%.\nWithin PVD, we continued our strategy to globalize the BDI portfolio with the recent launch of our Venovo venous stent in China, the first stent in this market specifically designed for iliofemoral venous disease.\nWithin the $3 billion oncology end market, a space also growing about 6%, we achieved a significant milestone, completing safety testing for our multimodality vacuum-assisted biopsy system, and we're on track for FDA submission and launch in FY '24. The BD multimodality VAB device is expected to be the first vacuum-assisted biopsy system designed to work across all 3 imaging modalities of ultrasound, CT and MRI, allowing customers to consolidate capital equipment, standardize consumables and simplify physician and nurse training.\nThese launches and milestones are good examples of how we're strengthening our position in attractive end markets across our portfolio.\nOur purposeful strategic investments in R&D as well as tuck-in M&A and CapEx are supported by our strong, flexible balance sheet and disciplined and balanced capital deployment strategy. This framework also gives us the flexibility to return capital to shareholders through a competitive dividend and share repurchases.\nIn Q1, we also continued to simplify our company with programs across our manufacturing network, our portfolio and most recently our operating model. More specifically, we continue to make progress on our RECODE portfolio simplification program, where we are reducing SKUs of older-generation products in order to focus on the most important products needed to deliver care today.\nWe remain on track to remove 20% of our total portfolio by 2025, having achieved more than half of these SKU reductions thus far. In addition, we have numerous initiatives underway to consolidate our manufacturing footprint in more cost-effective locations. All of these efforts are designed to reduce complexity, drive supply chain excellence, and make BD more agile while supporting the achievement of our margin expansion goals.\nOur BD2025 strategy is balanced, robust and resilient. And our foresight, planning and agility are enabling us to deliver strong performance despite the continued macro environment challenging all companies.\nTo share some perspective specific to health care. Overall, the environment continues to stabilize and is in line with our view that challenges are going to persist, not escalate, at least through 2023. While inflation is easing in some areas, we do expect that it will remain well above what we have seen historically and have planned for another year of outsized inflation, primarily in labor and raw materials.\nWe see continued labor pressure with different market dynamics impacting hiring and increasing wages for certain roles, primarily in our manufacturing organization. Across raw materials, some categories of resins used in finished goods are beginning to show signs of improvement, while other materials, such as packaging and rubber, are still inflated versus historic prices.\nIn terms of the COVID pandemic. Broadly speaking, we see stabilization. While there continues to be surges in certain pockets around the world, similar to our customers, we have become more accustomed to managing through COVID-driven dynamics and have been effective at avoiding any extended manufacturing and distribution disruptions.\nSpecific to China, we anticipate that the recent COVID restrictions that impacted us in Q1 will affect our peers as well. Our local teams are navigating these restrictions well, which reflects the resiliency and strength of our China organization and the diversity and durability of our business.\nBy successfully navigating the challenging macro environment, we are distinguishing BD and supporting our ability to continue delivering strong performance.\nBefore I turn it over to Chris, I'll share a few updates on the strong progress our team is making to advance our ESG strategy and goals. In December, we published our second annual ID&E report, which provides details about our progress towards our 2030 ESG goals for promoting a healthy workforce and communities. The report highlights our improvements towards increasing diversity at the management and executive levels and spotlights our global associates who are advancing our culture and driving meaningful change within BD and the communities that we serve.\nWe also published our third annual cybersecurity report. BD was the first in med tech to outline our ongoing efforts to advance cybersecurity in a report, including our work to protect against cyber attacks and empower customers with information about cyber risks and vulnerabilities.\nWe're proud to receive continued recognition for our ESG efforts, most recently being named for the fourth consecutive year to both Newsweek's list of America's Most Responsible Companies, ranking in the top 25%; and the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, recognizing our ongoing commitment to workplace equality.\nIn summary, I'm proud of our progress and momentum. Our associates are bringing our BD2025 strategy to life as we operate as a more agile, innovative med tech leader. BD is well positioned to drive profitable growth and create long-term value.\nFirst, our growth profile is consistent and durable. Second, we are enhancing our leadership positions through purposeful portfolio shifts into higher-growth markets, increasing the WAMGR across our portfolio. Third, we are improving our margin profile through our differentiated growth, enhanced simplification programs and ongoing supply chain excellence. And fourth, we are committed to remaining disciplined and maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet. We see an increasing capacity through our BD2025 time frame to support value creation and continued strong growth through tuck-in M&A.\nAll of this adds up to a compelling financial profile with a long-term targeted base revenue growth of 5.5%-plus and double-digit EPS growth. Our updated guidance for FY '23 reinforces our confidence in our ability to achieve these targets.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance and outlook.\n\nChristopher J. DelOrefice\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Tom. Echoing Tom's comments, we delivered another quarter of strong performance in Q1, which demonstrates our consistent, reliable, durable growth profile, and our BD2025 strategy playing out as planned.\nSo first, beginning with our revenue performance. We exceeded our expectations for the quarter, delivering $4.6 billion in revenue with base business growth of 5.2% or 3% organic. We see underlying organic growth more at mid-single digits when adjusting for strategic product exits, the licensing fee comparison in Life Sciences, and several COVID-driven comparisons. COVID-only testing revenues were $32 million, which as expected, declined from $185 million last year.\nTotal company base business growth was strong across BD Medical and BD Interventional with approximately 6% growth. Base revenue growth in BD Life Sciences of 3.3% reflects the comparison to licensing revenues that impacted growth by almost 400 basis points.\nBase revenue growth was strong regionally as well, with mid-single-digit growth in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific. Revenues in China declined slightly, which reflects the impact of COVID restrictions, offset by strong performance from new product introductions in BDI and research solutions in BDB. For the full year, we continue to expect to deliver near double-digit growth in China.\nOur base business revenue performance continues to be supported by our durable core portfolio and an increasing contribution from the transformative solutions in our innovation pipeline and tuck-in acquisitions. We also continue to benefit from the organic contribution from acquisitions we anniversaried, which was about 30 basis points in the quarter.\nLet me now provide some high-level insight into each segment's performance in the quarter. Further detail can be found in today's earnings announcement and presentation.\nBD Medical revenue totaled $2.2 billion in the quarter, growing 6.1%. BD Medical performance reflects strong growth in both Medication Management Solutions and Pharm Systems, which more than offset a decline in Medication Delivery Solutions. The decline in MDS of 1% was driven by COVID-related comparisons and the impact of recent COVID restrictions in China as well as planned strategic portfolio exits. We continued to see strong performance in Vascular Access Management outside the U.S.\nDouble-digit growth of 15.5% in MMS was driven by strong demand for our Pharmacy Automation solutions, including both Parata and Rowa. We've been very pleased with customer response and the performance of Parata. As expected, growth in MMS also reflects the comparison to higher dispensing installations and infusion set utilization in the prior year driven by COVID dynamics.\nWe continue to have a very healthy backlog of customer orders for Pyxis and BD HealthSight, which reflects the strength of our connected medication management portfolio. And despite strong growth of 18% in Q1 of last year, Pharm Systems delivered another quarter of double-digit growth of 10.6%, driven by continued penetration in the high-growth biologic and vaccine markets.\nBD Life Sciences revenue totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter. The decline of 7.3% year-over-year is due to the expected lower COVID-only testing revenues. Life Sciences base revenues grew over 7%, excluding the licensing grow-over, as previously discussed.\nGrowth was driven by growth in Integrated Diagnostic Solutions base revenue of 1.3%, or 6.4% when excluding the licensing comparison. This strong underlying mid-single-digit growth was driven by BD Kiestra that is helping to address laboratory labor shortages through automation and informatics and continued leverage of our molecular testing menu across our expanded BD MAX installed base. In addition, there was strong demand for our respiratory testing portfolio that was partly aided by the timing of orders.\nHigh single-digit growth of 9.2% in Biosciences reflects continued growth from new product launches combined with strong double-digit growth in research reagents, enabled by our differentiated content and dye strategy. We continue to see demand for our expanded suite of flow cytometry analyzers and sorters as researchers continue to do even higher-parameter cellular analysis for cancer and other immune-related conditions.\nBD Interventional revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 5.6%. Growth was driven by: Surgery growth of 3.1%, which reflects strong performance in advanced repair and reconstruction, driven by continued strong market adoption of Phasix hernia resorbable scaffold; and double-digit growth in biosurgery, aided by the Tissuemed acquisition. Growth in surgery was tempered by planned strategic portfolio exits and an expected decline in BD ChloraPrep due to a tough comparison to the prior year as a result of dealer stocking.\nPeripheral Intervention grew 10.8%, which reflects double-digit growth in PVD, driven by the Venovo relaunch, coupled with continued global penetration of Rotarex, and the acquisition of Venclose, which addresses chronic venous insufficiency. Additionally, growth was strong in oncology within Greater Asia due to an improved backlog situation associated with prior year supplier constraints.\nUrology growth of 1.8% reflects double-digit growth in our PureWick chronic incontinence solutions and endourology that benefited from reduced back order due to improved supplier performance. Offsetting this strong performance was a difficult comparison in urological drainage due to Surestep back-order release and distributor stocking in the prior year.\nNow moving to our P&L. We reported Q1 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.98, which included gross margin of 54.7% and operating margin of 22.9% that were consistent with our expectations.\nWhile we are no longer providing a specific breakout of the impact to margins from COVID-only testing, you will recall the comparison to higher testing in the prior year is weighted to the first half, and as expected, is the driver of the decline in reported Q1 margins year-over-year. Excluding the COVID impacts to margins in Q1 of both years, both gross and operating margins in our base business were up slightly year-over-year.\nThe improvement in base margins was delivered despite around 350 basis points of outsized inflation that, as expected, was primarily driven by selling through inventory that included peak inflation impacts from FY '22, such as increases in certain raw materials noted earlier as well as the impact of labor inflation and elevated shipping. We were able to offset a large portion of this impact through our simplification and inflation-mitigation initiatives and the benefit from strategic portfolio exits of lower-margin products as planned. We expect the impact from inflation to moderate as we move through the year.\nBase margin performance also includes growing over the impact from licensing revenues in the prior year. As expected, we had favorable FX that was recorded in inventory that benefited our GP as it flowed through sales.\nR&D of 6.4% of sales reflects our innovation investments aligned to our strategy in support of our long-term growth outlook. Q1 reflects timing of project spend. We expect R&D to remain elevated in Q2 and normalize over the balance of the year to around our long-range target of 6%. Our tax rate in Q1 was lower than anticipated due to the timing of certain discrete items that were planned for during the year.\nRegarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totaled approximately $400 million in the quarter. Operating cash flow reflects an impact of approximately $300 million from higher inventory balances. The increase reflects the impact of inflation and our strategic investments in raw materials to optimize product delivery and meet customer demand. We've seen good progress in December and January on WIP and finished goods rightsizing with January inventory dollars down sequentially from December.\nWe are working to moderate strategic raw material purchases as stability improves in select markets. However, we continue to make prudent trade-offs where necessary to ensure we support our customers while delivering strong results. Assuming continued stabilization of the macro environment and supply chain, we expect to continue to manage inventory levels down, and by the end of the fiscal year, have this be a positive source of cash and meaningful progress towards meeting our long-term cash conversion goals.\nWe paid down approximately $500 million in long-term debt in Q1 and ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $600 million and a net leverage ratio of 3x. As the year progresses and we build cash, we can increase our capacity to deploy cash towards tuck-in M&A.\nMoving to our guidance for fiscal '23. For your convenience, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can also be found in our presentation. Given our first quarter performance, we are confident in increasing our revenue and EPS guidance, given the strength of our base revenue growth, consistent execution of our margin goals, and reflecting the latest FX rates.\nStarting with revenues, I will provide some insights into some of our key guidance assumptions. First, we are well positioned for strong growth across our 3 segments, which are delivering at or above our initial expectations despite the impact of restrictions in China. And thus, we are increasing our base revenue guidance.\nOn a currency-neutral basis, we now expect base revenues to grow 5.75% to 6.75%. This is an increase of 50 basis points from our prior guidance of 5.25% to 6.25% and is driven by our Q1 revenue outperformance and the confidence we have in our consistent, durable growth profile.\nOur base revenue guidance continues to include planned strategic portfolio exits that will enable increasing manufacturing efficiency and capacity and ensure the reliable supply of the products that matter most to our customers. We initiated these actions in Q1, and for the full year, continue to expect an impact to base revenue growth of approximately 100 basis points while being accretive to margin. Offsetting this revenue impact, we continue to expect a positive contribution of approximately 100 basis points from the full year benefit of our recent acquisitions, with Parata being the predominant driver.\nWhile we aren't providing segment-specific guidance, we are on track to deliver strong performance across our segments this fiscal year, in line with our long-term planned commitments. We expect Medical segment growth to be above the total company range, which includes the acquisition of Parata; Life Sciences growth to be below, given strong prior year comps; and Interventional to be above the midpoint.\nFor COVID-only testing, we are now assuming about $50 million to $100 million in revenue versus our previous expectation of about $125 million to $175 million and is driven by reduced testing volumes and the continued shift in the market to combination testing for respiratory illness.\nRegarding Alaris. We continue to only model shipments related to medical necessity in line with fiscal '22 demand.\nRegarding our assumptions on earnings. We continue to expect operating margins to improve by at least 100 basis points while absorbing the decline in COVID-only revenue, which has a higher margin profile. Despite the challenging macro environment persisting, our focused execution on driving profitable revenue growth, combined with our simplified programs, gives us the confidence that we will be able to continue to mitigate inflationary pressures and make meaningful progress to achieving operating margin levels of about 25% in fiscal year '25.\nWe continue to expect over 80% of the improvement in operating margin to come from SSG&A, driven by internal cost containment and leverage. The balance is expected to come from slight improvement in gross margin and R&D as we normalize back closer to our target of 6% of sales.\nBelow operating income, our assumptions regarding interest, other and tax remain unchanged. We continue to expect adjusted EPS before the impact of currency to be around double-digit growth and within a range of approximately 9% to 11%. This includes absorbing about a 350 basis point headwind from the anticipated decline in COVID-only testing, which is about 50 basis points more than we previously anticipated. As a result, this implies a very strong low teens base earnings growth of approximately 12.5% to 14.5% compared to 12% to 14% previously anticipated.\nLet me now walk you through the estimated impact from currency. As a reminder, we manage our business and provide guidance on an operational basis, but provide perspective on currency using current spot rates. Since our last call in November, the U.S. dollar weakened against all of our major currencies. Based on current spot rates, which assumes the euro at $1.08 for the remainder of the year for illustrative purposes, currency is now estimated to be a headwind of approximately 200 basis points or about $370 million to total company revenues on a full year basis, which is an improvement of approximately 250 basis points compared to our prior view.\nThe currency headwind to adjusted EPS growth has also declined significantly since our November earnings call. At current rates, currency would represent a total headwind of approximately 230 basis points to adjusted EPS growth compared to approximately 420 basis points previously.\nAll in, including the estimated impact of currency, we are increasing our reported revenue guidance by approximately $500 million to a range of $19.1 billion to $19.3 billion compared to $18.6 billion to $18.8 billion previously, and are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to be between $12.07 and $12.32, which is an increase of $0.22 at the midpoint compared to our prior guidance range of $11.85 to $12.10.\nAs we think of fiscal '23 phasing, there are various items to consider. We have outlined more detail in the accompanying presentation slides, but the following are key areas to note.\nFirst, regarding margins. We expect Q2 operating margin to be similar to our FY '22 full year margin. This demonstrates our strong focus on profitable growth given the continued impact of inflation and the grow-over impact of our COVID-only testing revenue, both of which we expect to be most prominent in the first half of the year. As a reminder, COVID-only testing has a higher margin and reinvestment of COVID-only testing profit was weighted to the back half of the year. As the year progresses and we continue to benefit from our simplification and inflation-mitigation programs, we anticipate margin expansion to be most prominent and to increase through the second half.\nSecond, regarding FX. At current spot rates, we expect the headwind to revenue and EPS will be over-indexed to the first half with about 90% of the full year impact to revenue and about 80% of the full year impact to EPS occurring in the first half. For the full year, we expect the FX drop-through to earnings to be in line with our BDX operating margin.\nLastly, a couple of timing items to note. We expect R&D as a percentage of sales to remain elevated in Q2 and normalize over the balance of the year to around our long-term target of 6%. Additionally, the midpoint of our full year effective tax rate guidance indicates an effective tax rate over 16% for the balance of the year, which is best to assume occurs evenly throughout the year as the exact timing of any other discrete items is hard to predict.\nIn closing, we are very pleased with our performance, which demonstrates our consistent, reliable, durable growth profile and our BD2025 strategy continuing to progress as planned. As we look forward and as reflected in our FY '23 guidance, we are well positioned for growth with excellent momentum in our base business.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Tom for a few additional comments.\n\nThomas E. Polen\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Chris. The future has never been brighter for BD. We have demonstrated a powerful combination of innovation and strong execution, and have the talent, vision and momentum to continue delivering robust performance.\nAs we move through the back half of the fiscal year, you can expect to see continued relentless focus on execution of our strategy. I'd like to thank our associates worldwide once again for their tireless commitment to our purpose of advancing the world of health.\nWith that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue?"

DeMartino\n\nSenior VP & Head of IR, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nGood morning, and welcome to BD's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. On behalf of the BD team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at bd.com.\nEarlier this morning, BD released its results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2022. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The press release and presentation can be accessed on the IR website at investors.bd.com.\nLeading today's call are Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Chris DelOrefice, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

When we refer to any given period, we are referring to the fiscal period, unless we specifically note it as a calendar period.\nI would also call your attention to the basis of presentation slide, which defines terms you will hear today such as base revenues and base margins, which refer to our results excluding estimated COVID-only testing.\nWith that, I am very pleased to turn it over to Tom.\n\nThomas E. Polen\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm extremely proud of our organization and our performance this year. We closed the year with excellent momentum, having delivered strong and consistent growth in our base business.\nFor the full fiscal year, we exceeded our revenue and earnings guidance and achieved our margin expansion goal. Our performance this year confirms BD 2025 is the right strategy and it's working. Our results reflect our strategy in action and the focused execution and dedication of our global teams who reliably served our customers, controlled costs and increased productivity during a challenging environment.\nAt Investor Day in November 2021, we outlined our plan to build sustained shareholder value creation in 5 key focus areas. Today, I'm pleased to review the progress we've made to achieve this plan.\nFirst, we delivered consistent performance and durably strengthened our growth profile. Our FY '22 results are on track with our long-range targets to deliver 5.5%-plus top line and double-digit EPS growth with operating margin improvement back toward our pre-pandemic level.\nIn FY '22, we drove 9.4% revenue growth in our base business. Additionally, we achieved our margin expansion goals in an increasing inflationary environment by both leveraging our revenue performance and realizing savings and efficiencies from several of our multiyear simplification and cost improvement initiatives. As a result, we delivered $11.35 in adjusted diluted EPS. Second, we continued to reshape our portfolio by advancing our innovation pipeline and M&A strategy towards higher-growth markets.\nIn FY '22, we continued to transform our innovation pipeline with about 60% of our new product development invested in 3 market spaces that are reshaping health care and helping to fuel our growth: smart connected care, enabling new care settings and improving chronic disease outcomes. We believe our current pipeline is the most exciting in the history of the company.\nIn addition, we deployed over $2 billion this year towards 6 tuck-in acquisitions, all of which were allocated towards higher-growth markets. This includes Parata Systems, our largest acquisition since Bard, which is aligned to our focus on smart connected care and enabling new care settings. Parata makes BD the global leader in the fast-growing pharmacy automation market and enables us to provide solutions to help pharmacies address rising costs and labor shortages.\nWith today's transformative solutions, from pharmacy automation to biotech drug delivery devices, to high-throughput molecular diagnostic systems and new dyes and instruments for immuno-oncology and multiomics research to at-home solutions for urinary incontinence, we are systematically creating a new wave of future growth for BD.\nThird, we executed our simplification programs and managed our cost structure. Like every other company, we face tremendous inflationary pressure. We saw the pressure coming early on, and we took action immediately, putting in place an inflation task force to attack it from every side. We also prioritized our internal cost reduction programs and significantly leveraged our selling and G&A expense, driving strong operating leverage.\nIn addition, we actively managed our portfolio, including spinning embecta as well as exiting more than 2,500 SKUs as we accelerated our Project RECODE initiative to simplify our portfolio and exit products that add complexity in our plants. A leaner portfolio and less complex manufacturing processes allow us to improve output with the same fixed cost base and optimize our mix to produce more of the products most critical to our customers.\nWe furthered our investments in what matters to our customers, strengthening our supply chain, validating secondary suppliers and building key component inventory, all factors that have been even more important in a supply-constrained environment.\nAnd finally, as we drove strong revenue growth beyond our original expectations, we leveraged our scale and excellence in manufacturing as volumes in our plants recovered from FY '20 and '21 lows due to COVID disruptions in procedures. As a result, in FY '22, we were able to absorb significant increases in inflation during the year and improved our margin profile back towards BD's pre-pandemic levels of 25% in FY '25.\nFourth, we maintained a disciplined and balanced capital deployment strategy. Over the last few years, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet and improved flexibility. This has allowed us to advance our balanced capital allocation framework and support growth-enhancing investments in capital, R&D and tuck-in M&A. We're now at 2.8x net leverage, and both Moody's and Fitch upgraded our debt this year, reflecting the strength of our business and disciplined approach on balance sheet management and capital deployment.\nAlso, this framework gave us the flexibility to return capital to shareholders. We just announced our 51st consecutive year of dividend increases, continuing our long-standing recognition as a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, a distinction that reflects the consistency and reliability of our dividend policy.\nAnd finally, our strong teams continued to execute and create value even during uncertain times. Our execution in FY '22 is a testament to our growth mindset at BD, where we firmly believe there's nothing we can't do, only things we haven't done yet. And by navigating successfully the challenging macro environment, we are distinguishing BD and supporting our ability to consistently deliver strong performance. These capabilities are now all embedded in our operating principles. And with the strong execution abilities across our network, they're having a positive impact on our overall cost effectiveness, responsiveness and sustainability.\nIn summary, these proof points reflect how BD 2025 and the actions we've taken in FY '22 and over the past several years, uniquely position us to lead and deliver strong and consistent results. I'll now provide more detail on the progress we made this year on organic innovation, which is a key enabler to our growth strategy.\nIn FY '22, we significantly advanced our innovation pipeline, launching 25 key new products. We are on track to achieve our new product revenue contribution as outlined at Investor Day and are increasing our portfolio weighting in attractive, faster-growing markets.\nOur product launches reinforce our leadership position in our durable core and expand our offering in higher-growth spaces across smart connected care, enabling new care settings and improving outcomes for chronic disease. These launches strengthened our position in strategic areas such as medication safety, immunology research reagents, molecular and point-of-care diagnostics, peripheral vascular disease and incontinence. Examples include PosiFlush SafeScrub, our next-generation flush product; PreVue, our peripheral vascular access system; BD COR, our fully automated high-throughput molecular system and related women's health and STI assays; and the PureWick Male External Catheter.\nI'm excited by the progress we've made advancing our innovation-driven growth strategy and the strides we've made to improve outcomes for patients and providers and create value for our stakeholders. I'll now share a few updates on the progress our team made this year to advance our ESG strategy and goals.\nTogether We Advance serves as a framework for our ESG strategy. In July, we published our 2021 ESG report, which provides details about our ESG strategy and progress against our 2030 commitments. Highlights include the launch of the BD Sustainable Medical Technology Institute; efforts to reduce our greenhouse gas emission, including joining the UN Race to Zero; and increasing our investments in on-site renewable energy.\nJust last month, BD in Sandy, Utah was awarded the Blue Sky Legacy award for making significant strides towards Utah's environmental sustainability. We believe that the work we're doing today can make a lasting positive impact on our communities. We also made progress on our workforce ID&E goals, ending FY '22 with increased diversity at the executive and management levels, and we remain committed to having an inclusive workplace. We're proud to receive continued recognition for our ESG efforts. Most recently, we were named to Forbes 2022 list of the world's best employers, a recognition of BD as a great place for the world's best talent to work as part of a healthy and inclusive community.\nBefore I turn it over to Chris, as we look forward to FY '23, I'd like to provide some perspective on the macro environment and BD 2025 as we move toward the second half of our strategic plan period.\nStarting with the macro environment. Our BD 2025 strategy and the capabilities we have built over the past 2 years position us well to navigate what we expect to be some persistent macro challenges and uncertainty facing all companies. We reiterate our conviction in the 3 irreversible forces shaping health care and our strategy to address them. For example, as it relates to smart connected care, there's an increasing need for digitalization and automation of health care processes as providers look for ways to increase efficiency and address labor and inflationary challenges.\nRegarding inflation and supply chain, our perspective continues to be that challenges are going to persist, not escalate, at least through 2023. And although inflation could potentially start easing somewhat, we do expect that it will remain well above what we have seen historically. Companies that have processes, systems and capabilities to navigate this environment will continue to thrive over the next couple of years.\nAnd as we move forward, you can expect to see continued relentless focus on execution of BD 2025, which will continue to serve as our true north. This includes delivering impactful innovations for our customers by expanding our leadership positions in our durable core and continuing to invest to expand our portfolio in the higher-growth areas that are transforming health care. In addition, Alaris remains our #1 priority, and we're making good progress. While we don't comment on the status of the review or approval timing, we are taking all the steps necessary to provide the required regulatory information and support our customers upon clearance. We will also continue our investments to increase manufacturing capacity, strengthen our supply chain and increase supplier redundancy to help ensure we continue to reliably supply our products for our customers.\nWe will continue to focus on initiatives to return our margin profile to FY '19 pre-pandemic levels in FY '25. This includes accelerating initiatives like Project RECODE, including our efforts around operating model simplification, resulting in BD becoming a more agile and less complex organization. We expect to continue our balanced approach to capital deployment. Our priorities include investing in our business through R&D and CapEx. After investing organically and returning value through dividends, we will continue to execute our tuck-in M&A strategy and return value to shareholders through share repurchases. We expect to continue to stay ahead of the curve as we navigate the macro environment, leveraging the capabilities we have built that are now embedded in our operating principles.\nWe recently celebrated BD's 125th year anniversary as a company, demonstrating our durable model underpinned by our tradition of relentless focus on innovation and operational excellence. We're really excited about what the future holds, and with the performance of our global teams, we'll continue to grow our impact on customers and patients and advance the world of health.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance and outlook.\n\nChristopher DelOrefice\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Tom. Echoing Tom's comments, we delivered strong, consistent results this fiscal year, which reflects our growth strategy playing out as planned. Through execution of our BD 2025 strategy, we are fulfilling our short-term commitments while progressing towards our long-term goals.\nBeginning with our revenue performance. We exceeded our revenue growth expectations for the fourth quarter and full year. We delivered $4.8 billion in revenue in Q4, with base business growth of 8.6% or 6.8% organic. Parata contributed about 140 basis points to growth in the quarter and about 40 basis points to the full year.\nCOVID-only testing revenues were $37 million, which is expected decline from $316 million last year. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $18.9 billion in revenue with base business growth of 9.4% and or 8.5% organic.\nCOVID-only testing revenues were $511 million, which as expected, declined from $2 billion last year. Total company base business growth was strong across all 3 segments with double-digit growth in BD Life Sciences and high single-digit growth in BD Medical and BD Interventional. Base revenue growth was strong regionally as well, with double-digit growth in the U.S., China and Latin America, along with high single-digit growth in EMEA.\nOur revenue performance continues to be supported by our durable core portfolio and an increasing contribution from the transformative solutions we are bringing to the market through our innovation pipeline and tuck-in acquisitions. We also continue to benefit from the organic contribution from tuck-in acquisitions we anniversaried, which was about 20 basis points for the full year.\nLet me now provide some high-level insight into each segment's performance in the quarter. Further detail can be found in today's earnings announcement and presentation. BD Medical revenue totaled $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter, growing 10.2% with strong performance across the segment. Growth was driven by strong growth in MDS of 8%, driven by continued execution of our comprehensive Vascular Access Management strategy; MMS growth of 11.5%, driven by strong demand of our connected medication management and pharmacy automation strategies, including our recent acquisition of Parata as customers focus on automation to drive efficiency to help address the constrained labor market; and another quarter of double-digit growth of 12.8% in Pharmaceutical Systems based on our strong leadership position in prefillable solutions for biologics and vaccines.\nBD Life Sciences revenue totaled $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. The decline of 11.6% year-over-year is due to the expected lower COVID-only testing revenues previously discussed. Excluding COVID-only testing, Life Sciences base revenues grew 8.3% with strong growth across both IDS and Biosciences. Base business growth was driven by IDS growth of 8.6%, enabled by continued leverage of our molecular testing menu across our expanded BD MAX installed base and continued demand for our leading clinical microbiology and specimen management platforms. And lastly, BDB growth of 7.5%, driven by continued demand for our expanded suite of flow cytometry instruments as researchers are able to do even higher parameter cellular analysis for cancer and other immune-related conditions.\nBD Interventional revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, growing 5.7%. Growth was driven by Surgery growth of 5.4%, supported by our advanced repair and reconstruction portfolio with strong market adoption of our leading Phasix hernia products. PI growth of 4.8%, which reflects continued expansion of our venous portfolio highlighted by Venclose in the U.S. and the global relaunch of Venovo. PI performance also reflects increased backorders primarily related to a BDI-specific European ERP system implementation. Urology growth of 7.2% reflects continued strong demand for our PureWick female incontinence solutions in both acute and alternative care settings.\nNow moving to our P&L. Q4 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.75 increased 28%. Base business gross margin of 52.5% was up 80 basis points and base operating margin of 22.5% was up 430 basis points year-over-year. Full year adjusted diluted EPS of $11.35 grew 0.6%. As we anticipated, we made significant progress towards achieving our pre-pandemic margin improvement goals despite increasing inflation pressures. For the full year, base business gross margin of 53.4% was up 110 basis points and base operating margin of 22.4% was up 280 basis points. The key full year drivers of gross margin include our simplification and inflation mitigation initiatives and increased volume utilization given our strong base revenue growth.\nIn addition, as expected, we had favorable FX that was recorded in inventory that benefited our GP as it flowed through sales this year. Base operating margin reflects strong operating expense leverage with base selling and G&A as a percent of sales leveraging by 180 basis points, partially offset by significant inflationary impacts, primarily in shipping.\nTo put this in perspective, shipping expense increased at a double-digit rate in our base business. This increase in shipping was offset with focused efforts on cost management and leverage of selling and G&A, which only grew at about 1/3 the rate of sales and was the primary driver of 21% currency-neutral growth in base operating income. This is a testament to the tremendous work by our organization to mitigate inflation and execute our margin enhancement initiatives. This was also a key enabler in supporting continued investment in R&D at just over 6% of sales to advance our innovation pipeline.\nRegarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totaled approximately $2.5 billion in FY '22. Operating cash flow reflects a higher inventory balance of about $600 million year-over-year. The increase reflects the impact of inflation, longer in-transit lead times and our strategic investments in raw materials to optimize product delivery and meet customer demand.\nAs expected, our free cash flow conversion this year was below our long-term target. We remain very focused on cash flow conversion, and we are taking actions to moderate inventory down. But in the short term, we believe it's a prudent trade-off to ensure we support our customers while delivering strong results.\nAs we execute against our BD 2025 strategy and supply chain constraints normalize, we expect to migrate towards our long-term cash conversion target. In addition to investing in R&D at over 6% of sales to advance our pipeline of innovative programs, we also invested over $2 billion in 6 tuck-in acquisitions across our businesses that will support our strong growth profile in 2023 and beyond.\nBeyond our investments in growth, consistent with what we shared regarding the planned use of embecta proceeds, we paid down $500 million in long-term debt this fiscal year and returned $1.6 billion in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We ended the year with a cash balance of $1 billion and a net leverage ratio of 2.8x.\nMoving to our guidance for fiscal '23. For your convenience, the detailed assumptions underlying our guidance can also be found in our presentation. Our FY '23 guidance aligns with the framework we communicated last quarter and the value creation model and long-term targets we outlined at our Investor Day to deliver 5.5%-plus base revenue growth, continued margin improvement and double-digit base earnings growth on a currency-neutral basis.\nAs a reminder, we manage our business on a currency-neutral basis to best represent underlying performance. Consistent with what other companies are discussing in their forward outlook, we are accounting for a headwind to our reported results as we translate currency to a stronger U.S. dollar. Beyond that change, our guidance has only strengthened in a complex macro environment, where we continue to see elevated inflation and geopolitical uncertainty.\nStarting with revenues. I'll provide you some insights into some of our key guidance assumptions. First, on a currency-neutral basis, we expect base revenues to grow 5.25% to 6.25%, which is a strong growth of 5.75% at the midpoint. This midpoint is above our 5.5%-plus target we outlined during our Investor Day, given the confidence we have in our strengthening growth profile.\nOur revenue guidance includes 2 proactive, strategic portfolio management actions that are consistent with our BD 2025 strategy and support our value creation goals. First, building on our FY '22 achievements. Our base revenue guidance includes planned strategic portfolio exits as part of the acceleration of our portfolio simplification and RECODE programs. These actions will enable increasing manufacturing efficiency and capacity and ensure the reliable supply of the products that matter the most to our customers. We expect these actions to impact revenue by approximately 100 basis points while being accretive to margin.\nSecond, offsetting this revenue impact is a positive contribution of approximately 100 basis points from the full year benefit of our recent acquisitions, with Parata being the predominant driver. We will continue to be active in portfolio management as a lever to create value for all stakeholders. While we aren't providing segment-specific guidance, we are on track to achieve our long-range plan commitments, and we are assuming strong performance across the segments in FY '23. We expect Medical segment growth to be above the total company range, which includes the acquisition of Parata, Life Sciences growth to be below, given strong prior year comparisons, and Interventional to be at the high end of the range. Consistent with what we shared, we expect COVID-only testing revenues and related earnings to be at a level significantly below FY '22, with revenues more in line with the annualization of our Q4 FY '22 results or approximately $125 million to $175 million for the full year.\nRegarding Alaris, consistent with what we've done in the past, we are only modeling shipments related to medical necessity. While we will be prepared when clearance is received, we continue to anticipate a gradual ramp to revenues upon clearance.\nRegarding our assumptions on earnings. We expect operating margins to improve by at least 100 basis points over the 22.6% reported in FY '22. Despite the challenging macro environment persisting, our focused execution on driving profitable revenue growth, combined with our simplified programs, gives us the confidence that we will be able to continue to offset inflationary pressures and make meaningful progress to achieving pre-pandemic operating margin levels of about 25% in FY '25.\nFirst, to give you some color on inflationary assumptions. As a reminder, outsized inflation in FY '22 was a headwind of over 200 basis points, and we expect a similar level of incremental outsized inflation in FY '23. The primary drivers of the incremental inflation are raw material costs and labor, which are about equally weighted. Even though we see some signs of cost normalizing in certain areas, a lot of the outsized inflation is from inventory we manufactured in FY '22, as there's about a 4- to 6-month lag from production to sell-through.\nLabor costs, especially in our manufacturing plants, have continued to increase. We have taken proactive actions to ensure we are differentiating BD to retain our skilled workforce. Lastly, transportation costs have stabilized, and we've begun to see some downward movement on certain rates. However, we are still above more normalized levels.\nWe remain committed to leading through the macro complexity while making investments to support our customers. To offset these inflationary impacts, we continue to leverage our strong growth profile and drive outsized cost reduction and other mitigation programs. We expect over 80% of the improvement in operating margin to come from SSG&A driven by internal cost containment and leveraging. The balance is expected to come from slight improvement in gross margin and R&D as we normalize back closer to our target of 6% of sales.\nOur simplification initiatives include continuing to execute on Project RECODE. You will recall when we announced RECODE, it was intended to deliver $300 million in savings by the end of fiscal year '24, with portfolio and network optimization representing about 70% of the savings. We are accelerating these efforts and are also making significant progress with the third pillar of RECODE: operating model simplification, which will result in BD becoming a more agile and less complex organization.\nIn addition, to provide some color below operating income. We expect an increase of approximately $50 million to $75 million in interest/other. This is primarily driven by increased pension expense, which we fully covered in our guidance and as a result of the negative movement in the financial markets. For tax, based on what we know today, assuming no major legislative or regulatory changes, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 13.5% and 14.5%.\nIt would not be unusual for our rate to fluctuate above or below this range on a quarterly basis given the timing of discrete items. Our guidance assumes no material change in average common shares outstanding from our average FY '22 share balance. This takes into account the conversion of all outstanding preferred shares on June 1, 2023, the benefit from the FY '22 share repurchase associated with the use of the embecta distribution and our commitment to mitigate the dilution from share-based compensation.\nSo on an all-in basis, we expect adjusted EPS before the impact of currency to be around double-digit growth and within a range of approximately 9% to 11%. This includes absorbing about a 300 basis point headwind from the anticipated decline in COVID-only testing, and as a result, implies a very strong low teens base earnings growth of approximately 12% to 14%.\nLet me now walk you through the estimated impact from currency. As a reminder, we manage our business and provide guidance on an operational basis but provide perspective on currency using current spot rates. Since our last call in August, the U.S. dollar strengthened against all major currencies. Based on current spot rates, for illustrative purposes, currency is now estimated to be a headwind of approximately 450 basis points or about $850 million to total company revenues on a full year basis. This currency headwind has nearly doubled since our August call.\nOur guidance assumes the euro at 0.99, which is down about 4% since August. The Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, British pound and Canadian dollar have also all declined even more than the euro since August by almost 2 times the euro movement.\nFor context, these 4 currencies combined are in line with our total euro exposure. The currency headwind to EPS growth has also nearly doubled since our August earnings call. At current rates, currency would represent a total headwind of approximately 420 basis points to adjusted EPS growth.\nAll in, including the estimated impact of currency, we expect revenues to be between approximately $18.6 billion to $18.8 billion and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $11.85 to $12.10.\nAs you think of fiscal '23 phasing, there are 3 key items to consider. First, FX. At current spot rates, we expect the headwind to revenue will be over-indexed to the first half. For the full year, we expect the drop-through to earnings to be below our BDX operating margin. Due to the expected benefit from inventory flow-through in Q1, the drop-through is expected to start well below the full year average and most significantly impact the second and third quarters.\nSecond is the grow-over impact of COVID-related dynamics. As a reminder, in FY '22, almost 80% of COVID-only testing revenue was realized in the first half of the year, with strong margin drop-through as reinvestment was weighted to the latter part of the year. In addition, there is also a comp to strong first half performance in FY '22 related to combo testing in the base business. And the third is inflation. Nearly 40% of the full year inflation headwind is expected to occur in Q1 as we sell through inventory manufactured in FY '22 in the first half of the year.\nAs a result of these items, as you think of the progression of our total operating margin expansion through the year, for Q1, you should expect a year-over-year decline driven primarily by the year-over-year comparison of higher COVID-only testing. We expect operating expansion to ramp over the remainder of the year, with the majority occurring in the second half.\nAs a reminder, there are some tough comparisons to the prior year in Q1 such as the benefit of about $50 million in licensing revenues in Life Sciences. As a result of these dynamics, we expect Q1 base revenue growth and adjusted EPS to be under-indexed relative to an equal quarterly phasing of the full year.\nSo this guide, coupled with our FY '22 results, has us progressing very well towards our FY '25 goals, including a 2-year revenue CAGR assuming the FY '23 midpoint of 5.75% that is well above the 5.5%-plus target at around 7.5%; achievement of nearly 400 basis points of margin improvement or over 70% of the way towards our FY '25 objective; and 2 consecutive years of strong double-digit adjusted earnings growth in our base business.\nIn closing, we are very pleased with our performance, particularly given the macro complexity and inflationary pressure we navigated. The consistent execution we delivered and our ability to mitigate these challenges through FY '22 enabled our results. This gives us confidence in our ability to continue this momentum into FY '23 and create long-term value for all of our key stakeholders.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Tom for a few additional comments.\n\nThomas E. Polen\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Chris. Our BD 2025 strategy is demonstrating strong momentum and performance, positioning BD to be increasingly well positioned to drive long-term growth and value for all stakeholders and successfully navigate and differentiate in today's challenging environment. I'd like to thank our associates worldwide once again for their tireless commitment to our purpose of advancing the world of health.\nAnd before I turn it to Q&A, I want to officially congratulate and welcome Mike and Rick to their new roles, leading the Medical and Interventional segments, respectively. Both Mike and Rick are highly effective leaders who have demonstrated strategic and operational excellence, in their nearly 2 decades at BD. Their focus on driving growth and meaningful outcomes has been critical as we pursue our BD 2025 strategy, and they are well-rounded, seasoned leaders with a track record of developing strong teams that deliver impactful results. Their broad experiences across multiple BD businesses and segments position them well for their new roles as we advance our growth agenda and build BD's future.\nWith that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue?"

DeMartino\n\nSenior VP & Head of IR, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nGood morning, and welcome to BD's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. On behalf of the BD team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at bd.com.\nEarlier this morning, BD released its results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The press release and presentation can be accessed on the IR website at investors.bd.com.\nLeading today's call are Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Chris DelOrefice, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Polen\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Francesca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased with our strong Q3 results. We exceeded our revenue, operating margin and earnings goals and delivered another quarter of consistent strong performance in our base business, with revenue growth of 9.3%. Our results continue to demonstrate the durability of BD's performance even during an uncertain market environment, with year-to-date base business growth of 9.6%.\nI want to thank our team of over 75,000 talented associates, who continue to deliver on the Grow, Simplify and Empower pillars of our BD2025 strategy. Our performance reflects the team's agility and strong execution, which puts us ahead of the curve in our ability to manage inflationary pressure, mitigate supply chain challenges and optimize supply for our customers.\nBD 2025 continues to serve as our true north and is proving to be the right strategy to reinvent and transform health care now and positions us to continue to deliver strong performance in the years to come. This is evident in our year-to-date results and the proof points of our performance, which include: one, a reliable and strengthened growth profile; two, our reshaped innovation and M&A strategy; three, an improving margin profile; four, disciplined capital deployment; and five, our continued execution during uncertain times.\nFirst, we've strengthened our growth profile as evidenced by our accelerating performance over the past 2 years. In part, this reflects the durability of our core products as BD is often referred to as the backbone of health care. Our durable core remains in high demand and creates a stable business, particularly in times of uncertainty.\nSecond, we've been enhancing our growth by reshaping our portfolio through our innovation pipeline, tuck-in M&A and the embecta spin, all increasing BD's weighting in higher growth spaces. Our investments in innovation are targeted across 3 irreversible forces that we believe will continue to transform health care over the next 10-plus years in the areas of smart connected care, the shift to new care settings and improving outcomes for patients with chronic disease. In fact, over 60% of our R&D is now invested in these high-growth areas.\nThird, we've taken actions to improve our margin profile. This includes simplifying our business by reducing complexities and increasing efficiencies through initiatives like Project RECODE. Through RECODE, we are simplifying our portfolio to optimize our mix, enabling plant efficiency and producing more of the products most critical to our customers. We started this work in mid-FY '20 as part of our BD2025 strategy, and it's been a critical contributor to navigating and performing in this challenging environment.\nFourth, we've built significant balance sheet flexibility that has enabled our disciplined capital deployment strategy to support our investments in growth, while also returning capital to shareholders. For example, with the close of the Parata acquisition, 90% of our M&A spend over the past 2 years has been in transformative solutions.\nFifth, we continue to execute during uncertain times. By successfully navigating the challenging macro environment, we are distinguishing BD and supporting our ability to deliver strong performance in today's environment.\nLet me share some examples of these macro factors that are impacting health care and what BD has been focused on to stay ahead of the curve. While our industry continues to face supply chain constraints and increased inflationary pressure, we determined early on that we would be best-in-class in navigating the environment and not take a wait-and-see approach.\nOver the past 2-plus years, we made investments to institutionalize improvements in supply chain resilience, which are having a positive impact on our overall cost effectiveness, responsiveness and sustainability. For example, we have continued our long-standing investments to systematically validate secondary suppliers for our most critical products. We've made additional investments to increase inventory to secure availability of critical raw materials and componentry.\nThis includes chips that have allowed us to deliver strong growth in areas such as BDB instruments. And we're contracting directly with shippers to ensure continuity of supply for our customers. These capabilities are now embedded in our operating principles, and our teams are doing an extremely good job navigating the environment and largely offsetting these pressures.\nRegarding China. While the impact from restrictions lasted longer into Q3, our recovery has been faster than anticipated with a strong rebound in June. Beyond the recovery of hospital patient flow, we initiated several actions to continue manufacturing and keep warehousing largely operational by working closely with our stakeholders in China to help secure key logistics capacity for ourselves and our suppliers.\nI'd like to thank a number of BD China associates, who made exceptional sacrifices to ensure product supply for our customers. As a result of the team's efforts, we expect continued strength in China in Q4 and for the full fiscal year, we're on track to deliver double-digit revenue growth, assuming no additional waves occur.\nFinally, there's talk of constrained capital spending amidst recessionary concerns. And as a reminder, BD's revenue base is 85% recurring. As it relates to revenue generated by capital spending, BD is well positioned with only a small percentage of our revenues attributed to capital placements or instruments.\nIn addition, in terms of hospital CapEx, we have seen many of our solutions prioritized due to the role in delivering patient outcomes, while addressing acute challenges, such as optimizing nursing workflow and reducing labor costs. These proof points are a reflection of how our BD2025 strategy and the actions we have taken uniquely position us to lead and deliver strong results.\nI'll now provide more detail on the progress we are making on organic innovation, which is a key enabler to our growth strategy. We continue to drive very strong R&D execution and deliver on the exciting opportunities in our pipeline, achieving over 90% year-to-date on both our critical milestones and launches, which is well into top quartile performance within our industry.\nOur increased investments in strong execution and organic innovation continue to contribute to our performance. Recent examples of how we're progressing our pipeline to drive future growth include the commercialization of the IntelliVault Controlled Substance Management System, which is part of the BD Pyxis RapidRx Solutions family that extends our connected medication management offering across new care settings. That's a $700 million space growing about 10%. IntelliVault is an RFID-enabled pharmacy automation solution that provides storage and prescription filling of controlled substance medications, while reducing outpatient pharmacy labor costs.\nAdditionally, in Q3, we received FDA approval for the BD COR MX module and a CT/GC/TV2 molecular assay on BD COR, meeting the milestones we disclosed on the Q2 call. Clearance of this assay in the U.S. gives BD access to the STI testing category, which is expected to grow at a 7% CAGR to $600 million by 2025.\nOverall, BD COR enables entry into the high-volume molecular diagnostics segment, which is expected to grow at a 9% CAGR to a $2.9 billion served market space by 2025. Our team has already received our first U.S. orders for the new BD COR and is getting very positive customer feedback.\nWith COVID being a more endemic condition, we continue to expand our offering and have received CE Mark and launched combination respiratory panels on both BD COR and BD MAX for the detection of multiple respiratory pathogens from one sample.\nIn BD Interventional, we received 510(k) clearance and launched the Aspirex mechanical aspiration thrombectomy system in the U.S., also meeting the milestone we disclosed on the Q2 call. Customer feedback has been very positive, and there have already been several successful cases to date since launch.\nDuring Q3, we completed the relaunch of the Venovo venous stent in the U.S. and Europe. And last month, we launched for the first time in China. We're seeing strong demand and gaining share with Venovo driven by best-in-class clinical performance data.\nBeyond these achievements, we also hit several key milestones across our pipeline this quarter. We received 510(k) clearance for BD PosiFlush SafeScrub. This is a prefilled flush syringe with an integrated disinfection unit, which is designed to simplify nursing workflow and enhance compliance with infection prevention guidelines. This is the first innovation in flush syringes in nearly a decade, and it's a really good example of how we're driving innovation to extend leadership in our durable core in a $900 million addressable space. We expect to launch PosiFlush SafeScrub in the first half of fiscal '23.\nIn our flow cytometry business, our research reagents platforms continue to be a key driver with double-digit growth in this category. Innovation and new product development are helping to fuel research reagents growth as customers continually seek to better understand human biology in the very complex immune system through new and novel experiments.\nWe continue to advance our innovation programs and are on track to launch more than 1,500 new flow cytometry reagent SKUs this year. The majority of these new products will expand our menu of fast-growing Sirigen reagents as well as our recently launched BD Horizon real yellow dyes, allowing our customers to run higher parameter experiments with more reagent choice and flexibility.\nFinally, PureWick Male is the next new product in our planned portfolio expansion for managing incontinence. And it's now authorized for release, and we're on track to launch this quarter. PureWick Male will provide nurses with a noninvasive option for urine management in men, enabling earlier Foley catheter removal and resulting in reduced risk of infection.\nNow as you are well aware, our strategy is driven by strong execution of both organic innovation and disciplined tuck-in M&A. And over this fiscal year, we continued to execute our tuck-in M&A strategy and have committed over $2 billion to the completion of 6 acquisitions. A great example of our M&A playbook is our acquisition of Parata Systems completed just last month. Parata allows us to enter the new area of high-growth pharmacy automation in the U.S. and marks an important step towards advancing our BD2025 growth strategy around smart connected care and enabling new care settings.\nParata's portfolio of innovative pharmacy automation solutions powers a growing network of pharmacies to reduce costs, enhance patient safety and improve the patient experience. By automating the more routine work within a pharmacy and implementing intelligent workflow solutions, pharmacists can focus more of their time on higher-value clinical work to improve medication adherence, patient safety and outcomes.\nAnd we're seeing macro trends across the industry accelerating and growing demand for pharmacy automation solutions, such as Parata's. These trends include the centralization of pharmacy services in large fulfillment centers and increased clinical demands on pharmacists and hospital and retail settings. And of course, we're seeing increased wage inflation, labor attrition and a large percentage of pharmacists reporting burnout. And taken all together, these trends are driving a $600 million pharmacy automation market opportunity today that's expected to grow approximately 10% annually to a $1.5 billion opportunity in 10 years, and that's just in the U.S. alone.\nParata's offering is complementary to our solutions in medication management. And together with BD, we expect Parata Solutions to outpace market growth as we leverage our commercial footprint, global scale and innovation capabilities. Not only is Parata a strong strategic fit, but the company has an attractive financial profile that meets all of our rigorous investment criteria on growth, profitability and returns.\nThe transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to revenue growth, adjusted operating margins and adjusted EPS. And it exceeds BD's 2025 sales growth and margin targets, thus enhancing the company's ability to achieve its long-range outlook. Given our current financial profile, we'll continue to deploy capital in a disciplined way to create value through tuck-in M&A.\nNow beyond our investments in R&D and M&A, our capital allocation framework gives us the flexibility to also return capital to shareholders through a competitive dividend and share repurchases when appropriate. I'm excited by the significant progress we continue to make advancing our BD2025 innovation-driven growth strategy to deliver even more significant impact towards improving outcomes for patients and providers.\nNow before I turn it over to Chris, let me share a few updates on the strong progress our team is making to advance our ESG strategy and goals. We recently issued our 2021 ESG report, which highlights our first performance measurements and progress on our 2030 ESG commitments. This includes launching a sustainable medical technology institute, joining the race to 0 and increasing our investments in on-site renewable energy and much more. We believe that the work we're doing today can make a lasting positive impact.\nWe are also proud to receive continued recognition for our ESG efforts. Most recently, we were recognized as a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion for the fourth consecutive year. We achieved a perfect score on the 2022 Disability Equality Index, demonstrating our progress in removing barriers and creating employment opportunities for people with disabilities. In addition, we are also named as a Noteworthy Company for the third straight year in DiversityInc's annual ranking of the top U.S. companies for diversity.\nIn summary, our BD2025 strategy continues to serve as our true north, allowing us to demonstrate: one, a reliable and strengthened growth profile; two, our reshaped innovation and M&A strategy; three, an improving margin profile; four, disciplined capital deployment; and five, our continued execution during uncertain times. With another strong quarter, our year-to-date performance gives us confidence to increase guidance, and we remain well positioned in the future to deliver sustainable, profitable growth.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials, guidance and outlook.\n\nChristopher DelOrefice\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Tom. Echoing Tom's comments, our Q3 results demonstrate the strength of our business and the momentum of our strategy. Additionally, the investments we are making in inventory, transportation, portfolio simplification and innovation are also enabling our growth and our ability to deliver our critical health care offerings to our customers and their patients. We continue to deliver strong performance, while simultaneously managing the persistent macroeconomic pressures through our simplification and mitigation programs. Through this balanced approach and the effectiveness of our BD2025 strategy, we are making strong progress against both our short- and long-term commitments.\nSo turning to our revenue performance. We delivered $4.6 billion in revenue in the third quarter, with strong base business growth of 9.3% or 8.8% organic, which excludes the impact of acquisitions. Importantly, however, we are benefiting from the organic contribution from tuck-in acquisitions we anniversaried, which was about 30 basis points this quarter. Our revenue performance continues to be supported by our durable core portfolio and an increasing contribution from the transformative solutions we're bringing to the market through our innovation pipeline and tuck-in acquisitions.\nPrice contributed 190 basis points to growth year-to-date. While this continues to be well below inflationary levels, it's one of many factors that is ensuring we can deliver our health care offerings to our customers. COVID-only testing revenues were $76 million, which, as expected, declined from $300 million last year. Year-to-date, COVID-only testing revenues were $475 million. BD's unique ability to continue to deliver strong performance during this uncertain environment is reflected in the performance across our segments with both Medical and Interventional growing 7.9% and Life Sciences base revenues growing 13.2%.\nTotal company base business growth was also strong regionally with double-digit growth in the U.S., Greater Asia, excluding China, and Latin America, along with high single-digit growth in Europe. Despite the COVID-driven restrictions, we grew low single digits in China.\nLet me now provide some further insight into each segment's performance. Our Medical segment delivered $2.2 billion in revenues in the third quarter, growing 7.9%, driven by strong performance in our Pharmaceutical Systems and Medication Delivery Solutions businesses. MDS revenues increased 6.4%, reflecting continued strong demand for our durable COR products. Performance in MDS reflects continued competitive gains in catheters and momentum in our comprehensive Vascular Access Management strategy despite the challenging environment in China during the quarter. Performance in MDS also reflects higher hospital utilization levels year-over-year in the U.S. and Europe.\nMMS revenues grew 3.6%. In our dispensing business, strong growth was driven by continued customer adoption of our connected medication management and pharmacy automation solutions. Worldwide performance in our infusion business was about flat with a similar level of demand in the U.S. for pumps under medical necessity compared to the prior year. Pharm Systems revenues grew 16.3%, driven by the continued acceleration of demand for prefilled devices for biologic drugs and our strong leadership position that is being supported by our ongoing capacity expansion and supply availability.\nBD Life Sciences revenue totalled $1.3 billion in the third quarter. The decline of 5.1% year-over-year is due to the lower COVID-only testing revenues previously discussed. Excluding COVID-only testing, Life Sciences base revenues grew 13.2% with strong growth across both IDS and Biosciences despite supply constraints and the impact from restrictions in China.\nIDS revenues declined 10.5%, which reflects the decline in COVID-only testing, partially offset by strong base business revenue growth of 12.8%. Performance in our IDS base business was driven by continued adoption of our broader respiratory panel as well as strong growth in IVD assays, leveraging our increased BD MAX install base. IDS base revenues were also driven by continued demand for specimen management products with strong growth in our durable core products aided by price management.\nBiosciences revenues increased 14.2%, reflecting continued strong demand for reagents, driven by our antibody and dye strategy and continued adoption of our e-commerce platform. Performance in Biosciences also reflects strong instrument growth driven by recently launched products and strategic procurement of critical components that enabled us to fill orders to relieve some of the backlog from the end of Q2.\nBD Interventional revenues totalled $1.1 billion in the third quarter growing 7.9% with strong performance across the segment. Revenue growth of 6.4% in Surgery reflects strong worldwide performance in advanced repair and reconstruction, driven by continued strong market adoption of Phasix hernia resorbable scaffold and the revenue contribution from the Tepha acquisition. Performance also reflects double-digit growth in biosurgery.\nRevenues in Peripheral Intervention grew 9.1%. Strong performance reflects competitive gains driven by Venovo's return to the market and continued global penetration of Rotarex and the acquisition of Venclose expanding our focus across chronic disease settings. Partial backorder recovery also contributed to performance in the quarter, offsetting the impact on deferrable procedures from macroeconomic factors, such as labor constraints.\nUrology and Critical Care revenues grew 7.7%, driven by continued strong demand for our PureWick chronic female incontinence platform in the acute care and alternative care settings. Strength in acute care was also aided by some backorder recovery.\nNow moving to our P&L. In Q3, we delivered adjusted net income and EPS above our expectations, with adjusted net income of $786 million or 14.2% reported growth and adjusted diluted EPS of $2.66 or 16.7% reported growth. As we anticipated on a year-over-year basis, margins improved significantly. We delivered base business gross margin of 52.9%, up 180 basis points and base operating margin of 22.2%, up 450 basis points year-over-year. Base operating margin includes a favorable impact of approximately 75 basis points from an employee benefit-related item that has a related negative offset in our other income and expense line and thus is neutral to our adjusted EPS.\nQ3 base gross margin increased in line with our expectations. Key drivers of gross margin include our simplification and inflation mitigation initiatives, such as mix optimization and price management, along with increased volume utilization given our strong base revenue growth. These actions enabled us to offset the impact of inflation and deliver margin improvement. In addition, as expected, we had favorable FX that was recorded in inventory that benefited our GP this quarter as it flowed through sales.\nQ3 base operating margin reflects very strong operating expense leverage with base SG&A as a percent of sales, leveraging by about 200 basis points, excluding the employee benefit-related item, partially offset by inflationary impacts primarily in shipping. R&D of 6.2% of sales reflects our innovation investments aligned to our strategy in support of our long-term growth outlook. Our tax rate in Q3 was lower than anticipated due to the timing of certain discrete items that occurred in the quarter.\nRegarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totalled approximately $1.5 billion year-to-date. Q3 cash flow from operations reflects a higher-than-normal inventory balance by about $400 million as we continued our strategic investments in raw materials, such as electronic components as part of our actions to optimize product delivery to meet customer demand in this uncertain environment. During Q3, we paid down approximately $500 million in debt and ended the quarter with a strong cash balance of $2.6 billion and a net leverage ratio of 2.7x.\nIn addition, we are pleased by our recent debt upgrades from both Moody's and Fitch, which reflect the strength of our business and disciplined approach on balance sheet management and capital deployment. Our current cash and leverage position and continued focus on cash flow provide us the flexibility to advance our balanced capital allocation framework in support of our BD2025 growth strategy.\nTurning to our fiscal '22 guidance assumptions. First, some macro considerations that support our guidance. Our guidance assumes the continued easing of COVID-19 restrictions and no significant or lasting disruptions to deferrable procedure volumes. Our guidance also assumes there are no prolonged and larger scale restrictions and countries continue to be more efficient in managing safety protocols and the containment of any new COVID variants to allow continuity of care for patients.\nRegarding China, specifically, we expect continued recovery from the recent restrictions over the balance of the fiscal year. Additionally, while we anticipate continued inflationary and supply chain pressure in Q4, we are not planning for significant escalation of macro headwinds.\nMoving to our updated guidance for fiscal '22. We have increased and narrowed both our revenue and EPS ranges. We now expect base revenues to grow 8.75% to 9.25% on an FX-neutral basis. This is an increase of 125 basis points at the midpoint from our previous guidance of 7.25% to 8.25% growth. 100 basis points of the increase is driven by strong growth and continued momentum in our base business. Additionally, with the closure of Parata, we're increasing our forecast by 25 basis points.\nFor COVID-only testing, we now assume up to $500 million in revenue. This reflects year-to-date revenues of $475 million and minimal additional revenue in Q4 as testing demand has slowed as expected.\nBased on current spot rates, for illustrative purposes, currency is now estimated to be a headwind of approximately 225 basis points or about $425 million to total company revenues on a full year basis. This is an incremental impact of about 25 basis points or approximately $50 million compared to our prior guidance and is primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro. All in, we are increasing our total reported revenue guidance by $190 million at the midpoint to a range of $18.75 billion to $18.83 billion.\nWe now expect base operating margins to improve by approximately 275 basis points, over 19.6% in fiscal '21. This is an increase of 25 basis points compared to our prior guidance and solely reflects the Q3 employee benefit-related item that has a corresponding negative adjustment to other income and expense and is neutral to adjusted EPS. Despite this challenging macro environment persisting, our focused execution on driving profitable revenue growth, combined with our simplified programs, gives us the confidence that we will be able to continue to offset inflationary pressures.\nA few additional items for your models. We now expect approximately $30 million in year-over-year improvement in interest/other compared to our prior guidance of $60 million to $75 million. This reduction reflects the offsetting impact to the Q3 employee benefit item that was recorded in G&A. Again, these items are neutral to adjusted EPS. We have narrowed our expected effective tax rate to a range of 13.5% to 14% from 13.5% to 14.5% previously.\nOur updated guidance still assumes share repurchases that, at minimum, offset any dilution from share-based compensation and thus does not assume material change in shares outstanding. Altogether, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $11.28 to $11.35 compared to $11.15 to $11.30 previously, which reflects an increase of $0.09 at the midpoint.\nThis reflects our strong Q3 base business revenue performance and increased outlook in Q4 and a margin profile that maintains our full year margin improvement commitments. We expect minimal impact from incremental COVID-only testing revenues as we intend to reinvest that to support our momentum into 2023. We still expect operating margin on COVID-only testing to be modestly above our base business margins for the full fiscal year. Additionally, while the Parata acquisition has an accretive margin profile, the income is expected to be offset by onetime deal-related costs.\nRegarding FX, based on current spot rates and our inventory outlook, we expect minimal incremental impact as incremental translational FX headwinds are expected to be offset by favorable FX on inventory flow through. As you think about Q4, the following are a few key considerations. Starting with base growth in Q4, we increased our organic growth and expect strong mid-single-digit growth, excluding the impact of acquisitions, above the 5.5% plus targeted growth profile we outlined at our Investor Day.\nThis includes absorbing the impact of a difficult prior year comparison in Q4 of fiscal year '21 where the delta variant's surge drove high acuity and demand for infusion sets and products used in the care of COVID. Additionally, we delivered initial shipments of our combination flu/COVID assays and benefited from the normalization of lab utilization and research activity. We also have a tough comparison to $316 million of COVID-only testing revenue in Q4 of last year as we expect minimal additional revenues this year with the decline in testing.\nRegarding margins, we expect sequential improvement in base gross margins and at a level near year-to-date gross margin of 53.8%. While the impact of increased inflation on our business is expected to continue, we see a larger benefit from our offsetting initiatives.\nRegarding base operating margins, we continue to expect significant year-over-year margin expansion in Q4. Sequentially, the improvement is driven by gross margin as well as continued strong leverage in selling and G&A and slightly lower R&D expense. For the full year, we continue to expect to invest in R&D at about 6% of sales.\nWhile it is premature to provide guidance for fiscal year '23, especially in a macro environment that remains uncertain, we recognize that offering a more proactive perspective during this time is helpful. To begin, while we expect macro challenges to persist, we are not assuming they worsen and would anticipate that as we move towards the back end of the year, there may be some modest relief from some of the current supply chain complexity. We will reassess the environment ahead of providing guidance in November.\nSo with that caveat, on an operational basis, excluding the impact of currency, which, based on current spot rates, would be a headwind to consider for next year, we remain confident in the strong value-creating framework we outlined at our Investor Day and expect to deliver 5.5% plus base revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. This framework continues to be supported by a strong growth profile and continued margin improvement.\nWe expect the COVID-only testing revenues and related earnings would be at a level significantly below FY '22 and more likely at a run rate similar to the implied Q4 FY '22 or approximately $100 million for the full year. We will have a positive contribution from the full year benefit of revenue and income from Parata that will partially offset the reduced COVID testing.\nSo importantly, despite the anticipated reduction in COVID-only testing, on an all-in basis, we would expect adjusted EPS to be right around double-digit growth, which implies very strong double-digit base adjusted EPS growth. Based on what we see, it appears current external thinking largely reflects this. We will share more details regarding FY '23 on our year-end earnings call in November.\nIn closing, we are very pleased with our strong performance to date and the consistency of execution against our strategy that is enabling these results. This gives us confidence in our ability to continue this momentum into FY '23 and create long-term value for all of our key stakeholders.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Tom for a few additional comments.\n\nThomas E. Polen\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Chris. Our BD2025 strategy is proving to be an effective winning strategy as reflected in the proof points of our execution and our continued strong performance. We expect continued momentum and remain well positioned to drive long-term growth and value for all stakeholders. I'd like to thank our associates worldwide once again for their tireless commitment to our purpose of advancing the world of health.\nBefore we turn to Q&A, I want to officially congratulate and welcome Simon in his new role as the Head of the Medical segment and thank Alberto Mas for an exemplary nearly 30-year career at BD. We expect to announce Simon's successor in BD Interventional soon.\nI'd also like to welcome Rishi Grover, our new EVP and Chief Integrated Supply Chain Officer. Rishi brings more than 20 years of experience in manufacturing and supply chain roles, and we're thrilled to have him join our executive leadership team. Rishi succeeds Alex Conroy, who will be retiring after more than 30 years at BD. I'd like to thank Alex for his contributions to BD throughout his career that include a vast array of roles and responsibilities. Most notably and recently, Alex led the organization through unprecedented challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic and global supply chain crisis.\nFor the purpose of today's Q&A session, Chris will take financials, Dave will answer Life Science questions, Simon will address BDI, and I will take BD Medical. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, can you assemble our queue?"

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay through May 12, 2022, on BD's Investor Relations website at bd.com or by phone at (866) 342-8591 for domestic calls and the area code +1 (203) 518-9713 for international calls. The replay bridges are now dedicated so you no longer need a conference ID to hear the replay. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to BD.\n\nFrancesca M. DeMartino\n\nSenior VP & Head of IR, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nGood morning, and welcome to BD's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. On behalf of the BD team, thank you for joining us.\nThis call is being made available via audio webcast at bd.com. Earlier this morning, BD released its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The press release and presentation can be accessed on the IR website at investors.bd.com.\nLeading today's call are Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Chris DelOrefice, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide highlights of our performance and the continued execution of our BD 2025 strategy, Chris will then provide a financial review and our updated outlook for fiscal 2022.\nThe Q2 results we will be discussing today include the results of our former Diabetes Care business as the spin of embecta was completed on April 1 subsequent to quarter end. On April 14, an 8-K was filed to provide recasted historical financial information reflecting the results of operations of our former Diabetes Care business as discontinued operations for the 2019, 2020 and 2021 fiscal years and the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nOn today's call, we will give an updated outlook for fiscal '22 for both legacy BD, which includes our former Diabetes Care business, and BD RemainCo. We anticipate recasted financial information for the second quarter of FY '22 will be available by the end of May.\nIn the meantime, to assist you with FY '22 RemainCo model, we are providing estimated impacts of excluding our former Diabetes Care business from our Q2 results. We don't expect the Q2 recasted financial information to differ materially from the estimated impacts nor affect the updated outlook for FY '22 that we are providing today.\nWe also do not plan to comment on Diabetes Care after this quarter. In addition to our prepared remarks, you can find this information on our earnings presentation that is posted on our IR website.\nFollowing the prepared remarks, Tom and Chris will be joined for Q&A by our segment President, Alberto Mas, President of the Medical segment; Simon Campion, President of the Interventional segment; and Dave Hickey, President of the Life Sciences segment.\nBefore we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements today. I encourage you to read the disclaimer in our earnings presentation slides and the disclosures in our SEC filings, which are both available on the Investor Relations website.\nUnless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis versus the relevant period. Revenue percentage changes are on an FX-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. When we refer to any given period, we are referring to the fiscal period unless we specifically noted as a calendar period.\nI would also call your attention to the basis of presentation slide which defines terms you will hear today such as base revenues and base margins, which refer to our results, excluding estimated COVID-only testing.\nWith that, I am very pleased to turn it over to Tom.\n\nThomas E. Polen\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We're very pleased with our strong performance in Q2 with revenues of $5 billion and base revenue growth of over 10%. These results reflect the continued focused execution of our BD 2025 strategy and another quarter of consistent strong growth in our base business.\nWe exceeded our revenue, margin and earnings goals while advancing our innovation pipeline and our tuck-in M&A strategy. And year-to-date, we generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow. In addition, we successfully executed the spin of our Diabetes Care business on April 1, which is now a stand-alone and publicly-traded company named embecta. It trades on NASDAQ under the ticker EMBC.\nI'm very pleased with how our strategy is progressing and coming to life. Through our efforts to grow, simplify and empower our company, we are creating an agile and resilient organization that is well positioned to deliver strong performance. Our durable core reflects our leadership position in areas of health care that remain in high demand. These are the products and solutions that form the backbone of health care around the world and create a very stable business that weather storms and uncertainty.\nThrough the performance of our durable core and our cash flow initiatives, we are fueling our growth strategy with investments in organic innovation and tuck-in M&A. The investments we are making are targeted toward higher growth spaces aligned to the irreversible forces that are transforming the future of global health care across smart connected care, the shift to alternative care settings and improving chronic disease outcomes. We are beginning to see the impacts of that shift in our growth.\nThrough the simplified pillar of our BD 2025 strategy, we are reducing complexity and driving excellence across supply chain operations, which delivers efficiencies and enhances our margin profile while improving customer satisfaction. And we're doing this by improving asset utilization and labor productivity while also enhancing our supply chain resilience, responsiveness and sustainability, all of which are more critical than ever in today's environment.\nOur focused execution of our strategy is creating momentum and gives us confidence in our outlook despite the challenging macro environment, which has evolved dramatically since our last earnings call. The conflict in Ukraine, increased supply chain challenges, energy price escalation, increased inflation and COVID-driven shutdowns in China are impacting nearly every company in the world. And while BD is not immune to these challenges, we believe the actions we've taken to drive our growth and simplification initiatives and empower our talented organization of over 75,000 associates uniquely position us to lead in this environment and give me continued confidence in our ability to execute during these times.\nI'd like to take a few minutes to share some additional thoughts on the evolving macroeconomic environment. Starting with supply chain and inflation. Like most organizations across health care, BD has faced increased inflationary pressure and supply chain constraints. However, our simplification strategy is driving our ability to largely offset these pressures and enabling our associates to respond to these rising challenges. An example is every year as part of our enterprise risk management process, we invest to systematically validate alternative suppliers for our most critical products. And this isn't something we started this year. We've been doing this for a decade. And it's showing benefits in this environment.\nMore recently, we were able to -- we've invested in additional inventory to secure access to scarce raw materials and electronic components such as semiconductor chips, and we've directly contracted for alternative transportation methods to ensure the continuity of supply for our customers. In addition, we're investing in capacity expansion and regional sourcing to create an agile supply chain that will be more responsive to events around the world.\nA key piece of our simplify strategy is our recode effort, which includes a focus on portfolio simplification, including SKU rationalization. Our strong growth profile has enabled us to accelerate the elimination of lower-margin SKUs and optimize our mix, which enables plant efficiency and for us to produce more of the products that are most critical to our customers. All of these strategic actions have helped us to move with speed and efficiency to mitigate the challenges of this environment, and we believe we are unique in our response.\nNow regarding COVID. The global health care system continues to be more agile and better prepared amid the emergence of new variants and spikes in COVID cases. And thus, while COVID-19 isn't behind us, health care utilization levels, deferrable procedure volumes and lab activities are consistently returning to pre-COVID levels in much of the world. However, the medical industry continues to be impacted when new variants develop and waves of COVID emerge. As you know, this is currently happening in China as the government takes meaningful steps to prevent the spread of new variants.\nThese efforts have had an unexpected impact on health care procedures, lab testing and the supply chain as reflected in our second quarter China results. And while this is continuing into the third quarter, we expect to mitigate most of the impact over the balance of the year, assuming there isn't any additional extended waves that require more significant COVID prevention actions. We continue to monitor the situation very closely. Despite the above complexities, the need for critical health care products and services has never proven to be more important. And our portfolio is well positioned to support clinicians and patients around the world.\nMoving on, I'll now provide more detail on the progress we're making on organic innovation, which is a key enabler to our growth strategy. As we shared at the November Investor Day, we've been focused on enhancing our R&D productivity, and it's having an impact. We significantly improved our on-time milestones and on-time launch metrics, which are both over 90% year-to-date. In addition to enhanced productivity, our increased investments in organic innovation are contributing to our performance. Some recent examples of how we're progressing our pipeline to drive future growth include BD Evolve, which is a fill-at-time of use, time delayed drug delivery system and was released for clinical trials in January. Multiple clinical trials are now underway by our pharmaceutical customers, and we see significant commercial interest with several signed development agreements.\nWe also launched new to world BD reagent technology in April, which was developed with novel dye technology and AI guidance. The new BD Horizon RealYellow 586 flowcytometry reagents are the first in a series, and they have the potential to accelerate discovery and drug development by enabling greater insights from biological samples.\nAnd we received 510(k) clearance of our Trek bone biopsy device that was submitted to the FDA last quarter with launch expected later this fiscal year. This device allows for faster sampling and is available on a broad range of sizes to accommodate a variety of procedural needs.\nBeyond these achievements, we also hit several key milestones across our pipeline this quarter. Consistent with our strategy to bring new transformative solutions to our portfolio that improves chronic disease outcomes, we released BD Libertas, a prefilled wearable injector that enables simple self-administration of larger volume doses for chronic disease. We've completed 5 clinical trials with our 5mL product and are accelerating development of our 10mL product with clinical release targeted in late FY '23, early '24.\nThe BD COR MX module and the CT/GC/TV2 assay on BD COR are now under FDA review. Already CE Marked outside of the U.S., clearance in the U.S. will give BD access to the high-volume sexually transmitted infections testing market on a fully automated and integrated platform. This assay already cleared on BD MAX is the only FDA-cleared triplex assay for the 3 most prevalent non-viral STIs.\nThe Aspirex mechanical aspiration thrombectomy system is also currently under FDA review and is expected to launch this fiscal year. Already CE Marked outside the U.S., the system is uniquely designed with a 3-in-1 method of action that removes fresh thrombus and/or thromboembolic material and peripheral vasculature. Also expanding our venous portfolio is the recent FDA approval of the Venovo Venous Stent. The relaunch of Venovo reflects strong execution by the team with shipments to customers already occurring this month.\nIn addition to organic innovation, our strong cash flows are also enabling execution of our tuck-in M&A strategy. Fiscal year-to-date, we've committed approximately $500 million to the completion of 4 acquisitions. In addition to 3 acquisitions in the prior quarter, in Q2, we closed Cytognos, whose differentiated flowcytometry assays for the detection of minimal residual disease in cancer, brings an important addition to our Biosciences business and accelerates our strategy to support chronic disease management. We believe that the current environment, coupled with our strong cash flow and robust M&A funnel, positions us well to create value through our tuck-in M&A strategy while remaining disciplined.\nBeyond our investments in R&D and M&A, our disciplined capital allocation framework gives us the flexibility to also return capital to shareholders through a competitive dividend and share repurchases when appropriate. I'm excited by the significant progress we continue to make advancing our BD 2025 innovation-driven growth strategy to deliver even more significant impact toward improving outcomes for patients and providers. And in that spirit, we also recently announced the inaugural members of our external Scientific Advisory Board. The SAB is comprised of top medical key opinion leaders, science and technology experts and experienced innovation leaders. The SAB is a new governance mechanism for BD, which will meet to review and advise on BD's technology capabilities, our innovation pipeline, tuck-in M&A opportunities and early-stage investments.\nFinally, I'd like to comment on the strong progress we're making advancing our ESG strategy and goals. One of the actions we announced this quarter that I'm particularly pleased with this the formation of our sustainable Medical Technology Institute. This is another step forward as we advance our 2030 ESG commitments and BD's focus on ensuring our portfolio leads the way on reducing the environmental impacts of medical products. We are proud to receive continued external recognitions for our ESG efforts, including recently being named to Newsweek's inaugural list of Americas most trusted companies and the Forbes 2022 list of Best Employers for Diversity as well as ranking #1 in the health care equipment and services industry and Forbes Americas best large employers list.\nIn summary, I'm very pleased with the progress that we're making advancing our BD 2025 strategy and our strong execution navigating a challenging environment, which is reflected in our strong Q2 performance. This performance gives us confidence in our updated guidance, which raises the midpoint of our revenue and EPS ranges. We remain well positioned to deliver consistent and sustainable growth and create value for all of our stakeholders.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials and outlook.\n\nChristopher DelOrefice\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Tom. So echoing Tom's comments, our Q2 results demonstrate the strength of our business and the momentum of our strategy. Additionally, we remain committed to supporting our customers and their patients and have made investments in many areas, including inventory, transportation, portfolio simplification and innovation so that we can continue to do our best to ensure continuity of delivering critical health care offerings.\nWe are delivering strong performance while simultaneously managing the increasing macroeconomic pressures through our simplification and mitigation programs. This balanced approach is helping us make strong progress against both our short- and longer-term commitments.\nTurning to our revenue performance. we delivered $5 billion in revenue in the second quarter, comprised of $4.8 billion in base business revenues, which had strong growth of 10.2% or 9.6% organic, which excludes the impact of acquisitions. Our revenue performance is supported by our durable core portfolio and an increasing contribution from the transformative solutions we are bringing to the market through our innovation pipeline and tuck-in acquisitions.\nPrice contributed 180 basis points to growth in Q2. While this is well below inflationary levels, it is one of many factors that is enabling our investments to ensure we can continue to deliver our health care offerings to our customers.\nCOVID-only testing revenues were $214 million, which is expected to decline from $474 million last year. BD's unique ability to continue to deliver strong performance during these uncertain times is reflected in the performance across our segments with Medical growing 6.4%, Life Sciences base revenues growing 17.1% and Interventional growing 11.2%.\nTotal company-based business growth was also strong regionally with double-digit growth in the U.S. and Europe, along with mid-single-digit growth in Latin America, which helped to offset lower-than-normal mid-single-digit growth in China, which was impacted by restrictions implemented to mitigate the spread of COVID late in the quarter.\nLet me now provide some further insight into each segment's performance. Our Medical segment delivered $2.4 billion in revenues in the second quarter, growing 6.4%. Strong performance across our Pharmaceutical Systems, Medication Management Solutions and Medication Delivery Solutions businesses was partially offset by an expected decline in Diabetes Care. Excluding Diabetes Care, BD Medical revenues grew 7.5%.\nMDS revenues increased 5.3%, reflecting continued strong demand for our durable core products. Performance in MDS reflects execution of our comprehensive Vascular Access Management strategy, including early momentum of our one-stick hospital stay, which is driving competitive gains in catheters and vascular care devices, particularly in the U.S. Performance also reflects a tough comparison due to a decline in syringe utilization for vaccinations.\nMMS revenues grew 7.8%. In our Dispensing business, high single-digit revenue growth was driven by continued strong worldwide demand for connected Medication Management Solutions in both acute and nonacute care settings. Within our Infusion business, revenue growth reflects strong performance in infusion sets, driven by increased pump placements outside the U.S. during the course of the COVID pandemic.\nPharm Systems revenue grew 12.2%, driven by continued strong demand for prefillable devices supported by our differentiated and expanding supply capacity. Demand for these devices continues to be aided by the fast-paced vial to prefilled device conversion for biologics, vaccines and other injectable drugs. Growth was also aided by the expansion of services provided to small and midsized pharma customers through the recent acquisition of ZebraSci.\nBD Life Sciences revenue totaled $1.5 billion in the second quarter. The decline of 4.2% year-over-year is solely due to the lower COVID-only testing revenues previously discussed. Excluding COVID-only testing, Life Sciences base revenues grew 17.1%. IDS revenues declined 6.8%, which reflects the decline in COVID-only testing, partially offset by strong base business revenue growth of 21.8%.\nPerformance in our IDS base business includes sales of our new combination flu/COVID assays for BD Veritor and BD MAX that were ahead of our expectations. It also reflects the soft comparison to the prior year where the flu season was limited. Demand for our combination assays was driven by strong adoption of our broader respiratory panel and timing of dealer stocking.\nIDS base revenues were also driven by strong demand for specimen management products and strong performance in our molecular diagnostics portfolio, driven by growth in both BD COR and BD MAX reagents with increased utilization across our larger install base.\nBiosciences revenues increased 5.6%, driven by continued strong demand for research reagents as a result of lab utilization having returned to more normal pre-COVID levels and increasing adoption of our e-commerce platform. Instrument production in the quarter was limited by supply challenges for electronic components. And as a result, we ended the quarter with a record backlog. We expect to fulfill those orders over the balance of the year.\nBD Interventional revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the second quarter, growing 11.2%. This reflects strong performance across the segment with double-digit growth in the U.S. and China. Our strong global performance is driving our ability to offset the impact of planned product line discontinuations, particularly in PI and UCC, of lower margin and nonstrategic products as part of our portfolio simplification strategy. The segment's results also reflect the easier prior year comparison resulting from the Delta variant.\nRevenues in Surgery grew 17.5%. Again, as a reminder, Q2 reflects a soft comparison to the prior year when revenues declined 7.7%. Excluding the soft comparison, revenues grew in the high single digits, driven by hernia, biosurgery and infection prevention, including the recent acquisitions of Tepha and TissueMed.\nRevenues in Peripheral Intervention grew 8.5%. Performance was driven by double-digit growth in the U.S. with strength across our peripheral vascular disease, end-stage kidney disease and oncology platforms. We continue to expand our peripheral vascular innovations and are driving strong growth through share gains from our recent acquisition of Straub and Venclose. Urology and Critical Care revenues grew 8.8%, driven by continued strong demand for our PureWick chronic female incontinence platform in both acute and nonacute care settings as we continue to expand our addressable market and deliver transformative solutions for alternate care settings. Also contributing to growth was continued back order recovery in acute urology and continued solid performance in targeted temperature management with our smart connected care enabled Arctic Sun platform.\nNow moving to our P&L. In Q2, we delivered adjusted net income and EPS above our expectations with adjusted net income of $937 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $3.18. We delivered base gross margin of 55.2% and base operating margin of 24% in Q2. Key drivers of gross margin include a benefit from our strategic portfolio initiatives, including mix optimization and increased volume utilization given our strong base revenue growth. And while inflation was broadly in line with our expectations, we did realize an escalating impact during the quarter that was largely offset by our simplification and inflation-mitigation initiatives.\nIn addition, as expected, we have favorable FX that was recorded in inventory in 2021 that benefited our GP this quarter as it flowed through sales. We leveraged our base SG&A as a percent of sales by over 200 basis points, driven by our focus on leveraging our base G&A expenses, partially offset by inflationary impacts primarily in customer shipping. R&D of 6.4% of sales reflects some accelerated phasing of investments and planned increases year-over-year, consistent with our strategy to support our long-term growth outlook.\nOur tax rate in Q2 was higher than anticipated due to the geographic mix of sales. Regarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totaled approximately $1.1 billion year-to-date. Q2 cash flow from operations reflects a higher-than-normal inventory balance as we made strategic investments to increase stocking of raw materials, such as electronic components as part of our actions to optimize product delivery to meet customer demand in this uncertain environment. We ended Q2 with a strong cash balance of $3.1 billion and a net leverage ratio of 2.8x. Our cash balance includes the receipt of a cash distribution from embecta at the end of Q2. In accordance with the tax-free nature of the spin and consistent with our capital allocation priorities, including our net leverage goals, we intend to utilize $1 billion of the embecta distribution over the coming quarters for debt paydown. The remaining $400 million of the distribution provides additional flexibility and will likely be deployed early in fiscal '23 with a bias towards share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other strategic considerations.\nWith the spin of embecta now complete, we've achieved our targeted dividend payout ratio of about 30% as we've maintained our dividend. Our current cash and leverage position and continued focus on strong cash flows provide us the flexibility to advance our balanced capital allocation framework and support our BD 2025 growth strategy through investments in R&D, capital and M&A.\nAs Francesca mentioned to assist you with your FY '22 models, we provided our best estimates of the impact of the spin on certain line items for Q2 in today's slide presentation. We estimate a $260 million impact to revenue, 100 basis points to adjusted gross margin and 160 basis points to adjusted operating margin and $0.45 to adjusted EPS.\nTurning to our fiscal '22 guidance assumptions. First, some macro considerations that support our guidance. While we still expect some global COVID-driven variability, our guidance assumes the continued easing of COVID-19 restrictions and no significant or lasting disruptions to deferrable procedure volumes.\nRegarding China specifically, we expect to mitigate the impact from the current lockdowns over the balance of the fiscal year as we're assuming the restrictions will ease in May, with recovery ramping up through fiscal Q3. In addition, our guidance assumes that the port congestion does begin to ease and will not have a lasting impact on our China business and other markets. While there could be additional lockdowns in China and other markets, our guidance assumes countries continue to be more efficient in managing safety protocols and the containment of new COVID variants to allow continuity of care for patients.\nAdditionally, we anticipate continued inflationary and supply chain pressure over the balance of the year and into next fiscal year, but we're not planning for significant escalation of macro headwinds. While these pressures are meaningful, we believe we are on track with our margin recovery initiatives, and we'll continue to proactively manage this. We expect to be able to largely offset these incremental inflationary impacts given our strong performance in Q2 and increased focus in the back half of our fiscal year to execute our company-wide mitigation initiatives.\nAs our first half results included Diabetes Care, we are providing guidance today on a legacy BD basis that includes Diabetes Care so you have a like-for-like comparison versus our February guidance. Then we're also providing RemainCo guidance for the full fiscal year, which excludes Diabetes Care in all 4 quarters, along with the spin impact for each guidance metric. This is also laid out on the FY '22 guidance summary slide in the guidance section in our earnings presentation.\nAs a reminder, going forward, our first half Diabetes Care results will be reflected as discontinued operations and we will only be discussing RemainCo performance.\nNow moving to our updated guidance for fiscal '22. We are well positioned for strong growth across our 3 segments given our performance and momentum in our base business. And thus, on a legacy BD basis, before adjusting for the Diabetes Care spin, we are increasing our base revenue guidance. We now expect legacy BD base revenues to grow 6.75% to 7.75% on an FX-neutral basis from $18.3 billion in fiscal '21. This is an increase of 100 basis points from our previous guidance of 5.75% to 6.75% growth.\nOn a RemainCo basis, we expect base revenues to grow 7.25% to 8.25% on an FX-neutral basis. This is an acceleration of approximately 50 basis points over BD legacy growth as our Diabetes Care business was a negative contributor to growth rates. The spin impact also includes a small contribution of revenues BD will earn in connection with agreements with embecta.\nFor COVID-only testing, we continue to assume approximately $450 million in revenue. As expected, testing demand has slowed, and our full year COVID-only revenue expectations are weighted to the first half of the year. Based on current spot rates, for illustrative purposes, currency is now estimated to be a headwind of approximately 200 basis points or about $400 million to total company revenues on both a BD legacy and RemainCo basis on a full year basis. This is an incremental impact of 75 basis points or $150 million compared to our prior guidance and is driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. So all in, we're increasing our legacy BD total reported revenue guidance by $50 million to a range of $19.6 billion to $19.8 billion. On a RemainCo basis, we expect total revenues of $18.5 billion to $18.7 billion.\nOn a legacy BD basis, we still expect base operating margins to improve by approximately 200 basis points over 21.7% in fiscal '21. Despite a more challenging macro environment anticipated over the back half of the year, our focused execution on driving profitable revenue growth, combined with our simplified programs, gives us the confidence that we will be able to offset the incremental inflationary pressures.\nOn a RemainCo basis, the embecta spin enhances our anticipated base margin expansion by approximately 50 basis points. And as a result, we expect base operating margins to improve by approximately 250 basis points in comparison to 19.6% in FY '21 as recasted.\nWe also still expect operating margin on COVID-only testing to be modestly above our base business margins. A few additional items for your models. On a RemainCo basis, we expect $60 million to $75 million in year-over-year improvement in interest/other, which reflects a minimal benefit from the use of embecta proceeds compared to our legacy BD expectation of $50 million to $75 million. On a legacy BD basis, we now expect an effective tax rate of 13% to 14% for the full year compared to 12.5% to 13.5% previously due to geographic mix as reflected in our revised guidance. For RemainCo, we anticipate an effective tax rate of 13.5% to 14.5%, which reflects the tax rate, excluding our Diabetes Care business.\nOur updated guidance still assumes share repurchases that at a minimum offset any dilution from share-based compensation and thus does not assume material change in shares outstanding. All in, on a legacy BD basis, we expect adjusted EPS to be between $12.85 and $13 compared to $12.80 to $13 previously, which reflects an increase of $0.025 at the midpoint.\nThe core drivers of the increase include $0.125 driven by the momentum and strength in our base business with a series of strategic mitigation actions we discussed earlier expected to largely offset increased inflationary pressures. And a $0.05 headwind from a higher effective tax rate. So operationally, this is an increase of $0.075. We expect an estimated incremental negative impact from currency of about $0.05, resulting in a $0.025 increase to our adjusted reported earnings guidance at the midpoint.\nOn a RemainCo basis, we anticipate adjusted EPS of $11.15 to $11.30. This reflects an adjustment from the embecta spin of about $1.70. This accounts for a half year of TSA income of about $35 million that will be realized in the second half of the fiscal year and recorded in other operating income on an adjusted basis. And it includes the contribution from supply agreements with embecta and the benefit from financing, which are both expected to be minimal.\nAs you think about the TSA income next year for your models, it would not be accurate to double the half year of TSA income as the services provided and income received will decline over time. As a reminder, BD shareholders received embecta shares upon completion of the spin.\nAs you think of the commitments we made during our Investor Day, on a BD RemainCo basis, our long-term targeted growth profile has been enhanced and increases our confidence in our ability to deliver a 5.5% plus base revenue growth target. Additionally, we are now targeting more than 400 basis points of base operating margin expansion through fiscal year '25 against the recasted fiscal year '21 margin. And notably, based on what we know today, all things being equal, we think BD RemainCo can deliver the absolute pre-pandemic operating margin level of legacy BD, which was about 25% by the end of that same time period. As we previously shared, this will lend itself nicely to double-digit EPS growth and a strong value proposition.\nAs you think about phasing for the balance of the year, the following are a few key considerations as you think of your RemainCo base revenue and earnings. We continue to expect base revenue growth to be fairly ratable in the back half of the year.\nRegarding our margins and P&L. First, on a year-over-year basis for Q3, we expect significant improvement in base operating margin compared to the recasted 17.7% in the prior year. Additionally, we expect the Q3 year-over-year improvement to be larger than what we delivered in Q2. Sequentially, from Q2 to Q3, we expect a modest step down due to a stronger Q2, primarily driven by product mix, most notably our flu/COVID combo test and increased inflationary pressures in the second half. As a result, Q3 is now projected to be the low watermark for the year. In Q4, we expect the impact of increased inflation on our business to continue. However, we see a larger benefit from our offsetting initiatives flowing through. In addition, we continue to see our SSG&A and R&D dollars relatively evenly spread over the remainder of the year, which will drive strong operating leverage on Q4's higher revenue dollars.\nAt the midpoint of our full year guidance range, our average tax rate for the balance of the year is about 14.5%, which is best to apply for the subsequent quarters.\nSo in summary, we are advancing our BD 2025 strategic objectives. Our underlying business is strong as evidenced by our strong base revenue and earnings performance. We remain focused on execution and are confident in delivering against our performance goals despite navigating a complex macro environment as evidenced by our updated guidance, which increases the midpoint of both our reported revenue and adjusted EPS.\nFurther, we are well positioned to deliver consistent and sustainable value with our long-term commitments enhancing with the completion of the spin. I'll now turn the call back to the operator to open the line for Q&A."

At the request of BD, today's call is being recorded and will be made available for replay through February 10, 2022, on BD's Investor Relations website at bd.com or by phone at (800) 839-2461 for domestic calls and Area Code 1(402) 220-7219 for international calls. The replay bridges are now dedicated so you no longer need a conference ID to hear the replay.\n(Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to BD.\n\nFrancesca M. DeMartino\n\nSVP of IR, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nGood morning, and welcome to BD's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. On behalf of the BD team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at bd.com.\nEarlier this morning, BD released its results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The press release and presentation can be accessed on the Investor Relations website at investors.bd.com.\nLeading today's call are Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Chris DelOrefice, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide highlights of our performance and the continued progress we have made against our BD2025 strategy. He will then turn the call over to Chris for the financial review and our updated outlook for fiscal 2022. Following the prepared remarks, Tom and Chris will be joined for a Q&A session by our segment presidents, Alberto Mas, President of the Medical segment; Simon Campion, President of the Interventional segment; and Dave Hickey, President of the Life Sciences segment.\nBefore we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements today. I encourage you to read the disclaimers in today's presentation slides and the disclosures in our SEC filings, which are both available on the Investor Relations website.\nUnless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis versus the relevant period. Revenue percentage changes are on an FX-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. When we refer to any given period, we are referring to the fiscal period unless we specifically note it as a calendar period.\nI would also call your attention to the basis of presentation slide, which defines term you'll hear today, such as base revenues and base margins, which refer to our results excluding COVID-only testing.\nWith that, I am very pleased to turn it over to Tom.\n\nThomas E. Polen\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Francesca. Welcome aboard. We're very happy to have you on the team.\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased with our strong performance in Q1. It reflects the continued execution of our BD2025 strategy and another quarter of consistent strong growth in our base business. We made meaningful progress and delivered on our revenue, margin, earnings and cash flow goals while advancing our innovation pipeline and our tuck-in M&A strategy. Our performance, along with the progress we are making delivering across our key priorities, gives us the confidence to increase our full year revenue and earnings guidance for both our base business and COVID testing.\nWe were able to deliver these results in an uncertain market environment, demonstrating demand across our broad portfolio of products essential to patient care, along with BD's unique ability to deliver strong performance in the face of an ongoing global pandemic. The market impacts from COVID-19 dynamics continue to be in focus, particularly in the health care sector. However, we've witnessed a global health care system that's more agile and better prepared as each new variant has emerged.\nIn Q1, health care utilization levels continued at rates similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, remaining slightly below pre-pandemic levels until mid-December, then only declining modestly as a result of Omicron.\nWhile we saw some slowdowns in deferrable procedures in the back half of December in certain regions due to hospital-imposed restrictions and staffing constraints, overall, our customers were able to continue to provide care to support patients and sustain a solid base of deferrable procedures. These challenges to procedure levels had minimal impact on our business in the first quarter. In addition, we saw routine lab testing returned to normal levels in Q1 and research lab activity remains strong.\nWith that said, as we look ahead, there are some pressures today related to staffing constraints that are impacting the delivery of some deferrable procedures, coupled with supply chain dynamics. We continue to watch these market dynamics closely.\nDespite the continued recovery, uncertainty and inflationary pressures, I'm pleased with our team's focus on execution. Our segments are delivering strong profitable growth and our strategic initiatives to enhance margins are progressing well. As seen in our results, we're off to a strong start, being very active and intentional in executing our inflation-mitigation initiatives across procurement, shipping and continuous improvements in our plants as well as appropriate pricing-related actions.\nFurther, we intend to be best-in-class in navigating the current inflationary environment. We see signs of continued pressure on shipping, labor, raw materials and electronic components over the remainder of the year since our last guidance update. However, we believe we have a clear path to accelerating margin recovery, and we expect to offset any inflationary impacts through various cost-containment and pricing-related initiatives already realized in Q1 that will enable us to deliver on our full year objectives.\nI'll now give a high-level summary of our financial performance. Q1 revenues of $5 billion reflect continued strong momentum in our base business. And through our focused execution, we grew base business revenues 8.3% in the first quarter. We also saw increased demand for our professional and at-home COVID tests relative to our previously communicated guidance, which was fueled by the Omicron variant.\nAs expected, in comparison to the prior year, COVID-only testing revenues declined, driven by lower antigen test pricing and volumes and a number of new entrants to the market with over 40 EUAs now granted in the U.S.\nWe have also continued to execute our cash flow initiatives, and we delivered strong operating cash flow of approximately $700 million. Our strong cash flow continues to enable investments in R&D and tuck-in M&A, which are fueling our BD2025 strategy.\nIn Q1, we closed 3 acquisitions, Scanwell, Tissuemed and Venclose. And just this week, we announced the acquisition of Cytognos, whose differentiated flow cytometry assays for the detection of minimal residual disease in cancer, bring an important addition to our biosciences business. These acquisitions advance our strategy to expand in higher-growth spaces that complement our durable portfolio and bring new transformative solutions across smart connected care, new care settings and improving chronic disease outcomes.\nOur disciplined capital allocation framework gives us the flexibility to deploy capital towards value-creating opportunities in both R&D and M&A for future growth as well as return capital to shareholders through a competitive dividend and share repurchases when appropriate.\nAs we look across the balance of FY '22, our Q1 momentum and focus on execution are driving our strong FY '22 outlook. As we have communicated, we see our growth profile as derisked as we're leaders in areas of health care that remain in high demand and are driving base revenues. We have strengthened our growth profile through new product launches and acquired assets in the higher-growth spaces that are adding to our performance. And we continue to support increased testing demand. While we expect the recent demand surge to be temporary, in the event that COVID-19 cases persist longer than anticipated, our testing portfolio provides a natural hedge against deferrable procedure softness and other COVID-related headwinds.\nIn addition to our derisked growth profile, we're also confident in our ability to improve our gross margins given the strong progress we've made to date through focused execution against our detailed plans to offset inflationary pressures and deliver cost improvements. All of this gives us the confidence to increase our full year revenue and earnings guidance while remaining appropriately prudent given the current uncertain environment.\nSo turning to innovation. We remain focused on enhancing our R&D productivity, and it's having an impact. During the quarter, we progressed our innovation pipeline, launching several new products. Examples include BD COR, where we recently launched our molecular MX module, which fully completes the CE Mark system. The MX is built off of our BD MAX assay technology, which will allow us to leverage the BD MAX menu of infectious disease tests into the high throughput lab segment.\nWe also launched BD Kiestra IdentifA, which received the 510(k) clearance this quarter and is designed to fully automate and integrate the preparation of microbiology bacterial identification testing using smart connected robotics.\nBeyond these achievements, we also hit several milestones across our pipeline. We submitted the 510(k) to the FDA for our TREK bone biopsy device. The TREK biopsy system will provide interventional radiologists with an easier and faster way to perform bone biopsies without the need to use multiple devices, thus reduces the cost per procedure, inventory needs and reduces procedure time.\nOur Pyxis ES version 1.7 software is now live in limited commercial release at 4 sites in anticipation of full commercial launch. This software adds new capabilities like enhanced automation and controlled substance management via improved connectivity with our C2 Safe offering and enables deeper integration of pharmacy and nursing areas.\nWe're also very proud of our new BD FACS Discover S8 CellSorter, which is currently profiled as a cover story of the January issue of Science Magazine. The S8 is a landmark advancement in flow cytometry that has the potential to transform a wide range of disciplines from immunology and genomics research to cell-based therapeutics. For the first time, we can sort cells at high speeds while separating cells not only based on which antibodies or other markers we see, but also based on new imaging parameters. To put this leapfrog technology in perspective, the most advanced flow cytometers today can analyze and sort cells based on 3 non-fluorescent parameters and have processing speeds of up to 15 megabytes per second. The S8 analyze and sorts on 11 nonfluorescent parameters and has processing speeds of up to 2,000 megabytes per second. We encourage you to visit bdbiosciences.com/celvieu to learn more about this exciting new innovation.\nI'm excited by the significant progress we continue to make advancing our BD2025 innovation-driven growth strategy. To that end, I am pleased to report that our Board of Directors recently approved the spin-off of embecta, which is scheduled to occur on April 1. We remain on track for a successful embecta spin. We continue to believe the spin is a significant value-creating opportunity for our shareholders as both BD and embecta are well positioned for success.\nembecta will be one of the largest pure-play diabetes companies in existence today with an ability to focus on its strategic goals, drive strong cash flow and allocate its capital more efficiently and effectively to drive higher revenue growth.\nFurther, we expect the spin-off will not have an impact on the long-term growth targets we laid out at Investor Day. And instead, we expect it to enhance both our sales and earnings growth profile and create an opportunity for additional shareholder value.\nFinally, regarding our progress on advancing our ESG strategy, which serves as a framework through which we address the most relevant ESG issues for our company and our stakeholders. We continue to make strong progress against our goals. We launched our inaugural 2021 Global Inclusion Diversity and Equity report, in which we shared our ID&E foundation, strategy and actions towards the healthy workforce and communities pillar of our 2030 ESG goals. BD's commitment to ID&E sets a new standard for how the company will work together to innovate new products and solutions, and we firmly believe that the more diverse people and perspectives there are at the table, the better outcomes we can produce to deliver what's next in health care.\nWe also published our second Annual Cybersecurity Report to update stakeholders on the state of health care cybersecurity, BD's impacts on advancing cybersecurity maturity and anticipated trends for 2022. We're very proud to be the first and only med tech company to publish a cybersecurity report. Through our leadership position in health care cybersecurity in our annual report, we're working to address cybersecurity challenges specific to our industry.\nWe also continue to receive external recognition of our ESG efforts, including just recently being named one of America's Most Just Companies in the Annual JUST 100 Ranking and ranking in the top 3 within our industry.\nI'm proud of the progress we're making advancing both our BD 2025 and ESG strategies. The actions we're taking are driving excellent momentum. We believe we are well positioned to deliver and create value for all of our stakeholders.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials and outlook.\n\nChristopher DelOrefice\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Becton, Dickinson and Company\n\nThanks, Tom. Echoing Tom's comments, our Q1 results demonstrate the strength of our business and the momentum of our strategy. We are enhancing our growth profile through the portfolio and investment actions we are taking, while also executing on margin improvement and inflationary-mitigation programs to deliver our long-term margin expansion targets and double-digit earnings growth profile. To that end, I'd like to recognize our associates across supply chain for their contributions. We have an incredible team around the world that is not only addressing the challenges that all companies are facing in today's environment, but they are excelling and driving performance.\nTurning to our revenue performance. We delivered $5 billion in revenue in the first quarter comprised of $4.8 billion in base business revenues, which had strong growth of 8.3%, and 7.8% organic, which excludes the impact of acquisitions. COVID-only testing revenues were $185 million, which, as expected, declined from $866 million last year, as this was our highest revenue quarter for COVID testing last year given higher pricing and volumes. The year-over-year decline in total company revenues of 5.9% is entirely attributable to the decline in testing revenues.\nBD is uniquely positioned to deliver strong performance during these uncertain times. The breadth and diversification of the total BD portfolio, including COVID diagnostic testing, provides insulation against COVID-driven procedure fluctuations, as demonstrated by the revenue performance across our segments, with BD Medical growing 6%, Life Sciences based revenues growing over 17% and Interventional growing 3.8%.\nTotal company base business growth was also strong regionally, with double-digit growth in the U.S., China and Latin America.\nLet me now provide some further insight into each segment's performance.\nOur Medical segment delivered $2.4 billion in revenues in the first quarter, growing 6%, led by our Medication Delivery Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems businesses.\nMDS revenues increased 7.3%, reflecting strong demand for our durable core products, particularly in the U.S., driven by competitive gains in catheters and vascular care devices. Our leadership position in these markets allow us to provide a strong value proposition to our customers in terms of the breadth of our portfolio as well as the cost and quality of our products. Importantly, as input costs such as resins have increased, we've been able to take appropriate price actions and accelerate cost mitigation programs while continuing to invest in innovation to support our strong value proposition.\nIn MMS, revenues were down slightly due to the difficult prior-year comparison given the high number of infusion pump placements last year in the U.S. and Europe to support COVID-related hospital needs. Excluding this impact, our MMS business reflects continued execution of our medication management strategy, which drove strong demand worldwide for our dispensing solutions. This was particularly evident in the U.S., where we saw another strong quarter of customer signings. The traction we are getting reflects the value our Pyxis platform provides our customers.\nRevenue growth of 1.6% in Diabetes Care reflects our category leadership position. Growth was aided by the timing of certain orders.\nPharm Systems revenue grew nearly 18%, driven by continued strong demand for pre-fillable devices. Growth was also enabled by our focused execution on capacity expansion that allowed us to fulfill certain orders earlier than originally anticipated. Demand for pre-filled devices continues to be aided by the fast-paced vial to pre-filled device conversion for biologics, vaccines and other injectable drugs.\nBD Life Sciences revenue totaled $1.5 billion in the first quarter. The decline of 24.8% year-over-year is solely due to lower COVID-only testing revenues previously discussed. Excluding COVID-only testing, Life Sciences base revenues grew 17.2%, with licensing revenue in IDS contributing about 400 basis points to the segment's base growth and about 100 basis points to the total company based revenue growth.\nIn IDS, base business revenues had strong growth of 20.3%, including about 600 basis points from licensing revenue. Performance was driven by our specimen management, microbiology and molecular platforms as routine lab testing returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nGrowth in BD MAX IVD assays was also strong, reflecting the leverage we are getting on the larger installed base. Performance in our base business includes sales of our combination flu COVID assay that were in line with our expectations. Indications are the respiratory season will be a normal to low flu season.\nBiosciences revenues increased 9%, driven by strong demand for research solutions as a result of lab utilization returning to normal levels and continued research on COVID variants. Contributing to Life Sciences Q1 growth were the 2 new FACSSymphony instruments that we launched in FY '21. As the evolution of flow cytometry continues to move from large labs to more midsized independent labs, we now provide a complete suite of analyzers for researchers from the benchtop A1 to the A5 SE, our first spectral analyzer that enables researchers to do even high-parameter cellular analysis to gain broader insights into pioneering new discoveries and treatments for cancer and other immune-related conditions.\nOur new e-commerce site also contributed to growth in Q1.\nBD Interventional revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the first quarter, growing 3.8%. BDI's performance reflects strong growth in Surgery and UCC. Q1 performance was impacted by temporary supply chain disruptions, and consistent with our ReCoDe initiative, product line discontinuations of lower-margin products in our PI and UCC businesses. While these strategic discontinuations create a temporary headwind to revenue growth, it demonstrates our commitment to simplifying our portfolio and enhancing margins.\nWe had a strong start to the year in our Surgery business, with revenue growth of nearly 9% despite some modest slowdowns towards the end of December due to Omicron. Strength in the quarter was driven by double-digit growth in advanced reconstruction and repair, with strength in hernia as deferrable procedures recovered, and the recent acquisition of Tepha.\nTepha provides us with a vertical integration strategy for our current [Phasix] platform, but more importantly, it provides us with exciting new opportunities to expand our horizon into new high-growth areas of tissue repair, reconstruction and regeneration.\nDouble-digit growth in biosurgery and high single-digit growth in infection prevention was also driven by the recovery of deferrable procedures and continued market adoption of Sterile BD ChloraPrep.\nRevenues in Peripheral Intervention declined 3.1% as a result of a product recall from fiscal '21 and the previously mentioned supply disruptions and product line discontinuations that support our margin enhancement goals. However, we saw continued acceleration in our atherectomy platform in China as we have leveraged the capabilities of our sales force. We are also experiencing positive momentum from our recent acquisition of Venclose.\nUrology & Critical Care revenues grew 7.7%, driven by continued strong demand for PureWick in our acute urology portfolio. We're also seeing continued adoption of our PureWick solutions in the home as we advance our strategy to expand our addressable market and deliver transformative solutions for alternate care settings. Also contributing to growth was remediation of Q4's temporary supply disruption within acute urology.\nNow moving to our P&L. We delivered adjusted net income and EPS above our expectations in Q1, with adjusted net income of $1.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of $3.64. We had strong execution of our margin enhancement initiatives in Q1 and delivered base business gross margin of 55.4% and operating margin of 24.3%. We remain on track to deliver our full year base margin goals, with our base margin performance in Q1 ahead of our expectations for the quarter and also above our full year base margin expectations, due to our ability to realize some of our inflation mitigation and pricing initiatives sooner than we previously anticipated.\nIn addition, our Q1 base business operating margin also included a benefit of about 40 basis points from licensing revenues in Life Sciences that was included in our full year plan. Excluding the licensing revenue, base gross and operating margin would have been nearly 55% and 24%, respectively.\nOther key drivers of gross margin in Q1 include a benefit from increased volume utilization given our strong base revenue growth and, as expected, favorable FX we experienced in 2021 but was recorded in inventory and benefited our GP this quarter when sold. We did realize a negative impact from inflation in the quarter, which was broadly in line with our expectations and was partially offset by our cost improvement and inflation mitigation actions, which are occurring as planned. We are making very good progress with strong sequential improvement and our full year base gross margin improvement goal remains on track despite continued inflationary pressures.\nSSG&A was in line with expectations and increased year-over-year, driven by variable expenses, including selling and commissions, and inflationary impacts, primarily in shipping, that we have previously shared. The increase in SSG&A as a percent of sales is a function of lower testing sales. However, we did leverage SSG&A versus our base revenue, which is contributing to our base operating margin improvement.\nR&D increased year-over-year, consistent with our strategy to invest more to support our long-term growth outlook.\nAs anticipated and communicated on our prior earnings call, our tax rate benefited from the timing of discrete items, resulting in a lower effective tax rate in the quarter.\nRegarding our cash and capital allocation. Cash flows from operations totaled approximately $700 million in the first quarter. We ended Q1 with a strong cash balance of $1.9 billion and an adjusted net leverage ratio of 2.8x. Our cash balance reflects our strategic investments in M&A during the quarter.\nOur current cash and leverage position and continued focus on strong cash flows provide us the flexibility to advance our balanced capital allocation framework and support our BD2025 growth strategy through investments in R&D, capital and M&A.\nDuring Q1, we invested in R&D at over 6% of sales to advance our innovation pipeline. We also invested over $400 million in 3 additional tuck-in acquisitions across our businesses that will support our strong growth profile in 2022 and beyond.\nTurning to our fiscal '22 guidance assumptions. First, the macro considerations that support our guidance. While we still expect some global COVID-driven variability, our guidance assumes the continued easing of COVID-19 restrictions, the stabilization of deferrable procedures and no significant disruptions to deferrable procedure volumes. Additionally, we see signs of continued inflationary and supply chain pressure over the balance of the year, with some stabilization by the end of the year. However, we believe we have a clear path to margin recovery, and we expect to offset any incremental inflation impact through various cost containment and pricing-related initiatives already realized in Q1. Our guidance doesn't contemplate a more significant step increase in market-driven supply chain and inflationary disruption.\nA few comments on testing-specific assumptions. Our base business revenue assumptions include sales of our combination flu COVID assays. We anticipate a normal to light flu season based on what we've seen so far from the CDC surveillance reports.\nMoving to our updated guidance for fiscal '22. We are well positioned for strong growth across our 3 segments, which are delivering at or above our initial expectations and, thus, we are increasing our base revenue guidance.\nWhile we aren't providing segment-specific items, relative to our revised total company base growth outlook, we expect our Medical segment growth to be slightly below and our Life Sciences and Interventional segment growth to be slightly above total company growth.\nWe now expect base revenues to grow 5.75% to 6.75% on an FX-neutral basis from $18.3 billion in fiscal '21. This is an increase from our previous guidance of 5% to 6% growth and is driven by our Q1 revenue outperformance and confidence in the strength and resilience of our base portfolio, and our Q1 acquisitions, which account for about 25 basis points of the increase.\nFor COVID-only testing, we are now assuming $450 million in revenue, which is a little more than double our original expectation of $200 million. As we communicated last quarter, higher testing revenues position us well to manage through this period of uncertainty and also provide the potential to create value through reinvestment in our business. Given our increased testing revenue expectations, we currently plan to reinvest a portion of the testing profits over the balance of the year, but we'll ensure they are value-creating opportunities and would not invest at a level that would result in our full year testing margins dropping below our base margins. Should those investment opportunities not materialize as anticipated, we would allow the incremental profits to flow through.\nBased on current spot rates, for illustrative purposes, currency is now estimated to be a headwind of approximately 125 basis points or about $250 million to total company revenues. This is an incremental 75 basis point headwind compared to our prior view.\nAll in with our base revenue, COVID-only testing revenue and the illustrative currency impact, we now expect reported revenues in the range of $19.55 billion to $19.75 billion in fiscal '22, compared to $19.3 billion to $19.5 billion previously announced.\nWe still expect operating margins in our base business to improve by approximately 200 basis points over our fiscal '21 base operating margin of 21.7%.\nGiven the planned reinvestment, we also still expect operating margin on COVID-only testing to be modestly above our base business margins.\nA few additional items for your models. We now expect $50 million to $75 million in year-over-year improvement in interest other or an incremental $25 million benefit. We still expect an effective tax rate of 12.5% to 13.5% for the full year. Our guidance still assumes share repurchases that, at a minimum, offset any dilution from share-based compensation.\nAll in, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to be between $12.80 and $13, which is an increase of $0.50 at the midpoint from our prior guidance of $12.30 to $12.50. This includes absorbing the negative impact of currency, which we estimate to be about $0.10. The increase reflects our strong Q1 base business performance and our expectations for increased COVID testing net of reinvestment.\nAs a reminder, our fiscal '22 guidance continues to include our Diabetes business.\nAs Tom mentioned, the embecta spin has now been approved by the Board of Directors. As we proceed towards the spin date, I want to provide a few reminders Restated financials for RemainCo will not be made public until the completion of the spinoff. Given the higher but declining margin profile of embecta, one should expect BD margins to be lower after they're restated. However, off the restated FY '21 financials, we are still targeting about 400 basis points of base operating margin expansion through FY '25. BD is expected to receive a distribution of approximately $1.44 billion, equivalent to multiple years of cash generated by the Diabetes Care unit. We remain excited for what's ahead for embecta and making this a successful and value-creating opportunity for everyone.\nAs you think about phasing for the balance of the year, the following are a few key considerations as you think of our base revenue and earnings. Regarding sales, we remain confident in the durable nature of our portfolio and the strength of our underlying sales.\nIn Q2, we expect some impact from Omicron on hospital staffing and procedures. But recall, Q2 is a relatively easy compare due to the significant COVID resurgence we experienced in Q2 of fiscal '21. As a result, we anticipate base revenue growth in Q2 to be above our full year guidance range, with the remaining quarters being equally balanced.\nRegarding our margins and P&L, as I noted, Q1 had the benefit from licensing, which added about 40 basis points to operating margin, which will not repeat in Q2. While we expect improvement versus the prior year, we also previously shared that Q2 would be the quarter with the largest inflationary impact.\nSo given those 2 dynamics, you would expect a sequential step down in margin, and we expect Q2 to represent the low watermark for base operating margin for the year.\nWe remain well on track to achieve our base operating margin guidance of approximately 200 basis points improvement. As we progress through the second half of the fiscal year, in Q3, we expect the impact of inflation on our business to stabilize and see a modest pickup of cost improvement and price-related benefits flowing through, with Q4 being the highest benefit. As a reminder, we see our SSG&A and R&D costs relatively evenly spread through the year.\nAs expected, our tax rate in Q1 benefited from the timing of discrete items. At the midpoint of our full year guidance range, that would imply we expect our average tax rate for the balance of the year to be about 13.7%, which is best to apply for the subsequent quarters.\nRegarding COVID-only testing sales, we expect the vast majority of testing revenues to occur in fiscal Q2 and then trend down as Omicron subsides. In future years, we would not expect this level of COVID-only testing to repeat.\nIn summary, we are continuing to advance our BD2025 strategic objectives with focused execution against our key priorities. As we look forward, and as reflected in our FY '22 guidance, we are well positioned for growth with excellent momentum in our base business, increased investments in our innovation pipeline, tuck-in M&A momentum, strong progress executing our balance sheet and cash flow initiatives and clear visibility to meaningful margin improvement.\nThanks for your time. Operator, we can now open the line for Q&A."

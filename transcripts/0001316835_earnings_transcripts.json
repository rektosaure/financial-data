[Operator Instructions]\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Heather Kos, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead.\n\nHeather Anne Kos\n\nVP of IR, Univar Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings call.

Jackson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. Over the past several years, we have transformed into a stronger organization powered by our leading network of value-added solutions our relentless focus on operational excellence and superior capital deployment. These strengths, combined with our scale and a team is dedicated to exceptional customer service, have driven margin expansion, reinforced our industry leadership and extended our track record of success. By focusing on the factors within our control and leveraging our competitive advantages, we are competing effectively today. and are well positioned to outperform our competitors as the market recovers.\nLet's turn now to Slide 4. Our third quarter results reflect the strength of our strategy and disciplined execution in a weak housing market. We continue to execute effectively and sustain healthy profitability despite a low starts environment. underscoring our operational disciplines and improvements since 2019. Let's take a minute to step back and talk about the market. Single-family construction remains soft as Builders manage the pace of starts given affordability concerns, consumer uncertainty and elevated new home inventories. Demand remains tempered despite Fed rate cuts in 2025.\nAs a reminder, Q4 is one of our slower quarters due to seasonality. Our Builders customers have addressed these challenges by offering smaller and simpler homes as well as incentives such as interest rate buydowns. That creates an environment where there are less sales dollars per start, and every start is more competitive on the affordability front. We are working closely with leveraging our broad product portfolio and bundled solutions to drive cost efficiencies while upholding the highest quality standards. In the multifamily market, activity is expected to remain muted through year-end, in line with our previous thinking. However, we have seen green shoots and quoting activity as our customers see improving financing costs. As a reminder, our first sale tends to lag a multifamily start by roughly 9 to 12 months. We continue to be multifamily as an appealing and profitable business for us, supported by a substantial mix of value-added products and attractive fundamentals.\nOn Slide 5, we highlight some of the key initiatives under our strategic pillars. In the third quarter, we invested more than $20 million in value-added solutions to expand our product offerings in key markets. This included opening a new millwork location in South Carolina and expanding our upgrading plants in 7 states. We remain disciplined in how we deploy capital. Our consistent strong free cash flow through the cycle gives us the flexibility to invest in organic growth, pursue strategic M&A and return capital to shareholders. This capital deployment is strengthening our competitive position and driving long-term value creation. Operational excellence is crucial to how we run the business as we develop talent, improve agility and embed technology into our operations. We generated $11 million in productivity savings in Q3 primarily through targeted supply chain initiatives.\nTurning to Slide 6. We are prudently managing discretionary spending and maximizing operational flexibility. In response to lower volumes over the last year, we have taken steps to align capacity across our facilities, manage head count and control expenses. We are reducing variable costs today while also investing in needed capacity to ensure we are positioned to scale quickly with the expected recovery in demand. Year-to-date through September, we have consolidated 16 facilities, including 8 in the third while maintaining an on-time and in-full delivery rate of 92%, with our industry-leading scale, experienced leadership team and a track record of operating proactively through the cycle, we are confident that we can continue to deliver exceptional customer service.\nMoving to Slide 7. Our disciplined capital allocation strategy focuses on maximizing shareholder returns through organic growth, M&A and share repurchases. In the third quarter, we deployed over $100 million toward return-enhancing opportunities aligned with those priorities. Drilling into M&A on Slide 8, we remain focused on pursuing acquisitions that expand our value-added product offerings and advance our leadership position in desirable geographies. We have developed substantial and proven muscle memory to grow through M&A and have a track record of successful integration. In the third quarter, we acquired St. George Trust Company, trust manufacturer serving builders in Southern Utah and Southern Nevada. In October, we acquired [indiscernible]. Together, the 2 companies formed a leading provider of door and network capabilities in the Las Vegas area, closing a key product gap in the region and strengthening our ability to deliver comprehensive solutions to our customers.\nWe have made 3 acquisitions, representing over $2 billion in annual sales since the BMC merger in 2021, the equivalent of a top 10 LVM player demonstrating our ability to execute and integrate seamlessly. And with the industry still fragmented, we see significant opportunity ahead. We remain confident that inorganic investments will remain an important driver of long-term growth.\nLet's now turn to Slide 9 and discuss the latest updates on our digital and technology strategy. We are accelerating the adoption of our digital capabilities in deploying scalable customer-centric solutions that will strengthen our operational agility and support long-term growth. Our BFS digital tools deliver meaningful benefits to our homebuilder customers and align BFS as a key technology partner in the industry. Despite the weak market, we have seen continued adoption with our target audience of smaller builders. Since launching in early 2024, our digital tools have processed over $2.5 billion of orders and over $5 billion of quotes, representing increases in excess of 200% year-to-date. Importantly, we're seeing that digital is not just about incremental sales.\nIt's a catalyst for a broader company growth. The efficiencies and capabilities enabled by our digital tools, including artificial intelligence, accelerate the pace and elevate the precision of our quoting and sales operations. While it's evident that our initial business case around digital did not predict the timing of our outcomes very well, we remain convinced of the tremendous shareholder value that the digital tools will unlock for us. Continuing on the technology front.\nI'm pleased that we continue to make steady progress on our comprehensive implementation of SAP after the launch of 2 pilot markets in July. We've gained valuable insights from these initial pilots, and we'll be applying those learnings as we prepare for the next phase. During Q3, we also successfully converted to SAP for our centralized accounting functions as well as for all of our internal and external financial report. Although these conversions are never easy, we are working through the details and are excited about the growth and efficiency opportunities to come with this new software.\nRecognizing one of our incredible team members each quarter is one of the best parts of my role. Today, I want to spotlight [indiscernible] driver at our Lebanon, Tennessee yard recently celebrated 40 years with BFS. Harold is known for his dependability, strong work ethic in love of the Tennessee volunteers. The dedication shows in his commitment, he's often at the yard before 4:00 a.m. and in the way he shares his experience, having trained more than 100 drivers over the years. He's also earned a reputation for driving over the region's toughest Hills with skill and care. I'm honored to recognize here and so many others across BFS, whose hard work and commitment continue to move us forward.\nI'll now turn the call over to Pete to discuss our financial results in greater detail.\n\nPete R. Beckmann\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. We continue to execute our strategy in a down market. responding to near-term challenges and carefully managing costs while preserving our ability to invest for the future. Our financial agility, supported by a healthy balance sheet and strong free cash flow through the cycle, enables us to deploy capital prudently to fuel organic growth, pursue strategic M&A and return capital to shareholders. These investments are bolstering our competitive position as we invest for the future. .\nLet's begin by reviewing our third quarter performance on Slides 10 through 12. Net sales decreased 6.9% to $3.9 billion, driven by lower organic sales and commodity deflation partially offset by growth from acquisitions. The core organic sales decrease was driven by a 12% decline in single family due to lower starts activity and value per start as well as a 20% decline in multifamily in line with our expectations amid muted activity levels against stronger prior year comps. Additionally, repair and remodel decreased 1% given consumer uncertainty.\nAs we've noted on recent calls, there are a few key factors reconciled single-family starts through our core organic sales. First, as a reminder, there is a roughly 3-month lag from a start to our first sale. Second, the value of the average home has fallen as size and complexity have decreased over time, rating in additional sales headwind. Third, margins remain pressured throughout the supply chain as affordability concerns continue to be paramount. Based on this, we believe our third quarter share was flat to up slightly as we continue to be the industry leader and a trusted partner to our customers. For the third quarter, gross profit was $1.2 billion, a decrease of 13.5% compared to the prior year period. Gross margin was 30.4% and down 240 basis points, primarily driven by below normal starts environment. Compared to an approximately 27% gross margin in 2019, our Q3 gross margin reflects the substantial investments we have made and value-added solutions and our continuous improvement.\nAdjusted SG&A of $790 million increased $7 million, primarily due to acquired operations partially offset by lower variable compensation due to lower sales. As Peter touched on previously, we are focused on carefully managing our SG&A and are well positioned to leverage our costs as the market grows. Adjusted EBITDA was $434 million, down approximately 31%, primarily driven by lower gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11% and down 380 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to lower gross profit margins and reduced operating leverage. Our ability to maintain a double-digit EBITDA margin in a weak market is a testament to strength of our transformative business. Adjusted EPS was $1.88, a decrease of 39% compared to the prior year on a year-over-year basis. share repurchases enabled by our strong free cash flow generation, added roughly $0.10 per share for the third quarter.\nNow let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 13. Our third quarter operating cash flow was $548 million, a decrease of $182 million, mainly driven by lower net income. We generated free cash flow of $465 million. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow yield was approximately 8%, and our operating cash flow return on invested capital was 15%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.3x, while our fixed charge coverage ratio was roughly 6x. We have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. Our maturity profile enables us to remain operationally and financially disciplined while preserving a flexible balance sheet for accretive capital deployment.\nMoving to third quarter capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $83 million, and we deployed $19 million on acquisitions. We only have $500 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We remain comfortable with our net debt levels, and we'll continue to execute our capital allocation priorities in a disciplined manner on the path to maximizing value creation.\nOn Slides 14 and 15, we show our 2025 outlook and assumptions. On a year-over-year basis, our latest forecast assumes single-family starts down 9% for the year, will definitely source down mid-teens and [indiscernible] to be flat. The 2025 multifamily headwind to sales of $400 million to $500 million and EBITDA of less than $200 million has largely been digested and remains on track. As a result, we are guiding net sales in the range of $15.1 billion to $15.4 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $1.625 billion to $1.675 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecast to be in the range of 10.6% to 11.1%. We [indiscernible] our 2025 full year gross margin to be in the range of 30.1% to 30.5%, reflecting our strong execution in a below normal starts environment.\nWe expect free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion. Our revised guidance assumes average commodity prices in the range of $370 to $390 per thousand board foot versus the long-term average of $400.\nMoving to Slide 16. We recognize that 2026 is coming into focus as we approach year-end. Like we did last year, we have laid out a scenario analysis to demonstrate how we are positioned to generate resilient financial performance across a range of potential housing market and commodity conditions. As you can see, we have included a new scenario that provides a perspective on our performance and a normal housing environment. I want to emphasize that this is not guidance. These scenarios should help clarify our range of performance expectations for 2026 and demonstrate the strength of the best-in-class operating platform.\nIn closing, we are closely monitoring the current environment and remain agile to mitigate downside risk in the near term while also investing strategically for the future. I am confident in our ability to drive long-term growth by executing our strategy over in our exceptional platform and maintaining financial flexibility.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Peter for some final comments.\n\nPeter M. Jackson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThanks, Pete. I want to close by emphasizing the transformation of BFS as illustrated on Slide 17. Today, we are an exceptionally improved organization, one powered by our value-added solutions and digital tools. Our relentless focus on operational excellence and a disciplined capital deployment strategy. These improvements, combined with our scale, have positioned us to accelerate growth as we return to a normalized starts environment. By controlling what we can control and leveraging our competitive advantages, we will continue to deliver exceptional long-term shareholder value. .\nThank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions."

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Heather Kos, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead.\n\nHeather Anne Kos\n\nVP of IR, Univar Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2025 earnings call. With me on the call are Peter Jackson, our CEO; and Pete Beckmann, our CFO. The earnings press release and presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to the presentation during our call.\nThe results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation.\nOur remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the Forward-Looking Statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.\n\nPeter M. Jackson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. Our durable results in the second quarter reinforce the advantage of our differentiated product offerings and commitment to execution. In this challenging market environment, we are prioritizing what's within our control: Serving customers with excellence, leveraging technology and managing the business with discipline. These efforts are strengthening our position in the industry and laying the foundation to emerge stronger as market conditions improve.\nAs shown on Slide 3, we continue to execute against our strategy as we operate in a dynamic environment. This morning, I want to drill down on 3 key focus areas within our strategy: Our customers, operational excellence and capital allocation, what we refer to internally as smart investments.\nDelivering exceptional customer service is a core value as we drive for growth. We drive to be trusted partners to homebuilders by providing best-in-class service every day and working together to solve the industry's most complex challenges. We are expanding our value-added solutions and leveraging technology, including our end-to-end BFS digital tools to help create a differentiating customer experience while empowering our teams to serve more effectively.\nThe next focus area, operational excellence, is crucial to how we run the business. It's about developing talent, improving agility and embedding technology into our operations with the implementation of a single ERP system. As we talked about previously, moving to SAP will unlock further opportunities for growth and efficiencies, including how we make decisions, streamline operations and manage costs. Finally, we remain disciplined in how we deploy capital. Our consistent strong free cash flow through the cycle gives us the flexibility to invest in organic growth, pursue strategic M&A and return capital to shareholders. These investments are strengthening our competitive position and driving long-term value creation.\nLet's turn now to our second quarter performance on Slide 5. Our sales were impacted by a softer-than-expected housing market due to ongoing affordability concerns and rising home inventories as completions outpaced sales. While we readily acknowledge that we are experiencing lower margins as we support our customers, I'm pleased that we are maintaining healthy profitability in a [ low starts ] environment, a testament to the operational discipline that is part of the fabric of BFS.\nSlide 6, we highlight key areas where we've been executing our 4 strategic pillars. In the second quarter, we invested more than $35 million in value-added solutions as we build for the future. This included opening a new millwork location in Florida and expanding or upgrading plants in 7 states. We generated $5 million in productivity savings in Q2, primarily through targeted supply chain initiatives. We are focusing on optimizing processes, utilizing new tools and partnering with suppliers to grow share.\nTurning to Slide 7. We remain disciplined stewards of discretionary spending, and we are continuing to maximize operational flexibility. In response to lower volumes over the last year, we have taken meaningful steps to align capacity across our facilities, manage headcount and control expenses. Year-to-date through June, we have consolidated 8 facilities while maintaining an on-time and in-full delivery rate of 92%. With our industry-leading scale, experienced leadership team and a track record of operating proactively through the cycle, we are confident that we can continue to deliver exceptional customer service.\nSingle-family starts remain soft as builders manage the pace of construction. As expected, we've experienced a muted sales pace that is below the normal seasonal levels. Given customer feedback and our understanding of land development trends, we expect single-family starts to decrease through year-end.\nBuilders are working to help buyers find affordable options by offering smaller and simpler homes, as well as incentives such as interest rate buy-ins. We are marching in lockstep with builders through our comprehensive product portfolio, enabling them to optimize their costs while maintaining quality.\nMulti-family also remains muted, driven by higher input and financing costs. However, with a substantial mix of value-added products and attractive long-term fundamentals, multi-family remains an appealing and profitable business for us.\nTurning to M&A on Slide 8. We remain focused on pursuing higher return opportunities that expand our value-added product offerings and advance our leadership position in desirable geographies. Over the years, we have developed substantial and proven muscle memory to grow through M&A and have a track record of successful integration.\nIn the second quarter, we acquired Truckee-Tahoe Lumber with aggregate prior year sales of roughly $120 million. Truckee-Tahoe's reputation of excellence as a leading supplier of lumber and building materials extends our presence in the Northern California and Nevada markets. We have made 35 acquisitions since the BMC merger in 2021, yet our industry remains highly fragmented. Today's market volatility makes price discovery difficult. But despite the current slower M&A environment, we are confident that inorganic investments will remain an important driver of long-term growth.\nTurning to Slide 9. Our disciplined capital allocation strategy focuses on maximizing shareholder returns through organic growth, M&A and share repurchases. In the second quarter, we deployed over $500 million towards return-enhancing opportunities aligned with our priorities.\nNow let's turn to Slide 10 and discuss the latest updates on our digital and technology strategy. In June, we announced Gayatri Narayan as our new President of Technology and Digital Solutions. Gayatri brings over 2 decades of global technology leadership experience, having held senior roles at Amazon, Microsoft and PepsiCo. Her proven track record of driving innovation and growth through digital transformation will be instrumental as we leverage technology to enhance connectivity across our industry.\nWe are accelerating the integration of our digital source systems and deploying scalable customer-centric solutions that will strengthen our operational agility and support long-term growth. Our BFS digital tools deliver meaningful benefits to our homebuilder customers and align BFS as a key technology partner. Despite the challenging market, we have seen continued adoption with our target audience of smaller builders.\nSince launch in early 2024, we have seen more than $2 billion of orders and $4 billion of quotes placed through our BFS digital tools. These metrics are up more than 400% and nearly 300% year-to-date, respectively, compared to 2024. We continue to refine our new adoption road map, and we'll roll out our new thinking around benefits and timing later this year.\nI'm pleased that we continue to make progress on our implementation of SAP with the launch of 2 pilot markets earlier this month. Although these conversions are never easy, we are working through the details and are excited about the growth and efficiency opportunities to come with this new software.\nI remain deeply grateful for the opportunities to lead such a skilled and dedicated team that makes a difference every day. This quarter, I want to highlight [ Jim Henry ], a load builder in our Burbank Yard, who recently celebrated an incredible 40 years with BFS. Jim is known for his efficiency, flexibility, team-first attitude and his love of cycling. He's had a lasting impact on operations and is someone his teammates look to as a model of how to get the job done right. I'm proud of Jim and the many others across our organization whose hard work and commitment drive BFS forward.\nI'll now turn the call over to Pete to discuss our financial results in greater detail.\n\nPete R. Beckmann\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. We continue to benefit from the strength and adaptability of our operating model. By executing consistently through the cycle, we are generating strong free cash flow and preserving financial flexibility. Our scale, operational rigor and talented team give us confidence in our ability to deliver [ solid results ] and compound value into the future. We remain disciplined in our capital deployment with a focus on maintaining a healthy balance sheet and investing in high-return opportunities.\nI'd like to pause for a moment to highlight our operating model, a core differentiator that continues to set us apart in the industry. At BFS, we have a disciplined enterprise-wide approach that unites our teams across functions, geographies and product categories. We conduct granular performance reviews that track market trends and key productivity metrics, such as [ truss board foot ] per labor hour and utilization rates of manufacturing and fleet capacity. These insights enable us to identify opportunities, address challenges early to drive continuous improvement across the business.\nWhat truly reinforces this discipline is the active oversight of our Executive Steering Committee. This cross-functional leadership group needs to review operational KPIs and challenge assumptions and confirm alignment with our strategic goals. Their involvement ensures that insights from the field translate into action at the highest levels of the organization, enabling us to respond quickly and adapt as needed to evolving market dynamics.\nLet's begin by reviewing our second quarter performance on Slides 11 through 13. Net sales decreased 5% to $4.2 billion, driven by lower organic sales and commodity deflation, partially offset by growth from acquisitions. We continued to experience commodity deflation, attributable largely to lower OSB prices. While pending duties and capacity rationalization have contributed to a more stable lumber market, OSB capacity additions have continued to create downward pricing pressure. The organic sales decrease was driven by a 23% decline in multi-family, with muted activity levels against stronger prior year comps.\nAdditionally, single-family declined 9%, attributable to lower starts activity and value per start, while repair and remodel increased 3%, driven by strength in the Mid-Atlantic and South Central regions. As we've noted on recent calls, there are a few key factors reconciling single-family starts to our core organic sales. First, as a reminder, there was a roughly 3-month lag from a [ start tour ] for sale. Second, the value of the average home has fallen as size and complexity have decreased over time. Third, margins remain pressured throughout the supply chain as affordability concerns continue to be paramount. Despite these challenges, we continue to lead the building products market and serve as a trusted partner to our customers.\nFor the second quarter, gross profit was $1.3 billion, a decrease of 11% compared to the prior year period. Gross margin was 30.7%, down 210 basis points, primarily driven by single and multi-family margin normalization, as well as a below normal source environment. Adjusted SG&A of $818 million increased $4 million, primarily attributable to acquired operations, partially offset by lower variable compensation due to lower sales. On an annual basis, adjusted SG&A was approximately 30% fixed and 70% variable with volumes, enabling flexibility during challenging periods.\nAs Peter touched on previously, we are focused on carefully managing our SG&A and are well positioned to leverage our costs as the market grows. Adjusted EBITDA was $506 million, down 24%, primarily driven by lower gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12%, down 300 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to lower gross profit margins and reduced operating leverage. Adjusted EPS was $2.38, a decrease of 32% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases, enabled by our strong free cash flow generation, [ added ] roughly $0.18 per share for the second quarter.\nNow let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 14. Our second quarter operating cash flow was $341 million, a decrease of $111 million, mainly attributable to lower net income. We generated free cash flow of $255 million. Our trailing 12 months free cash flow yield was 9%, and operating cash flow return on invested capital was 18%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.3x, while our fixed charge coverage ratio was roughly 6x.\nIn May, we completed a $750 million offering of 6.75% senior unsecured notes due 2035 to pay down the balance on our ABL. Additionally, we upsized our ABL facility by $400 million to $2.2 billion. We have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. Our maturity profile enables us to remain operationally and financially disciplined while preserving a flexible balance sheet for accretive capital deployment.\nMoving to second quarter capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $86 million. We deployed $61 million on acquisitions, and we repurchased 3.3 million shares at an average price of $118.27 per share for $391 million. We currently have $500 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. While our 2.3x leverage ratio is slightly above our target range, we remain comfortable with our net debt levels. We will continue to execute our capital allocation priorities and remain disciplined stewards of capital on the path to maximizing value creation.\nOn Slide 15 and 16, we show our 2025 scenarios and outlook. Given the dispersion of potential housing market and commodity outcomes for the rest of the year, we have laid out a scenario analysis to demonstrate how we are positioned to generate resilient financial performance. As you can see, the bottom of our guidance range corresponds to lower assumptions for single-family starts and commodity prices. Our latest forecast assumes single-family is down 10% to 12% for the year. We continue to expect a multi-family headwind to sales of $400 million to $500 million and a headwind to EBITDA of less than $200 million, with most of the drag already coming in the first half of the year.\nWe also expect R&R end market to be flat. As a result, we are guiding net sales in the range of $14.8 billion to $15.6 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecast to be in the range of 10.1% to 10.9%. Given the below normal starts environment, we expect our 2025 full year gross margin to be below long-term normalized levels and in a range of 29% to 30.5%.\nWe expect free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion. Our revised guidance assumes average commodity prices in the range of $375 to $425 per thousand board foot. Please refer to our earnings release and presentation for a list of key 2025 assumptions.\nAdditionally, we want to provide color for Q3 because of our ongoing macro volatility and to align with builder expectations. We expect Q3 net sales to be between $3.65 and $3.95 billion given a weaker-than-normal building season. Q3 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $375 million and $425 million.\nIn closing, we are closely monitoring the current environment and remain agile to mitigate downside risk in the near term while also investing strategically for the future. I'm confident in our ability to drive long-term growth by executing our strategy, leveraging our exceptional platform and maintaining financial flexibility.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Peter for some final thoughts.\n\nPeter M. Jackson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThanks, Pete. I want to close today by emphasizing the transformation of BFS. Today, we are an exceptionally improved organization, one powered by differentiated product offerings, including our value-added solutions, our relentless focus on operational excellence and disciplined capital deployment strategies. This evolution is illustrated on Slide 18, which highlights how our performance in a challenged starts environment is substantially better today than in 2019.\nOur business is positioned to accelerate when starts increase and current headwinds begin to subside. Our current -- our customer relationships are deepening, our operational efficiency is improving and our technology platform is creating real value for the business. By controlling what we can control and leveraging our competitive advantages, we will continue to compound long-term shareholder value.\nThank you for joining us today. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions."

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Heather Kos. Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead.\n\nHeather Anne Kos\n\nVP of IR, Univar Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2025 earnings call. With me on the call are Peter Jackson, our CEO; and Pete Beckmann, our CFO.\nThe earnings press release and presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to the presentation during our call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation.\nOur remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.\n\nPeter M. Jackson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. Given the current environment, I'm proud of our resilient results for the first quarter, which reflect the strength of our differentiated product portfolio and our continued focus on driving operational excellence. While macro and industry dynamics continue to be unsettled, we remain confident in our ability to navigate any challenges. We are a cycle-tested team that has withstood economic uncertainty in the past. We will execute again by staying rooted in our strategy and focusing on the factors within our control.\nDuring these uncertain times, our role as a trusted partner is vital as we help our customers address affordability challenges and increase efficiency. We are focused on the near term while laying the groundwork for future growth. As the market recovers, I'm confident we will outperform.\nAs shown on Slide 3, our strategy remains consistent. We are focused on organic growth, operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation. We are committed to advancing our strong foundation and driving value creation for our customers through investments in innovation. Our significant investments in value-added products, digital tools and internal systems are cementing our leading industry position.\nLet's turn now to our first quarter performance on Slide 4. Our team's ability to drive resilient results, despite external headwinds, reflects our focus on execution, operational rigor and customer success. Pete will expand on our results more later in the presentation.\nOn Slide 5, we highlight key areas where we've been executing our strategy. In the first quarter, we invested $23 million in our value-added facilities to prepare for future demand in key markets. This included opening one new millwork location, expanding another millwork plant and upgrading a truss facility. Adoption rates for our industry-leading BFS digital tools are steadily climbing each week and we are garnering consistent positive feedback from our growing customer base. I'm pleased that we realized $19 million in incremental digital sales for the quarter, bringing our total to $153 million since launch despite the challenging environment that has persisted for our target customers.\nWe achieved $17 million in productivity savings in Q1 and primarily through targeted supply chain initiatives, more efficient truss manufacturing and fleet management. We are focused on optimizing processes, leveraging technology and improving supplier relationships to enhance efficiency. We remain disciplined stewards of discretionary spending, and we are continuing to maximize operational flexibility. We increased our service levels to our customers with an on-time and in-full delivery rate of 92%.\nSingle-family starts remain soft, as builders manage the pace of construction amid affordability challenges, inventory buildup and increased economic uncertainty. As we expected and communicated previously, multifamily also remains a headwind compared to 2024. In response to lower volumes over the last year, we have taken steps to align capacity across our facilities, manage headcount and control expenses. This continues to be an attractive and profitable business for us.\nTurning to single family, builders continue to employ specs, smaller and simpler homes and interest rate buydowns to help buyers find affordable options. Our comprehensive product portfolio enables builders to optimize their costs while maintaining quality. And we continue to supply more lower-cost offerings in products like engineered wood, windows and doors. We are standing alongside our customers to battle affordability challenges and grow with them through the investment in our people, technology and innovation.\nWhile critical for the long-term health of the industry, these actions mean less near-term sales and gross profit dollars for BFS. Ultimately, this positions our company to accelerate when starts increase and current headwinds begin to subside.\nTurning to M&A on Slide 6. We remain focused on pursuing high-return opportunities that expand our value-added product offerings and advance our leadership position in desirable geographies. Over the years, we have developed substantial and proven muscle memory to grow through M&A and have a track record of successful integration. In the first quarter, we completed two acquisitions with aggregate prior year sales of roughly $565 million. As a reminder, in early January, we acquired Alpine Lumber, the largest independently operated supplier of building materials and value-added products in Colorado and northern New Mexico. In February, we acquired O.C. Cluss, a leading supplier of lumber, building materials and installation services with locations in Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia.\nIn addition, we acquired Truckee Tahoe Lumber in early April after quarter end. Truckee Tahoe has built a reputation of excellence as a leading supplier of lumber and building materials in the Northern California and Nevada markets. We are excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family.\nOur industry remains highly fragmented. And despite a slowing M&A environment, we are confident that our M&A capabilities will remain an important catalyst for our long-term growth.\nTurning to Slide 7. Our disciplined capital allocation strategy focuses on maximizing shareholder returns through organic growth, inorganic growth and share repurchases. In the first quarter, we deployed over $900 million towards investing in the business, acquisitions and share repurchases.\nNow let's turn to Slide 8 and discuss the latest updates on our digital strategy. With our BFS digital tools, we are focused on creating value for our homebuilder customers and in doing so, further extending our industry leadership position and driving substantial organic growth. Despite the challenging market, we have seen continued adoption and growth with our target audience of smaller builders. Our sales team continues to increase digital tool usage, which will further drive customer adoption.\nSince launch in early 2024, we have seen more than $1.5 billion of orders placed through our BFS digital tools, of which $153 million were incremental sales from existing and new customers. We're pleased with our progress to date and expect an additional $200 million of incremental sales in 2025, bringing our total to $334 million at the end of the year.\nI'm incredibly grateful to lead such a talented and hard-working team that makes a difference every day. One great example is Delmar Littleview in Oklahoma City, who has been with BFS for more than 20 years. Delmar excels as a trusted partner to our customers who have relied on him both as a driver and now as a dispatcher to ensure that deliveries are accurate and on time. As a dispatcher, he has helped keep his location ranked among the best in the company for dispatch and delivery management efficiency. Beyond his technical skills, Delmar is a mentor to our drivers. The experience in the field allows them to guide them not just on routes and best practices, including safety, but also on ways to provide value to our customers. His leadership and calm demeanor help keep our team running efficiently, even on the most challenging days.\nI'm proud of Delmar and our countless other dedicated team members who continually raise the bar and service to our customers and each other.\nI'll now turn the call over to Pete to discuss our financial results in greater detail.\n\nPete R. Beckmann\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results were driven by our durable business model and unwavering commitment to executing our strategy. We have a proven track record of generating strong free cash flow through the cycle and deploying capital in a disciplined manner, in line with our capital allocation priorities. Our scale, differentiated platform and talented team members give us confidence that we will continue to compound value now and into the future.\nLet's begin by reviewing our first quarter performance on Slides 9 through 11. Net sales decreased 6% to $3.7 billion, driven by lower organic sales, 1 fewer selling day and commodity deflation, partially offset by growth from acquisitions. Although we expect higher commodity prices for the full year, we experienced commodity deflation in Q1 given the prior year spike in OSC prices. The core organic sales decrease was driven by a 33% decline in multifamily with muted activity levels against stronger prior year comps.\nAdditionally, single-family declined 6%, attributable to lower starts activity, value per start and weather, while repair and remodel increased 4%, driven by strength in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions. As we have shared on recent calls, there are a few main variables reconciling single-family starts to work for organic sales. First, the value of the average home has fallen as size and complexity have decreased. Second, we have seen ongoing margin pressure as starts remain below normal. Third, extreme weather in the Southeast and California impacted the quarter by approximately $80 million in long-term deferrals.\nAlthough macro headwinds persist and there are fewer sales dollars available per start today, we are the market leader in building products and continue to be a trusted partner to our customers that start to remain below normal levels.\nFor the first quarter, gross profit was $1.1 billion, a decrease of 14% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 30.5%, down 290 basis points primarily driven by single and multifamily margin normalization as well as a below normal starts environment. Adjusted SG&A of $771 million decreased $9 million, primarily attributable to lower variable compensation due to lower core organic net sales, partially offset by acquired operations. On an annual basis, adjusted SG&A is approximately 30% fixed and 70% variable with volumes, enabling flexibility during challenging periods.\nAs Peter mentioned, we are investing in technology with a look toward the future despite ongoing headwinds. One big component of this is moving to a single, modern, ERP platform. Our ERP investment is projected to incur approximately $140 million this year. This positions us to drive innovation, enhance efficiency and support our long-term growth objectives. We are focused on carefully managing our SG&A and are well positioned to leverage our fixed costs as the market grows.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $369 million, down 32%, primarily driven by lower gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.1%, down 380 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to lower gross profit margins and reduced operating leverage.\nAdjusted EPS was $1.51, a decrease of 43% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases, enabled by our strong free cash flow generation, added roughly $0.11 per share for the first quarter.\nNow let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 12. Our first quarter operating cash flow was $132 million, a decrease of $185 million mainly attributable to lower net income. We generated free cash flow of $45 million. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow yield was 9%. Operating cash flow return on invested capital was 19%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2x. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030.\nAt quarter end, our total liquidity was $1.1 billion. consisting of $944 million in net borrowing availability under the ABL and $115 million in cash.\nMoving to capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $87 million in the first quarter. We deployed $828 million on two acquisitions. In Q1, we repurchased roughly 100,000 shares for $13 million. Additionally, in April, we repurchased 3.3 million shares for $391 million. As we announced this morning, our Board has authorized a $500 million share repurchase program inclusive of the $100 million remaining on the prior $1 billion authorization. This reflects our commitment to returning capital to shareholders while maintaining flexibility for strategic investments. With our current leverage ratio at approximately 2x, we remain mindful of maintaining a leverage ratio of roughly 1 to 2x at year-end.\nWe remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation to maximize returns.\nOn Slide 13, we show our 2025 outlook. For full year 2025, our forecast assumes a down mid-single-digit single-family market and continued weakness in multifamily. As a result, we are guiding net sales in the range of $16.05 billion to $17.05 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $1.7 billion to $2.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be in the range of 10.6% to 12.3%.\nIn a lower starts environment, we expect our 2025 full year gross margin to be in a range of 29% to 31%. We expect free cash flow of $800 million to $1.2 billion. The change from the prior guidance is primarily due to a lower working capital assumption based on our lower sales outlook for the year.\nAs we have stated previously, imports accounted for approximately 15% of our total raw material spend in 2024, comprised of roughly 11% commodities and 4% non-commodities. Given what we know today, we estimate a tariff cost impact of $175 million to $250 million annually. This impact reflects the products we import as well as potential U.S. supplier impacts. This range also assumes USMCA tariff exemptions on Canadian lumber. 2025 guidance assumes average commodity prices in the range of $400 to $440 per thousand board foot, an increase of $15 at the midpoint. Note that this is our best current estimate and subject to change. Our guide does not reflect potential tariff and duty impacts.\nPlease refer to our earnings release and presentation for a list of key 2025 assumptions. Additionally, we want to provide color for Q2 given ongoing macro volatility. We expect Q2 net sales to be between $4.1 billion and $4.4 billion. Q2 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $475 million and $525 million.\nIn closing, I am confident in our ability to drive long-term growth by executing our strategy, leveraging our exceptional platform and maintaining financial flexibility. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Peter for some final thoughts.\n\nPeter M. Jackson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThanks, Pete. Let me close by reiterating that we remain focused on controlling the controllables. Our resilient business model enables us to win in any environment, given our scale, breadth of product offerings and our disciplined investments in technology. I'm confident in the long-term strength of our industry due to the significant housing underbuild across our core markets. We are well positioned to capitalize on this, driving growth for years to come as we execute our strategy.\nWe continue to deepen our value proposition as a key partner to our customers by helping them solve problems through our investments in value-added products, digital tools and install services. Our proven growth playbook, fortress balance sheet and robust free cash flow generation through the cycle will help us continue to compound long-term shareholder value. In the meantime, we are closely monitoring the current environment and remain agile to mitigate downside risks in the near term while also investing strategically for the future.\nThank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions."

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session.\n[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Heather Kos, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders Resource. Please go ahead.\n\nHeather Anne Kos\n\nVP of IR, Univar Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. With me on the call are Peter Jackson, our CEO; and Pete Beckmann, our CFO, the earnings press release and presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to the presentation during our call.\nThe results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures were applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation.\nOur remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.\n\nPeter M. Jackson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Heather and good morning, everyone. Before I get into my prepared remarks, on behalf of Builders FirstSource, I want to send our thoughts to all of those who have been impacted by the California wildfires. I'm proud of how we have come together as a company to support disaster relief efforts. We will work together with our partners to help communities rebuild in the years ahead. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate our resilience and ability to drive results in the face of a complex operating environment while maintaining our focus on building for the future.\nThis begins with our strategic pillars as we show on Slide 3. By continuing to invest in our value-added products and services, along with leveraging cutting-edge technology, we are addressing customer challenges and serving as a supplier of choice. We have a fortress balance sheet and consistently generate strong cash flow over the cycle. Enabling us to remain disciplined and opportunistic as it pertains to capital allocation. Our investments today in organic growth opportunities and value-enhancing acquisitions position us to perform well in any environment.\nLet's turn now to our full year 2024 performance on Slide 4. The strength of our differentiated platform and our operational excellence initiatives drove a mid-teens adjusted EBITDA margin and a nearly 33% gross margin in 2024. Results this year are further proof that our success is driven by the dedication of our hardworking team members and the support of our customers. Turning into Slide 5. I I'd like to share more detail on the execution of our strategy. Our strong organic growth engine is fueled by our investments in value-added solutions and digital tools.\nIn 2024, we invested more than $75 million in our value-added facilities to address demand in our growing markets. This included opening 2 new truss manufacturing facilities, upgrading 19 truss facilities and enhancing 13 millwork locations. Our install sales increased by 8% year-over-year as we leverage our product expertise and help our customers progress along the value-added continuum. While we've always done install in some capacity, we have emphasized it in recent years by utilizing playbooks to expand into new markets and improve execution in existing ones.\nBy growing install in a down market, I'm optimistic about the substantial opportunity for business going forward. In line with this optimism, adoption rates for our industry-leading digital platform are steadily climbing on the heels of consistent positive feedback from our customers. I'm pleased that we were able to achieve $134 million in incremental digital sales in 2024, despite the challenging environment that has persisted for our target customers. Our focus on operational excellence resulted in $117 million in productivity savings in 2024. We accomplished this mainly through supply chain initiatives and more efficient manufacturing. For instance, we were able to improve board foot per labor hour by 10% in truss and panel manufacturing. Not only do our productivity initiatives increase our efficiency, but they also drive additional revenue by enhancing available capacity and shortening lead times. We remain disciplined stewards of discretionary spending and are continuing to maximize operational flexibility.\nWe consolidated roughly 30 facilities in 2024, while maintaining our service levels to our customers with an on-time and in-full delivery rate of over 90%. Single-family starts pulled back as builders manage the pace of building in the face of affordability challenges and uncertainty around potential policy changes. As expected and communicated, Multifamily remains a headwind in muted activity. In response to lower volumes over the last year, we have taken steps to align capacity across our facilities, reduce head count and manage expenses.\nOn a normalized basis, multifamily represents about 9% to 10% of net sales and remains an attractive and profitable business for us. As we have signaled, multifamily will be a headwind again in 2025. To address the current environment and affordability challenges, builders continue to employ specs, smaller and simpler homes and interest rate buydowns to help buyers find affordable options. Builders of all sizes are working to navigate complex market conditions, including regulatory, land development and infrastructure challenges. Smaller builders have been especially impacted by the availability of land and limited options to buy down rates. We are strengthening our partnerships with customers by offering innovative solutions to address affordability challenges.\nOur comprehensive product portfolio allows us to provide flexible options, enabling builders to optimize their costs while maintaining quality. We continue to supply more lower-cost offerings in products like EWP, windows and doors to help alleviate affordability challenges. Although these actions to support our customers mean less sales and gross profit dollars for BFS, our margin profile remains strong, and we are very well positioned for growth when starts increase and structural headwinds begin to subside.\nTurning to M&A on Slide 6. We continue to pursue high-return opportunities that augment our value-added product offerings and advance our leadership position in desirable geographies. Over the years, we have developed substantial improvement muscle memory to grow through M&A and have a proven track record of successful integration. In 2024, we completed 13 acquisitions with aggregate prior year sales of roughly $420 million. In October, we acquired Douglas Lumber, which supplies building materials in New England. In November, we acquired [ Cleat ] Lumber, a leading provider of building materials on Long Island.\nIn addition to the acquisitions we completed in 2024, in early January, we acquired Alpine lumber. The largest independently operated supplier of building materials in Colorado and Northern New Mexico with 21 locations. Alpine's broad product portfolio includes prefabricated trusses, wall panels and mill work. And in February, we acquired [ OCs ] lumber and building supplies, a leading supplier of lumber, building materials and installation services in Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia. These acquisitions reinforce our commitment to invest in our strong value-added business through M&A. We are excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. Turning to Slide 7. Our disciplined capital allocation strategy focuses on maximizing shareholder returns through organic growth, inorganic growth and share repurchases. In 2024, we deployed a total of $2.2 billion. We allocated $367 million to sustaining the business as well as ROI generating growth investments in value-added capacity and digital. We spent $352 million on 13 acquisitions to expand our footprint into high-growth geographies and enhance our value-added offerings. And we executed opportunistic share repurchases of approximately $1.5 billion, removing roughly 7% of shares outstanding.\nNow let's turn to Slide 8 and discuss the latest updates on our digital strategy. With our BFS digital tools, we are focused on creating value for our homebuilder customers and in doing so, further extending our industry leadership position and driving substantial organic growth. Despite the challenging market, we have seen continued adoption and growth with our target audience of smaller production builders in addition to interest from multiple top 200 builders. We continue to release enhancements that are improving the user experience and helping to drive adoption. Since launching about a year ago, we have seen nearly $1 billion of orders placed through our digital platform. Of which $134 million were incremental sales from existing and new customers.\nWe're pleased with our progress to date, and we expect additional incremental sales of approximately $200 million in 2025, as we grow wallet share and win new customers. I'm incredibly grateful to lead such a talented and hard-working team that makes a difference every day. One shining example of our values is Bob Whitney in Isaka, Washington. Who recently celebrated 45 years with BFS. Bob began his journey with us as an administrative assistant, managing invoices on the location's first computer, a massive machine to fill a 20 by 20-foot room. Fast forward to today, Bob, a senior designer is frequently cited by homebuilders and framers in the area is the key reason they choose our engineered wood products. His detailed designs, expertise and innovative approach to finding more efficient ways to accomplish tasks as have set a high standard. I'm proud of Bob and our countless other dedicated team members. We continually raise the bar on service to our customers and each other.\nI'll now turn the call over to Pete to discuss our financial results in greater detail.\n\nPete Beckmann\n\nSenior Vice President of Financial Planning & Analysis\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter and full year results reflect our ability to execute our strategy by leveraging our exceptional operating platform and financial flexibility. Our fortress balance sheet, consistently strong cash flow generation over the cycle, and ability to prudently deploy capital to the highest return opportunities are positioning us for further success. Our scale and investments in innovation enable us to serve as a key partner to homebuilders and we have a clear line of sight to compound value creation over the long term. We believe we are well positioned for meaningful operating leverage into the recovery.\nLet's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter performance on Slides 9 and 10. Net sales decreased 8% to $3.8 billion, driven by lower core organic sales as well as commodity deflation. Partially offset by growth from acquisitions and one additional selling day. The core organic sales decrease was driven by a 29% decline in multifamily amid muted activity levels against strong prior year comps. Additionally, single-family declined 7% amid lower value per start, while repair and remodel was roughly flat versus the prior year. Value-added products represented 50% of our net sales during the fourth quarter and we're roughly balanced between manufactured products and window doors and millwork.\nAs we have shared on recent calls, there are 3 main variables reconciling single-family starts to our core organic sales. The first variable is the lag between permits and starts. Like Q3, this was less of a factor with construction times mostly back to normal for our larger customers. On average, we expect a roughly 2-month lag between the single-family start and our first sale. Second, the value of the average home has fallen as size and complexity have decreased. Finally, we saw a slight normalization in selling margins of non-commodity products and the lapping of manufacturer price reduction.\nTo summarize, although macro headwinds persist and there are less sales dollars available for start today, we remain the market leader in building products and are a trusted partner to our customers as they grapple with affordability challenges. For the fourth quarter, gross profit was $1.2 billion, a decrease of approximately 16% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 32.3%, down 300 basis points, primarily driven by single-family and multifamily margin normalization. As discussed previously, our [ exit ] velocity at the end of 2024 was approximately 31.5%, given normalization and competitive dynamics. Adjusted SG&A decreased approximately $35 million to $764 million, primarily attributable to lower variable compensation due to lower core organic net sales and intangible amortization expense, partially offset by acquired operations.\nOn an annual basis, adjusted SG&A is approximately 30% fixed and 70% variable with volumes. Enabling flexibility during challenging periods. We are focused on carefully managing our SG&A and are well positioned to leverage our fixed costs as the market grows. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $494 million, down 28%, primarily driven by lower gross profit, partially offset by lower operating expenses after adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.9%, down 360 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to lower gross profit margins and reduced operating leverage.\nAdjusted EPS was $2.31, a decrease of 35% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases enabled by our strong free cash flow generation, at roughly $0.15 per share for the fourth quarter. Now let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 11. Our 2024 operating cash flow was $1.9 billion, a decrease of approximately $400 million, mainly attributable to lower net income. For 2024, we delivered higher-than-expected free cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion. Our trailing 12 months free cash flow yield was approximately 9%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 22%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.5x. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At year-end, our total liquidity was approximately $1.8 billion, consisting of $1.6 billion and net borrowing availability under the ABL and approximately $200 million in cash. Moving to capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $96 million in Q4 and $367 million for the year.\nWe deployed approximately $90 million during Q4 on 2 acquisitions and $352 million on 13 acquisitions in 2024. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased roughly 2 million shares for approximately $345 million. For the year, we repurchased 8.9 million shares for $1.5 billion. Since the inception of our buyback program in August 2021, we have repurchased 46.5% of total shares outstanding at an average price of $79.56 per share for $7.6 billion. We have approximately $500 million remaining on our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We remain disciplined stewards of capital, and have multiple paths for value creation to maximize returns.\nOn Slide 12, we show our 2025 outlook. For full year 2025, our forecast assumes a flat single-family market and continued weakness in multifamily. As a result, we are guiding net sales in the range of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be in the range of 11.5% to 13%. In line with our long-term target, we expect our 2025 full year gross margin to be in a range of 30% to 32%. We expect full year 2025 free cash flow of $600 million to $1 billion. The change from 2024 to 2025 is primarily due to a $500 million swing in working capital as we move from shrinking to growing sales as well as higher capital expenditures and interest expense.\nOur cash flow guidance also includes our ongoing ERP investments. As we have said, we will start our ERP pilots later this year and have a plan to complete a phased implementation by 2027. Our 2025 outlook is based on several assumptions, including average commodity prices in the range of $380 to $430 per thousand board foot. This does not assume significant changes to existing duties and tariffs. Imports account for approximately 13% to 15% of our total purchasing spend. Comprised of 8% to 10% commodities and 3% to 5% noncommodities. Please refer to our earnings release and presentation for a list of key 2025 assumptions. As you all know, we do not typically give quarterly guidance. But we wanted to provide color for Q1 given extreme weather and macro volatility. We expect Q1 net sales to be between $3.5 billion and $3.8 billion. Quarter-to-date, we have lost sales of approximately $80 million due to extreme weather in the California wildfire at the start of the year.\nQ1 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $350 million and $400 million. While we expect our sales to rebound quickly as severe weather conditions subside, the areas impacted by the California wildfires will likely take much longer to recover. Turning to Slides 14 and 15. As a reminder, our base business approach normalizes sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps us to clearly assess the core strength of the business, where we have focused our attention on driving sustainable outperformance. Given expected 2025 commodity prices near the historical 25-year average of $400 per 1,000 board foot, the base business guide is approximately the same as our total guidance.\nAs I wrap up, I am confident in our ability to drive long-term growth by executing our strategy leveraging our exceptional platform and maintaining financial flexibility.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Peter for some final thoughts.\n\nPeter M. Jackson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThanks, Pete. Let me close by reiterating that we remain focused on controlling the controllables. Our resilient business model enables us to win in any environment, given our scale, breadth of product offerings and investments in technology. I'm confident in the long-term strength of our industry due to the significant housing underbuild across our core markets. We are well positioned to capitalize on this driving growth for years to come as we execute our strategy. We continue to deepen our value proposition as a key partner to our customers by helping them solve problems through our investment in value-added products, digital tools and install services. Our proven growth playbook, fortress balance sheet and robust free cash flow generation through the cycle will help us continue to compound long-term shareholder [indiscernible]. We are making strategic investments today to enhance efficiency and drive sustainable growth for the future.\nThank you again for joining us today. Operator, please open the call now for questions."

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Heather Kos, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead.\n\nHeather Kos\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications, Ingredion, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Rush, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. The earnings press release and presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to the presentation during our call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. .\nYou can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review these forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid E. Rush\n\nCEO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. As we continue to operate in a complex environment, I am proud of resilient second quarter results, highlighted by our mid-teens EBITDA margin which demonstrates the strength of our differentiated business model and the hard work of our extraordinary team members. While we continue to see the expected affordability challenges and normalization in multifamily, we are executing our strategy by controlling what we can control, investing in value-added solutions and driving adoption of our industry-leading digital platform. .\nOur ability to solve industry pain points with our best-in-class product portfolio and exceptional customer service, makes us a trusted partner as our customers navigate this complex macro landscape. While near-term market dynamics are challenging as starts have lost momentum, we remain focused on executing our strategy in the weeks and months ahead, and we are well positioned for growth as long-term housing tailwinds remain intact. Moving to our strategic pillars on Slide 3.\nWe continue to invest in value-added products, install services and digital solutions [indiscernible] we are providing our customers with a more efficient and cost-effective way to manage home construction. This leads to increased customer stickiness, new business and improved operational efficiency for BFS. We have a robust set of continuous improvement initiatives focused on leveraging our scale while delivering the highest quality products and services to our customers.\nOur highly experienced team members are delivering these critical initiatives while serving our customers with excellence and integrity every day. Finally, we continue to allocate capital in a disciplined manner with a proven M&A strategy and a track record of buying back shares at attractive prices over the long term.\nTurning to our second quarter highlights on Slide 4. While navigating a market challenge by cross currents, we have seen softer-than-expected sales. However, we delivered strong gross margins of nearly 33% in Q2 and our adjusted EBITDA margin has remained in the mid-teens or better for 13 consecutive quarters. Our durable margin profile is a key proof point of our transformed business model and our differentiated product portfolio and scale.\nGiven the strength of our base gross margin, we see opportunities to more aggressively go after profitable share. We have grown our mix of value-added products over the past 5 years, improved our manufacturing processes and efficiency and positioned ourselves at the forefront of homebuilding innovation. Let's move to Slide 5, where we show how we're executing our strategy. Our full suite of value-added products and services remains a competitive advantage for BFS and continues to bolster our partnerships with customers.\nWe're pleased with our progress on digital as we continue to hear great feedback from customers and see increasing levels of adoption each week. We demonstrated operational rigor by delivering $37 million in productivity savings in Q2 and have driven $77 million year-to-date primarily through more efficient manufacturing and procurement initiatives. As I've spoken about in the past, we continue to use playbooks to drive growth in our install services business. I'm pleased that our install sales increased by 15% year-over-year as we focus on helping customers address labor challenges.\nOur managers have best-in-class information to help them navigate this dynamic environment and make effective real-time decisions. We are also maximizing operational flexibility and have consolidated 7 facilities while maintaining our service levels to our customers with on time and in full delivery rate of over 90%.\nWe will remain disciplined managers of discretionary spending no matter the operating [indiscernible]. We are continuing to take actions into the second half of the year to flex the business where appropriate. The single-family growth momentum occurring earlier in 2024 has stalled as interest rate cuts have not materialized and starts have come in lower than expected. In addition, the value of a new start has fallen as the market has adapted to affordability challenges.\nMultifamily continues to be a headwind amid muted activity and relative to our record performance last year, which is creating an increasingly tough comparison. This was expected and detailed on prior [indiscernible] as multifamily continues to normalize, even at today's levels, multifamily continues to be a very profitable business for us. In the current environment, Builders have employed specs, smaller and simpler homes and interest rate buydowns to help buyers find affordable options. Builders of all sizes are having to navigate affordability issues along with regulatory, land development and infrastructure challenges. Smaller builders have been especially impacted by the availability of land and limited options to buy down rates.\nWe are partnering with our customers to help them lower the cost of homes for consumers as well as maintain their margins. This includes balancing our product mix to address their needs while passing through lower material costs. For example, when Engineered Wood Products, or EWP, was constrained we supplied a larger number of higher-value floor trusses as EWP supply normalized and prices came down, we have been able to provide customers with more EWP and have sold fewer floor trusts, helping to specifically address the builder's biggest current challenge, affordability.\nWe have what the builders want and do what's right by them. Although this trend means less sales and gross profit dollars, our margin profile remains strong. We have the operational and financial flexibility needed to partner with our customers to meet their needs and capture growth opportunities. Turning to M&A on Slide 6. We continue to pursue attractive opportunities while remaining financially disciplined. In the second quarter, we completed 3 deals with aggregate 2023 sales of roughly $72 million.\nIn May, we acquired Schoeneman's Building Materials, which we detailed on our Q1 call and TRS components, which establishes trust manufacturing within Metro Detroit. In June, we acquired RPM Wood Products, which enhances our ability to serve high-end custom builders in Northeast Florida. Finally, in July, we acquired Western Trust and Components adding trust capacitive Flagstaff, Arizona area and CRI SoCal, a dealer and installer of high-end windows and doors in Orange County. We are excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family.\nOur disciplined approach to M&A includes increasing our market position in desirable geographies and extending our lead in value-added and specialty solutions and enhancing customer retention. Our M&A pipeline remains healthy. and we believe we can continue to acquire in a fragmented market. On Slide 7, we provide an update on capital allocation. In addition to the 3 tuck-in acquisitions during the second quarter, we repurchased nearly $1 billion of shares.\nI'm happy to announce that our Board has authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase plan as proven by our allocating capital to high-return opportunities. We remain on track to strategically deploy $5.5 billion to $8.5 billion of capital from 2024 to 2026 as outlined at Investor Day last December. Now let's turn to Slides 8 and 9 for an update on our digital strategy. As the only provider of an end-to-end digital platform in our space, we believe BFS digital tools will be transformative for the industry and a substantial driver of organic growth.\nWe have seen strong adoption and growth with our target audience of smaller builders even as they endure a challenging operating backdrop. We've had broad acceptance of the platform so far, including interest from multiple top 200 builders. Since launching in late February, we have seen the value of orders placed through the digital platform go from nearly 0 to over $250 million.\nYear-to-date through Q2, incremental sales have totaled $45 million. While we still have a long way to go, we remain confident in our ability to meet our target of $1 billion in incremental sales by 2026 as we grow wallet share and win new customers. I am thrilled to share a significant achievement that underscores our team members' commitment to making a positive impact in our communities. At our recent annual charity event, we successfully raised over $1 million on behalf of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.\nThis brings total contributions to nearly $12 million since first partnering with LLS in 2006. These funds are crucial to advancing research, patient support and advocacy programs aimed at finding treatments and cures for blood cancers. I want to extend our heart failed gratitude to our industry partners and sponsors whose overwhelming support made a successful event possible.\nI'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our financial results in Greg's detail.\n\nPeter M. Jackson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We were able to effectively navigate a softer-than-expected housing environment during the second quarter by leaning into the pillars of our strategy and operating model, leveraging our fortress balance sheet and exceptional financial flexibility, we executed nearly $1 billion of share repurchases into stock price weakness and made 3 tuck-in acquisitions to enhance and expand our footprint. We believe the sustainable competitive advantages and our extensive geographic coverage, value-added solutions and strong financial position are enabling us to successfully manage market dynamics and deliver long-term value creation.\nI will cover 3 topics with you this morning: first, I'll recap our second quarter results; second, I'll provide an update on our capital deployment; and finally, I'll discuss our revised 2024 guidance and related assumptions. Let's begin by reviewing our second quarter performance on Slides 10 and 11. Net sales were $4.5 billion, a decrease of 1.6% as core organic sales declined 3.8% with the expected multifamily downward trend. The decrease in net sales was partially offset by growth from acquisitions of 1.9% and commodity inflation of 0.3%. The core organic sales decline was driven by a multifamily decline of 31%, partially offset by increases in single family of 1%, amid higher [indiscernible] and repair and remodel of 1.5%.\nI want to take a moment to discuss the variables impacting the disconnect between single-family starts and core organic sales. As a reminder, historically, there's a roughly 2-month lag between a start and [ order ] sale. In the current environment, we are seeing that lag extend as the relative timing of permits, starts and completions has shifted in response to the changing market.\nSecond, we have seen a meaningful decline in the sales opportunity of a start in 2024 as the size, complexity and value of the average home has fallen. These changes are logical given the affordability challenges in the market. but it means that we are seeing less dollars per start despite our strong operating performance. As an example, looking at the Phoenix market, we are supplying material to roughly 45% more homes but our dollar sales are up only about 15%. To summarize, despite a market where starts are smaller, less complex and cheaper, we remain the market leader to continue to deliver superior results. During the second quarter, as we signaled and expected, multifamily declined more than 31% as we lapped the prior year's strong comps.\nR&R and other improved by over 1% given our retail strength in the faster growing West. Value-added products still represented approximately 49% of our net sales during the second quarter despite the headwinds from multifamily. Gross profit was $1.5 billion, a decrease of approximately 8% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 32.8%, decreasing 240 basis points, primarily driven by ongoing normalization, particularly in multifamily.\nSG&A decreased $45 million to $973 million, primarily attributable to lower variable compensation, partially offset by acquired operations. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A decreased 70 basis points to 21.8%. The team has done an excellent job of managing SG&A, and we are well positioned to leverage our fixed costs as the market grows. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $670 million down approximately 13%, primarily driven by lower gross profit, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 15%, down 200 basis points from the prior year. On a sequential basis, adjusted EBITDA margin was up 110 basis points, primarily driven by operating leverage, partially offset by lower gross margin. Adjusted net income of $420 million, was down $78 million from the prior year, primarily due to lower gross profit, partially offset by lower operating expenses.\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.50, a decrease of 10% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases added roughly $0.22 per share for the second quarter. Now let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 12. Our Q2 operating cash flow was approximately $452 million, an increase of $61 million mainly attributable to a decrease in net working capital and more than offsetting almost $100 million decline in adjusted EBITDA. This is a proof point of how our business generates a robust amount of cash in any environment.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter were $85 million and free cash flow was approximately $367 million. For the last 12 months ended June 30, our free cash flow yield was approximately 10%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 24%. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.4x, while base business leverage was 1.7x. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $1.7 billion, consisting of $1.6 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and approximately $100 million in cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment.\nDuring the second quarter, we repurchased roughly 5.8 million shares for approximately $990 million at an average stock price of $17.01 per share. Since the inception of our buyback program in August of 2021, we have repurchased 45% of total shares outstanding at an average price of $76.65 per share for $7.1 billion. As Dave mentioned, the Board approved a new authorization for the repurchase of up to $1 billion of common stock. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation to maximize returns. Now let's turn to our outlook on Slide 13, which we are lowering given a softer-than-anticipated hub market and weaker commodities.\nFor full year 2024, we expect total company net sales to be $16.4 billion to $17.2 billion versus our previous range of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion versus the previous range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be in the range of 13.4% to 14% versus the previous range of 14% to 15%, updating our 2024 full year gross margin guide to the range of 31.5% to 32.5% from 30% to 33%.\nThis also remains in line with our long-term expectation of 30% to 33% at normalized single-family starts of $1 million to $1.1 million. Our long-term margin profile reflects a greater mix of value-added products, recent acquisitions and disciplined pricing management. We expect full year 2024 free cash flow of [ $1 million to $1.2 million ], assuming an average commodity price in the range of $380 to $400 per thousand board foot.\nOur 2024 outlook is based on several assumptions. Please refer to our earnings release and Slide 14 of the investor presentation for a list of these key assumptions. While we do not typically give quarterly guidance, we wanted to provide color for Q3 given ongoing housing uncertainty and multifamily normalization. We expect Q3 net sales to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $575 million and $625 million in Q3. Turning to Slides 15 and 16. As a reminder, our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and resiliency of our company by normalizing sales and margins for commodity volatility.\nThis helps to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance. Our base business guide on net sales for 2024 was approximately $16.8 billion. Our base business adjusted EBITDA guide is approximately $2.3 billion at a margin of 13.7%, which reflects a roughly net 0 impact from commodities.\nFor context, Slide 16 shows that our 2020 base business adjusted EBITDA was roughly $1.1 billion at $991,000 single-family starts, and we are expecting better adjusted EBITDA at lower single-family starts this year. As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that our exceptional positioning and financial flexibility gives us the confidence in our ability to execute our strategy and drive long-term growth. The Investor Day goals we laid out in December remained achievable, assuming a return to normalized single-family starts of $1.1 million in 2026.\nWith that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts.\n\nDavid E. Rush\n\nCEO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. Let me close by reiterating that we continue to execute as evidenced by our strong profit margins and cash flow generation. Our resilient business model allows us to win in any environment. In 2020, we had an 8.7% base business adjusted EBITDA margin at 991,000 single-family starts. This year, we expect a mid-teens adjusted EBITDA margin at a lower level of housing starts. This demonstrates the resiliency of our transformed business and is a strong base to build from as the housing market grows to meet demand.\nI am confident in the long-term strength of the industry due to the significant housing underbilled and favorable demographic trends. We are well positioned to take advantage of those tailwinds, which will help drive growth for years to come as we execute our strategy. We believe we are the unquestioned leader in addressing our customers' pain points through our investments in value-added products, digital tools and install services. Our proven playbook for growth and robust free cash flow generation will help us continue to compound long-term shareholder value. Thank you, again for joining us today.\nOperator, let's please open the call now for questions."

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Heather Kos, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead.\n\nHeather Anne Kos\n\nVP of IR, Univar Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Rush, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. The earnings press release and presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to the presentation during our call. .\nThe results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they could be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation.\nOur remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid E. Rush\n\nCEO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Our resilient first quarter results reflect our differentiated product portfolio and scale. Our team members consistent focus on executing our strategic priorities and our operational efficiency initiatives. As we expected, a weakening multifamily market and higher mortgage rates, driving affordability challenges were headwinds to start the year. Despite these micro challenges, we built on our successes and drove growth through our value-added products portfolio in our industry-leading digital platform. .\nWe are committed to advancing innovation and delivering exceptional customer service as a trusted and preferred partner to our customers. We are focused on executing our clear strategic pillars, as shown on Slide 3. Our investments in value-added products, install services and digital solutions are driving organic growth, delivering greater efficiency and empowering the next generation of homebuilding. For those who are new to the BFS story, value-added products include manufactured components such as trusses, Ready-Frame and wall panels as well as Windows, doors and millwork.\nThrough our value-added products and install services we help meet our customer needs, such as reducing cycle times, addressing labor constraints and improving home construction quality. With our digital tools, we are providing our customers with a more efficient and cost-effective way to manage the construction of their homes that will increase existing customer stickiness, win new business and improve our operational efficiency. We remain committed to innovation and continuously seeking to do things better.\nWe have a robust set of operational and productivity initiatives and are focused on leveraging our scale and fixed cost while delivering the highest quality products and services to our customers. We are deploying capital in a disciplined manner with a proven M&A strategy and a track record of buying back shares at competitive prices. Working alongside the best team in the industry, I am confident that we will continue to compound long-term shareholder value and achieve our strategic priorities.\nLet's turn to our first quarter highlights on Slide 4. We continued to deliver strong margins in Q1, reflecting our end-segment diversification, focused execution and differentiated product portfolio and scale. Our gross margins of more than 33% reflect a higher mix of value-added products, including multifamily trust and our ability to manufacture more efficiently. We expect the multifamily in segment to progressively normalize over the course of this year, and we continue to see some normalization in core margins.\nMoving to Slide 5. We're off to a strong start on our strategic initiatives. Our full digital product launch at the International Builders Show in February was an exciting milestone. At a high level, our digital tools do 3 things: one, solve customer pain points; two, make it even easier to partner with us and our suppliers; and three, help us gain incremental business from new and existing customers. It's a win-win, and we're excited about how everything is going so far after the launch.\nWe're focused on operational excellence and innovation and using playbooks of proven best practices to increase our safety, efficiency and wallet share with customers. One area where we're using playbooks is with our installed services business. Our install sales increased by 17% year-over-year as we leverage our capabilities to help customers address labor constraints. Additionally, we drove $40 million in productivity savings in Q1, primarily through procurement and SG&A initiatives. We believe prudent expense management leads to maximum operational flexibility. This includes optimizing our footprint and balancing cost reductions against future capacity demands.\nWe will remain disciplined managers of just discretionary spending no matter the operating environment. Early momentum in single-family has slowed as persistent inflation has cooled short-term expectations for interest rate reductions. However, low existing home inventories and pent-up demand provide an environment where growth has continued to build. Builders across the board are having to navigate affordability issues and challenges with the regulatory environment, land development and infrastructure.\nIt's evident that the large national builders have done a good job of utilizing specs, reducing home sizing, home sizes and providing interest rate buydowns to assist buyers with affordable options. Smaller builders were more likely to benefit from rate cuts. We are staying in close contact with our customers of all sizes to maximize our business in the current environment. As we have detailed on prior calls, multifamily became a headwind in Q1 as our activity levels and record backlogs have declined versus the prior year.\nIt is important to note, however, that multifamily remains a strong contributor to gross margins and EBITDA even at current levels.\nTurning to M&A on Slide 6. We continue to target attractive opportunities while remaining financially disciplined. In the first quarter, we completed 2 deals with aggregate 2023 sales of roughly $36 million. In early February, we acquired Quality door and millwork, a leading distributor of millwork doors and windows in Southern Idaho.\nIn March, we acquired Hanson Trust, which further strengthens our value-added position in Northern California and Nevada. And last week, we acquired Shutdeman's Building Materials. [indiscernible] manufactures trusses and distributes building materials in the Sufal, South Dakota area. We are excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. M&A and organic investments have increased value-added products as a percent of our overall mix by 700 basis points over the past 2 years and by 1,000 basis points if you go back to 2019.\nOur success with this strategy has been a core component of our improved margin profile through the cycle. We believe there is a long runway of M&A targets in our fragmented market, and we are pleased with recent improvements in the pipeline. Our disciplined approach to M&A includes increasing our market position in desirable geographies, extending our lead in value-added and specialty solutions and enhancing customer retention.\nOn Slide 7, we provide an update on capital allocation. During the first quarter, we completed a $1 billion note offering which brought us additional financial flexibility to grow organically and remain acquisitive while maintaining a strong balance sheet. In addition to the 2 tuck-in acquisitions, we repurchased $20 million of shares as proven by our track record, we'll continue to buy back shares while allocating capital to high-return opportunities. We remain on track to strategically deploy $5.5 billion to $8.5 billion of capital from 2024 to 2026 as outlined at Investor Day last December.\nNow let's turn to Slides 8 and 9 for an update on our digital strategy. As the only provider of an end-to-end digital platform in our space, we believe BFS digital tools will be transformative for the industry and a substantial driver of organic growth. Our easy-to-use portal bldr.com seamlessly delivers our full digital capabilities to our customers. It is designed to create efficiencies for our team members and improved service for our customers by offering increased transparency and engagement in the homebuilding process. Combined with our proprietary estimating and configuration tools, our customers will have more control over the entire building process. This will save time and money for both our customers and their clients while making the homebuilding process more personalized.\nWe were proud to highlight the full digital product capabilities at IBS in February. Our customers told us the new tools address an unmet need, and they were excited to use them in their businesses. Since launch in late February, we have seen orders on the digital platform go from nearly 0 to over $60 million. In Q1, we had incremental sales of over $10 million. We remain confident in our ability to meet our targets of $200 million of incremental digital revenue by the end of this year and $1 billion by 2026, as we grow wallet share and win new customers.\nOne of our digital tools, build Optimized uses advanced 3D modeling to identify construction classes and resolve mechanical design conflicts before breaking ground. It ensures architects, builders and trades are coordinated and building to the same plan. As a proof point of the advantages of using this transformative tool, we've seen interest from 4 large builders. One of these customers has used it in 3 markets and 13 communities across 34 plants. On average, we have identified 150 conflicts per plant, resolving those conflicts before construction leads to job site time and cost savings.\nOne of my favorite initiatives at BFS is acknowledging team members who go above and beyond. [indiscernible] in Atlanta, Georgia personifies this quality. [indiscernible] began with BFS in 1996 as a driver helper and rose through the ranks to operations manager and now oversees our new Atlanta Millwork facility in Decola. Ara has the respect of his team members because he's willing to do whatever it takes to solve problems and add value for our customers. Recently, when there was no available drivers for an urgent customer delivery that had to arrive that day, Ara drove the box truck himself to take care of the customer.\nI'm grateful for Ara drive to lead by example, a quality we find consistently in leaders across BFS. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our financial results in greater detail.\n\nPeter M. Jackson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy and operating model. We are maintaining our fortress balance sheet and prudently deploying capital to the highest return opportunities. We've included acquisitions and share repurchases during the quarter. We are leveraging our sustainable competitive advantages and strong financial position to drive future growth and value creation for our customers and shareholders.\nI will cover 3 topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our first quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on our capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our 2024 guidance and related assumptions.\nLet's begin by reviewing our first quarter performance on Slides 10 and 11. We delivered $3.9 billion in net sales, driven by growth from acquisitions of 1.9% [indiscernible] offset by commodity deflation of 1.7%. Core organic sales in line with the prior year were driven by a single-family increase of more than 4% amid higher sales of early-stage homebuilding products. From a geographic perspective, E sales were down mid-single digits, Central was flat and the West was up mid-teens. As we signaled and expected, multifamily declined more than 13% as we lapped the prior year's strong comps. R&R and other also declined by almost 5% due to weakness predominantly in the Northeast from inclement weather.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, inclement weather negatively impacted our operations in Q1 by roughly 3% to 4% of our overall sales. Value-added products represented approximately 52% of our net sales during the first quarter, reflecting our strength and customer stickiness for these higher-margin products. During the first quarter, gross profit was $1.3 billion, increased approximately 5% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 33.4%, decreasing 190 basis points, mainly due to a timing shift in product mix towards lower-margin, early-stage homebuilding products, as well as margin normalization, particularly in multifamily.\nSG&A increased $22 million to $926 million, primarily attributable to acquired operations. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased 50 basis points to 23.8%. The team has done an excellent job managing SG&A, and we stand ready to leverage our fixed costs into the growing market. Adjusted EBITDA was $541 million, down approximately 14%, primarily driven by lower gross profit and higher operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.9%, down 240 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted net income of $327 million was down $83 million from the prior year due to lower gross profit and higher operating expenses, primarily due to acquisitions.\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share was $2.65, a decrease of 11% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases added roughly $0.29 per share for the first quarter. Now let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 12. Our Q1 operating cash flow was approximately $317 million, down [indiscernible] million compared to the prior year period, mainly attributable to lower net income and an increase in net working capital.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter were $90 million, and free cash flow was approximately $228 million. For the last 12 months ended March 31, our free cash flow yield was approximately 6%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 22%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.1x, while base business leverage was 1.2x. In February, we completed a $1 billion private offer of [indiscernible] senior unsecured notes due 2034, which enables a maximum financial flexibility to grow organically and remain acquisitive.\nExcluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $2.4 billion, consisting of $1.7 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and approximately $700 million of cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment. During the first quarter, we repurchased roughly 100,000 shares for $20 million at an average stock price of $202.67 per share. Since the inception of our buyback program in August of '21, we have repurchased 42.2% of total shares outstanding at an average price of $70.42 per share for $6.1 billion.\nWe have $980 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation to maximize returns.\nNow let's turn to our outlook, which we are reaffirming on Slide 13. For full year 2024, we expect total company net sales to be $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be 14% to 15%, and we are guiding gross margins to a range of 30% to 33%, which is in line with our long-term normalized expectation. Our recent margins reflect above normal multifamily performance on top of our greater mix of value-added products along with the disciplined pricing required to offset increased operating costs.\nWe expect full year 2024 free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. The free cash flow forecast assumes average commodity prices in the range of $400 to $440 per thousand [indiscernible]. Our 2024 outlook is based on several assumptions and includes an expectation for improving single-family growth. Please refer to our earnings release in Slide 14 of the investor presentation for a list of these key assumptions.\nAs you all know, we do not typically give quarterly guidance, but we wanted to provide directional color for Q2 given the ongoing interest rate uncertainty and the geopolitical situation. On a year-over-year basis, we expect Q2 net sales to be down low single digits to flat as single-family growth is offset by expected multifamily headwinds. Year-over-year adjusted EBITDA is expected to be down high teens in Q2, primarily given the impact of continued multifamily normalization.\nTurning to Slides 15 and 16. As a reminder, our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance. Our base business guide on net sales for 2024 is approximately $17.6 billion. Our base business adjusted EBITDA guide is approximately $2.4 billion at a margin of 13.5%.\nAs I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are confident in the near-term outlook, our exceptional positioning to execute our strategic goals and our ability to create shareholder value in any environment. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts.\n\nDavid E. Rush\n\nCEO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. Let me close by summarizing how we're set up to drive long-term profitable growth by executing our strategic pillars. We believe we are the unquestioned leader in addressing our customers' pain points through our focus on customer service, value-added products and install services. Our industry-leading digital innovations are bringing greater efficiency to homebuilding and will win us new customers and grow wallet share along the way.\nOur robust free cash flow generation is funding disciplined capital deployment that will maximize returns and compound long-term shareholder value. We have a proven playbook for growth during complex operating environments, and we'll keep working to be the best and deliver excellence every day. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, please open the call now for questions."

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Heather Kos, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead.\n\nHeather Kos\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications, Ingredion, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Rush, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. The earnings press release and investor presentation are available on our website at investor.builders.com. We will refer to the investor presentation during our call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation.\nOur remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of our future results. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements and projections.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid E. Rush\n\nCEO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. I'm proud of our full year results, which demonstrate the strength of our broad product portfolio and continued execution by our team members. Despite a challenging operating environment in 2023, which saw significant reduction in single-family starts, we delivered resilient results. As promised, we delivered a double-digit EBITDA margin in the high teens, along with robust free cash flow. We accomplished this through operational rigor and by closely partnering with our customers to help address their pain points through the use of our value-added solutions. Our results in 2023 further validate our strategy to be the easiest to do business with across the industry. I also want to thank everyone who participated both in person and virtually at our Investor Day in December, where we laid out the next leg of our growth journey. We're grateful for your ongoing support.\nAs we begin 2024, we are excited about the opportunities in front of us. We remain focused on profitable growth by leading with our value-added solutions, deploying our digital platform and expanding in desirable markets through our proven M&A strategy. These initiatives, along with our commitment to efficient operations and disciplined capital deployment will continue to compound long-term shareholder value. Our investments in value-added and digital solutions are driving clear market differentiation, delivering greater efficiency and empowering the next generation of homebuilding. By leveraging our scale in value-added products, we are able to help meet our customers' needs, such as reducing cycle times, addressing labor constraints and improving home construction quality.\nAs a proof point of our execution, I'm pleased that our service levels were on time and in full have continued to improve year-over-year. Our on-time delivery was 90% in 2023, while our in full performance was 96%, with our investments in technology and automation will keep working to drive these metrics higher. We remain committed to operational excellence and innovation to increase efficiency and create value. We have a robust set of operational and productivity initiatives and are focused on leveraging our scale and fixed costs while delivering the highest quality products to our customers.\nOur continuous improvement mindset employs technology, including our digital solutions, and automation to improve the construction process and drive greater discipline in our operations. As an important pillar of our strategy, we are focused on maintaining a fortress balance sheet. Our strong free cash flow provides financial flexibility and multiple high-returning paths for capital deployment, enabling our clear set of priorities. We continued our robust buyback program in 2023, repurchasing nearly $1.8 billion of shares.\nI'm happy to announce that yesterday, our Board increased our share repurchase authorization to a total of $1 billion. We remain disciplined in our approach to tuck-in acquisitions and still have a long runway of targets in a fragmented market. Our focus areas for M&A include increasing our market position in desirable geographies extending our lead in value-added and specialty solutions and enhancing customer stickiness.\nLet's turn to our full year highlights on Slide 4. We delivered strong margins in 2023, including a robust 17% adjusted EBITDA margin that underscores our differentiated product portfolio and scale. Our resilient gross margin of more than 35% reflects stronger mix and value-added products, notably in our multifamily business and improved manufacturing efficiencies. As we have communicated, we continue to see some normalization in core margins. We are also seeing multifamily normalize and expect it to continue over the course of this year.\nLooking at Slide 5, I want to highlight the over 30% improvement in our recordable incident rate in 2023, which is a remarkable achievement. At BFS, the safety of our team members is always our highest priority, and I am proud of the culture we have created to be a safer company every day. I'm also excited to see the structural improvements we are making to remove excess cost and operate more efficiently. Our strong productivity savings of $175 million for 2023, reflect the hard work we are doing on targeted initiatives, and we expect another $100 million of productivity savings in 2024. Prudent SG&A expense management also remains a key focus area. This includes the ongoing optimization of our footprint and balancing the need for cost reductions against future capacity demands. We remain disciplined stewards of discretionary spending, and our team has responsibly manage costs in the short term while executing our strategy for the long term.\nAs expected, we had a strong year in multifamily as prior year acquisitions were supercharged by a strong market. Multifamily remained a tailwind in Q4 as we worked through record backlog. For single family, lower mortgage rates and low existing home inventories have helped us steady activity levels. National Builder customers have done a good job of utilizing specs in conjunction with interest rate buydowns to provide homebuyers with affordable options to purchase new homes. Our focus this year is on being the best partner to our customers by providing the highest quality customer service, driving our robust value-added solutions and launching our BFS digital tools to make the building process faster, more efficient and more affordable.\nTurning to M&A on Slide 6. We continue to target attractive opportunities while remaining financially disciplined. In 2023, we completed 7 deals with aggregate 2022 sales of roughly $540 million. Early in the fourth quarter, we acquired Standale Lumber, which gives us a strong presence in the growing Grand Rapids, Michigan market. Then in December, we acquired Encore building products a leading building materials distributor that represents our entry into the Arkansas market and will serve as our platform for future growth in the state.\nAnd in early February, we acquired Quality Door and Millwork, a leading distributor of millwork, doors and windows in Southern Idaho. We are excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. We also show how our M&A and organic investments increased value-added products as a percent of our overall mix by 700 basis points over the past 2 years. Our success with this strategy has been a core component of our improved margin profile through the site.\nOn Slide 7, we provide an update on capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we made 2 tuck-in acquisitions and repurchased over $200 million of shares while maintaining the strong balance sheet. And for all of 2023, we prudently deployed approximately $2.5 billion, in line with our stated priorities. We have cumulatively deployed approximately $6.1 billion from 2022 through 2023, and we communicated a new goal at our Investor Day this past December to deploy $5.5 billion to $8.5 billion of capital from 2024 to 2026.\nNow let's turn to Slides 8 and 9 for an update on our digital strategy. We are establishing a differentiated position as the only provider of an end-to-end digital platform in our space, combined with our leading operating model and strong relationships. We believe BFS digital tools will be a substantial driver of growth for us and transformative for the industry.\nOur easy-to-use myBLDR.com portal will seamlessly deliver our full digital capabilities to our customers. It is designed to create efficiencies for our team members and improve service for our customers by offering increased transparency and engagement in the homebuilding process. Combined with our proprietary estimating and configuration tools, our customers will have more control over the entire building process. This will save both time and money for both our customers and their clients while making the homebuilding process more personalized.\nWe are excited to showcase the full digital product capabilities at the International Builders Show next week. To drive the adoption of these innovative solutions, we have focused on training our sales and operations teams to help our customers leverage these powerful new tools. We are confident in our ability to deliver value from our digital solutions and meet our target of $200 million of incremental digital revenue by the end of this year and $1 billion by 2026 as we grow wallet share and then new customers.\nThroughout the year, we acknowledge team members that go above and beyond. Rich Rapuzi, market manager in our Alaska market embodies these values like no other. I had the pleasure of spending time with Rich recently and witnessed the positive impact he has made on his team during his remarkable 50-year career at BFS and Legacy companies. Rich's journey started as a customer service rep in 1974 and is rooted in hands-on experience and continuous learning. Through his career, Rich established vital departments and assumed multiple leadership roles. What truly sets Rich apart is his passion for his community and mentoring others. His colleagues will tell you that he deeply cares about helping people reach their potential. As Rich prepares for retirement later this year, his impact will endure through the lives he has touched. While he'll be greatly missed, his legacy will resonate within our organization for years to come.\nI'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our financial results in greater detail.\n\nPeter M. Jackson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our results throughout the year demonstrate the effectiveness of our operating model regardless of the macro environment. Our fortress balance sheet, strong cash flow generation and ability to prudently deploy capital to the highest return opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases, continues to deliver value and positions us for long-term success. We are leveraging our sustainable competitive advantages and strong financial position to drive future growth and create value for our shareholders. I will cover 3 topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our fourth quarter and full year results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our full year 2024 guidance and related assumptions. Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter performance on Slides 10 and 11. We delivered $4.2 billion in net sales, driven by a 1% decline in core organic sales and commodity deflation of 5%, partially offset by growth from acquisitions of roughly 2%. The core organic sales were driven by a single-family decline of 4% amid a weak housing market and share in supply chain normalization.\nThat said, there are signs that the single-family market is starting to pick up. Our early cycle products are beginning to show growth, including high single digits growth in lumber and mid-single digits growth in truss. Multifamily grew by more than 4% driven by our prior year acquisitions as well as favorable margins. R&R and other also grew by over 4% due to increased sales focus and capacity versus 2022.\nImportantly, value-added products represented 52% of our net sales during the fourth quarter, reflecting our position as the supplier of choice for these higher-margin products. During the fourth quarter, gross profit was $1.5 billion, a decrease of approximately 1% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 35.3%, increasing 120 basis points mainly due to productivity and a tailwind from multifamily, partially offset by core organic margin normalization.\nSG&A increased by $60 million to $974 million, mainly due to higher variable compensation, acquired operations and inflation, partially offset by lower customer reserve expenses. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased 150 basis points to 23.5%, primarily attributable to decreased fixed cost leverage from lower sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $686 million, down approximately 2%, primarily driven by lower net sales due to a weak housing market and commodity deflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.5%, up 50 basis points from the prior year as we continue to execute and drive improved productivity across the business. Adjusted net income of $439 million was down $32 million from the prior year due to lower net sales. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.55, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases added roughly $0.55 per share for the fourth quarter.\nNow let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 12. Our 2023 operating cash flow was approximately $2.3 billion, down $1.3 billion compared to the prior year period, mainly attributable to commodity deflation and a shrinking housing market. Capital expenditures for the year were $430 million, all in, we delivered healthy free cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion. For the year, our free cash flow yield was approximately 13% while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 28%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.1x, while base business leverage was 1.4x. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $1.3 billion consisting of $1.27 billion and net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and $70 million of cash on hand.\nMoving to capital deployment. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares for $209 million at an average stock price of $131.74 per share. For the full year of 2023, we repurchased nearly $1.8 billion of shares at an average price of $100.49 per share. As Dave mentioned, the Board approved the repurchase of up to $1 billion of common stock, inclusive of the approximately $200 million remaining on the prior share repurchase plan authorized in April of 2023. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation to approve an ability to deploy capital and deliver high returns.\nNow let's turn to our outlook on Slide 13. For full year 2024, we expect total company net sales to be $17.5 million to $18.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be 14% to 15%, and we are guiding gross margins to a range of 30% to 33%. Our recent above normal margins reflect a greater mix of value-added products, along with the disciplined pricing required to offset increased operating costs. As we move through the year, we expect both our gross margins and the multifamily business to continue to normalize. We expect full year 2024 free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. The change from 2023 is primarily due to an expected $500 million year-over-year decrease due to working capital as we move from shrinking to growing sales.\nThe free cash flow forecast assumes average commodity prices in the range of $400 to $440 per 1,000 [indiscernible] our 2024 outlook is based on several assumptions. Please refer to our earnings release and Slide 14 of the investor presentation for a list of these key assumptions. As you all know, we do not typically give quarterly guidance, but we wanted to provide directional color for Q1. On a year-over-year basis, we expect Q1 net sales to be flat to down low single digits as we have lost roughly 2 days of sales due to inclement weather conditions at the start of the year. Year-over-year adjusted EBITDA is expected to be down high teens to low 20s in Q1 given the impact of extreme weather and continued margin and share normalization. We expect our sales to rebound as the severe weather conditions subside. Regardless, we remain optimistic for a healthy housing market in 2024.\nTurning to Slides 15 and 16. As a reminder, our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance. Our base business guide on net sales for 2024 is approximately $17.6 billion. Our base business adjusted EBITDA guide is approximately $2.4 billion at a margin of 13.5%.\nAs I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are confident in the near-term outlook, our exceptional positioning to execute our strategic goals and our ability to create shareholder value in any environment to support profitable growth.\nWith that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts.\n\nDavid E. Rush\n\nCEO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. Let me close by saying that we are focused on executing our strategic pillars. This focus, along with our close partnership with our customers to address their pain points is a competitive differentiator in our industry. We are the unquestioned leader in value-added solutions, which we believe are the most effective way to address labor and cycle time challenges. Our industry-leading digital innovations are bringing greater efficiency to homebuilding and will win us new customers and grow wallet share along the way. Our robust free cash flow generation is funding a disciplined capital deployment strategy that will compound long-term shareholder value. While 2023 was an exciting year, we are just getting started. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions."

Rush\n\nCEO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Before we begin, I want to formally welcome Heather to the Builders FirstSource team. We are excited to have someone with her deep knowledge and decades of experience leading investor relations, which is a critical function here. Heather, welcome.\nNow on to our Q3 performance. Despite industry volatility caused by macroeconomic headwinds, our resilient third quarter results reflect the strength of our value-added portfolio, broad footprint and operational initiatives we have put in place over the past several years. While challenges remain due to inflation and increasing mortgage rates, we continue to generate healthy margins. This is proof of our attractive product mix and the benefits of our investments in multifamily. We remain confident in our 2023 outlook as we focus on being the best partner for our customers and executing our strategy to drive long-term growth.\nWe continue to create robust free cash flow and invest in the business to operate more efficiently, increase customer loyalty and expand our footprint. We are committed to operational excellence, including efficiencies in our supply chain as well as investing in automation and process improvements. These efforts are driving productivity savings and helping address our customers' labor challenges now and into the future.\nWe are helping our customers reduce cycle times, which is highlighted by improving our infill deliveries from 94% last year to 96% during the third quarter. On time and infill deliveries ensure our customers have the right material at the right time, building their loyalty and trust in us.\nWe are [indiscernible] our investments in value-added solutions organically and through M&A to help our custom build more efficiently. These accretive acquisitions have enhanced our value-added product coverage and will help us achieve a leading position in desirable market as we grow share in these higher-margin products we are driving mix improvement across the business.\nOur strong free cash flow provides multiple paths for capital deployment, all towards creating shareholder value. Given the long runway of potential tuck-ins, we will remain acquisitive to bolster our growth potential while maintaining a disciplined focus on the highest return opportunities.\nLooking at our third quarter highlights on Slide 4. Gross margin was approximately 35% and only down slightly on a sequential basis. Despite normalization in core margins, our overall margins have remained resilient, primarily due to stronger mix and value-added products, including our multifamily business and improved mainstream efficiencies.\nOur adjusted EBITDA margin also remains strong, highlighting our ability to manage our operations effectively in a challenging and dynamic environment. This execution is a reflection of our talented and focused field leadership team.\nTurning to Slide 5. We generated strong productivity savings of $54 million during the quarter. This reflects the effectiveness of our BFS One Team operating system, which delivers value across the business by building people, excellence and growth.\nOur recent acquisitions in multifamily contributed an increase of 2% in sales and 4% in EBITDA compared to the prior year quarter. Multifamily remained a tailwind this quarter. In fact, the strength to continue for the remainder of 2023 before declining around the second quarter of next year.\nDisciplined SG&A expense management remains a key focus area. This includes the ongoing optimization of our footprint and balancing the need for cost reductions against future capacity needs.\nWe are focused on our discretionary spending, and our team has responsibly managed costs in the short term while executing our strategy for the long term.\nRegarding our industry, the national builders have reported resilient results by providing incentives such as interest rate buydowns to ease affordability challenges and attract prospective buyers.\nThe limited inventory of existing homes for sale is also steering traffic to new construction. As we look forward to 2024, we will maintain our best-in-class customer service, continue our emphasis on expanding our value-added product mix and launch our BFS digital tool to make building process faster, more efficient and more affordable.\nTurning to M&A on Slide 6. We continue to target attractive opportunities while remaining financially disciplined. Through the third quarter, we have completed 5 deals with aggregate prior year sales of roughly $350 million.\nIn September, we acquired Frank's Cash & Carry, a leading building material distributor with trust manufacturing in the Florida Panhandle. We are pleased that this acquisition will help us grow with builders in the area. And earlier in the third quarter, we acquired Church's Lumber which expanded our presence in the Detroit market. We're excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family.\nAs shown on Slide 6, our M&A and organic investments have substantially increased our value-added product mix and diversified our end markets. We have seen the fruit of this growth in recent quarters through higher gross margins even in a down housing market.\nMoving to Slide 7. I would like to provide an update on capital allocation. During the third quarter, we prudently deployed capital in line with our stated priorities. We made 2 tuck-in acquisitions and repurchased over $200 million of shares while maintaining strong balance sheet, cumulatively deployed approximately $5.7 billion since the end of 2021 and remain on track to achieve our 2025 goal employing $7 billion to $10 billion of capital as communicated at our Investor Day in December of 2021.\nNow let's turn to Slide 8 and 9 for an update on our digital strategy. We are steadfast in our commitment to leading the digital evolution in our industry and generating new innovations to drive greater efficiency across homebuilding and enhance our product and service offerings.\nAs we look forward to our full product launch in Q1, we have made it a priority to drive digital adoption across our operations.

Taking with our proprietary meeting and configuration tools, this gives our customers more control over the entire building process, saving both time and money for our customers and their clients while making the homebuilding process more personalized.\nIn the third quarter, we continued our product development and adoption efforts as we prepare for the upcoming full product launch. These are important milestones in our journey to reshape industry and extend our lead as the partner of choice in the market and attain our goal of $1 billion in incremental sales by 2026 million. We look forward to sharing more information with you at our Investor Day next month.\nAt BFS, we pride ourselves on helping our people achieve their career goals. A team member who has taken full advantage of every growth opportunity presented to her is Susan Dean, the General Manager of our Florence, South Carolina location. Through the various roles she's held over her more than 40 years with BFS, she's earned the nickname, Sue Dini, for her ability to solve problems and make magic happen. Since being promoted as general manager, Sue has led her location to achieve exceptional results by recognizing her team members' potential and empowering them. In stories like Sue's that made me excited to see all the different ways, our team members can grow here at BFS.\nI'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail.\n\nPeter M. Jackson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate the effectiveness of our operating model in the face of macro volatility. We are maintaining a healthy balance sheet and prudently deploying capital to the highest return opportunities, which included share repurchases during the quarter. We are leveraging our sustainable competitive advantages and strong financial position to drive future growth and value creation for our shareholders.\nI will cover 3 topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our third quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our full year '23 guidance and 2024 scenarios.\nLet's begin by reviewing our third quarter performance on Slide 10, 11. We delivered $4.5 billion in net sales or organic sales decreased by 14%, driven by a 19% decline in single family due to slower demand over the prior year, supply chain normalization and commodity deployment of approximately 9%.\nMultifamily grew by over 6% and driven by our recent acquisitions as well as favorable margins, largely attributable to the longer lead time for this end market.\nR&R and other grew by over 1% amid increased sales focus and capacity versus the prior year.\nThe cumulative effect of our acquisitions over the past year contributed approximately 3 percentage points of growth to net sales. Importantly, value-added products represented 51% of our net sales this quarter, increasing 6 percentage points since Investor Day in Q4 2021. This reflects our position as the supplier of choice for these higher-margin products.\nDuring the third quarter, gross profit was $1.6 billion, a decrease of approximately 22% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 34.9%, decreasing 10 basis points due to normalization in core organic gross margins, offset by roughly 125 basis points of our previously discussed multifamily overearning.\nSG&A decreased $61 million to $940 million, mainly due to lower variable compensation, partially offset by additional expenses from operations acquired in the last year of inflation. Acquisitions increased SG&A by $34 million in the quarter.\nAs a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 330 basis points to 20.7%, primarily attributable to decreased fixed cost leverage from lower sales. We remain focused on operating efficiently, containing costs and effectively integrating acquisitions.\nAdjusted EBITDA was approximately $813 million, down 31%, primarily driven by lower net sales due to a weaker housing market and commodity deflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin remained a robust 17.9%, up 90 basis points sequentially as we continue to execute and drive improved productivity across the business.\nAdjusted net income of $534 million was down $280 million from the prior year quarter. The 34% decrease was largely due to lower net sales.\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share was $4.24, down 19% compared to $5.20 in the prior year period. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases added roughly $0.83 per share.\nNow let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 12. Third quarter operating cash flow was approximately $665 million, down $835 compared to the prior year period, mainly attributable to commodity deflation and a weaker housing market.\nCapital expenditures were $128 million. All in, we delivered healthy free cash flow of approximately $538 million. For the trailing 12 months ended September 30, our free cash flow yield was 14.1%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 32%.\nOur net debt to adjusted EBIT ratio was approximately 1.1x while base business leverage was 1.5x.\nExcluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $1.1 billion, consisting of $1 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and $100 million of cash on hand.\nMoving to capital deployment. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares for $224 million at an average stock price of $136.22 per share. Year-to-date, we have repurchased nearly $1.6 billion of shares at an average price of $97.43 per share. We have approximately $400 million remaining on our most recent $1 billion share repurchase program approved in April of 2023.\nWe remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation through a proven ability to deploy capital and deliver high returns.\nNow let's turn to our outlook on Slide 13. Given that affordability headwinds, our Q3 sales were a little softer than it did. However, the October sales trend was seasonally healthy. And our focus -- our continued focus and execution gives us confidence that we will achieve our full year base business and total company EBITDA guidance for 2023 that we outlined in our second quarter earnings call.\nFor full year 2023, we expect total company net sales to be $16.8 billion to $17.1 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be 15.8% to 16.7% and the gross margins to a range of 34% to 35%.\nOur recent above normal margins reflect a greater mix of value-added products, along with disciplined pricing required to offset increased operating costs. As we move through the end of the year, we expect both our gross margins and the multifamily business to continue to normalize.\nWe expect full year 2023 free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. The free cash flow forecast assumes average commodity prices in the range of $400 to $425.\nOur 2023 outlook is based on several assumptions. Please refer to our earnings release and Slide 14 of the Investor Presentation for a full list of these assumptions.\nTurning to Slides 15 and 16. As a reminder, our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance.\nOur base business guide on net sales is $16.4 billion. Our base business EBITDA guide is $2.2 billion at a margin of 13.5%.\nMoving to Slide 17. We recognize that 2024 is coming into focus as we approach year-end. Like we did earlier this year, we have laid out a scenario analysis to demonstrate how we are positioned to generate resilient fund performance across a range of potential housing market and commodity conditions to emphasize that this is not full year guidance for 2024. But these scenarios should help clarify our range of performance expectations for 2024 and demonstrate the strength of our best-in-class operating platform.\nAs a wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are confident in the near-term outlook, our exceptional positioning to execute our strategic goals and our ability to create value in any environment to support profitable growth.\nWith that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts.\n\nDavid E. Rush\n\nCEO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. Let me close by saying that we're executing on our strategic pillars to deliver long-term value creation. Our tireless team effort has resulted in a differentiated platform, setting us up for above-market growth and exceptional profitability for years to come. I continue to be proud of our operational excellence, which is driving increased safety, productivity and profitability despite market headwinds. We are in a great position today. And as end markets further stabilize, we are positioned for an even stronger future.\nWe'll remain at the forefront of technology with our BFS digital tools as I'm confident will be a game changer for the industry. We are exceptionally well positioned in the marketplace to navigate complex operating environments due to our value-added solutions, fortress balance sheet and strong free cash flow generation.\nWe're excited to share more details about our long-term vision at our upcoming Investor Day on December 5 in Atlanta and look forward to seeing you there. Thank you again for joining us today.\nOperator, please open the call now for questions."

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMichael D. Neese\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Performance Food Group Co.\n\nThank you, Angela. Good morning, and welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Call. With me on the call are Dave Rush, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will review our results for the second quarter of 2023. The earnings press release and investor presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com.\nWe will refer to several slides from the investor presentation during our call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures were applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentations.\nOur remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid E. Rush\n\nCEO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Entering 2023, we prepared for a challenging and dynamic year. During the first half, we had better-than-anticipated performance driven by the strength of our value-added product portfolio, continued outperformance in Multi-Family and a more stable housing environment than originally projected.\nMulti-Family is an area we identified as providing strong growth potential and end market diversification over the long term. We are truly seeing the differentiated platform we have put together over the past few years generate results. We continue to exceed our near-term targets through contributions from operational initiatives in still over the last few years and by executing our strategic priorities which is a testament to the unwavering commitment and dedication of our amazing team members. We are focused on delivering exceptional customer service and always strive to be the easiest company in the industry to do business with. We are driving mix improvement through value-added share growth while continuing to expand through tuck-in acquisitions.\nOur acquisitions in recent years have allowed us to enhance our value-added offerings and also extend our reach to a more diverse customer base in attractive markets. Moreover, these acquisitions have proven to be immediately accretive to our earnings. We continue to consistently generate robust free cash flow and prudently deploy capital. making 2 tuck-in acquisitions and repurchasing over $700 million of shares in the second quarter alone. Despite the headwinds posed by elevated mortgage rates and affordability challenges, our resilient results in the first half of 2023 give us confidence that we have the right strategies in place with a customer-centric approach and an incredible team that is executing at the highest level to successfully navigate this dynamic economic environment.\nMany Single-Family builders are showing stabilizing demand partially due to widespread shortages of existing homes for sale, driving healthy new construction. Public builders have been reporting a stream of stronger-than-expected results and taking proactive steps such as interest rate buydowns to help get prospective buyers off the sidelines. With home prices normalizing in many places, our focus on value-added solutions, digital innovations and customer service is helping builders improve their construction efficiencies. We are helping our customers lower cycle time which is highlighted by our continued improvement in -- on in-full deliveries from 93% last year to 96% during the second quarter. On time and in-full deliveries ensure our customers have the right material at the right time.\nLooking at our second quarter highlights on Slide 4. Our gross margin percentage increased 40 basis points to 35.2% due to stronger mix and value-added products overall, largely driven by our Multi-Family segment and the related positive impact from commodity cost timing. We maintained a healthy double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin, showcasing our ability to execute effectively from an operations perspective in a challenging environment. This execution is a reflection of our talented field leadership team, which averages 30-plus years of industry experience.\nTurning to Slide 5. We drove strong productivity across the business by delivering $50 million in savings during the quarter. Our BFS 1-TEAM Operating System continues to generate robust efficiencies focused on manufacturing and delivery improvements. Our recent acquisitions in Multi-Family contributed an increase of 4% on the top line and 9% to EBITDA compared to the prior year quarter. Multi-Family was an exceptionally strong tailwind this quarter, and we expect this streak to continue for the remainder of 2023. While we expect Multi-Family to normalize around the first or second quarter of next year, we remain optimistic that Single-family [indiscernible] will be on stronger footing in the same period compared to the first half of 2023.\nAs it relates to our cost structure, controlling SG&A and other expenses remains a vital focus for us. This includes the ongoing optimization of our footprint and balancing the need for variable cost reductions against future capacity needs. We are focused on our discretionary spending and our team has done a great job on managing costs in the short term while executing our strategy over the long-term.\nTurning to M&A on Slide 6. We continue to target attractive opportunities with a disciplined approach. Thus far in 2023, we have completed 4 deals and are still committed to our goal of investing an average of $500 million in M&A per year for the next several years. During the second quarter, we added millwork capabilities through the acquisitions of JB Millworks and Builders Millwork supply. And earlier this week, we acquired [indiscernible] Lumber, which expands our presence and scale in the Detroit market. We're excited to welcome our talented new team members to the BFS family.\nOur M&A and organic investments have substantially increased our value-added product mix and diversified our end markets since Q4 2021, as shown on Slide 6. We have seen the fruit of this growth in recent quarters, and we have driven our gross margins higher even in a down housing starts environment.\nMoving to Slide 7. I would like to provide an update on capital allocation. In the second quarter, we deployed over $850 million of capital towards organic growth investments, tuck-in M&A and share repurchases. We have cumulatively deployed approximately $5.3 billion since the end of 2021 and remain on track to achieve our 2025 goal of $7 billion to $10 billion communicated at our Investor Day in 2021.\nNow let's turn to Slide 8, for an update on our digital strategy. We firmly believe our long-term commitment to new digital innovations and technologies will deliver greater efficiency across homebuilding and enhance our product and service offerings. We continue to play a pioneering role in the digital transformation of the homebuilding industry and have made a significant investment in growing our digital platform. We have made it a priority to ensure digital adoption is integrated across our operations as we seek to create a platform that will lead to building better, more affordable homes.\nmyBLDR.com serves as the entry point to our collaborative project management platform. It is designed to create efficiency for both BFS and our customers by offering improved transparency and engagement in the homebuilding process. It combines Paradigm's next-generation estimating technology with our 3D home configuration model. Together, these tools allow our customers more control over their design, cost estimating and building process ultimately say we both -- our customers and their clients, time and money.\nWe are still in early innings and have more to come as we continue to roll out these digital solutions to our end users but we remain confident in our ability to gain an incremental $1 billion in product sales by 2026. We believe our sustained commitment to investing in digital innovations and technologies will extend BFS' lead as the partner of choice in the market, and we look forward to providing more detail on our long-term strategy at our Investor Day in December.\nBefore I turn the call over to Peter, I want to say how grateful I am to our team members for continuing to execute in a challenging environment and providing excellent service to our customers on a daily basis. At BFS, we keep our high-performing, people-first culture at the heart of all we do. That's why we like to recognize team members in our organization that embody the true spirit of our, Be More, Do More, Build More to gather philosophy. [ Pearl Hover ] is an inventory control supervisor in Houston, Texas, who has made a huge impression on her managers and colleagues. In May, she was honored as 1 of our first team MVPs for exemplifying our core values. [ Pearl's ] attitude -- positive attitude for willingness to jump in and help in her pursuit of excellence really makes a difference on the team. The supervisors appreciate how she embraces learning new skills and mentoring others, especially young women new to our industry. employees like Pearl make me proud to lead this great organization. Without the full effort of our team, we would not have had the outperformance that we achieved during the first half of this year.\nI'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail.\n\nPeter M. Jackson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our performance during the quarter further highlighted the resilience of our business in the face of macro pressures. I'm particularly proud of our gross margin results driven by our increased mix of value-added products and services. We are well positioned in the marketplace with differentiated solutions and a healthy balance sheet. We continue to generate robust free cash flow and prudently deploy capital. I'm confident that the combination of our industry-leading scale, ongoing investments in value-added and digital products, and strong financial position will lead to a double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin this year, and sustained growth in the years to come.\nI will cover 3 topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our second quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our full year 2023 guidance. Let's begin by reviewing our second quarter performance on Slide 10. We delivered $4.5 billion in net sales. Core organic sales decreased by 22%, which was better than expected despite a 31% decline in Single-Family due to slower demand over the prior year. Multi-Family continues to be a bright spot growing by nearly 30%.\nAs Dave mentioned, the strength in Multi-Family was driven by our recent acquisitions as well as favorable margins, largely attributable to the longer lead time for this end market. R&R and other grew by nearly 5%, mainly due to increased sales focus and capacity versus the prior year. The cumulative effect of our acquisitions over the past year contributed approximately 4 percentage points of growth to net sales. Importantly, value-added products represented 53% of our net sales this quarter versus 45% in the fourth quarter of 2021, reflecting our improving position as a supplier of choice for these higher-margin products.\nDuring the second quarter, gross profit was $1.6 billion, a decrease of 33.9% compared to the prior year period. Gross margin increased 40 basis points to 35.2%, driven primarily by a stronger mix in value-added products overall and with particular strength in Multi-Family value-add. SG&A decreased $28 million to $1.02 billion, mainly due to lower variable compensation, partially offset by additional expenses from operations acquired in the last year.\nAcquisitions increased SG&A by $52 million in the quarter. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 740 basis points to 22.5%, primarily attributable to decreased leverage on net sales. We remain focused on operating efficiently, containing costs and effectively integrating operations and acquisitions.\nAdjusted EBITDA was approximately $769 million a decline of 49% primarily driven by lower net sales, including a decline in core organic products attributable to a slower housing market and commodity deflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin remained a robust 17%, up 70 basis points sequentially as we continue to execute and drive improved productivity across the business.\nAdjusted net income was $498 million, down from an adjusted net income of $1.07 billion in the prior year quarter. The 54% decrease in adjusted net income was primarily driven by a decrease in sales volumes and commodity deflation.\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share were $3.89 compared to $6.26 in the prior year period. The decrease in adjusted EPS was partially offset by our repurchase of nearly 7 million shares, which added roughly $0.20 per share during quarter.\nOur second quarter results exceeded the guidance we provided in May, supported by our core business mix and gross margin strength amid outperformance in value-added products. We continue to gain confidence in the strength and ability of our margin performance, and we believe our long-term normalized gross margin percentage is now at 29% plus versus our previous expectation of 28% plus.\nNow let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 12. Our second quarter operating cash flow was approximately $391 million, down $556 million compared to the prior year period, mainly attributable to commodity deflation and a reduction in Single-family starts. Capital expenditures were $121 million. All in, we delivered healthy free cash flow of approximately $270 million.\nThe trailing 12 months ended June 30, our free cash flow yield was 17.7%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 41.4%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.1x, while base business leverage was 1.6x. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $900 million, consisting of $800 million in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and $100 million of cash on hand.\nMoving to capital deployment. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 7 million shares for $723 million at an average stock price of $103.68 per share. In total, we have repurchased approximately 41% of our outstanding shares since August of 2021. We have approximately $600 million remaining on our most recent $1 million share repurchase authorization from April 2023. We remain disciplined stewards of capital, and we'll continue to look for organic and inorganic growth opportunities while maintaining our fortress balance sheet.\nLet's turn to our outlook on Slide 14. Our July sales trends are encouraging and fuel our confidence in the resilience of our industry. Several of our national customers have begun to provide full year guidance, providing us with better visibility and greater confidence in the strength of the market. As a result, we are establishing our full year base business and total company guidance as we enter the back half of 2023.\nOur base business approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing for commodity volatility. As a reminder, our base business definition assumes normalized margins and static commodity prices at $400 per 1,000 [ board feet ]. This is helpful to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance in our industry.\nOur base business guide on net sales is $16.6 billion. Our base business EBITDA guide is $2.2 billion at a margin of roughly 13.3%. At this time, we are also providing total company guidance for full year 2023, including total net sales, gross margins, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin.\nFor full year 2023, we expect total company net sales to be $16.8 billion to $17.8 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be 15% to 17%, and we are guiding gross margins to a range of 33% to 35%. Our recent above normal margins reflect a greater mix in value-added products along with disciplined pricing required to offset our increases in operating costs from inflation. As we move through the second half of the year, we expect both our gross margins and Multi-Family business to continue to normalize.\nWe expect full year 2023 free cash flow of $1.6 billion to $2 billion. Our free cash flow forecast assumes average commodity prices in the range of $400 to $450. Our 2023 outlook is based on several assumptions. Please refer to our earnings release and Slide 15 of the investor presentation for a full list of these assumptions.\nAs I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are exceptionally well positioned to drive our strategic goals. Our guidance illustrates our belief that we will deliver a double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin this year and sustain that momentum in the years to come. As we continue to reap the benefits of our transformed business, we are positioned to achieve an upwardly revised long-term normalized gross margin of 29% or higher. I'm confident that our best-in-class operating platform will continue to generate substantial free cash flow providing further financial flexibility on top of our already healthy balance sheet. Importantly, we will continue to diligently deploy capital and maximize long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts.\n\nDavid E. Rush\n\nCEO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. Let me close by saying that we feel better about the current building environment today than we did at the beginning of the year. We're executing our strategy and continuing to invest to drive future growth. Our results in the first half reflect our hard work over the past few years to build a differentiated platform that has BFS set up to win in any environment. I am proud of our operational excellence, which is driving increased safety, productivity and profitability despite market headwinds. We are in a great position today and as end markets further stabilize, we are positioned for an even stronger future.\nWe'll continue to be at the forefront of technology with our digital strategy, which I'm confident will be a game changer for the industry. We are exceptionally well positioned to drive shareholder value this year and in years to come. I'm excited to share more details at our upcoming Investor Day on December 5 in Atlanta and look forward to seeing you there.\nThank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions."

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\nI'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMichael D. Neese\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Performance Food Group Co.\n\nThank you, Shelby.\nGood morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Rush, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will review our results for the first quarter of 2023. The earnings release, investor presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to several slides from the investor presentation during our call.\nThe results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should be considered in isolation for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they'd be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation.\nOur remarks in the press release presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid E. Rush\n\nCEO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call.\nOur start to 2023 has exceeded our expectations as the work that we have put into transforming Builders FirstSource into the premier supplier of building product solutions is driving tangible results. We are confident that the resilience of our business and the exceptional positioning with our customers will become increasingly evident to the market as we progress through a dynamic year in 2023. Despite a challenging macro backdrop, we performed above forecast due to the strength of our product portfolio, execution on our strategic priorities and the tireless efforts of our team members.\nWe are managing through this complex environment by leveraging our best-in-class distribution footprint and end market exposure. We remain committed to enhancing our customer relationships by being the easiest in the industry to do business with while driving improvements that will make home building more affordable and efficient. Our unrelenting emphasis on operational excellence positions us well to continue to execute our goals. We are driving share growth and mix improvement while continuing to grow through accretive acquisitions. Our recent transactions allow us to further expand our value-added offerings and reach a more diverse customer base in attractive markets.\nWhile macroeconomic factors continue to dominate the headlines, we are closely monitoring local market activity by staying close to our customers and maintaining focus on our strategy. We are controlling what we can control and running the business for long-term value creation. Elevated mortgage rates and affordability challenges are headwinds, but feedback from some homebuilders has suggested that underlying demand has been resilient when we have seen mortgage rates dip. Though the results vary slightly by region, our April sales continue to offer encouraging signs that green shoots are starting to emerge across homebuilding.\nOn Slide 4, we show what we achieved in the first quarter. Among the highlights, our gross margin percentage increased 300 basis points to 35.3%, driven by the strength of our Multi-Family value-added product category. Our recent acquisitions, which have diversified our footprint and enhanced our exposure to the Multi-Family sector, have been a strong contributor for us this first quarter. Our EBITDA margin remained healthy in the first quarter as we executed well and drove improved productivity across the business. It is important to note that during the quarter with sales down 31.6%, our adjusted EBITDA margin was only off by 130 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. This reinforces our belief that we can sustain a double-digit EBITDA margin throughout this year, assuming Single-Family starts declined by no more than 25%.\nOn Slide 5, while core organic sales declined relative to prior year as Single-Family housing demand slowed, I would point out that Multi-Family and R&R and Other both grew. Multi-Family was a tailwind this quarter, and we expect this strength to continue for the remainder of 2023. Following recent acquisitions, Multi-Family [indiscernible] more than doubled to 13% of our net sales in the first quarter versus 6% this time last year. We continue to focus on improving productivity, and we are pleased to deliver $34 million in savings for the quarter as we leverage our BFS [ one team ] operating system. We are working hard to improve efficiencies through operational excellence focused on manufacturing and delivery improvements. This is evidenced by our 96% in full delivery metric. We are dedicated to reducing our customers' cycle times with full deliveries and fewer trips to the job site, strengthening our customer relationships and helping to lower their total cost.\nWe remain focused on the importance of controlling SG&A and other expenses. This includes efficient capacity utilization, ongoing optimization of our footprint and balancing the need for variable cost reductions against future capacity needs. In May 2020, we released our first Corporate Social Responsibility report. We expect to release our 2023 CSR report later this month and look forward to sharing our progress on sustainability with our stakeholders. We are committed to addressing the risk of climate change, including taking actions to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. In 2022 and early 2023, we undertook and completed an extensive project to consolidate and report our energy use data. Through this work, we now monitor our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions across our facilities and fleet and expect to report our 2022 greenhouse gas emissions later this month. We are leveraging this 2022 carbon emissions baseline to set appropriate emissions reduction goals.\nWhen we talk about our high-performing BFS culture, safety is our first priority. I'm proud to say that we achieved a 22% reduction in our total recordable incident rate last year and have reduced it by another 30% so far this year. We continue to invest in our people by striving to make BFS the best place to work. We have improved benefits to better attract and retain high-performing talent and have trained over 99% of our team members to date on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\nTurning to M&A on Slide 6. While the current M&A pipeline remains slower than prior years, we continue to target attractive opportunities with a disciplined approach. Thus far in 2023, these have been smaller deals. But given the highly fragmented nature of our industry, we still believe in our goal to invest an average of $500 million in M&A per year for the next several years.\nAs we mentioned on our call in February, we acquired Noltex Truss during the first quarter, a 5-location truss manufacturer providing building components to the Single and Multi-Family markets throughout Texas. Since then, we have acquired 2 more companies. Last month, we acquired Builders Millwork Supply, a millwork distributor serving Anchorage. And this past Monday, we acquired JB Millworks, which contributes important value-adding capacity in the Chattanooga area. We are excited to welcome these businesses and new team members to the BFS family.\nMoving to Slide 7 and capital allocation. In the first quarter, we deployed approximately $800 million of capital towards organic growth investments, tuck-in M&A and share repurchases, and we have cumulatively deployed $4.3 billion against our 2025 $7 billion to $10 billion goal. Looking forward, I am happy to announce we plan to host another Investor Day in December in Atlanta, where we will update our progress on our strategic initiatives, including the latest on our digital offerings. We will also provide a tour of our nearby robotic truss facility. We are planning to release more details in the coming months.\nNow let's turn to Slide 8, and provide an update on our digital strategy. We continue to play a pioneering role in the digital transformation of the homebuilding industry, growing our capabilities in 2022 and are working to drive enhancements and adoption throughout 2023. We are executing our digital product development plan and introducing our customers to the tools and their benefits through the myBLDR.com platform. We firmly believe our long-term commitment to investing in digital innovations and technologies will deliver greater efficiency across homebuilding, enhance our product and service offerings and extend BFS's lead as the partner of choice in the market.\nDuring our last call, we announced the launch of our myBLDR.com customer portal, which will ultimately provide our homebuilder customers with access to easy-to-use digital tools to virtually design and build their homes. One of those applications is Home Configure, which is already in use for the significant number of customers, while we continue to develop and pilot new capabilities that will be deployed throughout 2023. Home Configure is a 3-dimensional virtual application that allows the user to configure a home while providing a more collaborative experience. These are the types of advancements putting us at the forefront of our industry as we continue to rapidly scale a full suite of capabilities.\nIn Q1, we completed over 6,000 automated window and lumber take-offs, an 80% increase over Q4 2022, and we had nearly 15,000 visitors who started 56,000 sessions in our Home Configure [ tool ]. This momentum gives us early [ comp stats ] that our digital strategy remains on schedule, and we will continue to enhance the platform to drive adoption. Our digital tools will help us integrate more closely with our customers and ultimately result in incremental sell-through of our 4 building products as we gain share of wallet. We are on track to gain an incremental $1 billion in sales by 2026.\nYou have heard me say that our people are the building blocks of our organization. They inspire me every day to continue the evolution and growth of our People First culture. Today, I'm delighted to share a success story that represents the best of our sales team, [ Mitchell Ingram ] from [ Blairsville ], Georgia. [ Mitchell's ] journey began with us 17 years ago as a CDL driver, and from the very beginning, he stood out for delivering exceptional customer service. For 5 years, Mitchell was the driver that every customer wanted as they flawlessly delivered materials to their job sites, earning their trust and loyalty. That natural ability for exceptional customer service led Mitchell being promoted to inside sales, where he continued to excel and quickly became the go-to salesperson for both our internal team and our customers.\nToday, as a key member of our outside sales team, Mitchell has become the market's top salesperson and recently won a Leader of the Pack award, recognizing him as 1 of our top sales team members. On behalf of BFS, I extend my warmest congratulations to Mitchell for his outstanding contributions and achievements. At BFS, we have very -- we have many similar remarkable stories, further exemplifying our commitment to the team members that make us so successful. Their dedication and commitment are invaluable to our team's success, and we are fortunate to have them.\nI will conclude by saying that our differentiated platform, experienced management team and clear focus on delivering value-added solutions to our customers. have positioned us well to win in the market and outperform. I'm very excited to lead this winning team.\nI'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail.\n\nPeter M. Jackson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone.\nI'm pleased to report that we delivered exceptional gross margins in the first quarter despite a challenging macro backdrop. The advantages of value-added products and services are evident and key to our outperformance. We generated strong free cash flow as we leveraged our best-in-class operating platform and extended our track record of effective cost containment and working capital management. Our robust financial position, the industry-leading products and solutions and reputation for providing excellent customer service allow us to successfully navigate macro volatility and position us for above-market growth in the years to come.\nI will cover 3 topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our first quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our second quarter guidance and provide an update on our illustrative full year scenarios.\nLet's begin by reviewing our first quarter performance on Slide 10. We delivered $3.9 billion in net sales. Core organic sales decreased by 26%, attributable to a 34% decline in Single-Family due to slowing demand and compared to a strong first quarter of 2022. Multi-Family was a bright spot that reflects the benefit of our expansion strategy in this category, growing by nearly 70%. The growth was driven by multiple acquisitions and a strong rental market. R&R and Other grew by more than 3%, mainly attributable to increased sales focus and capacity versus prior year.\nThe cumulative effect of our acquisitions over the past year contributed approximately 5 percentage points of growth to net sales and 1 additional selling day had a favorable impact of 1%. While core organic sales and value-added products decreased by nearly 17% due to slowing Single-Family starts, this is almost 10 points better than the overall core organic result and underscores the resilience of the value-added product portfolio. Importantly, value-added products represent 56% of our net sales in the quarter, reflecting our position as the supplier of choice for these valuable, high-margin products.\nDuring the first quarter, gross profit was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 25.2% compared to the prior year period. Gross margin increased 300 basis points to 35.3%, with more than half of the 300 basis points change coming from our Multi-Family value-added products and services. SG&A decreased $64.4 million to $904.2 million, mainly due to lower variable compensation, partially offset by additional expenses from operations acquired in the last year. Acquisitions increased SG&A by $46 million in the quarter. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 630 basis points to 23.3%, primarily attributable to decreased leverage to net sales.\nWe remain focused on disciplined cost management and are taking appropriate actions in response to volume dynamics on a market-by-market basis. As we have stated in the past, approximately 70% of SG&A expense is variable with volumes. We are striking the right balance between calibrating operations based on changes in volume and protecting capacity for future growth.\nAdjusted EBITDA was approximately $632 million, a decline of 37%, primarily driven by lower net sales, including a decline in core organic products attributable to a slowing housing market and commodity deflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin was a robust 16.3%. Adjusted net income was $410 million, down from an adjusted net income of $701 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $2.96 compared to $3.90 in the prior year period. The decrease in adjusted EPS was favorably offset by our repurchase of more than 7.5 million shares or $0.15 per share during the quarter.\nOur first quarter results beat the guidance we provided in February, supported by gross margin strength as value-added products overdelivered and productivity came in faster than forecast. As a result, we are increasingly confident that our long-term normalized gross margin percentage is now at 28% plus versus our previous expectation of 27% plus.\nNow let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 12. Our first quarter operating cash flow was approximately $654 million, up from $180 million in the prior year, mainly attributable to disciplined working capital management and improved product mix as well as effective pricing and cost management. Capital expenditures were $100 million. All in, we delivered robust free cash flow of approximately $554 million. Free cash flow yield is 28.5% while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 47.1% for the trailing 12 months ended March 31. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 0.8x. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was $1.4 billion, consisting of $1.2 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and $144 million of cash on hand.\nMoving to capital deployment. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 7.5 million shares for $628 million at an average stock price of $83.17 a share. In addition, we have repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares so far in the second quarter for $348 million at an average stock price of $91.90. In total, we have repurchased 39% of our outstanding shares since August of 2021.\nAs we have completed our prior share repurchase authorization, the Board of Directors decided to approve a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We remain disciplined stewards of capital, and we'll continue to look for organic and inorganic growth opportunities and to repurchase shares at an attractive value while maintaining our fortress balance sheet.\nNow, I would like to discuss our guide on Slide 13. Given the ongoing challenging conditions in the housing market, we are continuing to provide quarterly guidance. We will reassess our full year guidance for actual and base business as the year progresses. For the second quarter, we expect net sales to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 13.1% to 13.7%. Our adjusted EBITDA guide for the second quarter assumes gross margins in the 32% to 34% range.\nOur second quarter guidance includes the following full year assumptions, which are also outlined in the earnings release and on Slide 14. We expect total capital expenditures in the range of $325 million to $375 million. This includes continued investments in scaling our value-added products. We expect interest expense in the range of $150 million to $170 million, an effective tax rate between 23% and 25%, depreciation expenses in the range of $525 million to $575 million, no change in the number of selling days versus the prior year. And finally, we expect to deliver between $90 million and $110 million in annual productivity savings.\nWe recognize that it is important to think about potential outcomes for the full year, so on Slide 15, we have updated our scenario analysis to demonstrate how we are positioned to generate resilient financial performance across a range of potential housing market and commodity conditions. As you can see, our strong Q1 performance and visibility into Q2 have meaningfully improved our expectations for each of the full year performance scenarios. As Single-Family starts are down 15% for this year, we now believe we can generate roughly $2.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA, which is up $500 million from our fourth quarter scenario analysis. This increased EBITDA expectation reflects stronger gross margins and productivity savings than we previously expected.\nAs I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are exceptionally well positioned to drive our strategic goals forward. We believe that we can sustain a double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin this year, and we continue to see the benefits of our transformed business. I believe that our long-term normalized gross margin percentage is now at 28% or higher. I'm confident in our best-in-class operating platform will continue to set us up to generate substantial free cash flow, which provides further financial flexibility on top of our healthy balance sheet. We will also continue to diligently deploy capital and work to manage -- to maximize long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for his closing remarks.\n\nDavid E. Rush\n\nCEO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter.\nLet me close by saying that we feel really good about our strategy and our execution so far in 2023. Our investments in value-added products, productivity initiatives and digital solutions are all delivering on our goal to improve our customers' experience and partnership with BFS while driving growth over the long term. While 2023 still appears to be a challenging year for our industry, I'm confident that we can create value for our shareholders through executing our strategy, our focus on value-added products and services, and our disciplined deployment of capital towards growth opportunities.\nThank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions."

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMichael D. Neese\n\nSVP of IR, BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Britney, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Rush, our recently appointed CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO.\nToday, we will review our fourth quarter and full year results. The earnings press release and investor presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com.\nWe will refer to several slides from the investor presentation during our call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures, where applicable and the discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation.\nOur remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid E. Rush\n\nCEO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Before we get into the results, I'd like to thank the Board of Directors for the opportunity to serve as the CEO of Builders FirstSource and for trusting me to lead this great organization. Also want to thank all of the BFS field leaders and team members for their support, which has been inspiring.\nI come from a background in finance, having spent the first 18 years of my career in various financial roles from Controller to CFO. Over my 23 years with BFS, I've been fortunate to have had a variety of operational roles, including region oversight primary responsibility for both the ProBuild and BMC integrations and most recently, leadership of our enterprise-wide initiatives as EVP of our Strategic Management Office.\nI believe my experience and industry knowledge will be a strong basis to build on our success of creating long-term value for shareholders. Now let's turn to the business results. Macroeconomic factors will undoubtedly continue to create headlines this year. However, with our exceptional and seasoned team, strong balance sheet, an industry-leading platform, we are in a great position to win in any environment.\nWe have a field leadership team with over 30 years average experience in the industry. They have been through similar macroeconomic environments to the ones we are currently facing today, which gives me great confidence in our ability to manage business changes with quick and decisive action as required. We have maintained very low leverage, providing us with maximum flexibility to deal with any scenario, and we continue to leverage our footprint, our scale and our product portfolio to outcompete in the market. Let's turn to our long-term strategic priorities on Slide 4 for a moment.\nAs we navigate a changing landscape, we see no need to alter our long-term strategy, and we remain focused on expanding organically in value-added products and services, driving operational excellence, continuing to build our high-performing culture and growing through strategic tuck-in acquisitions.\nOn Slide 5, you can see our continued emphasis on the strategic priorities was key to our record full year 2022 net sales of $22.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $4.4 billion. Top line growth, value-added product mix improvement and disciplined cost management resulted in our adjusted EBITDA margin increasing 390 basis points to 19.3%. The combination of the increased profitability and share buybacks supported 81% growth in full year 2022 adjusted EPS.\nOn Slide 6, you can see that we delivered a 6.6% increase in core organic sales, including nearly 21% growth in our higher-margin value-added products. We are extremely pleased to deliver $123 million in productivity savings for the year, exceeding our $100 million target as we drive improvement across a variety of projects and leverage our BFS 1-TEAM Operating System.\nWe remain focused on the importance of controlling SG&A and other expenses. This includes efficiency -- efficient capacity utilization, ongoing optimization of our footprint and balancing the need for variable cost reductions and future capacity. Importantly, we have rationalized over 30 locations during the last year while maintaining coverage and not exiting any markets.\nI'm extremely proud of how we continue to demonstrate our high-performing culture through improved safety by lowering our recordable incident rate by approximately 22% year-over-year, which marks the second consecutive year of improvement. We also continue to invest in training, enhanced DEI initiatives and improved employee benefits to better attract and retain high-performing talent.\nTurning to M&A on Slide 7. In addition to our focus on profitable core organic growth, we continue to execute tuck-in acquisitions aligned with our strategy, completing 6 acquisitions in 2022. Although the M&A pipeline has slowed in the current macro environment, we continue to be acquisitive while remaining disciplined in our approach. We are committed to expanding our geographic footprint in key markets with a particular emphasis on enhancing our value-added portfolio to better serve our customers, diversify our end market exposure and leverage our technological capabilities.\nThis is evidenced by our recent acquisitions, including Pima Door and Supply in the fourth quarter, which expands our millwork footprint in the Phoenix area. And earlier this month, we acquired Noltex Truss, a 5-location truss manufacturer providing building components to the single and multifamily markets throughout Texas.\nThis tuck-in acquisition further extends our leading position in value-added products across the state. We are excited to welcome both Pima and Noltex with their long-standing customer relationships and track record of profitable growth to the BFS family.\nThe still highly fragmented nature of our industry supports our ambition to invest $500 million in M&A per year on average for the next several years. Moving to Slide 8 and looking at our capital allocation in aggregate for 2022, we deployed approximately $3.5 billion of capital towards organic growth investments tuck-in M&A and share repurchases and remain on track to achieve the goal we established at our 2021 Investor Day of deploying $7 billion to $10 billion from 2022 to 2025. We will continue to closely monitor our customer sentiment, which currently suggests a challenging year ahead.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we saw a slowdown in average daily sales, which has continued into the first quarter. Higher mortgage rates and affordability challenge continue to be headwinds.\nOn Slide 9, we outlined the benefits of our flexible business model for dynamic operating environment, such as the one we're currently experiencing. As we have discussed, we are actively managing the business as conditions indicate, and we are acting decisively wherever we see decelerating demand.\nOur focus is on effectively managing costs through our variable expense structure to match cost with volumes. We are optimizing capacity and reducing discretionary spend without impairing our ability to maximize the recovery when this turns the corner.\nStepping back, we realized affordability has been an increasing concern over the past several years as home prices and rates have increased significantly. We are working on making housing more attainable by investing in value-added products, productivity and digital capabilities to reduce cycle times and make home building more efficient.\nFor example, in 2022. We invested approximately $125 million in CapEx supporting our value-added product growth and digital strategy. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize our investments in our fleet value-added technology and digital innovations. Together, these initiatives will help lower total cost improve affordability and allow more people to buy homes.\nWe are committed to strategically accelerate our leading market position and deliver on our overall value proposition. -- and we will continue to execute while keeping our focus on providing the best possible service to our customers.\nNow let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss our primary role in the digital transformation of the homebuilding industry.\nWe have a long-term commitment to investing in digital innovations and technologies that we believe will drive greater efficiency across homebuilding and enhance our product offerings. On the homebuilder software side, we are executing our development plan and integrating that with our BFS operations through our digital sales teams.\nWe're excited to have reached a significant milestone in launching the pilot of our new bldr.com platform. This platform will introduce our homebuilder customers to easy-to-use digital tools to virtually design and build their homes. These include key capabilities such as planned intake and markup, home configuration, conflict identification material estimating and ordering and job site scheduling.\nIn January, we began communicating this release to add both our BFS National Event and the International Builder Show. At both events, we received overwhelmingly positive feedback affirming the need for this innovative technology in our industry.\nWe are launching the current mybldr.com capabilities to 40 pilot customers across 4 markets. This will allow us to assess, collaborate with and provide new solutions to our customers in a way that aligns our BFS sales and operations teams. We will add new features with monthly releases throughout 2023, as we build and scale our end-to-end digital homebuilding platform.\nThe overall digital strategy remains on schedule, and we are on track to gain an incremental $1 billion in sales by 2026. Last month, at our national event, we announced our inaugural BFS Hall of Fame Class for 2022, the culmination of our annual employee recognition program and a highlight of our people-first culture. These distinguished individuals represent the best of our frontline team members, but there is 1 person I would like to highlight today, Frank Loria.\nFrank is a fleet and compliance manager out of Southern California, who's been with the company and its predecessors for an impressive 45 years. He oversees our fleet and machinery across 11 locations. Frank takes great pride in keeping everything running consistently and with minimal downtime.\nAs manager emphasized, \"Frank's knowledge of everything mechanical is simply unrivaled.\" on behalf of the leadership team, I want to thank Frank and the other Hall of Fame inductees for their tremendous contribution.\nI will conclude by saying that we have the best team to win in a challenging environment. I am confident in our strategies and our ability to deliver long-term results for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail.\n\nPeter M. Jackson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I want to congratulate Dave on his appointment as our new CEO. I've worked with him for many years and couldn't be happier for him and for this company. I know he will lead us to continued growth and success. I also want to join Dave in thanking our team members for delivering a record year of performance. We sincerely appreciate your hard work and dedication to delivering excellent service to our customers day in and day out.\nI'm proud to report that we delivered solid financial results in the fourth quarter to cap off a record year for the business. We continue to manage through the complex operating environment with a proactive mindset and a disciplined approach. We expect that the structural enhancements we have made in our business over the past decade will help us mitigate the impact of softer housing demand and inflationary headwinds.\nOur ample liquidity, low leverage and disciplined cost management, provides significant financial firepower to continue to strategically and opportunistically grow our business. I will cover 3 topics with you this morning.\nFirst, I'll recap our fourth quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our first quarter guidance and lay out illustrative full year scenarios. Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter performance on Slide 12.\nWe delivered $4.4 billion in net sales. Core organic growth decreased by 8%, attributable to a nearly 14% decline in single family at slowing demand compared to strong fourth quarter 2021 led to difficult comps. Both multifamily and repair/remodel and other increased by almost 15%.\nMultifamily was driven by a strong rental market and resulting backlog. R&R and other growth was mainly attributable to increased sales focus and capacity versus prior year. 2 fewer selling days had an unfavorable impact of roughly 3% on net sales. The cumulative effect of our acquisitions over the past year contributed approximately 8 percentage points of growth to net sales.\nValue-added products saw another quarter of growth. Compared to total fourth quarter starts, which decreased by 16%, core organic sales in the category increased by 0.6% and reflecting the macro trend of value-added product adoption and our success in the category. I'm very happy to highlight value-added products represented over half of our revenue in the quarter, a great proof point of success towards our goal of being the supplier of choice for these valuable high-growth products.\nDuring the fourth quarter, gross profit was $1.5 billion, or roughly comparable to the prior year period. Gross margin increased 200 basis points to 34.1%, mainly due to the increased mix of value-added products. SG&A grew 11% to $958.7 million, mainly due to additional operating expenses from companies acquired in the last year, inflation and other costs.\nAcquisitions represented over 60% of the increase in SG&A. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 340 basis points to 22%. We remain focused on disciplined cost management and are taking appropriate actions in response to volume dynamics on a market-by-market basis. These actions include footprint rationalization, discretionary spending reductions and cutting headcount and overtime.\nAs we have stated in the past, approximately 70% of SG&A expense is variable. Within that 70%, roughly 20% of sales is driven by volume-based formulas is like commissions and bonuses. The remaining 50% of sales is where we are actively managing our operations. We are striking the right balance between resizing operations based on changes in volume and protecting capacity for future growth.\nAdjusted EBITDA was approximately $700 million, a decline of $97 million, primarily due to declines in core organic sales and commodities, partially offset by M&A. Importantly, adjusted EBITDA margin was 16%. This represents the second best fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin in our history, reflecting our focused execution and expense control.\nAdjusted net income was $470.8 million, down from an adjusted net income of $532.4 million in the prior year quarter, attributable to a decrease in net sales and higher SG&A expense. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.21 compared to $2.78 in the prior year period. The increase reflects our more than $650 million in accretive share repurchases investments during the quarter.\nTo put this in perspective, the repurchase equates to $0.21 or nearly half of the $0.43 change. Now let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 14. Our fourth quarter operating cash flow was approximately $971 million, mainly attributable to increased profitability due to effective pricing and cost management as well as disciplined working capital management.\nGenerally, we see working capital as an incremental or decrement of approximately 10% of sales. Capital expenditures were $131 million. All in, we delivered robust free cash flow of approximately $840 million. For the year, we generated record free cash flow of approximately $3.3 billion, representing a free cash flow yield of 30.6%. Operating cash flow return on invested capital was 41.1% for the year ended December 31.\nOur 2022 net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 0.7x and approximately 1.3x our estimated 2022 base business EBITDA, well within our stated target of 1 to 2x. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030.\nAt quarter end, our total liquidity was $1.5 billion, consisting of $1.4 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and approximately $100 million of cash on hand.\nMoving to capital deployment. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 10.2 million shares for $651 million at an average stock price of $64.17 per share.\nIn addition, we have repurchased approximately 900,000 shares so far in the first quarter of 2023 for $61 million at an average stock price of $65.94 During 2022, we repurchased almost 42 million shares for $2.6 billion, and we have more than $900 million remaining in our authorization.\nIn total, we have repurchased more than 1/3 of our outstanding shares in the last 18 months. We remain disciplined stewards of capital, and we'll continue to look for inorganic growth opportunities and to repurchase shares at an attractive value. We maintain a fortress balance sheet, which will help us withstand a slower housing environment and keep us well positioned for long-term growth.\nTurning to Slide 15. We continue to believe it is important to assess our results using a base business methodology. During 2022, base business revenue grew 13% while base business adjusted EBITDA increased 28% year-over-year. This approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing commodity volatility.\nAs a reminder, our base business definition assumes normalized commodity margins and static commodity prices at $400 per 1,000 board feet. Overall, I'm proud that we delivered solid results in the fourth quarter despite slowing housing starts. Additionally, our record results for the full year reflect our differentiated platform, talented team members and intense focus on execution. I'm confident that through our leading footprint, investments in value-added products and ongoing efficiency initiatives that we can continue to gain share, grow our value-added products and deploy capital.\nNow I would like to discuss our guidance on Slide 16. Given the current challenging conditions in the housing market amid elevated mortgage rates and general uncertainty in economic conditions, we are amending our guidance disclosures at this time to align with our public customers. Customers of all types and sizes have expressed their uncertainty about starts in the year ahead.\nAs a result, we have decided to only provide guidance for the first quarter of 2023, as shown on Slide 16. We will reassess full year guidance for actual and base business as the year progresses.\nFor the first quarter, we expect net sales to be in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $400 million to $440 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 11.7% to 11.9%. I would also note that the first quarter guide assumes gross margins to be in the 30% to 32% range.\nIn addition, given the 2022 starts profile, we expect comparisons to prior year will be most difficult in the first 2 quarters. Our guidance includes the following full year assumptions, which are also outlined in the earnings release and on Slide 17.\nWe expect total capital expenditures in the range of $300 million to $350 million. This includes continued investments in value-added products. And we continue to invest in our technology and infrastructure, and we will migrate to one integrated ERP platform in the coming years.\nI'll remind you that the related increases in CapEx and OpEx are included in our guidance and our 2025 financial projections from our December 2021 Investor Day. We expect interest expense in the range of $150 million to $170 million, an effective tax rate between 23% and 25%, depreciation and amortization expenses in the range of $525 million to $550 million. No change in the number of selling days, and we expect to deliver between $90 million and $110 million in productivity savings.\nWe recognize that it's important to think about potential outcomes for the full year. So on Slide 18, we provide a scenario analysis to demonstrate how we are positioned to generate resilient financial performance across a range of potential housing market and commodity conditions.\nI will reiterate that we are not providing full year guidance, but this scenario analysis should help clarify our range of performance expectations and demonstrate the capability of our business to achieve strong adjusted EBITDA margins in 2023.\nTo summarize, we are exceptionally well positioned to withstand a slowdown in house while continuing to drive our strategic goals. We have a strong balance sheet and no long-term debt maturities until 2030. We are operating in a proactive fashion and are taking the necessary steps to manage through this downturn with a relentless focus on execution. I'm confident our best-in-class operating platform will continue to generate solid free cash flow, which provides further financial flexibility. We will also diligently deploy capital and work to maximize long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for his closing remarks.\n\nDavid E. Rush\n\nCEO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. Let me provide a few final thoughts. Having spent the greater part of my career with BFS, I firmly believe in our differentiated platform, which is the strongest it's ever been and will enable us to outperform in any environment. We have a clear strategy that we're continuing to execute. We generate strong cash flow, and we have significant opportunities to invest that cash to expand our value-added products and solutions, execute strategic acquisitions and return capital to shareholders.\nThrough it all, we remain focused on operational excellence to continue to drive increased safety, productivity and profitability. 2023 will be a challenging year for our industry, but I'm confident in our talented team members who have clearly demonstrated their ability to execute and win in any market.\nThank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's open the call now for questions."

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMichael D. Neese\n\nSVP of IR, BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Todd. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Flitman, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will review our third quarter results for 2022. The third quarter press release and investor presentation for today's call are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to several slides from the investor presentation during the call.\nThe results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation.\nOur remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid E. Flitman\n\nCEO, President & Director, BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call.\nOur strong third quarter results reflect the fundamental strength of our business, including our value-added products and services that resonate with our customers and our consistent execution. We are winning new business and strengthening existing customer relationships by consistently providing customers tailored solutions and excellent service, which collectively make us a partner of choice.\nIn the third quarter, we delivered a 6.9% increase in core organic sales, including nearly 20% growth in our higher margin value-added products. That performance, combined with our investments in core operations, our relentless focus on cost controls and acceleration of productivity helped us produce record adjusted EBITDA.\nOn Slide 3, I would like to remind you of our long-term strategic priorities: expanding organically in value-added products and services, driving operational excellence, continuing to build our high-performing culture and growing through strategic tuck-in acquisitions.\nOn Slide 4, we outline how we continue to execute against our strategy this quarter. Specifically, we delivered record results in the quarter by increasing our value-added product sales. We leveraged our BFS 1-TEAM operating system, leading to $33 million in productivity savings in the quarter. We deployed additional capital toward tuck-in acquisitions as highlighted by our recent purchases. Since the BMC merger, we have now deployed $2 billion of capital to strategic M&A.\nThrough October, we have repurchased $2 billion in common stock this year. We still have slightly more than $500 million remaining on our current $2 billion share repurchase authorization and we will continue to look for favorable opportunities to repurchase shares, considering market dynamics and our ongoing commitment to maximize long-term value creation. Since we launched our buyback program 15 months ago, we have invested approximately $3.8 billion in repurchasing roughly 61 million shares, retiring nearly 30% of our common shares outstanding.\nLet's turn to our third quarter results on Slide 5. We delivered approximately $6 billion in net sales. Core organic sales in value-added products grew by nearly 20%, while single-family sales increased almost 2%.\nRepair and Remodel and Other increased over 30% and multi-family increased 16%. R&R and Other growth was mainly attributable to a weaker prior year when supply constraints limited our ability to support growth in this segment. Multi-family was driven by solid organic growth and a strong backlog of projects. Once again, value-added products drove our growth story, further validating that we are well positioned to be the supplier of choice for these products.\nDuring the third quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA with a margin of 20.3%. These results were driven by our strong execution, share gains, ongoing productivity initiatives and pricing discipline in a market that has been supply constrained, but is returning to normal.\nTurning to M&A on Slide 6. In addition to our focus on profitable core organic growth, we continue to execute tuck-in acquisitions that are aligned with our strategy. Since the start of the quarter, we have completed 4 acquisitions that collectively advance our objective of expanding our geographic footprint in key markets, enhancing our value-added portfolio to better serve our customers and diversifying our end market exposure.\nIn September, we closed our acquisition of Trussway, which expands our footprint in multifamily trusses, accelerating our growth in the Southwest and Southeast. We also acquired Fulcrum Building Group in September, providing us with pro contractor-focused lumberyards, millwork facilities and additional resources in the high-growth markets of the Gulf Coast. In July, we closed our acquisition of HomCo Lumber and Hardware, which enhanced our footprint in Flagstaff, Arizona. Then in October, we acquired Pima Door & Supply, which provides us with dedicated millwork capabilities in Phoenix.\nThese acquisitions represent our ability to acquire high-return assets that will boost our long-term value proposition. We're excited to welcome the HomCo, Trussway, Fulcrum and Pima teams with their long-standing customer relationships and track records of profitable growth to the BFS family.\nWe have spent approximately $630 million on M&A so far this year. The highly fragmented nature of our industry supports our ambition to invest on average $500 million per year for the next several years while deploying capital in a disciplined manner. As we navigate near-term market dynamics, we will continue to be acquisitive where valuations make sense. We remain vigilant stewards of capital to ensure we continue to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders.\nNow let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss our pioneering role in the digital transformation of the homebuilding industry. The end of the third quarter marks just over 1 year since the completion of our Paradigm and Apollo acquisitions. The original Paradigm business continues to perform exceptionally well and we are investing in the long-term growth of that business.\nOn the homebuilder software side, we remain committed to executing our development plan to build out of our digital sales team and integration with BFS operations. As we highlighted last quarter, we successfully integrated our structural design, material takeoff and visualization models into one streamlined process for our pilot customers. We now have 18 new digital sales representatives in place with more than 330 customer meetings held during the third quarter.\nAnd we are excited to tell you about a new technology that we will be introducing to the marketplace at the beginning of 2023, our new mybldr.com website which will provide our small builder customers easy-to-use digital tools to virtually design and build their next home and engage with key operational functions, including planning, specifying products, ordering materials and budgeting. We believe our launch of this platform will help us grow the BFS brand and build on our momentum as the supplier of choice in the homebuilding industry.\nTurning to productivity. In addition to the $55 million of carryover synergies, we have delivered $73 million in savings so far in 2022 and we expect to exceed $100 million in productivity savings for the full year as we drive improvement projects and leverage our BFS 1-TEAM operating system.\nLast quarter, we outlined the increased resilience of our business model, and we believe these are important points to reiterate in this current environment of macro uncertainty. In the scenario of a challenged market where housing starts are down significantly, we have many levers to pull, as shown on Slide 8 that will allow us to quickly respond, including effectively managing costs through our variable expense structure to flex expenses with demand, optimizing capacity and further streamlining our footprint, reducing discretionary spend, accelerating productivity projects and taking appropriate workforce actions.\nOur scale, combined with these initiatives, allow us to operate in a much more proactive and effective manner compared to the last recessionary cycle 15 years ago.\nAs we have all seen in the public builder announcements, the commentary has suggested a 30% to 40% decline in order rates on average. While we had very strong third quarter results, we have begun to see a slowdown in average daily sales as higher mortgage rates and declining consumer confidence are weighing on demand and commodity prices.\nOur September and preliminary October volumes were down low double digits versus a year ago, amid a significant decline in early-stage build products. As such, we quickly pulled a few levers to curb our costs, including bringing our inventory in line with evolving sales levels, putting a moratorium on nonessential travel, reducing headcount and overtime to align with volumes and rationalizing facilities. This work is never easy, and these are difficult decisions with respect to our affected team members, but we must be responsive to the market deceleration and best position the company to navigate this environment. We are proactively managing into the downturn, and we are prepared to act decisively to protect and resize the business as necessary.\nWe anticipate that the operating environment will remain challenging for the foreseeable future, but we are committed to strategically accelerating our leading market position, allocating capital towards value-generating organic and inorganic growth opportunities and delivering on our overall value proposition. We are confident that no matter the operating environment, we will continue to execute well, outpace the market and create long-term value for our shareholders.\nAs laser-focused as Builders FirstSource is on making fundamentally sound business decisions that drive value for our shareholders, we are equally devoted to supporting the communities where our team members and customers reside, especially in times of need. The past several weeks have been difficult for many due to the devastation caused by Hurricane Ian. Our hearts go out to all the individuals and families who have been impacted. We were relieved to learn that our team members are safe but saddened that a few of them suffered catastrophic damage to their homes. We stand behind each of them as they work to rebuild.\nIn recent weeks, we've donated over $500,000 to humanitarian organizations supporting the Hurricane Ian relief efforts. The organizations Builders FirstSource has made contributions to include the American Red Cross, Samaritans Perse and BFS Cares, the company's emergency assistance program that helps team members who are facing hardship immediately after a natural disaster.\nMoreover, I want to recognize our countless team members who have selflessly gone above and beyond to support those displaced by Hurricane Ian, with special gratitude going to our team members in Wausau, Wisconsin, who partnered with our local community to send a semi-truck filled with supplies and essentials, more than 1,500 miles to Fort Myers, Florida. It's times like these that we be truly humbled to lead such a caring and supportive organization. I extend my heartfelt appreciation to these exceptional team members and to all those individuals and organizations offering support on the ground and assisting with the relief efforts. We stand ready to support these communities and help them rebuild.\nI will now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our third quarter financial results.\n\nPeter M. Jackson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone.\nI'm pleased to report that we delivered strong financial results in the third quarter. We generated a record quarterly free cash flow of $1.4 billion and repurchased $658 million of our common stock during the quarter, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our financial performance reflects consistent execution, disciplined operational management and alignment with our strategic priorities. We are operating with a proactive mindset and have enhanced our already strong expense management processes amid a challenging operating environment. Our fortress balance sheet, low net leverage profile and substantial liquidity provide us with the flexibility to navigate a dynamic but decelerating market. All the while, we are maintaining focus on creating long-term shareholder value.\nI will cover 3 topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our third quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our guidance for full year 2022.\nLet's begin by reviewing our third quarter performance on Slide 9. We generated net sales of $5.8 billion for the quarter, which increased 4.6% compared to the prior year period. Core organic sales in the value-added products category grew by 19.9%, reflecting our work to enhance our product mix and meet customer needs. Gross profit was $2 billion, a 17.6% increase year-over-year. Gross margin increased 390 basis points to 35% as we increased sales in our value-added product categories and continued pricing discipline in what has been a supply-constrained market, but is returning to normal.\nSG&A grew 14.3% to $1 billion, with about half of that increase driven by 2 factors: additional operating expenses from locations acquired within the last 12 months and higher wages and variable compensation costs as a result of increased net sales and profitability. The remainder of the increase was driven by fuel-related expenses and strategic initiatives such as IT, productivity and digital investments. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 150 basis points to 17.4%.\nWe remain focused on the importance of controlling expenses and driving EBITDA improvement. We executed successfully during the third quarter as adjusted EBITDA increased 20.1% primarily driven by net sales growth, a higher mix of sales from value-added product categories and disciplined price. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 260 basis points from the prior year period to 20.3%.\nAdjusted net income was $814 million or $5.20 of adjusted EPS compared to adjusted net income of $697 million or $3.39 of adjusted EPS in the prior year period. The 16.8% increase in adjusted net income was primarily driven by an increase in net sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher income tax and SG&A expense.\nNow let's turn to our strong balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 11. Our third quarter cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion, while capital expenditures were $84 million. We generated robust free cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion, primarily driven by core organic sales growth, increased profitability due to effective pricing and cost management and disciplined working capital management. Free cash flow yield was 33.3%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 39.8% for the trailing 12 months ended September 30.\nMoving to capital deployment. As Dave mentioned, this year, we have put approximately $630 million to work through 6 acquisitions. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 11.2 million shares for $658 million at an average stock price of $58.57. To put this in perspective, the repurchase equates to $1.24, nearly 70% of the $1.81 adjusted EPS change. In addition, we have repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares so far in Q4 for $112 million at an average stock price of $61.54. We are committed to prudent capital deployment, and we will continue to look for favorable opportunities to repurchase shares.\nOur net debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of September 30 was approximately 0.7x, our last 12 months adjusted EBITDA and approximately 1.4x our estimated 2022 base business EBITDA, well within our stated target of 1 to 2x. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was $1.3 billion, consisting of $1.2 billion in borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and approximately $100 million of cash on hand.\nWe had a fantastic quarter. We achieved strong metrics across the board, deployed capital and enhanced our overall leadership in our industry. I want to thank our entire team for their skill and dedication.\nTurning to Slide 12. We continue to believe it is important to assess our results using a base business methodology. This approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing commodity volatility. As a reminder, our base business definition assumes normalized margins and static commodity prices at $400 per thousand board feet. We are maintaining our full year guidance on our base business sales and adjusted EBITDA.\nTurning to Slide 13. I would like to discuss our full year base business and total company outlook as we enter the final months of 2022. We expect results to decelerate over the balance of the fourth quarter amid higher rates, normal seasonality, declining commodity prices and the cooling housing market. While we are seeing slower single-family starts, we expect our results through the end of the year to be supported by the substantial backlog of homes under construction. Our base business guide on net sales remains unchanged at 8% to 12% or $17.2 billion at the midpoint. Our base business EBITDA guide also remains unchanged. We continue to expect growth of 18% to 22% or $2.2 billion at the midpoint.\nGiven we have less than 2 months left in the year, today, we are also providing guidance for the full year 2022 including total net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. This will provide you with our anticipated full year total company performance. We expect full year total company net sales to be $22.5 billion to $23 billion or approximately 13% to 16% over our 2021 net sales of $19.9 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion or approximately 35% to 42% over our 2021 adjusted EBITDA of $3.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecast to be 18.5% to 19.5% or approximately 310 to 410 basis points over the 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%.\nWe now expect full year 2022 free cash flow of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, an increase from our prior range of $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion. The improved free cash flow forecast is based on our higher profit outlook on total results and the timing of commodity price fluctuations.\nOur 2022 outlook is based on several assumptions, which are outlined in the earnings release and presentation. Given inflation, higher mortgage rates and cancellation rates in the double digits, we expect full year single-family starts across our geographies to be down low double digits. We continue to expect multifamily starts to be up in the low double digits and R&R to be up in the low to mid-single digits. Regarding near-term demand, multifamily is gaining momentum and will improve diversification of our mix in coming quarters.\nCapEx guidance for 2022 is $275 million at the midpoint versus our prior estimate of $300 million due to continued supply chain delays. As we begin to close the books on 2022 and are in the midst of finalizing next year's budget, we thought it might be helpful to provide a reminder of our ability to weather a challenging operating environment.\nWe will provide our full 2023 demand outlook during our Q4 call in February. However, in the spirit of transparency and to give you a high-level sense of what our business is capable of, I'd like to provide you an illustrative example of single-family starts declining 20% to $800,000 next year from approximately $1 million in 2022. In that example, we believe we can sustain a double-digit EBITDA margin and deliver solid cash flow of over $1 billion, given our differentiated platform, consistent execution and disciplined operational management.\nWe are operating with a proactive mindset and have enhanced our already strong expense management processes to tightly control costs. Our premier positioning and robust operating platform have provided us with line of sight to more than $3 billion in free cash flow this year, a fortress balance sheet with no long-term debt maturities until 2030. And over $1.3 billion of liquidity to outperform into 2023 and beyond.\nWith that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for his closing remarks.\n\nDavid E. Flitman\n\nCEO, President & Director, BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter.\nI want to close by reiterating the underlying strengths of our business that will enable us to gain share in any environment. We are the market leader in a highly fragmented industry. We have a growing portfolio of value-added products and solutions that resonate with our customers, making us a partner of choice. We have a diversified revenue stream and are constantly optimizing our capacity and operations for long-term growth.\nWe are laser-focused on operational excellence, which adds to our competitive advantage. We take a disciplined approach to organic and inorganic growth with a long-term focus. We generate significant free cash flow which enables financial optionality in times of uncertainty, and we consistently generate solid returns while executing our long-term strategy.\nOur industry is clearly experiencing deceleration versus the prior year, but we are not discouraged. We are confident in our ability to navigate through any market environment and we will remain proactive in implementing our downturn playbook to streamline costs and stay close to our customers and supply partners. We will continue to execute through near-term market volatility while keeping our sights on our long-term goals, our core values and our operating principles as our guidepost. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we have a very strong, seasoned and highly experienced leadership team that has succeeded through many prior cycles and knows how to deliver compounded shareholder value over the long term.\nThank you again for joining us today. Todd, let's please open the call now for questions."

Neese\n\nSVP of IR, BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Katie. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me on the call are Dave Flitman, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will review our record second quarter results for 2022. The second quarter press release and investor presentation for today's call are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to several slides from the investor presentation during our call.\nThe results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS calculation excludes amortization of intangibles. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures were applicable and a discussion of why we believe they could be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation.\nOur remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results.

Flitman\n\nCEO, President & Director, BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We ended the first half of the year on strong footing, delivering robust results during the first quarter with that positive momentum continuing throughout the second quarter in which we achieved sales growth of 24% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 80% in the face of difficult comps in a challenging operating environment.\nThese outstanding achievements are a direct result of having strong alignment around the clear strategy and the focused execution against that strategy, driven by the hard work and dedication of our approximately 30,000 team members and their commitment to provide outstanding service to our customers.\nOn Slide 3, our strategic priorities continue to be: organically grow our value-added products and services, drive operational excellence, continue to build our high-performing culture and pursue strategic tuck-in acquisitions.\nOn Slide 4, we outline how we continue to execute against our strategic priorities this quarter. Specifically, we delivered record results in the quarter through expanding capacity, increasing value-added product sales and increasing productivity. We continue to leverage our BFS 1-TEAM operating system with a focus on cost containment to drive strong P&L leverage and bottom line performance.\nWe maintained our industry leadership by successfully navigating a challenging industry and macroeconomic environment. We strategically deployed capital toward accretive inorganic growth opportunities as highlighted by our most recent acquisition, HomCo. Through July, we have repurchased approximately $1 billion of the $2 billion share repurchase authorization, our Board approved in May.\nTurning to Slide 5. We continue to believe it is important to assess our results using a base business methodology to better appreciate the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing commodity volatility. As a reminder, our base business definition assumes static margins and commodity prices at $400 per thousand board feet. We are maintaining our full year guidance on our base business EBITDA of $2.2 billion, as Peter will discuss in a moment.\nTurning to Slide 6. As we outlined in our Investor Day last December, I want to reaffirm our expected performance by year-end 2025 given our assumption of average single-family starts growth in the low single digits through that time. We expect our base business to deliver a 10% top line CAGR and a 15% adjusted EBITDA CAGR.\nImportantly, this represents an average 50 basis point per year expansion in adjusted EBITDA margin for a total of 200 basis points of improvement by 2025 when compared to 2021. And as we deliver this performance, we expect to have between $7 billion and $10 billion of capital to deploy through 2025. That includes money for this year's planned capital investments in innovation and organic growth, along with potential additional M&A and share repurchases. We have already deployed a total of $2.8 billion of capital since we gave this guidance last December. And in the last 12 months, we have repurchased 25% of our shares outstanding.\nLooking at our record second quarter results on Slide 7 in more detail. We delivered strong core organic growth of 12%. Our single-family core organic growth was nearly 16%, again exceeding a single-family starts decline of approximately 3.4%.\nTough comps against 2021 results impacted year-over-year growth in our multifamily and R&R segments, leaving our year-over-year growth essentially flat. Core organic sales grew 12.2%, while value-added core organic sales grew by 32% compared to the prior year period. This highlights once again the strength of our strategy and that our team continues to execute it very well.\nOverall, we delivered record sales of nearly $7 billion in the second quarter and generated $1.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA with a record margin of 21.8%. These results were driven by solid demand for housing across our markets, ongoing productivity initiatives and pricing discipline in an improving but still supply-constrained environment.\nAs we turn to M&A on Slide 8, we remain focused on executing tuck-in M&A that delivers a high return. Over the past 1.5 years, we completed 10 acquisitions, reporting $1.6 billion of capital, aimed at building out our value-added customer offerings, investing in our digital transformation and further scaling our distribution network.\nIn July, we acquired HomCo, a lumber and hardware supplier in Flagstaff, Arizona, and are excited to welcome these new team members to the Builders FirstSource family. HomCo had net sales of approximately $44 million in 2021. This acquisition further demonstrates the fourth pillar of our strategy, M&A. Building upon the strong reputation and presence of tuck-in targets while leveraging our BFS 1-TEAM operating system to swiftly integrate these new businesses.\nWe have spent approximately $230 million on M&A so far this year and we expect to invest at least $500 million for the full year of 2022. We remain committed to allocating capital in a disciplined manner that drives long-term value creation for our shareholders.\nNow let's shift gears and cover our digital strategy on Slide 9. Our momentum on our digital transformation of the homebuilding industry is accelerating. Foundational initiatives such as standardizing our house plan intake and bid process continue to progress well. We completed agreements with two new customers for our configurable visualization tool. Collectively, Creative Homes of Minnesota and Snap ADU of California complete over 300 starts annually. And we now have customers responsible for more than 5,000 starts using paradigm visualizer.\nWe recently hit an important milestone in our technology development by successfully integrating the material takeoff, structural design and visualization models into one process. This means when selections are made in a lock specific model, such as choosing a siding type in color or expanding from a two to a three car garage is reflected in the material list in real time. Pricing of the base house and options can be made available in the visualization experience and reflected in the material list.\nOur three dimensional models also provide the basis for offering Building Information Modeling, or BIM services to our customers, allowing them to gain project efficiencies by resolving construction conflicts in the digital world, instead of at the job site. This important capability strikes at the heart of the efficiency gains we believe our platform will bring to the homebuilding industry.\nAlso, we have ongoing BIM pilots with one large national builder and two custom builders. Our pilot with Front Light Building Company in South Carolina is highlighted on their company website and will help you understand how our technologies and services are helping homebuilders today.\nTurning to productivity. We delivered $40 million in savings in the second quarter and we continue to expect to exceed $100 million in savings for the full year 2022 by driving improvement projects and leveraging our BFS 1-TEAM operating system. Over the long term, we are targeting 3% to 5% of annual productivity improvement as our teams work together to leverage best practices and technology, allowing us to become faster and more efficient at serving our customers. We are accelerating our efforts in this important area to ensure we not only hit our financial targets, but to also make sure our industry-leading platform is as efficient as possible.\nIncreasingly, we are being asked what's different about BFS today versus 15 years ago during the last housing downturn. On Slide 10, we would like to point out that the company has seen a dramatic increase in scale and share, and BFS is now more than 12x larger and 60x more profitable than it was during the last downturn.\nWe are a leaner, more efficient, consolidated company. This increased scale has enabled the company to remove more than $400 million of annual run rate cost through several large combinations, including the integrations of ProBuild and stock building supply as well as our merger with BMC.\nWe are operating as a consolidated platform, not as a decentralized organization, providing better visibility, alignment and greater efficiency than other players in our space. We've improved processes and reduced costs to more efficiently serve our distribution network of more than 560 locations. We optimized our footprint by closing 120 locations and repurposing numerous other facilities.\nSince 2006, we have increased our value-added components and no-work facilities to over 200. That's nearly 6x. We have grown our manufacturing capabilities as we have invested in high-speed door lines trust automation and robotics, which have improved our variable cost to serve and reduced our dependency on skilled labor.\nA good example of this would be our recent announcement of our 2-year partnership with Household Design on the development and recent startup of our first fully robotic for trust manufacturing line at our Villa Rica, Georgia facility. We have also contracted for an additional 8 fully robotic lines including 4 roof trust lines.\nWe have improved our expense structure, making approximately 70% of our SG&A variable. We have leveraged the size and scale of our business through strategic direct and indirect spend, enabling BFS to more efficiently serve our customers. And we have dramatically improved our cash generation, capital structure and leverage, providing us with significant financial flexibility.\nWhile we have seen strong demand through July that weighed near-term results, we fully recognize the current industry dynamics that are beginning to play out. We've heard from our customers that demand is slowing due to higher mortgage rates and overall affordability concerns. We remain confident that no matter what market conditions we face, we will remain nimble and balance any short-term dislocation, positioning BFS for long-term success and accelerating our market leadership.\nTurning to Slide 11. In the scenario of a highly challenged market where housing starts are down more than 20%, we have several levers to pull to drive outperformance, including effectively managing costs through our variable expense structure to flex expenses with demand, optimizing capacity and further streamlining our footprint, reducing discretionary spend accelerating productivity projects, taking appropriate headcount actions and moderating capital expenditures. Our industry-leading platform led by our strong and experienced team is generating exceptional results, which we believe positions us well for any market environment, anchored by the strength of our balance sheet with no debt maturities until 2030.\nWe're committed to investing to capture growth organically and through tuck-in M&A. Although there will certainly be some challenges over the near term, we remain very optimistic on the prospects for our industry over the long term. I am highly confident in our ability to outperform the market in any scenario. And given our bulletproof balance sheet, expect us to lean in opportunistically on M&A in a more challenged market.\nSo to sum up, we will continue to execute our strategy gain share and deliver value to our shareholders in any environment. Our people are the building blocks of our company and our my inspiration that come to work every day to continue the evolution and growth of our world-class company. I want to recognize Brent Goodwin, an exceptional team member who for the past 4 years, has worked as an inventory control analyst at our Raleigh, North Carolina Yard and Millwork facility.\nRaleigh has been one of the strongest housing markets in the country for quite some time with more than 60 families moving there each day. For the past several years, rents contributions are a key reason why our Raleigh Millwork facility has become the go-to supplier for homebuilders in this burgeoning market.\nBeginning in late Q3 2021, Brent's location began experiencing shortages across multiple millwork product categories. Over the past 2 years, Brent has been relentless in developing creative solutions to help augment inventory, keeping our stock levels consistent to ensure minimal delays for customers. What makes Brent's work all the more impressive is the fact that he's been able to do it all while during first a demolition and then an expansion of this location's main storage warehouse. I want to thank Brent for his many contributions in helping keeping Raleigh's builders on track amid tight supply constraints and strong homebuyer demand. We are fortunate to have Brent on our team.\nAnd I again want to thank all of our team members for their continued tremendous work and focus in satisfying the needs of our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our financial results for the second quarter.\n\nPeter M. Jackson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We are excited to continue our exceptional track record of financial performance. We navigated through a complex supply and demand environment to produce record second quarter net sales, gross margin, net income and adjusted EBITDA.\nI am also pleased to report that we have again demonstrated our ability to deliver strong cash flow results by generating approximately $900 million in free cash flow this quarter. Our accomplishments have come through disciplined operational management and solid execution of our strategic priorities. At the same time, we further strengthened our balance sheet by extending debt maturities and returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders through buybacks.\nI will cover 3 topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our Q2 results Second, I'll update you on our capital deployment efforts. And finally, I will touch on our updated guidance for full year 2022.\nLet's begin with our Q2 performance on Slides 12 and 13. We had net sales of $6.9 billion for the quarter, which increased approximately 24% compared to the prior year period. Core organic sales in the value-added products category grew by 32% highlighting our work to meet the demand across our customer channels. Although we continue to face supply chain constraints in the quarter, we are pleased to report that we are seeing signs of those constraints loosening and lead times starting to return to normal.\nGross profit was $2.4 billion, a 52% increase compared to the prior year quarter. The gross margin increased 640 basis points to 34.8%, primarily driven by increased sales in our value-added product categories and disciplined pricing in a volatile supply-constrained marketplace. SG&A increased 15.9% to $1 billion, driven primarily by four items. Acquisitions represented over 40% of the increase. Incentive compensation represented nearly 40% of the increase due to higher net sales and profitability. Investments in strategic initiatives, such as IT, productivity and our digital strategy represented another 10% of the increase, and fuel-related expenses contributed 10% of the increase in overall SG&A.\nAdjusting for commodity inflation, expenses were 40 basis points better than the prior year, even after funding our strategic investments and absorbing inflation in several P&L categories. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A decreased by 110 basis points to 15.1%.\nClearly, our team understands the importance of controlling expenses and has been doing an excellent job. Adjusted EBITDA increased 80% to $1.5 billion, primarily driven by poor organic growth, commodity inflation and acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 21.8%, which increased 680 basis points compared to the prior year period.\nAdjusted net income was $1.1 billion or $6.26 of adjusted earnings per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of $574 million or $2.76 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the prior year period. The 86.9% increase in adjusted net income was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher income taxes and to SG&A expense.\nNow let's turn to cash flow on Slide 14. Our second quarter cash provided by operating activities was $947 million, and cash used in investing activities was $258 million. We generated free cash flow of approximately $900 million, primarily driven by core organic growth in sales and commodity inflation.\nMoving to capital deployment. This year, we have spent approximately $230 million on our M&A transactions, including our most recent purchase of HomCo in July. In the second quarter, we repurchased 16.9 million shares for $991 million at an average stock price of $58.7. In addition, we've repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares in July for $270 million at an average stock price of $61.18. Year-to-date through July, we have repurchased over $1.5 billion of stock.\nSince August of 2021, we have repurchased approximately 52.3 million shares of stock at an average price of $62.95 for $3.3 billion. This represents the repurchase of approximately 25% of our total shares outstanding since August of 2021. We are committed to balanced capital deployment, and we will continue to look for favorable opportunities to repurchase shares considering market dynamics and our ongoing commitment to maximize long-term value creation.\nOur net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 0.8x our LTM adjusted EBITDA. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. Our total liquidity was $1 billion, consisting of $838 million in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility, and $166 million of cash on hand. We are pleased with our first half '22 performance, and I want to thank our entire team for their tremendous execution and dedicated efforts despite the dynamic environment and tough year-over-year comparisons.\nAs we look to the back half of 2022, I would like to provide you with our full year outlook on Slide 15. Given inflation, higher interest rates for mortgages and cancellation rates in the mid-teens, we now expect full year single-family starts across our geographies to be down mid-single digits. We expect multifamily starts to be up in the low double digits and R&R projected to be up in the low to mid-single digits.\nAs a result, we are lowering our base business guide on net sales from 10% to 14% to 8% to 12% or $17.2 billion at the midpoint. Our EBITDA guide remains unchanged, and we continue to expect growth of 18% to 22% or $2.2 billion at the mid as our outperformance in the first half will be largely offset by market weakness as we move further into the back half of the year.\nWe will continue to provide you with a commodity price sensitivity chart in our investor presentation on Slide 16 to allow you to incorporate your own commodity estimates into your models. CapEx guidance for the year is down to approximately $300 million in 2022 due to continued supply chain delays. Building on the approximately $40 million in productivity savings achieved during the quarter, we expect to deliver over $100 million in total productivity savings this year as we continue to drive improvements across our operations.\nWe now expect free cash flow at the midpoint to increase from $2.2 billion to $2.75 billion, reflecting higher-than-expected commodity prices and increased profitability. Our projected free cash flow assumes average commodity prices in the range of $700 to $1,000 for the full year as prices decelerate through year-end. In conclusion, our efficient operating platform has provided us with line of sight to nearly $3 billion in free cash flow, a fortress balance sheet with no long-term debt maturities until 2030 and over $1 billion of liquidity. With that, let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.\n\nDavid E. Flitman\n\nCEO, President & Director, BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. Our industry is clearly experiencing pockets of deceleration. We've all seen mortgage rates rising single-family starts forecast coming down in the back half of this year and cancellation rates increasing. We are not deterred. Our company is a much different one today than it was in 2007, and we remain confident in our ability to effectively navigate the persistently unpredictable environment.\nWe are operating with our eyes wide open to any near-term macro turbulence while keeping our eye insights on our long-term goals, our core values and our operating principles as our guidepost. BFS is a company with fundamental strengths and clear competitive advantages and we are prepared to win in any environment. We remain leaders in a highly fragmented industry with the opportunity to be the acquirer of choice in the event of market dislocations, given our belief in the long-term industry growth trends.\nOur more than 560 facilities are in 47 of the top 50 MSAs with tremendous geographic customer and end market diversification. We have an extremely strong balance sheet, and we'll continue to execute our strategy and deliver strong free cash flows. And finally, this is a seasoned and highly experienced leadership team that has successfully navigated many prior cycles, and we will deliver compounded shareholder value over the long term.\nKatie, let's please open the call now for questions."

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMichael D. Neese\n\nSVP of IR, BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Priscilla. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Flitman, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will review our record first quarter results for 2022. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS calculation excludes amortization of intangibles. The first quarter press release and our investor presentation for today's call are available on our website at investors.bldr.com.\nThe results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and our presentation.\nOur remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid E. Flitman\n\nCEO, President & Director, BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 2021 was a phenomenal year for our company. We entered the first quarter of 2022 building on that strong momentum and delivered another quarter of record net sales, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA. We produced strong core organic sales growth of 15%, marking our fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth. Along with our strong start to the year, we continue to invest prudently in our operations and work hard to deliver outstanding service to our customers in the face of significant supply chain constraints that persist throughout our industry. The success we've achieved is directly attributable to all 28,000 of our hard-working and dedicated team members who go above and beyond every day to help us maintain our position as the industry leader.\nI'll cover 4 key topics on today's call. First, I'll provide a quick update on our base business and our record first quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on our acquisition success that continues to strengthen our premier market position, including our most recent tuck-in deals. Next, I'll provide an update on our digital strategy. And finally, I'll discuss our view of the current state of the housing market.\nOn Slide 3, I've highlighted this important point for several quarters and would like to share it again. As we discussed during our Investor Day last December, we believe it is important to assess our results using a base business methodology to better appreciate the underlying growth and profitability of our company by normalizing for commodity prices. As a reminder, our base business definition assumes static commodity prices at $400 per thousand board feet.\nTurning to Slide 4. Over the next 4 years, we expect our base business to deliver a 10% CAGR on the top line, a 15% adjusted EBITDA CAGR, and importantly, a 50 basis point per year improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin for a total of 200 basis points of improvement by 2025. And our expected full year 2022 base business performance is ahead of these targets. As a result of this performance, we expect to have $7 billion to $10 billion of capital to deploy through 2025. That includes this year's planned capital investments in innovation and organic growth, along with M&A and share repurchases.\nTurning to our first quarter results on Slide 5. We delivered strong core organic growth of 15%. Commodity price inflation added 13% and acquisitions added 8%. Our single family core organic growth was nearly 17%, once again exceeding the single-family starts growth, which was about 4%. And our single family core organic growth was double digits across all 3 of our operating divisions. Our multifamily and R&R segments each grew approximately 10%. Core organic sales in value-added products grew by 31% compared to the prior year period, and value-added products were the key growth driver across all customer segments, accounting for nearly 80% of our organic growth in the quarter. This is another strong data point that confirms our strategy is working.\nWe delivered record sales of nearly $6 billion in the first quarter and generated $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.6%. These exceptional results were driven by robust demand for housing, internal productivity and ongoing pricing discipline in a volatile, supply-constrained environment.\nLet's turn to M&A. We remain focused on executing tuck-in M&A that delivers a high return. As you can see on Slide 6, there are more than 1,000 potential opportunities with revenue less than $100 million clearly highlighting our future opportunity for growth.\nOn Slide 7, last year, we completed 7 acquisitions for $1.2 billion. This year, we expect to invest approximately $500 million in accretive M&A, and we're off to a great start. On April 1, we acquired Panel Truss, a multi-location provider of building components to single and multifamily markets with 7 locations throughout Texas, Georgia and South Carolina. The additional component capacity expands our value-added solutions offerings in several key high-growth markets. Panel Truss had approximately $138 million in sales last year.\nAlso on April 1, we acquired Valley Truss, a single-location provider of building components to single and multifamily markets in Boise, Idaho. Boise's active housing market is seeing an influx of national homebuilders rushing in to meet a rise in local demand, and we're excited to partner with builders to meet their ambitious goals. Valley Truss sales were approximately $26 million in 2021.\nI want to welcome the team members from Panel Truss and Valley Truss to the BFS family, and I look forward to providing future updates on how Builders FirstSource will continue to lead the way in consolidating our fragmented industry.\nNext, I'll provide a brief update on our digital strategy on Slide 8 as we continue to accelerate our pace of digital transformation. During our fourth quarter earnings call, I highlighted the deployment of Paradigm Estimate, which we continue to roll out across our operations to provide faster and more accurate customer quotes. Year-to-date, we have completed 2,000 estimates on customer plans across 9 states, and that adoption will continue to accelerate. In addition, this process provides a foundation for our configurable visualization technology and improved design and construction efficiency for homebuilders.\nRegarding our visualization technology, I'm pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement with Hayden Homes, a builder in the Pacific Northwest for the use of our Homebuilder Omni platform. With their plans of approximately 2,000 starts, Hayden Homes will become the largest builder currently using our digital solutions. We believe we are making the necessary investments to revolutionize our industry and that our digital strategy is on track to capture an incremental $1 billion growth opportunity by 2026.\nTurning to productivity. We expect to deliver over $100 million in productivity savings in 2022 by continuing to leverage our BFS 1-TEAM Operating System, which we've highlighted at our Investor Day in December. We're off to a strong start. As an example, our component manufacturing and efficiency metrics shows that our board feet produced per hour has improved by 19% versus the first quarter of last year as our teams work aggressively to maximize the throughput of our existing facilities to meet demand. Over the long term, we are targeting 3% to 5% of annual productivity improvement as our teams work together to leverage best practices and technology, allowing us to become more efficient and productive in serving our customers.\nLately, many industry headlines expressed uncertainty and concern. From what we have seen across the thousands of customers and homesites that we serve, I can affirm that this industry remains strong, underbuilt and resilient. I believe the homebuilding industry will continue to grow this year and that we will outperform our peers as our platform delivers for our customers and our shareholders. Despite persistent supply chain challenges and rising interest rates, we are not expecting a significant downturn in housing because we are far healthier and more prepared industry than the last time we saw a significant downturn.\nOur beliefs are supported by 3 key facts: first, the significant underbuilding of homes that has occurred over the last 12-plus years; next, the improvement in underlying demographic demand; and finally, the credit quality of that demand. We continue to believe that the U.S. housing market is significantly underbuilt. And while I acknowledge higher mortgage rates will likely represent a near-term headwind to satisfying that demand, we continue to see tremendous momentum and long-term growth for the industry.\nIn the first quarter, single-family homes under construction increased 27.5% versus the prior year to 789,000 units. As a result of this underlying demand and ongoing supply chain challenges, total units under construction hit 1.6 million in March. The last time this occurred was in the summer of 1973. Also, the cancellation rates have remained low at approximately 8% during the first quarter, essentially unchanged from last year, indicating customer demand remains durable.\nTurning to demographic growth. We see a clear favorable trend in the most populous age cohort of 25- to 34-year olds. This swell of young adults is moving into their early 30s, a time of life when many people start to buy their first homes or move from apartments to single-family homes, and we are seeing household formations reflect this demographic shift.\nAnd last month, according to the U.S. Census, the home vacancy survey revealed that all mature age cohorts younger than 50 years old posted year-over-year increases in homeownership, the first time this has occurred since 1994. This data indicates the overall financial strength and creditworthiness of today's buyers are far healthier and more resilient than in the last cycle as evidenced by the strong consumer balance sheets resulting from the trillions of dollars in COVID relief measures and the low 3.6% unemployment rate. So the homebuilding industry remains well positioned with significant tailwinds given the historic underbuilding, favorable demographics and consumers with strong finances.\nAs a company, we have a long track record of successful execution, gaining share and driving efficiencies through innovation for our customers. We significantly overachieved our BMC synergy commitments and are ramping up productivity and operational excellence across the entire organization. We will continue to focus our efforts on accelerating our growth in higher-margin value-added products and investing further in our digital solutions platform to advance our goal of transforming the homebuilding industry.\nFor 2022, we have increased our outlook and expect strong double-digit base business growth and significant free cash flow generation. We remain committed to deploying capital into high-return internal investments, accretive bolt-on M&A and share repurchases.\nI'd like to spend a couple of minutes highlighting Military Appreciation Month and its importance to Builders FirstSource. At BFS, we are honored to be a military-friendly employer and to be part of the journey for those who have served our country. One veteran we are particularly proud of is Rodney Hatch, who served as a marine and is now a safety coordinator for multiple locations across our Alabama and Mississippi geographies. Rodney honors and celebrates those who have greatly served our country by creating veteran walls at our locations showcasing those who are now growing their careers with BFS. His spirit of community doesn't stop with his coworkers.\nRodney gives back to local neighborhoods by maintaining blessing boxes and honor system food pantry where people in need can take food and necessities. And when Hurricane Ida hit the area last year, Rodney jumped into action, collecting donations from his fellow team members and delivering them to Louisiana himself. He does all of this on top of this vital role of keeping our people safe, a responsibility he excels at, day in and day out. His safety-first mindset and teachings have helped his 6 locations achieve 0 recordable injuries so far in 2022. People like Rodney are the reason we continue to see year-over-year reductions in our recordable incidents as part of our never-ending drive to 0.\nWe are fortunate to have Rodney on our team, and I thank him for his service for our country and the communities we serve. And I'm grateful to all of our veterans and each of our 28,000-plus team members who embody our core values, putting people first and showing our customers why BFS is the most valuable partner in our industry.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Peter to go through a detailed look at our Q1 results and provide an update on our improved 2022 financial guidance.\n\nPeter M. Jackson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I would also like to take a moment and thank each one of our team members who delivered an incredible first quarter of 2022.\nWe are very pleased with our remarkable first quarter results. We remain committed to a balanced approach to capital deployment through 2022 and beyond as we leverage our strong cash flow to make accretive investments in our operations and add great businesses to the BFS family, all while executing against our share repurchase authorizations.\nI will cover 3 topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our Q1 results. Second, I'll update you on our capital deployment efforts. And finally, I'll provide you with our updated guidance for the full year 2022.\nLet's begin with our Q1 performance on Slide 10. We had net sales of $5.7 billion for the quarter, which increased approximately 36% compared to the prior year period. Core organic sales in the value-added products grew by an estimated 30.8%, underlining our work to meet the strong demand across our value-added channels and the continued supply chain constraints. Our focus on value-added products continues to strengthen our appeal to customers looking to improve efficiency on the job site.\nGross profit was $1.8 billion, a 71% increase compared to the prior year quarter. The gross margin percentage increased 670 basis points to 32.3%, primarily driven by disciplined pricing in a volatile, supply-constrained marketplace as well as effective and timely sourced. SG&A was $968.6 million, an increase of $147 million or 17.9% compared to the prior year period, driven primarily by acquisitions and variable compensation. Variable and incentive compensation increased due to core organic growth and improved profitability. We also made strategic investments in IT, productivity and digital initiatives.\nLastly, fuel-related expenses increased by $12 million or nearly 50% due to recent global events. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A decreased by 270 basis points to 17%. Adjusted EBITDA increased nearly 120% to $1 billion driven by strong demand across our key customer end markets, higher commodity prices and improved gross margins. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 17.6%, increasing 670 basis points compared to the prior year period as we continue to manage spending in a fast-growing environment. Net income in the quarter was $639.6 million or $3.56 per share compared to net income of $172.6 million or $0.83 per share in the same period a year ago. Adjusted net income was $700.8 million or $3.90 of adjusted EPS compared to the net income of $296.3 million or $1.42 of adjusted EPS in the prior year period. The 136.5% increase in adjusted net income was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher income taxes and SG&A expenses.\nNow let's turn to cash flow. Our first quarter cash provided by operating activities was $179.8 million, and cash used in investing activities was $48.3 million. We generated free cash flow of $131.5 million. I'll highlight the fact that we are cash flow-positive in Q1 for the first time. Historically, in the first half of the year, we are a net borrower as we make seasonal increases in working capital. This quarter's positive cash flow really highlights the strength of our market-leading platform.\nLet's turn to capital deployment. This year, we have spent approximately $180 million on our M&A transactions which closed in April. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares for roughly $286 million at an average stock price of $79.58. In addition, we repurchased approximately 4.3 million shares in April 2022 for $266.9 million at an average stock price of $62.21. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $552.9 million of stock. The number of shares repurchased was lower than the past 2 quarters primarily due to the timing of M&A and seasonal working capital needs. Since August 2021, we have repurchased approximately 35.3 million shares of stock at an average price of $65.10 for $2.3 billion. This represents almost 17% of our total shares outstanding in less than a year.\nI'm happy to announce that yesterday, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of $2 billion. When added to the $2.3 billion already repurchased, our authorization provides for $4.3 billion of total share repurchases. We remain committed to opportunistically repurchasing our stock and continuing to create value for our shareholders.\nAlso on Slide 11, our pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 0.9x our actual EBITDA. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2027. Our total liquidity was $1.2 billion, consisting of approximately $900 million in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and $282 million of cash on hand.\nWe are off to a great start this year. The team is driving higher-margin products, delivering value and efficiency to our customers, and our balance sheet remains rock solid.\nLet's shift gears and discuss updated '22 full year outlook on Slide 12. We continue to see strong underlying demand in new housing construction. We are maintaining our estimate of single-family starts growth across our geographies in the mid-single digits and R&R and multifamily growth in the low to mid-single digits. As we discussed last quarter, we are providing you with our base business guide on net sales and EBITDA as we believe this is a better measurement of our performance and assumes constant commodity costs at $400 per thousand board foot. We will continue to provide you with a commodity price sensitivity chart in our investor presentation to allow you to incorporate your own commodity estimates into your models.\nAs a result of our Q1 performance, we are increasing our 2022 base business sales growth guidance from 8% to 12% to 10% to 14% or $17.6 billion at the midpoint. We are also increasing our adjusted EBITDA growth guidance from 12% to 18% to 18% to 22% or $2.2 billion at the midpoint. Our CapEx forecast came down $20 million due to supply chain delays and is expected to be approximately $390 million in 2022. This year's CapEx will be focused on adding capacities to existing and establishing new value-added facilities to support growth initiatives that will create capacity for higher-margin products.\nWe delivered $55 million in cost synergies to the P&L in the first quarter, fully recognizing the synergy commitments of the BMC merger. In addition, we expect to deliver over $100 million in productivity savings this year as we continue to drive improvements across our operations. We expect to generate free cash flow of $2 billion to $2.4 billion in 2022, reflecting higher commodity prices, disciplined working capital management and our ability to capitalize on our industry-leading product portfolio. This is an increase of $400 million from last quarter's free cash flow guide. Our projected free cash flow assumes average commodity prices in the range of $700 to $1,000 for the full year. We still anticipate working capital coming down due to lower commodity prices in the back half of 2022.\nOn Slide 13, we provide the sensitivity chart I mentioned, providing an illustrative way to think about our total sales and total adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2022 at various static commodity price points. We believe 2022 will be another strong year of growth. We continue to focus on growing value-added products, driving operational excellence across the company and delivering innovative technology to our customers.\nWith that, let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.\n\nDavid E. Flitman\n\nCEO, President & Director, BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. In summary, the homebuilding industry remains resilient and underbuilt, and we believe it will continue to grow in 2022 and beyond. Our momentum is strong. Our industry-leading platform is generating exceptional results, which we expect to continue in the second quarter, the remainder of this year and beyond.

Neese\n\nSVP of IR, BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Britney. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. With our Dave Flitman, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. .\nToday, review our record fourth quarter and full year results for 2021. We have provided results that include BMC in the fourth quarter of 2021 and stand-alone BFS in the fourth quarter of 2020. We've also provided pro forma results as if we own BMC in the fourth quarter of 2020. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS calculation excludes amortization of intangibles.

I would encourage you to visit our Investor Day slides and commentary on our IR website at bldr.com.\nThe results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

Flitman\n\nCEO, President & Director, BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 2021 was a phenomenal year for our company. We achieved 4 straight quarters of double-digit core organic growth, delivering above-market performance and record results. I want to thank our more than 28,000 team members for an incredible year. I'm extremely proud of their (inaudible) despite the many supply chains and strong demand that is impacting our industry. .\nI'll cover 3 key topics on today's call, which speaks to the strength of our business and the strategy that is enabling us to excel as a leader in our space: first, I'll provide an update on our record full year results, including our base business and our view of the current state of the housing market. Peter will discuss our fourth quarter results in his remarks; second, I'll provide an update on our tuck-in acquisitions that continue to strengthen our industry-leading market position; and finally, I'll provide an update on our digital strategy, which we laid out during our Investor Day in December.\nAs you know, we are the nation's leading supplier of structural building and value-added products and services, primarily to the residential construction market. We are a consolidator in our industry with arguably the best balance sheet of anyone in the space. We have a long track record of successful execution, combined with a very strong value proposition a highly differentiated platform and an unwavering commitment to customer-focused solutions. We are now 14 months in the combining BFS and DMC with plenty of low-hanging fruit remaining for us to continue to harvest as we look to accelerate growth, capture synergies and drive new productivity.\nBefore I review our full year results, I would like an important slide from our Investor Day. As we discussed during that event, we believe it is important to assess our results on a base business basis, to better appreciate the underlying growth and profitability of our company by normalizing commodity prices.\nAs you can see on Slide 3, over the next 4 years, we expect our base business to deliver a 10% CAGR on the top line, a 15% adjusted EBITDA CAGR and importantly, a 50 basis points per year improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin for a total of 200 basis points by 2025.\nGiven the strength of our cash flow and the leverage target that we laid out last year between 1x and 2x adjusted base business EBITDA, we expect to have $7 billion to $10 billion of capital to deploy through 2025. And we will put that capital to work through continued investments in innovation and organic growth, accretive tuck-in M&A and returning capital to shareholders as evidenced by the recent announcement of our third $1 billion share repurchase program in the 11 months.\nTurning to Slide 4. On a pro forma basis, we delivered an impressive single-family core organic growth of approximately 28% in 2021, meaningfully exceeding the single-family starts growth of 13.6%. We produced record sales of nearly $20 billion to deliver $3.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA and a record adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%.\nAs you can see on Slide 5, our base business is strong as we grew sales by 26% and to $15.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA by an outstanding 63%, while our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 250 basis points to 11.2%. Our momentum carried through the fourth quarter in which we delivered $4.6 billion of revenue and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.1% on the strength of robust demand for housing, pricing discipline and our continued focus on serving our customers with our value-added offerings.\nLast month, we attended the International Builder Show in (inaudible) Based on our conversations with many customers and suppliers, we believe demand for single-family housing will remain strong headed into the spring homebuilding season. Whereas from these anecdotal conversations but more importantly, by the double-digit top line increases that we have seen in our results so far this year. The number of single-family homes under construction increased 27% in 2021 versus 2020.\nOne fact I'd like to remind you of is that there are more single-family homes under construction across the country than there have been in more than 14 years, and the homebuilder backlog is currently at the highest level it's been in the last 15 years. Backlogs, in fact, were an estimated 145,000 single-family units authorized but not yet started as of last month, up 32% year-over-year, an encouraging sign of continued demand strength.\nOn Slide 6, you will see that we also remain focused on executing our strategy of investing in inorganic growth. We have completed 7 acquisitions for [$1 billion] since we closed on the BMC merger. And we believe we can invest at least $500 million each year in accretive M&A to augment our organic growth strategy. And as such, we will remain a disciplined consolidator in our industry for many years to come as we continue to focus on expanding in attractive high-growth markets and product categories.\nOn December 31, we closed on our most recent acquisition of National Lumber, the largest independent building material supplier in New England. National Lumber operated 16 facilities and employs more than 700 people across Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island with a diverse mix of products and end markets. This then adds to our value-added portfolio and provides a favorable R&R mix in the New England area we previously did not have a presence. I'd like to welcome the National Lumber team members to the Builders FirstSource family.\nNow let me provide an update on our digital strategy on Slide 7. As a reminder, during our Investor Day, we provided in-depth (inaudible) paradigm in how they (inaudible) digital strategy. Our teams are working with our customers to pilot our technology, aiming to improve the preconstruction process, create more accurate material lists, bring our supply partners into a digital workflow to better engage home buyers.\nWe are actively pursuing service to advance our digital transformation. Among them, continue to deploy paradigm estimate across more markets to accelerate quotations. And we are working on a specific pilot with a customer in South Carolina to improve our understanding of how to connect the homebuilders' front-end sales process, utilizing paradigm visualization technology to enable a full ban execution model and enhanced homebuilding efficiency. We are making investments and executing projects that we believe will put us at the center of the homebuilding ecosystem. Concepts may be basic relative to other industries, they simply do not yet exist at scale in residential homebuilding. We believe we're on a path to revolutionize our industry for the benefit of our customers. And to us, this represents an incremental $1 billion growth opportunity over the next 5 years.\nNext, on Slide 8, I'm pleased to announce that we delivered $32 million in BMC merger-related cost synergies during the fourth quarter for a total of $108 million for the full year 2021. I can also announce we achieved a synergy run rate of $160 million as we exited 2021, well in excess of our $130 million to $150 million commitment at the announcement of the merger. And we capture those synergies 2 years faster than what we initially projected. I couldn't be more pleased with the outcome of our merger integration.\nWith our merger-related synergy capture now officially completed, we have turned our attention to ramping up our internal productivity efforts. In 2022, we expect to capture total P&L productivity and synergy savings of $150 million, and we'll provide updates on our progress as the year proceeds.\nI believe great companies and we are one, drive productivity on an ongoing basis and reinvest a portion of those savings to fuel future growth. We unveiled our BFS One Team operating system at our Investor Day. And the best way to think about that is continuous improvement in 3 key areas of our business. The first 2 are building people in excellence. And as we do those 2 well, we will deliver the third, which is driving growth.\nLong term, we are targeting 3% to 5% of the annual productivity improvement through our BFS One Team operating system. Looking at our progress as a combined company, we are clearly leveraging the strength of our industry-leading product portfolio, national network and disciplined operating model alongside the robust demand environment to deliver exceptional growth, profitability and free cash flow. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities to invest both organically and with M&A while returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases.\nWith a thoughtful and disciplined approach to deploying our capital, we are transforming the homebuilding industry through our investments in digital, expanding value-added offerings for our customers and making strategic acquisitions that bolster and extend our industry leadership position.\nFor 2022, we expect a continued strong execution by our team, combined with our diverse portfolio of value-added offerings will enable us to deliver double-digit net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth in our base business. Our team members continue to impress me at every turn from the sales forward to the yard and everywhere in between.\nTheir commitment to excellence is what keeps this company moving forward, and I'd love to highlight their collective and individual progress. For example, along to Christian, the delivery manager at our Williamsburg, Virginia lumber location, is his team started at 5 a.m. to ensure that Builders FirstSource trucks are the first out every morning to maximizing our customers each day. Not only does this give us a strategic advantage, but it shows our customers that BFS will be there for them when they need it, especially if they confront supply chain and labor challenges. With along those leadership, the yard runs efficiently and safely with no recordable injuries over the past 5 years, coupled with remarkably low expenses and team member turnover.\nIn total, we've made great progress in keeping our people safe. And last year, we delivered an 18% in recordable injuries across the company, meeting our 10% reduction target, and we have another 10% improvement targeted for this year. It's a journey that never ends, and we're getting better, but we're not going to stop. Our goal is 0.\nI'm grateful to team member (inaudible) embody our core values, putting people first and showing our customers why BFS is the most valuable partner in the industry.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Peter to go through a detailed look at our Q4 results and provide an update on our new share repurchase program and our 2022 updated financial guidance.\n\nPeter M. Jackson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Builders FirstSource, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I want to add my thanks to our team members for delivering an outstanding and record 2021. We wouldn't have been able to deliver such fantastic results without your hard work, your dedication and your focus on our customers. I will cover 3 talks with you this morning. First, I'll review our fourth quarter results compared to combined pro forma results from the prior year quarter, and save you on our capital deployment. And third, I'll provide you with our updated guidance for the full year 2022.\nLet's begin with our Q4 performance on Slide 9. We had net sales of $4.6 billion for the quarter, which increased approximately 24% compared to the combined pro forma prior year period. Value-added core organic sales grew by an estimated 28%, highlighting our work to meet the strong demand across our value-added channels, especially impressive given the continued supply chain constraints. Despite the price volume, commodity price inflation benefited net sales by 5% and acquisitions contributed another 7%.\nGross profit was $1.50, an increase of 52% compared with the combined pro forma prior year period. Gross margin increased 610 basis points to 32.1%, driven mainly by cost increases, coupled with disciplined pricing as well as effective and timely sourcing in a volatile supply-constrained marketplace. For the full year, our gross margin increased 360 basis points to 29.4%.\nFollowing this recent performance and our increase of value-added products, we believe our normalized gross margins will now be approximately (inaudible) to 18.6%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 110% to $93.4 million driven by solid demand across our key customer end markets combined with disciplined pricing on increasing costs. Adjusted margin improved to 17.1%, which increased 700 basis points compared to the year-over-year pro forma period.\nFor the quarter, net income was $442.5 million or $2.31 per share compared to combined pro forma net income of $200.7 million or $0.96 per share in the same period a year ago. Adjusted net income was $532.4 million or $2.78 of adjusted EPS. This compares to a combined pro forma adjusted net income of $225.5 million or $1.08 of adjusted EPS in the prior year period. The 136.1% increase in adjusted net income was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher income tax and SG&A expense. The 157.4% increase in adjusted EPS is driven by the increase in adjusted net income, coupled with our reduced share count, which I'll cover in a moment.\nNow let's turn to cash flow. Our fourth quarter operating cash flow was approximately $840 million, driven by increased net sales and the impact of inflation free cash flow was $774 million during the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 12, for 2021. Our full year free cash was an inflow of $1 billion, primarily driven by the impact of commodity inflation and core organic growth. The free cash flow for 2021 was a bit lower than our forecasted guide as a result of higher-than-expected sales driving an increase in year-end working capital due in large part to rising commodity prices late in the year.\nLet's turn to our capital. For the full year 2021, our M&A bolt-on strategy resulted in our purchasing 7 companies for approximately $1.2 billion. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately (inaudible) shares of BFS common stock at an average price of $70.89 for a total cost of approximately $1.2 billion. Since the inception of our share repurchase in August of 2021, and we have repurchased $30.6 million of common stock at an aggregate cost of $2 billion (inaudible) for an average price of $65.40 per share. That's more than 15 (inaudible) per shares outstanding while maintaining a rock-solid balance sheet.\nWe have completed the share repurchase programs authorized in August and November of 2021 in February 2022, support and authorized another $1 billion share repurchase program. As we mentioned during Investor Day, we plan to deploy $5 billion to $7 billion of capital by 2025. Of the $3 billion of share repurchase authorizations announced to date $2 billion counts towards our target. We accelerated $700 million of the second $1 billion authorization at the end of 2021 and finish the remaining $300 million in January.\nAs you may have seen, last month, we completed a private offering of $300 million of our 2032 notes and issue price equal to 100.5% of par value. Net proceeds from (inaudible) used to repay borrowing 2026 ABL facility. In addition, the company amended the 2026 facility to (inaudible) commitments by an aggregate amount of $400 million, resulting in a new $1.8 billion amended credit facility.\nAlso on Slide 12, our pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.7x our base business EBITDA. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2027, and our total liquidity was over $700 million as of year-end, consisting of about $686 million in net borrowing availability and $43 million of cash. Our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results were tremendous. The merger of BFS and BMC has gone better than expected. The combined field sales team is driving higher-margin products and delivering value to our customers. And our balance sheet is (inaudible)\nLet's change gears and discuss our 2022 full year outlook on Slide 13. We continue to see strong underlying demand in new housing construction. We are estimating single-family start geographies in the middle single digit, R&R and multifamily growth in the low to mid-single digits. Going forward, we are going to provide you with our base business guide on net sales and EBITDA as we believe this is a better measurement of our performance and assumes constant commodity costs at $400 per thousand. We'll continue to provide you with a commodity price sensitivity chart to allow you to incorporate your own commodity estimates into your models.\nWe expect base business net sales to grow approximately 8% to 12% over 2021 net sales of $15.7 billion. We expect base business adjusted EBITDA to grow 12% to 18% over 2021 adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 billion. The growth in these consistent with the long-term plan we communicated at our December 7 Investor Day. CapEx is projected to be approximately $400 million in 2022. The increase from prior year is due to adding capacity in several of our facilities, largely related to value-added growth initiatives that will drive higher margin results.\nIn 2022, we expect it will contribute another $150 million to EBITDA, of which $50 million will come from the realization of EMC synergies. We believe free cash flow will be in the range of $1.6 billion to $2 billion, assuming an average commodity price in the range of $600 to $1,000 for the year. This assumes working capital coming down due to lower commodity prices in the back half of 2022.\nOn Slide 14, we provide the sensitivity charge I mentioned, providing a way to think about our total sales and total adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2022 had various static commodity price points. (inaudible) know that our base business outlook is the same under any of these commodity assumptions. While we are not providing explicit guidance for total sales and total adjusted EBITDA, we believe this table is helpful in understanding the relationship between expected base commodity performance and total results under commodity assumptions. We believe 2022 will be another strong year of growing our value-added products and profitability, outperforming the market, introducing innovative technology and driving operational excellence across our geographic footprint. I'm proud of our 2021 performance and excited for what is in store for 2022.\nWith that, let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.\n\nDavid E. Flitman\n\nCEO, President & Director, BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. In summary, the homebuilding industry is resilient, underbuilt and we believe will continue to grow in 2022. As a result of the hard work of our team members every day, our company's momentum remains strong. We are leveraging our industry-leading platform to grow and sustain our profitability, and we'll continue to benefit from our robust record free cash flow generation. We are poised to transform the homebuilding industry through our investments in value-added products and services and expanding our digital offers. Our M&A pipeline remains strong and attractive, and we have the balance sheet to continue to execute on this important pillar of our strategy. We will remain disciplined in doing so. .\nWe are committed to a balanced approach to capital deployment and our most recent $1 billion share repurchase authorization is another indication of this commitment. We have a very clear and simple business strategy that our team is fully committed to implementing, and I've never been more excited about our potential and our future.\nWhitney, let's please open the call for questions."

My name is Tina, and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Stephanie Rabe. Stephanie, you may begin.\n\nStephanie M. Rabe\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\n[Audio Gap]\nOn Slide 2, you will see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you'll hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website at www.ir.ameriprise.com.\nSome statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our third quarter 2025 earnings release, our 2024 annual report to shareholders and our 2024 10-K report. We make no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.\nOn Slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the third quarter. Below that, you'll see our adjusted operating results, followed by operating results excluding unlocking, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. We completed our annual unlocking in the third quarter. Many of the comments that management makes on today's call will focus on adjusted operating results and adjusted operating results excluding unlocking.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.\n\nJames M. Cracchiolo\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. I'll begin with my perspective on the business, and Walter will follow with more detail on our third quarter metrics and financials. As you saw in our release, Ameriprise delivered another strong quarter and generated significant value as we built on our performance from the first half of the year.\nRegarding the operating environment, clearly, it remains fluid. We've continued to see strong bull markets, but investors still have many variables to navigate. Inflation remains elevated. In terms of interest rates, the Fed announced yesterday that they cut rates by another 0.25 point. Meanwhile, there are signs of softening in the labor market, along with lingering questions around tariffs and ongoing geopolitical impacts. And our business continues to demonstrate both its relevance and resilience in that regard. In a dynamic landscape, Ameriprise consistently generates strong results driven by a diversified business and disciplined management, And our third quarter financials, excluding unlocking, reflect this momentum.\nAssets under management, administration and advisement grew to a new high of $1.7 trillion, up 8% year-over-year. We continue to deliver strong earnings and also generated double-digit EPS growth of 12%. And our firm-wide margin of 27% is exceptionally strong as we continue to invest significantly in the business.\nI would also highlight that the Ameriprise ROE is best-in-class year after year and one of the highest in financial services at nearly 53%. In fact, Ameriprise is well positioned even if the environment becomes more challenging. Our complementary mix of revenue streams, effective expense management and strong margins help enable us to sustain strong financial performance.\nRegarding the overall business, we're driving nice progress across many areas. Our advisers are leveraging our proven advice value proposition and generating high client value, satisfaction and practice growth. Overall, we had continued strong AWM client asset growth, up 11%. Wrap assets were also up nicely, up 14% year-over-year. And our adviser count is up and adviser productivity continues to be very strong, increasing another 10%. And we're back to strong recruiting levels, bringing in 90 experienced advisers in the quarter, one of our best. The Ameriprise value proposition, as well as the strength and stability of the firm, continue to differentiate us in the recruiting space, and our pipeline in the fourth quarter is strong.\nAcross the business, we're leveraging our investments to further elevate our value proposition and drive long-term economic returns. In September, we launched a new [ advertising ] that reinforces our premium brand and helps create strong awareness among our target market. And we continue to invest in advanced capabilities that empower our advisers to further engage clients and deepen relationships.\nOur digital and AI investments are creating strong experiences and streamlining workflows. In fact, we're seeing record digital adoption from our clients, and our mobile app satisfaction hit an all-time high in the quarter. And our advice insights [ to the ] next-generation capability that uses big data and machine learning to create client-centric insights to drive engagement save time and support business growth.\nWe're also investing to enhance our comprehensive solution suite, both to broaden our offering and position the business for sustainable growth. Over the summer and into the fall, we've been working closely with advisers to integrate new capabilities. As an example, the launch of our Signature Wealth platform has proven to be quite successful. It's early, but it's already helping advisers attract new assets and manage client portfolios more efficiently, and it has great potential.\nAt the bank, we recently launched HELOCs and also began a soft launch of our checking accounts, with a full rollout plan for later this year. These solutions add to our suite of savings and lending products, including CDs, mortgages, pledged lending and credit cards. They also help to enhance our client experience and deepen relationships. We're also growing our [ AFG ] business, partnering with banks and credit unions who can benefit from our sophisticated wealth management solutions and adviser support tailored to institutional clients. And we continue to add new financial institutions to have a strong pipeline into the year-end in 2026.\nAt RPS, performance remains strong, driven by demand for annuities and insurance solutions that align with our clients' financial planning goals. We're seeing solid interest in variable universal life, structured annuities, and variable annuities without living benefits, highlighting the relevance of our offering in today's market. We're also pursuing growth in our disability insurance business, including streamlining it with approval process for clients applying for life insurance. In addition, we're using data analytics in our digital insurance underwriting. And I'll reinforce that we built one of the most profitable insurance businesses in the industry.\nIn Asset Management, we continue to make good progress as well as enhancements to the business. Our investment performance remains strong over all time periods. Over 65% of our funds outperformed the median on an asset-weighted basis for 1-year period, more than 70% for the 3- and 5-year periods and over 80% for the 10-year. And we maintain a good asset base, with assets under management and administration up to $714 billion.\nIn addition, net outflows improved across the board from last quarter as redemption slowed in both retail and institutional, and we had an increase in retail growth sales, particularly in North America. As I shared, we're investing and adding to our solutions in high-demand areas where we differentiate our capabilities. We're also using data and analytics to better target and segment advisers, and we're gaining traction with SMAs and models as well as our alt business and active ETFs in the U.S. In addition, we'll soon be launching our active ETF capability in the U.K. and Europe.\nRegarding institutional, we also had an improvement in flows in the quarter. Looking forward, we'll continue to manage expenses effectively in asset management with the ability to generate good margins and profitability. And that applies across Ameriprise as we continue to drive transformation and operational efficiency.\nWhat's clear, our disciplined approach delivers results, and that's evident in our strong margins. And our digital transformation is not only enhancing the client adviser experience, it is also reducing cost and positioning us for sustainable growth. We're also enhancing our global operating platform for asset management. A recent example is the announcement of our expanded partnership with State Street, establishing a unified global back office for many Columbia Threadneedle funds. These initiatives further strengthen profitability and our ability to reinvest in innovation and growth.\nAs you know, we manage the business with rigor and consistency. Ameriprise consistently delivers profitable growth, robust free cash flow and a strong return. In fact, the return on capital remains exceptional, supported by healthy dividends and robust share repurchases. That includes a capital return in the quarter that we increased to $842 million. Our financial strength and stability enables us to reinvest strategically and act opportunistically.\nWe believe that what also sets Ameriprise apart are our relationships and consistent recognition we earn to how we operate. Core to our success is how our clients feel. We consistently earn top client satisfaction and continues to be exception of 4.9 out of 5, and our advisers are also very engaged in being selected for top awards. In fact, we had 20 Ameriprise advisers on the Barron's Top 100 Independent Financial Advisers list for 2025. Also key, our employee engagement consistently best-in-class across industries as confirmed by our latest internal survey results received in the third quarter.\nAnd J.D. Power once again recognized Ameriprise with their Outstanding Customer Service certification for our phone support for the seventh consecutive year for advisers and the second year for clients, which is tremendous. In addition, Forbes named Ameriprise as one of America's Best Companies. Newsweek honored us as one of America's Most Responsible Companies. Fortune listed Ameriprise among America's Most Innovative Companies. And I also highlight that Newsweek recently ranked us as one of America's Greatest Companies.\nIn closing, I feel very good about Ameriprise and the totality of the firm. Earlier this month, we officially marked 20 years of independence and our listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Over the last 2 decades, Ameriprise has built an exceptional track record for achieving high client satisfaction and industry-leading results, guided by our proven strategy and management principles. And that includes generating the #1 total shareholder return within the S&P 500 Financials Index since our spin-off in 2005.\nAs I look ahead, Ameriprise is well positioned and represents attractive value at these levels, regardless of market momentum. With that, I'll turn it over to Walter for his perspective, and then we'll take your questions.\n\nWalter S. Berman\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered another quarter of solid performance, underpinned by exceptional balance sheet strength. Our focus on sustainable profitable growth continues to serve us well in delivering consistently strong financial results and client satisfaction, demonstrated by adjusted operating EPS, excluding unlocking, up 12% to $9.92 with a strong margin of 27% across the firm. Adjusted operating net revenues, excluding unlocking, increased 6% to $4.6 billion, driven by asset growth. Expense discipline remains strong from our ongoing firm-wide transformation initiatives.\nIn the quarter, G&A expenses improved 3%. It was another solid quarter driven by the sustained benefit from the leverage within our integrated business model. Our stable 90% free cash flow generation across our segments, combined with the foundation of strong balance sheet and enterprise risk management capabilities, enabled us to increase our capital return to 87% of operating earnings in the quarter. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders at a differentiated pace and are targeting an 85% payout ratio for the fourth quarter based upon our share price and substantial free cash flow.\nOn Slide 6, you'll see EPS growth of 12%, demonstrating the strength and leverage across our businesses. Assets under management, administration and advisement increased 8% to a record high of $1.7 trillion. We delivered strong [ termwide ] margins from 6% revenue growth while reducing G&A expenses by 3%. On a full year basis, we are targeting a G&A decline of 3%. We continue to generate a best-in-class return on equity of 53%.\nLet's turn to Slide 7. Underlying performance metrics and wealth management remains strong across all measures. Client assets grew nicely to a record $1.1 trillion, with $29 billion of flows over the past year. Wrap assets were up 14% to $650 billion, with wrap flows of $30 billion over the past year. In the quarter, client and wrap flows were impacted by the departure of 2 large adviser teams. Excluding those departures, client flows were solid at $6.5 billion, and wrap flows were $8 billion when also adjusted for an administrative change. The flows from our legacy adviser and client base have been consistent.\nIn addition, transactional activity levels remain strong, near-record levels reflecting the full scope of our planning model. Cash sweep balances were stable at $27.1 billion compared to $27.4 billion in the prior quarter. We are also seeing strong momentum in our experienced adviser recruiting, with 90 advisers joining Ameriprise this quarter. Our value proposition is resonating with advisers, and we remain focused on ensuring our transition packages are attractive to experienced advisers that share our values and commitment to the client experience. And more importantly, adviser productivity grew 10% to a new high of $1.1 million.\nLet's turn to Wealth Management financial results on Slide 8. Adjusted operating net revenues increased 9% to $3 billion. The core business is performing very well. Our fee-based and transactional revenues were quite strong, increasing in the low-teen percentage range, benefiting from higher client assets and activity levels. Our cash revenues, which include net investment income, distribution fees related to off-balance sheet cash and banking and deposit interest expense, were impacted by the Fed funds rate reduction over the past year and declined in the mid-single-digit range, as you would expect. Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter increased 10%. In the quarter, distribution expenses increased 11%. I would note that adviser compensation within distribution expenses increased in line with the revenues advisers generate.\nG&A expenses increased 5% to $439 million in the quarter, primarily driven by volume and growth-related expenses, including investments in Signature Wealth and banking products. Expenses remain well managed for the full year. We continue to expect low to mid-single-digit growth in G&A. Pretax adjusted operating earnings increased 7% to $881 million. We saw continued strong contributions from both core and cash earnings in the quarter. Our core earnings grew in the high teen percentage range, benefiting from higher asset levels, strong transactional activity and well-controlled G&A. The strong level of core earnings that we generate is unique and demonstrates our focus on profitable growth.\nCash earnings had a mid-single-digit percentage decline, as expected from rates. Our strategy of leveraging Ameriprise Bank has been important in minimizing the impact from Fed funds effective rate reductions on our AWM business. In fact, net investment income in the bank was flat this quarter. We continue to take actions to build the bank investment portfolio in a way that supports stable earnings contributions going forward. The overall bank portfolio has a yield of 4.6% with a 3.7-year duration. In the quarter, new purchases at the bank were nearly $700 million at a yield of 5.3% with a 4.4-year duration. Last, our margins remained excellent at 29.5%.\nTurning to Asset Management on Slide 9. Financial results were solid in the quarter. Operating earnings increased 6% to $260 million. The strong quarter reflected equity market appreciation and the positive impact from expense management actions, partially offset by the impact of net outflows. Total assets under management and advisement increased to $714 billion, up both year-over-year and sequentially from higher ending market levels. Net outflows significantly improved on a sequential basis to $3.4 billion, with improvement in both retail and institutional. Retail flows benefited from higher gross sales, which included a nice win in model delivery.\nInstitutional flows benefited primarily from lower redemptions in both the U.S. and EMEA. Revenues increased 3% to $906 million with a stable fee rate at 46 basis points. G&A expenses increased 1%. For the full year, we expect mid-single-digit G&A expense decline, excluding performance fees. Margin reached 42% in the quarter, which is above our target range, driven by favorable markets and continued expense discipline.\nLet's turn to Slide 10. Retirement & Protection Solutions continued to deliver strong earnings and free cash flow generation, reflecting the higher quality of the businesses that was built over a long period of time. Pretax adjusted operating earnings, excluding unlocking in the quarter, were $200 million, in line with our expectations. The strong and consistent performance of the business reflects the benefit from strong interest earnings and higher equity markets. Overall, Retirement & Protection Solutions sales were solid at $1.4 billion, with a continued demand for structured variable annuities. These high-quality books of business continue to generate strong free cash flow with excellent risk-adjusted returns and continue to be an important contributor to the diversified business model.\nThe company completed its annual actuarial assumption update in the quarter, which resulted in an unfavorable after-tax impact of $5 million. In Retirement & Protection Solutions, there was a favorable insurance model change, which was partially offset by unfavorable changes to variable annuity surrender and utilization assumptions. In long-term care, there was an immaterial impact from changes to morbidity and mortality assumptions. Overall, LTC policyholder behavior is in line with expectations.\nBefore we move to the balance sheet, I'd like to take a moment to address the Corporate segment. The pretax operating loss, excluding unlocking, was $93 million, which was a significant improvement from a year ago due to lower severance and cloud migration expense as well as favorable share-based compensation expense.\nTurning to balance sheet on Slide 11. Balance sheet fundamentals and free cash flow generation remains strong. We have an excellent excess capital position of $2.2 billion. We have $2.5 billion of available liquidity, and our investment portfolio is diversified and high quality. We have diversified source of dividends from all our businesses, enabled by strong underlying fundamentals. This supports our ability to consistent return capital to shareholders and invest for future business growth. Ameriprise's consistent capital return strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently generate strong long-term shareholder value.\nIn summary, on Slide 12, Ameriprise delivered solid results in the third quarter, which is a continuation of our long track record navigating various market environments over the longer term. Over the last 12 months, revenues grew 7%, adjusted EPS increased 12%, return on equity grew 210 basis points and we returned $3.1 billion of capital to shareholders. We had similar growth trends over the past 5 years, with 9% compounded annual revenue growth, 18% compounded annual EPS growth, return on equity improving 17 percentage points, and we returned $13 billion of capital to shareholders. These trends are consistent over the long term as well. This differentiated performance across multiple cycles speaks to the complementary nature of our business mix as well as our consistent focus on profitable growth and maintaining our strong values as a company.\nWith that, we'll take your questions."

    "content": "Q2 2025 AMP Ltd Earnings Call\n\nQ2 2025 AMP Ltd Earnings Call\n\nAMPASXAUG 6, 9:00 PM\n\nOperator\n\nGood day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to AMP Half Year 2025 Results. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chief Executive Officer, Alexis George. Please go ahead.\n\nAlexis Ann George\n\nDeputy CEO, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited\n\nYes. Thank you very much, and I'm very glad to have you all join us so soon after our Investor Day to deliver our first half '25 results.\nBefore commencing today, let me acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of the land on which we're holding this meeting, which for us, of course, is the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, and I'd like to pay my respects to the Elders past and present. Of course, with me today, I also have our CFO, Blair Vernon, who will talk later.\nSo if we just go through the order of proceedings for today, I'll firstly just do a quick overview of the first half '25, and then Blair will deep dive into our financial results, including in each of our business operating units. And then we'll do a focus particularly on cost, capital, our guidance for the remainder of the year before we give a quick wrap-up on what our priorities will be for the second half.\nSo as we come to the first half '24 highlights, I think about this as a continuation of just delivering on our promises every single time. The group NPAT is up over 9% to $131 million as we continue to drive cash flows in our wealth businesses while remaining focused on efficiency and removing those stranded costs from the transactions we've undertaken. Controllable costs continue to decrease. And I'll remind you, at the same time as doing this, we're absorbing inflation of over 3%.\nEPS is improving and has improved 18% in the half, both positively impacted by the operating performances of the businesses, but also by the share buyback through the capital return. And today, we announced an interim dividend as promised of $0.02 per share franked 20%.\nOn top of the financial results, we've also launched Lifetime solutions across our Master Fund options, launched AMP Bank GO and continue to prudently manage loan growth for margin, not volume. So let's just quickly reflect on the portfolio AMP has today.\nBy now, I'm sure you're all familiar with our operating units, the Platforms, Super and Investments, where we spent a lot of time a couple of weeks ago deep diving into the way we're driving those businesses. Of course, we also have AMP Bank, which consists of our Heritage as well as our new AMP Bank GO digital offering and the New Zealand Wealth Management business.\nWe still do have exposure to a number of partnerships that continue to deliver both growth and dividends. If I look at our China assets, the payout ratios on dividends have increased for both our CLPC and our CLAMP offering. And you may recall that we've been talking about this for some time. The businesses grow, but we wanted to focus on increasing dividends.\nAnd CLPC increased from 30% to 35% payout and CLAMP paid a special and almost commenced dividends this period of 40%. We expect dividends will continue, but maybe not at that higher level. And of course, PCCP continues to deliver in line with its actual performance.\nSo let's just go a bit deeper on each of the business units and the execution through the first half before we get into the numbers. In Platforms, we went into detail on Investor Day, but I think it's important to remember that we do continue to innovate in retirement. We're not just talking about it. We're actually executing on it and we're now working on the next phases of those innovations.\nWe are growing fast in managed portfolios, but we have a robust process around management of that. We're driving AI to improve adviser efficiency and we're really focusing on that sales capability and I was pleased to announce the new appointments just a couple of weeks ago.\nIn S&I, our Lifetime solutions is now being delivered for 140,000 customers and is growing. Returns, service, reputation are all at strong levels. We've launched Digital Advice and we continue to add new modules to that every single quarter to ensure that we can meet our customers' needs and help drive that financial well-being. And in the next few days, we'll be delivering Citro, our rewards program to members in the AMP business.\nIn New Zealand Wealth Management, it'd be fair to say that it's a very difficult economy in which they're operating. However, our diversified income through Advice, KiwiSaver and General Insurance does provide us some protection across the income base. And our bank is focused and continues to be focused on margin over volume whilst looking for those niche opportunities such as the self-employed area.\nWe also launched our 10-year interest-only to support the proposition about AMP being an expert in retirement. And of course, we just recently introduced our new broker interface to streamline processes and I've been very pleased to see the feedback from brokers that we've been receiving.\nAnd on top of that work, we launched AMP GO on time, on budget, our new digital offering to both individual and mini businesses. And just to reflect on what we've done over the last 6 months, I want to remind you back in November '23, we said we would launch this in the first quarter of '25, and we did that.\nIn February, we introduced personal and mini business transaction accounts. In April, we were first to bring Qantas Frequent Flyer to transaction account balances. In June, a simple business overdraft, in July, savings accounts for both personal and businesses and we also brought in Live Pay for businesses. And over the rest of the year, we'll introduce joint accounts, further developments for overdrafts and term deposits.\nI think this demonstrates that we can execute when we put our minds to things. And on top of that, AMP GO has really helped facilitate the cultural change that we're bringing across AMP.\nSo on that note, Blair, please let us go to the financials.\n\nBlair Robert Vernon\n\nCFO & Group Executive of Transformation\n\nThanks, Lex, and good morning, everyone. As Lex has outlined, underlying NPAT for 1H '25 is up over 9% to $131 million in the half. Total revenue increased to $632 million for the half. And importantly, our controllable costs fell by over 4% to $303 million for the half, delivering an EBIT improvement of some 14% over 1H '24.\nEarnings per share increased over 18% off the back of these improved metrics. And similarly, cost to income improved almost 3% to 59.4% in the half on the basis of our measurement. ROE also improved at a group level to 7.4%. Statutory profit is down slightly half-on-half at $98 million.\nBreaking out the details of underlying and stat profit, we did absorb an increase in litigation and remediation-related costs during 1H '25, reflecting the further mobilization of our response to class actions.\nSecondly, our business simplification program continues as planned with $21 million of post-tax expense in the half, broadly consistent with our prior periods and within our anticipated total envelope of spend across this program of up to $150 million pretax. Following on from our Q2 cash flow announcement on July 21, our 1H '25 AUM reconciliation shows the positive improvements across all 3 Wealth Management businesses.\nPlatforms AUM up over 11% in the half to $83.2 billion, with margin holding steady at 43 basis points. Superannuation and Investments AUM grew over 8% to close the half at $58.5 billion, including a return to positive cash flow in Q2, as previously discussed. Margin for the half was just marginally down at 62 basis points.\nIn New Zealand, AUM increased by 9.6% to $12.2 billion, driven predominantly by market movements with some modest margin compression, albeit from a structurally higher start point in New Zealand compared to our Australian businesses.\nLooking at the overall group reporting units now at a high level. Platforms NPAT increases to $58 million for the half, up 7.4% off the back of significant AUM growth. Superannuation and Investments NPAT is flat in 1H '25 compared to the prior corresponding period.\nAMP Bank NPAT of $36 million is a modest improvement, reflecting our careful management of volume and margin. New Zealand NPAT is up almost 12% in the period to $19 million, a solid result built off diversified revenue streams. Finally, our group reporting unit improved to a loss of $16 million for the half as we continue to remove stranded costs as planned.\nNow looking at the business units in a little more detail. Platforms AUM revenue was up slightly to $172 million for the half, with other revenue and investment income stable half-on-half. Costs overall are slightly down, reflecting savings from our continued corporate center cost-out initiatives, creating an envelope to continue our ongoing investment in the North business.\nNorth Guarantee continued a positive contribution in 1H '25 and our managed portfolio growth continues to be another highlight, as Lex mentioned, up 14% in the half to $21.8 billion. Margin for the half at 43 basis points is consistent with guidance. And while down compared to 1H '24, pleasingly, it is flat when compared to our closing margin of 43 basis points for FY '24.\nLooking at Platforms margin in more detail, where the flat margin compared to 2H '24 is evident in the bar graph on the slide and the mix between admin and other fees also remains broadly stable. The composition of Platform AUM has only changed marginally in 1H '25 in terms of the mix between managed portfolios and AMP managed funds products on the platform. However, pleasingly, the mix of AUM that generates investment-related fees remained steady at 56% of total AUM on the platform.\nPlatform cash flows were discussed extensively at our recent Investor Day, again, as Lex mentioned. However, I think it's worth reiterating a couple of key points. Net cash flows in 1H '25 continue a solid half-on-half outcome in line with our strategic intent. Similarly, the composition of advisers using North also continues to improve with 2,213 advisers now having AUM of greater than $1 million on the platform, up 25% in the half.\nPleasingly, the cash flow performance from those advisers continues to improve through 1H '25 relative to lower volume advisers as shown in the bar chart on the bottom right of the slide.\nIn our Superannuation and Investments business, NPAT for the half was flat at $34 million. AUM-based revenue was up over 4% to $175 million in the half, a combination of improved average AUM, offset by slightly lower margin when compared to 1H '24. Other revenue and investment income is down compared to 1H '24. This is mostly a function of positive one-offs experienced in the 1H '24 period not repeating this half.\nControllable costs fell slightly in the half. However, variable costs were up in the period, tracking the rise in AUM. Notably, [ IME ] remained steady at 15 basis points. Net cash flows continue to improve, reflecting a range of positive actions from the management team, including a top quartile investment return for our diversified options in the financial year ending 30 June 2025.\nMargin across the S&I business is down slightly at 62 basis points in 1H '25, which predominantly reflects the impact of fixed member fees and fee caps and the outworking of market movements positively impacting individual member balances. We are actively reviewing the construct of fees across the S&I product range to ensure we are positioned to manage margin dynamics as we look into FY '26.\nOur guidance of margins at circa 63 basis points for the year remains, given the subtlety of these mix and volume characteristics, albeit this will remain a critical focus for us in 2H '25 as we continue to target growth in this key business. That growth is best shown in the improvement in cash flows half-on-half with a significant improvement seen in 1H '25 as profiled at our recent Investor Day.\nOur clear focus on member retention is paying dividends and our renewed investment in this business to deliver new features and benefits to members will see further enhancements rolled out in the coming half, as Lex mentioned earlier.\nNPAT for AMP Bank is up slightly in the half to $36 million, mostly influenced by positive growth in income, offset by some cost increases. NIM grew 2 basis points when compared to 1H '24. Our mortgage book grew below system, reflecting our disciplined approach to the volume margin trade-off in the asset side of our business.\nDeposits also fell slightly, again, reflecting our granular approach to margin and volume management. Variable and controllable costs collectively grew by $5 million pretax in the half. This is entirely as a result of absorbing the initial operating and resource costs from the go-live of AMP Bank GO, which accounted for an aggregate of $6 million pretax in the half. Return on capital was up 40 basis points in the half, reflecting our improved operating metrics in the bank.\nBriefly turning to net interest margin, which improved more significantly when comparing to 2H '24 with a total 6 basis point improvement. Roughly half of that improvement emerged in the lending book, mainly as an outworking of fixed to variable rollovers. On the funding side of our book, margin improvement was weighted towards our retail deposit business as we carefully manage term deposit maturities in particular.\nIn line with our strategy, 1H '25 saw the continued growth of investor loans as compared to owner-occupier with a relatively stable mix of interest-only compared to P&I loans. Arrears increased modestly in 1H '25 compared to the December metrics, reflecting the ongoing mortgage pressure that a small number of our clients are experiencing. This remains an area of key management focus, albeit our existing weighted average LVR metrics, as shown on the slide, suggests most clients have significant headroom in their facilities. Equally, bad debts and loan impairment expenses both continue to be negligible relative to our book size.\nTurning to New Zealand, which delivered another strong result with profit up almost 12% in the half. Controllable costs remained flat compared to 1H '24 and continues the trend of our New Zealand business absorbing significant inflation in that local market over many years.\nNet cash flows, excluding pension payments were up in the half as is average AUM. This represents a positive outcome when considering the difficult market conditions in New Zealand, where unemployment has now risen to 5.2% and KiwiSaver hardship withdrawals are up 26% across the market. NPAT underlying in our group unit improved 20% to a reported loss of $16 million.\nOur partnerships in China delivered a strong result, up 35% on 1H '24 at $27 million. Conversely, our other partnerships reduced by $7 million, predominantly as a result of property valuations in the PCCP fund and FX movements. Collectively, this saw the partnerships contribution to our results steady half-on-half at $37 million.\nOther revenue fell to $4 million in the half, which reflects the reduced contribution from the residual advice assets that were not part of the sale perimeter in our advice transaction, which we announced at this time last year. Interest expense on corporate debt is broadly steady half-on-half as a result of average debt balance and interest rate mix being higher overall. As previously noted, controllable costs at a group level continue to fall as we harvest stranded costs in line with our guidance.\nAs I just mentioned, our joint venture partnerships in China continue to make a growing contribution to the overall group. China Life Pension Company with an equity accounted carrying value of $525 million in 1H '25 is the larger of these 2 joint ventures and has achieved a preeminent position in the pension market in China.\nThis has built off its market-leading position in the Pillar 2 enterprise annuity segment and now its rapidly growing success in the recently launched Pillar 3 or individual segment. AUM was up 21% in FY '24 to the equivalent of AUD 441 billion, which underscores the scale opportunity in the Chinese pension market.\nDividends from CLPC in FY '24 have increased with a 35% payout ratio, reflecting the continued success of CLPC. China Life AMP Asset Management Company with a carrying value of $103 million at the half also enjoyed significant AUM growth in FY '24, up 27% to the equivalent of AUD 89 billion. Pleasingly, as Lex mentioned, the first significant dividend was paid from CLAMP in 2024, representing a 40% payout ratio of distributable net profit.\nNow turning to costs. Controllable costs in 1H '25 at $303 million represents a 4.4% reduction in absolute terms, having absorbed continued inflation pressure across most of our expense lines. Employment costs experienced that inflationary pressure more significantly. And in addition, the resourcing of AMP Bank GO also contributed $2 million to the increase in this line.\nFY '24 employment costs in total also had some timing differences, which contribute to the historically better H1 to H2 performance in prior years of our reporting. We expect that to be neutralized this year and this also contributes to some noise on those half-on-half comparisons.\nAlso noteworthy is our continued shift to a better mix of permanent staff compared to consultants, which makes for a mix change across employee costs compared to professional services.\nPleasingly, we saw continued reduction across the rest of our expense categories, which demonstrates the discipline and rigor of our cost improvement initiatives. Technology cost saves continue and also include the continued acceleration of our investment in AI to further future-proof our technology and digital capability.\nNow to capital. Following on from our restatement of capital and liquidity in FY '24, we summarize on this slide our 1H '25 capital position. Group CET1 surplus capital has increased to $211 million, benefiting from statutory profit in the half of a net $98 million, offset by the FY '24 final dividend and net business activity.\nBusiness activity in the half absorbed $39 million of capital. However, this was offset by the realization of $40 million of net deferred tax assets, delivering the virtually flat net business activity impact in the half.\nThe 1H '25 interim dividend announced today will naturally reduce the surplus capital by a further $51 million as we enter 2H '25. Group cash remains slightly higher than our target level, but this is expected to trend down in coming periods as we continue to optimize the group liquidity position.\nFinally, updating our FY '25 guidance, subject to market conditions as usual. We maintain our guidance on margins of circa 43 basis points for Platforms and circa 63 basis points for Superannuation and Investments as we look at the full year. In contrast, we revised slightly our FY '25 NIM for AMP Bank, which we now expect to be broadly in line with the 1H '25 result at circa 1.3%.\nControllable costs are expected to be $600 million, in line with our market commitment and guidance. This will include the initial AMP Bank GO operational costs, reflecting ongoing cost-out momentum in our underlying business.\nOur business simplification program continues to deliver results and is now expected to conclude slightly later than anticipated but remains within our guided investment envelope of $150 million pretax. This timing change reflects our careful approach to this program of work and ensuring that we get maximum value from every dollar spent. Our partnerships performance guidance remains unchanged.\nI'll now hand back to Lex.\n\nAlexis Ann George\n\nDeputy CEO, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited\n\nThank you. And so if we look forward to the second half, the priorities are consistent. We want to continue to drive that improvement quarter-on-quarter for our wealth flows by focusing on innovating in retirement, utilizing AI for advisers to improve their customer service, but also for our own efficiency and of course, improving retention in our S&I book.\nSecondly, we're focused on scaling AMP Bank GO while continuing to look for lending in those niche opportunities to improve the margin. We will deliver on the '25 cost promise and look to maintain CTI competitiveness through the years into the future. And fourthly, we want to continue to support the partnerships and look for the opportunity, as we've talked about, to exit the PCCP relationship in the future.\nSo I think when we look at AMP, we're delivering on our promises. We've returned the capital and that's starting to show in the EPS growth. We're delivering on our cost promises. We're not just talking, but we're delivering on innovation in retirement and we're delivering growth and really gaining momentum across our wealth businesses. I think we're at the point where we're in a strong position to really capitalize on the very hard work of many years.\nSo with that, thank you very much for listening today, and I'll pass over to you, Maggie, for questions."

My name is Desiree, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Stephanie Rabe. Stephanie, you may begin.\n\nStephanie M. Rabe\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\n[Audio Gap] Quarter Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. [Operator Instructions]\nTurning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website. On Slide 2, you will see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website at www.ir.ameriprise.com. Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance.\nThese forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our first quarter 2025 earnings release, our 2024 Annual Report to shareholders and our 2024 10-K report. We make no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. On Slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the first quarter. Below that, you see our adjusted operating results, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.\n\nJames M. Cracchiolo\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call. Overall, Ameriprise had a good start to the year. We're actively engaging our clients and delivering strong financial performance with contributions from across the business. I know that the current operating environment is top of mind for everyone. Clearly, we've seen elevated and ongoing market volatility due to the lack of clarity around the tariffs and general economic uncertainty. And we heard from Fed Chair Powell last week that the Fed is still trying to navigate what it all means for the economy inflation and interest rates. With that in mind, Ameriprise remains very well positioned. We know that we can navigate what's ahead because of our diversified business strong client value proposition and excellent record for managing economic uncertainty and market volatility.\nOur financial strength is another important differentiator. With the business growth in positive markets overall in the quarter, assets under management, administration and advisement grew nicely to $1.5 trillion. Our first quarter adjusted operating results were also good.\nTotal revenues increased 5% from a positive asset growth in flows and higher transactional activity. Earnings were up 8% from strong business growth and our ongoing expense discipline with EPS up 13%. And our return on equity ex AOCI remains best-in-class at 52%.\nIn terms of the business highlights in Wealth Management, our advice value proposition and the way we engage clients is very effective in helping them remain on track to achieve their goals and feel confident and even more so during increased dislocation, our clients have been strongly engaged in the quarter with assets up 7% to $1 trillion. We also had good inflows of $10.3 billion across our platform.\nMoney has gone to work in a number of product categories. Wrap activity was strong. Flows grew 34% to $8.7 billion, representing a 6% annualized flow rate in the quarter and total wrap assets grew to $573 billion, up 10%.\nTransactional activity was also robust, up 6% year-over-year, particularly in retail brokerage and financial planning and client cash levels remain high overall at $86 billion, which represents a nice opportunity for money to be put back to work.\nWe're working closely with advisers and directly with clients to provide highly relevant investment and market insights as well as important context when maintaining a long-term perspective. We had great client engagement, including record levels on our highly rated mobile app and secured site during the recent volatility.\nAnd we continue to invest in our advice value proposition and practice support. We have one of the best adviser platforms in the business and the way we engage and support advisers with our entirely integrated ecosystem. This includes our significant investment in our goal-based and investment advisory solutions.\nWe're adding an even more comprehensive way for clients and advisers to manage investments. It's a powerful new UMA called Signature Wealth that offers the best features of our advisory platform in a streamlined and innovative way. We're currently testing it and plan to launch it more broadly later this quarter. The tech environment that we've built has helped us achieve excellent availability important at any time, but particularly during volatility, our proprietary client advisory systems have performed extremely well with increased traffic. And we continue to innovate and use emerging technology to further enhance how we do business.\nIn fact, Ameriprise just earned the 2025 Technology Innovation Award from the Bank Insurance and Securities Association for our adviser practice tech platform. Practice Tech streamlines key practice actions into 1 integrated platform that makes operations much more efficient and effective. With the quality of our advisers and our consistent investments adviser practices continue to grow nicely.\nProductivity increased 12% in the quarter to approximately $1.1 million per adviser, reflecting our best-in-class capabilities and strong asset growth. We also had another good quarter for recruiting, with 82 experienced productive advisers joining Ameriprise based on our adviser value proposition, strong support and financial strength.\nI'm pleased to share that we continue to earn strong client satisfaction and adviser recognition. The Ameriprise client experience helped drive leading client engagement, and our clients continue to rate us 4.9 out of 5 for satisfaction. And Ameriprise recently earned Heart and Wallets top performer recognition in the client categories that understands me and shares my values and unbiased puts my interest first. And a large number of our advisers were recognized in the quarter in rankings like Forbes top 1200 wealth advisers, the best in-state women wealth advisers as well as the top 100 women wealth advisers less.\nWe also launched the next phase of our advertising in the quarter to further promote our highly effective advice value proposition and excellent client satisfaction. Our bank is another important capability for Ameriprise. In just the past few years, assets have grown to more than $24 billion. The bank is generating attractive earnings as we focus on deepening client relationships and bringing in assets held elsewhere.\nThe team has just launched our CDs and coming later this year, will add HELOCs and checking accounts to our offering. The bank made important contributions during the quarter minimizing the carryover impact from rate cuts. With the bank in our investment portfolio, we're able to generate sustained interest earnings even if the Fed decides to change rates. Overall, margin for Wealth Management remains strong at 29%.\nTurning to Retirement & Protection Solutions. The business continues to drive transactional activity within Wealth Management and generate strong earnings. In Annuities, we had significant growth in our traditional VA without living benefits, up 28% and had good sales in our structured products, and we continue to see strong sales in our Life business, where we're focused on VUL which is up 22% and disability products.\nI also reinforce that RPS consistently delivers strong earnings, profitability and free cash flow as part of our diversified business. We consistently generate one of the highest returns on equity in the industry, and RPS also provides important stability, which is particularly meaningful during periods of volatility. And in Asset Management, we continue to generate good earnings that reflect the actions we've taken, but it was a more challenging quarter for flows. For the quarter, assets under management and advisement was $657 billion.\nOverall, investment performance remains quite good even in a volatile environment. We delivered good performance across 1-, 3- and 10-year periods. In total, we have 101 Columbia Threadneedle 4- and 5-star Morningstar-rated funds. And we were just rated in the latest Barron's Best Fund Family rankings. Columbia Threadneedle was in the top 15 for all 3 time frames. 1, 5 and 10 years.\nRegarding flows, we had higher outflows of $18.3 billion in the quarter. Retail outflows were $5.8 billion, driven by higher redemptions. And institutional outflows of $11.5 billion were impacted by a large client repositioning into passive as well as the exit of the Lionstone business. In this climate, active management is even more important, and we believe in the benefits it can provide.\nIn terms of priorities, we're focused on ensuring that we're positioning strategies that are appropriate for the environment and help us go to flows.\nWe're also looking to build momentum in key product capabilities, including active ETFs, SMAs and model delivery. And the team has made excellent progress over the past 2 years, significantly transforming and improving our cost base while maintaining our fee rate. They've driven important operational efficiencies that combined have helped us expand margins. In fact, the margin in the quarter was extremely strong at 43%.\nAnd for Ameriprise overall, we continue to both invest in the business and manage expenses very well. As you saw, expenses across the firm were down 5% due to our transformation efforts.\nIn a difficult environment, like we've seen so far in the second quarter, I'd like to reinforce some important themes from the company's perspective. Our diversified business generates substantial free cash flow across market cycles. We maintain excellent liquidity with our cash flow, we're able to invest and return to shareholders at attractive levels. We have a strong excess capital position that also gives us the flexibility to be opportunistic and our disciplined and proven risk management is highly effective even during periods of increased volatility.\nIn terms of our capital return for the quarter, we continue to return strongly to shareholders, another $765 million to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. In fact, today, we announced an 8% increase in our dividend. This is the 21st dividend increase since our spinoff 2 years ago. And with that, our Board just approved a new sizable $4.5 billion share repurchase authorization given we are completing our current authorization early.\nFor the firm overall, it was a good start to the year. The high level of results that we consistently achieve is driven by the totality and strength of Ameriprise. And while it's a more volatile environment, we remain well positioned.\nFinally, the team and I are always proud of the accolades we earn in the marketplace. In addition to the awards I referenced, Ameriprise has just been recognized by Fortune as one of America's most innovative companies 2025.\nNow Walter will provide more detail on the quarter and then we'll take your questions. Walter?\n\nWalter S. Berman\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered continued solid performance with exceptional balance sheet strength, providing us flexibility to be opportunistic. Ameriprise had strong underlying performance across our diversified businesses particularly in light of the slowing equity market appreciation and the full impact of the Fed funds rate reduction since September with adjusted operating EPS increasing 13% and to $9.50 in the quarter. This result reflects positive flows and activity levels in Wealth Management the initial impact of proactive changes made to the bank's investment portfolio, including the reduction in floating rate exposure and the benefit to expenses from our transformation initiatives.\nAs we exit the quarter, our balance sheet fundamentals remain very strong, and we are well positioned to navigate potential volatility going forward.\nWe have an excellent excess capital position of $2.4 billion with $2.5 billion of available liquidity. The investment portfolio is diversified and highly rated. Our hedge programs continue to perform extremely well. And we have strong and consistent free cash flow generation across all segments.\nWe have a successful track record of navigating market cycles looking ahead at the potential for continued elevated volatility levels. We continue to be well positioned to navigate these scenarios with the flexibility to be opportunistic based on the diversity of our businesses, the quality of our earnings and margins and underlying balance sheet strength.\nOn Slide 6, you will see the strong EPS growth demonstrates the strength and leverage points within our business model. Assets under management, administration and advisement increased to $1.5 trillion, benefiting from strong net client flows over the past year and equity market appreciation, which more than offset the impact of outflows in asset management.\nWe delivered strong profitability with consolidated margins of 27%. Revenues grew 5%, reflecting slower equity market appreciation and impacts from lower Fed funds rates since September. At the same time, G&A expenses were down 5%. G&A expenses continue to be well managed and demonstrated our focus on operating efficiency and effectiveness while still making the right investments in areas that will drive future business growth.\nOur stable 90% free cash flow generation -- our segments combined with strong balance sheet fundamentals enabled us to return $765 million or 81% of operating earnings to shareholders in the quarter. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders at a differentiated pace and announced an 8% dividend increase and a new share repurchase authorization of $4.5 million through June 30, 2027.\nOn Slide 7, you see the strong mattress results from Wealth Management. Revenue per our Viser grew 12% to a new high of $1.1 million. This resulted from a 7% increase in client assets to $1 trillion with strong client flows of $10.3 billion. Wrap assets were up 10% to $573 billion from $8.7 billion of wrap flows in the quarter and $35.3 billion over the past year. In addition, transactional activity levels continue to improve.\nAWM cash balances declined 8% year-over-year to $40 billion. Bank balances increased in the quarter while certificates and off-balance sheet cash declined. We continue to take actions to build the bank investment portfolio in a way that supports stable earnings contributions going forward.\nThe overall bank portfolio has a yield of 4.6% and a 3.6-year duration. We reduced cash levels at the bank have further reduced our floating rate securities to only 15% of the securities portfolio, both of which have reduced our exposure to lower rates.\nWe also brought an additional $500 million of balances on to the bank's balance sheet. Those balances as well as portfolio maturities and prepayments were invested at a 5.5% yield and 4-year duration. And you're aware of the crediting rate changes on cash sweeps that were made early in the quarter. These factors all helped to offset the carryover impact from the Fed funds reduction since September and will support net investment income in the bank going forward.\nOn Slide 8, you see the strong financial results from Wealth Management. Pretax adjusted operating earnings increased 4% to $792 million with strong contribution from both core and cash activities. Core contributions continued a double-digit increase driven by good business fundamentals and equity market appreciation. Cash experienced a single-digit decrease primarily driven by Fed funds effective rate reduction since September. Adjusted operating net revenues increased 9% to $2.8 billion even with fewer fee and trading days. Revenue growth from higher line assets and increased transactional activity driven by adviser productivity more than offset lower spread revenues. Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter increased 11% with distribution expenses of 14%, reflecting our business mix and higher transactional activity.\nG&A expenses increased only 1% to $424 million in the quarter, reflecting strong expense discipline with continued growth investments and volume-related expenses due to business growth.\nMargins remained solid at 29%. The business is well positioned to navigate potential volatility going forward based upon continued strong adviser productivity the high-quality investment portfolio that will benefit from actions we've taken and continued disciplined expense management.\nTurning to Asset Management on Slide 9. Financial results were solid in the quarter. Operating earnings increased 17% to $241 million. This strong quarter reflected equity market appreciation and the positive impact from expense management actions partially offset by the cumulative impact of net outflows. Total assets under management and [indiscernible] decreased to $657 billion. Net outflows were elevated at $18.3 billion, reflecting institutional outflows from a large client repositioning into passive and the exit of Limestone. Revenues were at $846 million, down 1%, reflecting slower market appreciation, net outflows and fewer fee days. The fee rate was stable in the quarter.\nAdjusted operating expenses decreased 7%. G&A expenses improved 12% from a year ago, primarily driven by proactive transformation initiatives as well as lower performance fee compensation. These transformational initiatives will continue to benefit results and help to offset the impact of net outflows. Margins reached 43% in the quarter.\nLet's turn to Slide 10. Retirement and Protection Solutions continued to deliver strong earnings and free cash flow generation, reflecting the high quality of the business that was built over a long period of time. Pretax adjusted operating earnings in the quarter increased 8% to $215 million. The strong and consistent performance of the business reflects the benefit from stronger interest earnings and higher equity markets. These high-quality books of business continue to generate strong free cash flow with excellent risk-adjusted returns and continue to be an important contributor to the diversified business model. Overall, Retirement and Protection sales were strong at $1.2 billion, fueled by client demand for structured variable annuities and variable universal life products.\nIn the Corporate segment, I want to mention long-term care pretax adjusted operating earnings was $14 million. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 11. We Balance sheet fundamentals and free cash flow generation remained strong with $2.4 billion of excess capital, $2.5 billion of available liquidity and a diversified high-quality investment portfolio. We have diversified sources of dividends from all of our businesses enabled by strong underlying fundamentals. This supports our ability to consistently return capital to shareholders and invest for future business growth. Ameriprise's consistent capital return strategy drives long-term shareholder value.\nIn summary, on Slide 12, Ameriprise delivered excellent growth in this first quarter. which is a continuation of a long track record of outperforming our stated financial targets. Ameriprise has a proven track record of navigating through challenging market environments over the longer term. Over the last 12 months, revenues grew 10%. Adjusted EPS increased 16%, return on equity grew 280 basis points, and we returned $2.9 billion of capital to shareholders.\nWe had similar growth trends over the past 5 years with 8% compounded annual revenue growth, 15% compounded annual EPS growth, return on equity improving 13 percentage points and we returned over $12 billion of capital to shareholders. These trends are consistent over the long term as well.\nThis differentiated performance across multiple cycles speaks to the complementary nature of our business mix as well as our focus on profitable growth.\nWith that, we'll take your questions."

Welcome, and thank you for joining the Amplifon Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Francesca Rambaudi, Investor Relations and Sustainability Senior Director of Amplifon. Please go ahead, madam.\n\nFrancesca Rambaudi\n\nInvestor Relations Director\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Amplifon's conference call on Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Results. Before we start, a few logistic comments. Earlier today, we issued a press release related to our results, and this presentation is posted on our website in the Investors section. The call can be accessed also via webcast and dial-in details are on Amplifon's website as well as on the press release.\nI have to bring your attention to the disclaimer on Slide 2 as some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements.\nWith that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Amplifon's CEO, Enrico Vita.\n\nEnrico Vita\n\nCEO, MD & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Francesca. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. So let's begin with some comments on the year that just ended, which was more complex than we initially thought especially and once again because of the development of the European market. In fact, while we saw the U.S. market continue to grow strongly and in line with our expectations at circa 6%, Europe our core geography was definitely weaker than we initially expected mainly because of the negative performance of France. Q4 also was below expectations. We again estimate only flattish slightly positive demand not only for France, which was again negative, but also for the Spanish market, which contracted sharply in November, hence in the quarter due to the Dana storm.\nUnfortunately, it has been 3 years now that the European market has remained muted after the strong growth seen in 2021. And it is also in light of this and the anticipated growth of the French market that we expect a better 2025. But I will come back to this at the end of the presentation. In this overall context, also in 2024, we grew strongly around at 7% constant exchange rates. And I see this as an achievement considering our geographical mix, which is, as you know, still more skewed towards Europe, even if the U.S. grew exceptionally well in 2024. And in this regard, I would like to highlight another important achievement of last year. The United States has finally become our largest market.\nRegarding profitability, we had some dilution, making 2024 a year of significant investments to prepare us in the best way possible ahead of 2025 and beyond. I refer to the investment in audiologist capacity in France during the second half of the year ahead of the RAC 0 reform anniversary as well as the significant investment for the launch of the new TV campaign in Italy and Spain in Q4, which already had a positive effect on all our brand KPIs. Additionally, as you know, we are building scale in strategic markets such as the U.S. and China. This has a dilutive effect on margin in the short-term, but we are confident it will return higher profitability in the medium and long-term.\nIn fact, in China, as anticipated, we now can count on more than 500 stores, and we are also running fast in our direct store network in the U.S., where we now have around 400 stores. All in all, we are proceeding at full speed following our strategic priorities, and I'm optimistic that all these initiatives will yield medium- and long-term benefits. Finally, we propose a EUR 0.29 dividend maintaining last year's level.\nWith this, I now leave the floor to Gabriele, who will give you more details about our performance. Please, Gabriele.\n\nGabriele Galli\n\nExecutive of Financial Reporting & Corporate Accounting Information and CFO\n\nThanks, Enrico, and good afternoon, everybody. Moving to Slide #4, we have a look at our financial performance in full year '24. Revenues, as already commented by Enrico, reached another record level of EUR 2.41 billion, up 7% at constant FX versus '23, driven by a strong and above-market organic growth at 3.4% in a 2 speed market environment with Europe softer-than-expected and U.S. growing very healthily over a challenging comparison base of 8% organic growth in '23 versus '22. M&A contribution was a remarkable 3.6%, thanks to the acquisition of around 400 points of sales mainly in our core markets, France, Germany, the U.S. and China.\nThe FX impact was slightly negative for 0.4%, easing at the end compared to the first 9 months of the year due to the annualization of the Argentine peso sharp devaluation back in December 2023. EBITDA recurring amounted to EUR 568 million, up 4.8% versus full year '23, with margin at 23.6% compared to 24% in full year '23, due to the lower operating leverage in EMEA attributable to market softness, the dilution effect of the Miracle-Ear direct retail network accelerated growth in the United States as well as the strong investments we sustained during the year ahead of 2025.\nMoving to Slide #5. We have a look at the group financial performance in Q4, which posted a revenue growth of 8% at current exchange rates and 4.5% at constant exchange rates. The organic performance was slightly below 1% reflecting the following 3 main effects. First, the annualization of the strong devaluation of the peso carried out by the Argentinian government in December 2023, which inverted the negative impact on the exchange rate effect in the first 9 months to positive and the positive impact on revenue at constant FX and consequently on organic growth in the first 9 months to negative.\nSecond, the softer-than-expected European market. Third, the extremely challenging comparison base with organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 at a record of 9%. The bolt-on M&A acceleration contributed for 3.7% to the top line growth. FX was positive for 3.5% primarily due to the normalization of the strong devaluation of the Argentine peso. More in detail, being Argentina affected by hyperinflation, the group needs to apply the inflation accounting principle, adjusting local financial statements with a price index, and then translating the adjusted local financial statements into euro at December 31 exchange rate versus the usually applied average FX for the period.\nThe sharp devaluation executed in December '23 is now annualized. So the effect for the full year is offset, but it's pretty evident in Q4 when the FX effect is particularly positive, given that the last quarter of the year is calculated as the difference between the full year when the FX effect is slightly negative and the first 9 months of the year when the FX was strongly negative.\nAs a consequence, in Q4, reported sales accelerated with the FX effect reversing to positive with a negative impact on sales at constant FX and consequently, a negative impact on organic growth as well. EBITDA recurring came in at around EUR 155 million, in line with 2023, with margin at 23.4% compared to 25.3% in the previous year, primarily due to the lower operating leverage in EMEA attributable to a softer-than-expected European market, the significant marketing investment in Italy and Spain for the launch of the new advertising campaign and the strengthening of the audiologist capacity in France to prepare for 2025 expected market growth related to RAC 0 anniversary, as well as to the dilution effect due to the Miracle-Ear direct retail network accelerated growth with integration of the 100 points of sales acquired during the year.\nMoving to Slide 6. We have a look at EMEA performance. Revenue growth at constant FX was around 3% versus Q4 '23 with organic performance reflecting the flattish and softer-than-expected market environment, especially in France, the largest market in the region as well as a very soft market performance in Spain in November due to the strong DANA floods in November which also severely compromised operations in more than 50 of our stores.\nM&A contribution in France and Germany was 2.4%. EBITDA amounted to EUR 180 million with margin at 25.1% versus 28.4% in Q4 last year, primarily due to the lower operating leverage in a softer-than-expected market, the significant marketing investment in Italy and Spain for the launch of the new ADV campaign and the strengthening of the audiologist capacity in France to prepare for 2025 expected market growth. In the full year, revenue growth at constant FX was 3% with a positive organic growth in a flattish market environment and M&A contribution was at 2.1%. EBITDA amounted to EUR 417 million with margin at 27.2% versus 28.2% last year for the reasons just mentioned.\nMoving to Slide #7. We have a look at the excellent performance of Americas. The organic performance in Q4 was plus 1.7% reflecting the extremely challenging comparison base with Q4 last year having an organic growth of 26% versus Q4 '22. And above all -- the already mentioned annualization of the strong devaluation of the peso in December '23, which inverted the negative impact on the exchange rate effect seen in the first 9 months of the year to positive with a negative effect on the organic performance. It's worth noticing that the United States recorded a well above market double-digit organic growth also in the fourth quarter, thanks to the performance of both Miracle-Ear direct retail, which today has a network of 400 points of sales and Amplifon Hearing Healthcare.\nThe FX impact was positive for 19.5% due to the exceptional and already commented Argentine peso devaluation in December 2023. The significant M&A contribution related to the U.S., Canada and Uruguay was 9.7%. EBITDA came in at EUR 38.6 million with margin at 27.4% compared to 28.8% last year due to the dilution effect of the Miracle-Ear direct retail network accelerated growth and the integration of the 100 points of sales acquired during the year. In the full year, revenues were up around 20% at constant FX despite the '23 very strong comparison base with a 10.6% organic component. EBITDA amounted to around EUR 130 million, up 12.7% versus '23 with margin at 25.5% compared to 26.8% in '23.\nMoving to Slide #8, we have a look at Asia Pac. Revenues were up over 5% mainly driven by a solid and above-market organic growth of 2.3% versus a remarkable comparison base of around 12% organic growth in Q4 '23 versus Q4 '22. Despite a very tough macro environment also, China posted a solid organic growth in the quarter.\nM&A contribution was 2.6% related to China's [ sanction, ] which led our network today to over 500 points of sale. FX was a slight tailwind of 0.3% reversing compared to the first 9 months of the year. EBITDA was EUR 23.8 million with margin of 25.3% compared to 26.2% in Q4 last year due to the fast growth of China, where we acquired around 110 points of sale during the year. In the full year, revenue were up 8.4% at constant FX, driven by a strong organic growth of 5% and M&A of 3.4%. EBITDA amounted to almost EUR 97 million, up 7.8% versus '23, with the margin stable at 26.1%.\nMoving to Slide #9, we see the profit and loss evolution. Total revenues increased by 6.6% at current FX and 7% at constant FX to EUR 2.41 billion. Recurring EBITDA increased by 4.8% to EUR 568 million, with margin at 23.6% versus 24% last year, reflecting the softer-than-expected market in Europe, the strong investments and the accelerated M&A. D&A included PPA increased by around EUR 35 million, leading the recurring EBIT to EUR 265 million versus EUR 274 million last year.\nNet financial expenses accounted for EUR 60 million, primarily due to the higher net financial debt, including higher lease liabilities following the strong M&A activity and related network expansion, coupled with the refinancing of expiring loans mainly subscribed in 2020 at current market condition, leading profit before tax to EUR 205 million versus around EUR 225 million last year. Tax rate ended at 25.9% with an improvement of 30 basis points versus 2023 and leading the recurring net profit to around EUR 152 million versus around EUR 166 million last year. Net profit as reported was EUR 145 million versus EUR 155 million reported in '23.\nMoving to Slide 10. We appreciate the Q4 profit and loss. In the quarter, total revenue increased by 8% of current FX at EUR 665 million and a 4.5% at constant FX in light of the above mentioned reversal of the Argentine peso. EBITDA recurring came in at EUR 155 million, in line with 2023 with margin at 23.4%, around 190 bps below Q4 last year.\nD&A, including PPA, grew by EUR 8 million last year in light of the significant M&A acceleration and the strong investment in network, IT infrastructure and innovation leading the recurring EBIT to EUR 73 million versus EUR 81 million in Q4 '23. Net financial expenses amounted to EUR 16 million versus EUR 13 million in Q4 last year in light of the previously mentioned reasons. Tax rate ended at 21.5% versus 22.8% in Q4 last year, leading recurring net profit at EUR 44.4 million versus EUR 53 million last year.\nMoving to Slide #10, we appreciate the cash revolution. The operating cash flow after repayment of lease liabilities posted a very strong increase in the year, ending at EUR 321 million versus EUR 300 million in '23, despite higher lease liabilities of around EUR 13 million for the strong network expansion and the higher financial expenses for the accelerated M&A activity. Net CapEx increased by EUR 5 million versus prior year at EUR 145 million, leading free cash flow to EUR 176 million versus EUR 160 million in '23, a remarkable 10% increase versus last year.\nNet cash out for M&A was EUR 193 million, around 80% higher than 2023, following the significant acceleration of bolt-on M&A with around 400 shops acquired in 2024 [ primarily ] in France, Germany, U.S. and China. NFP ended at around EUR 960 million, posting around EUR 110 million increase versus December 2023 after a very strong investment for around EUR 430 million in CapEx, M&A dividends and share buybacks.\nMoving to Slide 11, we have a look at the debt profile trend and the key financial ratios. As mentioned, the net financial debt closed at around EUR 960 million with liquidity and short debt accounting for around EUR 219 million, respectively, and medium- long-term debt accounting for around EUR 960 million. In October and December, we announced 3 new sustainability-linked credit facilities for a total amount of EUR 325 million. These credit lines linked to specific targets of our sustainability plan allow us to further optimize our financial structure, diversifying our sources of funding and extending the average debt maturity.\nFollowing the IFRS 16 application, lease liability amounted to around EUR 515 million, leading the sum of the net financial debt and lease liabilities to around EUR 1.48 billion. Equity ended up at around EUR 1.15 billion. Looking at financial ratios, net debt over EBITDA ended at 1.63x slightly increasing versus 1.5x at December last year after the strong investments in CapEx, M&A, dividend and share [ buyback. ] Net debt over equity ended at 4.84x.\nI will now hand over to Enrico.\n\nEnrico Vita\n\nCEO, MD & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Gabriele. Now let's discuss our further significant step-up in our sustainability journey. First, in 2024, we strongly accelerated our environmental responsibility. We reduced our GHG emissions, in particular, at Scope 3, increased the share of renewable energy from 74% to 80% and launched a new reusable packaging for all the Amplifon branded products, primarily made of recycled materials. Second, we continued delivering on the social front. First of all, helping more and more people to rediscover the emotions of sound by offering free hearing tests and delivering around EUR 200 million in saving to customers.\nWe also provided almost 600,000 hours of training to our employees and maintained a 47% women representation in managerial roles. We were recognized as top employer for the fifth consecutive year. In addition, this year, we rolled out the EcoVadis platform, enabling us to conduct ESG assessments on both direct and indirect suppliers and signed 3 new ESG-linked credit lines for over EUR 300 million.\nFinally, the score we obtained in the CDP questionnaire as well as the recognition for the fourth year in a row as a Standard & Poor's Yearbook member are testaments of our increasing transparency and focus on environmental and sustainability topics. Hence, we look forward with real excitement to our journey towards an even more sustainable company.\nLet's now move to the following chart, the chart of the outlook, which is the last chart of today's presentation and where you can find our key comment regarding 2025. Firstly, after a softer 2024, we are positive about the European market coming back to solid growth, first of all, because of the anticipated growth of the French market, but also because it has been growing well below its historical levels for 3 years in a row now. Then we also expect the U.S. market to continue to grow healthily despite a pretty challenging comparison base. Hence, we see a more balanced global market growing next year by around 4%.\nConsidering these market developments, we aim to achieve a mid to high single-digit growth at constant exchange rates which means growth between 5% and 9% at constant exchange rates driven by organic growth above the market and our M&A bolt-ons at circa 2%. We expect revenue growth to accelerate particularly after Q1, driven by the anticipated recovery of the French market from Q2 onwards and because of the exceptionally strong Q1 last year, which also had circa 1.5 days more working days than Q1 this year.\nFinally, we aim to grow our profitability beyond the 24%, driven by a more supportive market environment. And in particular, we see improved operating leverage in the EMEA region, which will contribute positively to our overall performance.\nWith this, we thank you for your attention, and we look forward to taking your questions. Francesca, over to you.\n\nFrancesca Rambaudi\n\nInvestor Relations Director\n\nThank you. I will kindly ask the operator to open up for Q&A session. I ask kindly to limit your questions to maximum 2 initially in order to give everybody the opportunity to ask questions.\nNow I turn the call over to Judith in order to open for Q&A. Thanks."

Welcome, and thank you for joining the Amplifon Q2 and H1 2024 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Francesca Rambaudi, Investor Relations and Sustainability Senior Director of Amplifon. Please go ahead, madam.\n\nFrancesca Rambaudi\n\nInvestor Relations Director\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Amplifon's conference call on the second quarter and first half of 2024 results. Before we start, a few logistic comments. Earlier today, we issued a press release related to our results, and this presentation is posted in our website in the Investors section. The call can be accessed also via webcast and dial-in details are on Amplifon's website as well as on our press release. I have to bring your attention to the disclaimer on Slide 2, and some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements.\nWith that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Amplifon's CEO, Erico Vita.\n\nEnrico Vita\n\nCEO, MD & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Francesca. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our Q2 results conference call. As always, let's begin commenting on the quarter's results, starting with the top line. and the market dynamics, which in Europe showed remarkable volatility throughout the quarter. In fact, the European market was below our expectations, particularly from the second half of May to the end of June.\nI must say that it's difficult to explain the reasons for this clearly, but we might suppose that the better weather in some markets and perhaps the European elections have negatively impacted the footfall in that time frame. If we look at the market dynamics for the main European markets, we still saw an unexpected negative demand in France positive growth in Germany, while the other markets contributed to an overall flattish European market with plus and minus. On the other hand, the U.S. market was still strong and in line with our expectations, although it slowed down from the double-digit growth of the first quarter to around plus 5% in the second quarter.\nFinally, we estimated that [indiscernible] in New Zealand were again somewhere in the middle of the 2 regions. In this context, also in Q2, we delivered a strong revenue growth, over 7% at constant exchange rates. And let's see this as a substantial achievement is considering our geographical mix, which is, as you know, still more skewed towards Europe, although the Americas region is growing very fast.\nCommenting then on our performance by region. In Europe, our revenue performance was still positive despite the sluggish market demand dimension. I must also share that the region's performance was also affected by contingent operational challenges in Spain related to the rollout of our new IT front office system and the change in its leadership. Both challenges are now resolved.\nThen I'm very satisfied with our performance in the Americas and in particular in the U.S. where we are proceeding at full speed following our strategic priorities to transform our network from franchise to direct retail. Thanks to the latest acquisitions today, we can count on a directly operated store network of circa 400 stores. Finally, I'm also active with our performance in Asia Pacific, which continues to deliver strong and above market growth.\nRegarding the EBITDA recurring, we delivered around EUR 160 million with the margin stable at 26.6%. The Here, let me underline that we were able to protect our profitability despite the market environment I described earlier as well as offsetting the dilution related to the acceleration of our growth of the Miracle-Ear direct network only thanks to the different productivity measures taken to realign our field structure in Europe in the second half of last year. Overall, let me say that I'm generally happy about how we responded quickly to the volatile market demand in Europe I described earlier.\nNow I will hand it over to Gabriele to give you more details about our numbers.\n\nGabriele Galli\n\nExecutive of Financial Reporting & Corporate Accounting Information and CFO\n\nThanks, Enrico, and good afternoon to everybody. Moving to Slide #4, we have a look at the group financial performance in Q2, which, as already commented by Enrico, posted a strong revenue growth at 7.1%, constant ForEx, with an above-market organic growth at plus 3.5%. Despite flattish and softer than expected European market, the U.S. market growing at a healthy plus 5%, though at a lower pace than M&A contribution from bolt-on acquisition mainly in France, Germany, U.S., Canada and China was at a remarkable 3.6%, strongly accelerating since the beginning of the year.\nForEx had a negative impact accounting for minus 1.8%, though reducing versus Q1 due to the depreciation of the Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar and moreover, Argentine peso. EBITDA recurring came in at EUR 160 million, with margin at 26.6%, thanks to the field productivity measures, successfully implemented in H2 2023, which continued to deliver good results and offset the lower-than-expected European market and the dilution from the accelerated growth of our direct retail network in the U.S.\nLooking at our financial performance in H1, revenues were up high single digits or 8% at constant FX versus H1 '23, with a strong and above market organic growth at circa 5% and the remarkable M&A contribution at over 3% with circa 290 points of sales acquired year-to-date. ForEx posted a negative contribution of 2.3% and decreasing throughout the period. EBITDA recurring amounted to EUR 297 million, up around 8% versus H1 '23 with margin at 25.2%, up 40 basis points versus prior year, thanks to the already mentioned as the field productivity measures, which more than offset the lower-than-expected European market and the dilution from the accelerated growth of Miracle-Ear direct retail network.\nMoving to Slide 5, we have eluded EMEA performance. In the quarter, revenue growth at constant FX was 1.5% versus Q2 '23, with organic performance reflecting the general market softness in Europe and in particular of the French market. as well as some contingent operational challenges in Spain already mentioned by Enrico, which are now entirely resolved. M&A contribution related to both [ pounds ] mainly in France and Germany was 2.1%. The performance in the other European market was solid. EBITDA amounted to EUR 117 million, in line with Q2 2023, with margin at 30.7%, still among the group's highest level of profitability, even if 50 basis points lower than in 2023.\nField productivity measures taken in the second half of 2023, delivered strong results, limiting the impact of the lower operating leverage due to the softness of the market. In H1, revenue growth was 3% with organic growth of 1.1% and M&A contribution at 1.8%. EBITDA amounted to EUR 227 million, up 4.2% versus H1 '23, with margin improving by 30 basis points to 29.9% driven by the just mentioned productivity measures.\nMoving to Slide #6, we have a look at another strong performance of Americas. Revenue growth in the quarter was 15.9% of current FX with strong and above market organic growth across different markets. and with both Miracle-Ear and Amplifon Hearing Health Care posting a strong performance in the U.S. M&A contribution was over 9%, with acquisitions in Canada Uruguay and above all in the U.S. where we completed since the beginning of the year, 3 sizable acquisitions totaling around 100 shops, thus bringing the Miracle-Ear direct retail network to 400 points of sales.\nThe FX impact was minus 8.8%, mainly due to the depreciation of the Argentine peso. As you may remember, last year, in December, the peso was strongly devaluated to circa PLN 890 for euro from EUR 370 at the end of Q3 and EUR 280 at the end of Q2. Therefore, we may assume that moving forward in the year, the very negative ForEx effect will reverse partially in Q3 and significantly in Q4, also because Q4 will be accounted as the difference between 2024 full year, where the FX impact will be negligible assuming a further devaluation in the first 9 months of 2024.\nThe other component of inflation accounting price index adjustments accounted in Q2 for less than 2%. EBITDA amounted to EUR 35.5 million, up almost 10% versus Q2 '23, with margin at 27.4%, down 150 basis points due to the accelerated growth of Miracle-Ear's direct retail business in the U.S. and due to the integration of the circa 100 points of sales acquired since January.\nIn H1, revenue were up 13.1%, driven by a strong organic growth despite the remarkable '23 comparison days when the region grew 18% versus 2022. EBITDA amounted to EUR 62 million, up 8.1% versus H1 with the margin decreasing by 120 basis points for the reasons I just mentioned.\nMoving to Slide 7. We have a look at the Asia Pac performance, where we posted an excellent revenue growth as well as a continued expansion of profitability. In the quarter, revenue were up 9.1% at constant FX, mainly driven by a strong and well above market organic growth. despite a very challenging comparison base with a '23 Q2 organic growth at 15% versus 2022.\nM&A contribution was 3.3%, mainly related to China, where today, we count on over 450 points of sales. FX headwind was 0.7%. EBITDA reached EUR 23.1 million, increasing by 10.4% compared to '23 with margin at 24.8%, a 50 basis points higher versus Q2 '23, also after the very strong growth of China. In revenue were up over 11% at constant FX and over 8% of current FX driven by an outstanding organic growth of over 7% and M&A for 4%. EBITDA amounted to EUR 47 million, up 10.8% versus H1 '23, with margin at 26.4%, posting an expansion of 60 basis points.\nMoving to Slide #8. We appreciated the Q2 profit and loss. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 5.3% at current FX and 7.1% at constant FX to EUR 604 million. EBITDA recurring came in at EUR 160 million, with margin at 26.6% in line with Q2 '23. As previously mentioned, the profitability reflects the implementation of field productivity measures offset in the slower-than-expected European market and the dilution from the accelerated growth of our direct retail network in the U.S.\nEBITDA reported was around EUR 158 million, up around EUR 9 million versus '23 after EUR 2.4 million one-off cost primarily related to the implementation of the changes of the company Article of Association with particular regard to the enhancement of the increased voting rights mechanism.\nD&A, including PPA grew by EUR 7 million versus last year in light of the increased investment in network infrastructure and innovation leading the recurring EBIT to EUR 87 million versus EUR 86 million in Q2 '23. Net financial expenses amounted to EUR 13 million versus EUR 12 million in Q2 '23 primarily due to the higher interest charges on short-term credit lines on the variable rate components of medium, long-term debt as well as on rent cost in application of IFRS 16 to network leases. Tax rate posted a 40 bps reduction versus Q2 '23, leading recurring net profit at around EUR 55 million, slightly above 2023.\nMoving to Slide #9, we see the H1 profit and loss evolution. Total revenues increased by 5.7% at current FX and 7.7% at constant FX to EUR 1.18 billion. Recurring EBITDA increased by EUR 7.7 million to EUR 297 million, with margin at 25.2%, up 40 basis points versus 3 thanks to the productivity measures, which more than offset the market softness in Europe and the dilution from the accelerated growth of Miracle-Ear direct network. D&A, including PPA, increased by EUR 16 million, leading the recurring EBITDA to around EUR 152 million with a growth of around 3.5% or EUR 5 million versus H1 '23.\nNet financial expenses accounted for EUR 27.5 million in light of the previously mentioned reason leading profit before tax to around EUR 125 million slightly above H1 '23. Tax rate ended at 27.7%, a leading recurring net profit to EUR 90 million, slightly above H1 '23.\nMoving to Chart 10, we appreciate the cash flow evolution. Operating cash flow after lease liability was in the period equal to EUR 112 million, EUR 26 million below the EUR 138 million strong level achieved in '23, following the higher cash out for taxes, financial expenses and the lower generation from our working capital. Net CapEx increased by around EUR 3 million to circa EUR 65 million leading free cash flow to EUR 47 million.\nNet cash out for M&A more than doubled versus -- to almost EUR 143 million versus EUR 59 million last year following the significant acceleration of bolt-on M&A with over 240 shops acquired in the first half of 2023 primarily in France, Germany, U.S., Uruguay and China. NFP ended slightly over EUR 1 billion, posting a seasonal increase versus December '23, after strong investment for around EUR 275 million in CapEx, M&A and dividends.\nMoving to Chart 11, we have a look at the debt profile trend and financial ratios. As mentioned, the net financial debt closed at around EUR 1 billion with liquidity accounting for EUR 155 million short-term debt accounting for around EUR 487 million and medium long-term debt accounting for around EUR 678 million. Following the IFRS 16 application, lease liability amounted to around EUR 512 million, leading the sum of net financial debt and lease liability to EUR 1.52 billion. Equity ended up at around EUR 1.14 billion.\nLooking at financial ratios, net debt over EBITDA ended at 1.7, slightly increasing versus 1.5 at December last year after the strong investment in CapEx, M&A and dividends. Net debt over equity ended at 0.89x.\nI will now hand over to Enrico for the outlook and the closing remarks.\n\nEnrico Vita\n\nCEO, MD & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Gabriele. So we are at the last chart of today's presentation, where you can find our key comments regarding the second half of the year. Firstly, even after a softer Q2, we still expect the European market to normalize and gradually return to solid growth. As we do not see any specific and structural reasons why this should not happen. We also expect the U.S. market to continue to grow healthily and in line with our expectations. Hence, we see a global market growing at around plus 3% this year.\nIn consideration and notwithstanding these market developments, we confirm our goal to grow high single digit at constant exchange rates thanks to our continued ability to overperform the market. Regarding profitability, we see the company EBITDA margin improving versus last year at around 24.3% as a result of the positive contribution of the productivity measures taken in 2023, which more than counterbalanced the dilution effect of the accelerated and above plan growth of our Miracle-Ear direct retail network in the U.S. as well as the potential need of higher marketing investments to respond to the potential continued softness in the European market.\nFinally, as usual, I wanted to share some insights about how we started the third quarter. In July, we saw stronger momentum in sales. Also in Europe, which could signal that the weakness of May and June was related to contingent situations. Clearly, we need this trend to continue in August and above all, in September before drawing any final conclusion.\nWith this, we thank you for your attention, and we look forward to taking your questions."

Welcome, and thank you for joining the Amplifon First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Francesca Rambaudi, Investor Relations and Sustainability Senior Director of Amplifon. Please go ahead, madam.\n\nFrancesca Rambaudi\n\nInvestor Relations Director\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Amplifon's Conference Call on First Quarter 2024 Results. Before we start, a few logistic comments. Earlier today, we issued a press release related to our results, and this presentation is posted on our website in the Investors section. The call can be accessed also via webcast and dial-in details are on Amplifon's website as well as on our press release. I have to bring your attention to the disclaimer on Slide 2 as some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements.\nWith that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Andrean CEO, Enrico Vita.\n\nEnrico Vita\n\nCEO, MD & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Francesca, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us Today, I'm pleased to comment on a simply excellent quarter, definitely the best way to start the 2024. I'm very happy not only for our financials, but also because we see the results of all the hard work we did last year in response to a market demand, which in Europe, as you know, was weaker than expected.\nThe further good news is that at last in Europe in Q1, the market demand finally seems to have started to normalize, and it was back to growth. We estimate something in the region of plus 1%. Also, it is important to remark that this growth was impacted by the early Easter of this year, compared to last year when the Easter occurred in April. Obviously, we will have a benefit in April of this year for the same reason, but I will come back to this at the end when we talk about the outlook.\nSo let's immediately review some of the quarter's key numbers and achievements together. Revenues were up for circa 9% at constant exchange rates and circa 6% at current exchange rates. The composition of the growth was excellent. And in fact, the organic growth was at a remarkable of 5.6%, especially considering what I said about the day at early Easter. In addition to the usual mention of our performance in the Americas, today, I would like to highlight our performance also in Asia Pacific, which delivered circa 9% of organic growth. M&A contribution was also strong at around 3% overall, accelerating further during this first quarter, also thanks to more targets willing to sell at attractive multiples for us.\nIn particular, I would like to mention the continued growth of our directly operated store network in the U.S. thanks to the recent acquisitions of 2 of our main franchisees. Today, we can count on a network of directly operated stores of nearly 400 stores. Hence we are moving forward with condition and at full speed in one of our strategic priorities. Regarding the EBITDA recurring, we delivered around EUR 137 million, thanks to a record margin increase of 100 basis points versus 2023. While in absolute terms, the increase was of circa 11%. Concerning profitability, I wanted to mention again the APAC results, whether we see and we are now reaping the fruits of all the work done over the past months and where we now see the benefit of the full integration of [indiscernible] Finally, we posted a net profit recurring of circa EUR 36 million with a margin at 6.2%. As [indiscernible], all in all, we are very happy about our results in this initial part of the year.\nAnd now I will hand it over to Gabriele to give you more information about our financials.\n\nGabriele Galli\n\nExecutive of Financial Reporting & Corporate Accounting Information and CFO\n\nThanks, Enrico, and good afternoon, everybody. Moving to Chart #4 we have a quick look at the group financial performance in Q1, which, as already commented by Enrico posted a truly excellent start to the year. In the quarter, revenue at constant FX increased by around 9% versus 2023 with a strong and above market organic growth at 5.6%. Despite the negative impact of early Easter in March we concurred -- which occurred last year in April with [ 1 13 ] days less in the quarter, equivalent to circa 1.5% growth.\nThe very tough comparison base. In fact, the revenues in Q1 '23 were 9% higher than in Q1 '22. Then the global market demand still driven by a strong U.S. market with Europe back to growth and progressively normalizing. M&A contribution from bolt-ons primarily in Uruguay, U.S. and China, strongly accelerated and was over 3%. FX was negative for 2.7%, primarily due to Argentine peso U.S. dollar, Australian dollar and New Zealand revenues in Q1 '23, growing 20% versus Q1 '24.\nRevenue growth in the quarter was over 20% at constant FX with an excellent organic growth at around 13%, driven by a continued very strong performance in the U.S. especially Miracle-Ear direct retail and Amplifon Hearing Health Care. M&A contribution, primarily related to U.S. and Uruguay was over 8%. The FX impact was minus 11.4%. Inflation accounting impacted less than 2 percentage points negatively on FX and positively on organic growth. EBITDA amounted to EUR 26.2 million with margin at 23.7%, up versus Q1 '23, reflecting the business mix with the fast growth of Miracle-Ear direct retail, the integration of recent acquisition and the strong reinvestment in the business. Moving to Slide 7.\nWe have a look at Asia Pac performance, where we posted an excellent revenue growth as well as an outstanding profitability. Revenues were up 13.5% at constant effect, mainly driven by the outstanding organic growth reported across all main markets and despite a very challenging comparison basis. M&A contribution was 4.7% related to China, where today, we count on over 410 points of sale. FX headwind was significant at over minus 5% due to the appreciation of euro versus both Australian and New Zealand dollars. EBITDA reached EUR 24.2 million, increasing by 11.2% compared to 2023, with margin at 28.1%, 80 bps higher versus Q1 '23, also after the very strong growth of China. Moving to Slide #8.\nWe appreciate the Q1 profit and loss. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 6.1% to EUR 573 million, with a strong 5.6% organic growth versus Q1 '23. EBITDA recurring came in at around EUR 137 million, increasing circa 11% or over EUR 13 million with margin at all-time high level of 23.9%, 100 bps above Q1 '23, thanks to the field productivity measures taken in H2 last year. EBITDA reported was around EUR 136 million, up around EUR 20 million versus [ 23 ] after EUR 1 million one-off costs. G&A, including PPA was EUR 71 million versus EUR 62 million in '23, increasing EUR 9 million in light of the growing investments made during the last years in network, digital transformation and innovation, leading the recurring EBIT to EUR 66 million versus EUR 61 million in Q1 '23. Net financial expenses amounted to EUR 14.4 million versus EUR 11.9 million in Q1 last year.\nFinally, due to the increase in interest rates on short-term and on the limited portion of long-term facilities at variable rates since, as you know, most of our long-term debt is at fixed rate. The higher figurative interest expenses on network leases following the application of IFRS 16. The nonmonetary negative impact of inflation accounting on the Argentinian subsidiary. Tax rate usually slightly higher in the first quarter versus the following quarters due to seasonality, posted a 10 basis point reduction versus [ 23 ] leading recurring net profit of around EUR 36 million versus [ 35 ] last year. Moving to Slide #9.\nWe appreciate the cash flow evolution. Operating cash flow before lease liabilities was in the period equal to EUR 97 million, roughly in line with the EUR 101 million level achieved in last year. After repayment of lease liabilities, growing by EUR 2 million, operating cash flow was equal to EUR 67 million. Net CapEx increased by over EUR 3 million to EUR 30 million, leading free cash flow to over EUR 37 million. Net [indiscernible] for M&A increased significantly, nearly doubling to around EUR 71 million versus EUR 39 million last year. following the significant acceleration of bolt-on M&A, primarily in France, Germany, Uruguay, the U.S. and China with over 150 shops acquired in the quarter. MFP ended at EUR 883 million versus EUR 852 million at year-end 2023. Moving to Slide 10.\nWe have a look at the debt profile trend and key financial ratios. As mentioned, the net financial debt closed at EUR 883 million, with liquidity accounting for EUR 215 million, short-term debt accounting for around EUR 376 million and medium long-term debt accounting for around EUR 721 million. Following the IFRS 16 application, lease liability amounted to around EUR 507 million, leading the sum of net financial debt and lease liability to close EUR 1.4 billion. Equity ended up at around EUR 1.14 billion. Looking at financial ratios. Net debt over EBITDA ended at 1.52x, stable versus December last year after the strong CapEx and bolt-on M&A plan. Net debt over equity ended at 0.78x.\nI would now hand over to Enrico for the outlook and the closing remarks.\n\nEnrico Vita\n\nCEO, MD & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Gabriele. So we are at the end of today's presentation, which contains several very positive messages. First, the market demand in Europe is back to slight growth after several negative quarters. Second, our field productivity measures are delivering very strong results. Third, we are progressing fast and delivering on our strategic priorities. Hence, we are very pleased with our performance in Q1, a great quarter, which strengthens our confidence in a very positive 2024 even further.\nFinally, I want to share that April was very strong too, up by a remarkable high teens also thanks to the early Easter in March 2024. Regarding Q2, please also note that due to a very peculiar calendar situation in June we will have 5 weekends in the month. So at the end, we will have only 1 more working day in the quarter than last year. We are, therefore, confirming with even more confidence our guidance communicated 2 months ago and say that, all in all, let me say, a strong set of good news for today.\nWith this, I want to thank you all for your attention, and we look forward to answering your questions. Francesca, over to you.\n\nFrancesca Rambaudi\n\nInvestor Relations Director\n\nThanks, Enrico. I kindly ask the operator to open today's Q&A session. Please kindly limit your questions to maximum 2 in initially in order to give everybody the opportunity to ask questions. Now I turn the call over to Judith in order to open for the Q&A."

Live in a hotel, swing on a plane, bless the state, money ain't a thing, club jumper like LeBron, now, hold it. What am I? Good afternoon, this is the Coruscant conference operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the Amplifon Q4 and full year 2023 results conference. As a reminder, all participants are in listen only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Should anyone need assistance during the conference, call the MES signal and operator by pressing Star and Zero on their telephones. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Miss Francesca Rambaudi, Investor Relations and Sustainability Senior Director of Amplifon. Please go ahead.\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Amplifon's conference call on Q4 and full year 2023 results. Before we start, a few logistic comments. Earlier today, we issued a press release related to our results, and this presentation is also posted on our website on the investor site. The call can also be accessed via webcast and dial-in details, which are on our website as well as in the press release.\n\nI have to bring your attention to the disclaimer on slide two, as some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Amplifon CEO Enrico Vita. Thank you, Francesca, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us.\n\nSo let's begin with some comments on the year that has just ended, which was undoubtedly more complex than initially thought, especially regarding the development of the European market. In fact, we saw a global market moving at three different speeds. The U.S. was very strong, while Europe, our core geography, was definitely weaker than we expected, mainly because of the negative performance in the two key markets of France and Germany. Australia and New Zealand were somewhere in the middle.\n\nIn this context, also in 2023, we delivered a record result. We grew strongly, around 10% at constant exchange rates, and I see this as an excellent achievement, considering our geographical mix, which is, as you know, still more skewed towards Europe.\n\nAlthough the U.S. is growing exceptionally well, regarding profitability, we sacrificed some, mainly because of the investment in audiologists' capacity at the beginning of the year, particularly in France, Germany, and a few others. However, in the second half of the year, we did our homework.\n\nWe worked hard to realign our cost structure in the field through several productivity measures, the benefits of which are already visible to us in these early months of the year. And let me tell you that, all in all, I'm very proud of how our organization reacted to the softness of the European market, reviewing once again how we were doing certain things and finding ways to do them even better and more efficiently. And it is because of all the work done, especially in the second part of last year, that I'm very positive about 2024. But I will come back to that at the end of this presentation. Instead, I will now leave the floor to Gabriele, who will give you more details about our performance. Thanks, Enrico, and good afternoon, everybody.\n\nMoving to slide number 4, we have a look at the group financial performance in Q4, which, as already commented by Enrico, posted revenue growth of 11.2% at constant FX, with strong and well above market organic growth, despite a still slightly negative and softer than expected European market. And one pregnancy day less, primarily in... Our organic performance was driven by significant share gains and positive pricing developments. M&A contribution from Bolton Acquisition in France, Germany, the US, and China was at a remarkable 2.3%. Effects had a significant negative impact, accounting for 5.1%, primarily due to the Argentine peso exceptional devaluation in mid-December.\n\nBeing Argentina affected by hyperinflation, the group needs to apply the inflation accounting principle, adjusting local financial statements with a price index and then translating the adjusted local financial statements into euros at December 31st exchange rate versus the normal average exchange rate for the period. The 140% PESO devaluation executed in mid-December more than offset the positive effect of the price index adjustment, strongly affecting revenue at current prices. Organic growth calculated instead from revenues at constant effect reflects the positive impact from price index adjustment. Such impact was positive by around 2 percentage points at group level and by around 10 percentage points at American level in the. For the full year, such impact was negligible at group level and positive for around 4 percentage points at American level.\n\nThe EBITDA recurring came in at around 156 million euros, with a margin of 25.3%, primarily due to the significant investments in the field capacity to unlock constraints and boost growth, and to the lower operating leverage in EMEA for the software, Nespector, in the European market. Moving to chart 5, we have a look at our financial performance for the full year 2023. Revenues reached another record level at 2.26 billion euros, up over 10% at constant effects, driven by very strong and above-marked growth of 8%, despite the softer than expected market in Europe and the M&A contribution of over 2%. The vaccine part was negative by 3.5% due to the depreciation of the Australian and New Zealand dollars and, above all, Argentina.\n\nCareer 23 revenue came in slightly lower than expected, primarily due to the above-mentioned significant effects deterioration at the end, compared to the estimated effects assumption, which had a negative impact in the range of 15 to 20 million. These are recurring revenues, and amounted to $542 million, up over 3% versus full year 2020, with margin at 24% in line with expectation, despite the very strong investment in field capacity, and despite the... EMEA lower operating leverage due to the software they expected. Moving to chart number six.\n\nWe have a look at the EMEA performance. Revenue growth at constant effects was over 5% versus 22, with well above market organic growth of 4.1%, driven by share gains and positive price in development, despite a still slightly negative and softer than expected market and the negative impact of one trading day less. M&A contribution in France and Germany was around 1 percentage point.\n\nEBITDA amounted to 118.7 million euros, with a margin at 28.4% versus 31.1% in Q4 2022, primarily due to lower operating leverage in a softer-than-expected market while strongly investing in audiologists' capacity to unlock constraints and enlarge the competitive gap versus others. In the full year, revenue growth at constant effects was 5%, with solid and above market organic growth at 4% and M&A EBITDA amounted to 419 million euros, with a margin of 28.2%. Moving to slide seven, we have a look at the excellent performance of Americas, despite the particularly adverse effects impacting P4. The impact was minus 24.5% due to the exceptional and already commented Argentine phase of devaluation in December.\n\nThe organic growth, including the positive inflation accounting impact, was 26%. The net dividend impact amounted to around 10 percentage points. The organic growth is still above 15%, driven by a very strong performance of both Miracle-Ear direct retail and Amplifon hearing help versus a very challenging 2022 comparison base, which grew 20% versus Q4 2021. M&A contributions, primarily related to the US and Canada, were 6.8%, came in at 31 million euros, with a margin of 28.8%, up 170 basis points versus 22, also after the fast growth of In the full year, revenue was up 25.4% at constant effects, despite the 22% very strong comparison base. BIDA amounted to 115 million euros, up 14.5% versus 22, with a margin up 50 basis points at 26.8%.\n\nMoving to slide 8, we have a look at Asia Pacific, where we fostered an excellent profession. Revenues were up over 15% at constant effects, mainly driven by outstanding organic growth at around 12%, with all markets in the region performing very well. M&A contribution was 3.4% related to China's expansion plan, which led our network today to exceed 400 funds. The effect headwind was significant at minus 6.7 percent due to the appreciation of the Euro versus both Australian and New Zealand dollars.\n\nEBITDA was at 23.4 million euros, with a margin at 26.2%, up 30 basis points versus Q4 2020, also after the very strong growth of In the full year, revenues were up over 15% as constant effects, driven by an excellent organic growth of over 30%. The EBITDA amounted to around 90 million euros, up 7.1% versus 22, with a margin of 26.1%, with a contraction of 10 basis points due to the one-time cost for the change of leadership in the region. Moving to slide number nine, we see the Q4 profit and loss. As previously mentioned, total revenue at constant FX increased in the quarter by 11.2%, while revenues at current FX grew by 6.1% at €615 million, with an increase of over €35 million versus €20 million.\n\nThe bid-out came in at 156 million euros, with a margin of 25.3% versus 26.9% in 2022 when we implemented some cost containment measures related to non-strategic investment. As previously mentioned, the profitability reflects lower operating leverage in EMEA and the less favorable geographic mix due to the softer-than-expected demand in Europe, coupled with very strong investment. DNA, including PPA, increased by around 30 million versus last year in light of the growing investments made during the last years in network, digital innovation, and digital transformation, leading the recurring EBIT to $81 million versus $94 million and net financial expenses amounted to 12.6 versus 9.4 million in Q4 2022. The tax rate posted a 190 basis point reduction, leading recurring net profit at around 53 million euros.\n\nMoving to slide number 10, we see the full year profit and loss evolution. Total revenues increased over 140 million euros to 2.26 billion with a growth of 10.2 percent at constant effects and of 6.7 percent at current, recurring EBITDA increased to 541 million euros with a margin of 24%, down 80 basis points versus a record level of 22 for the previously mentioned reasons, while reported bid-out was around 527 million, after 15 million one-off costs primarily related to the application of IFRS 2 accounting principle for the DNA included BPA increased by around 28 million to 268 million euros, leading the recurring EBITDA to 274 million euros.\n\nNet financial expenses amounted to €49.5 million versus around €35 million in 2020. This is due to the increase in interest rates on short-term and on the limited portion of the long-term facility at a variable rate since, as you know, most of our long-term debt is at a fixed rate, and the higher figurative interest expenses on network leases following the application of IFRS 16. Profit before taxes resulted at around 225 million euros versus 250 million euros in 2020. X-Rate ended up 26.2%, down 50 basis points, leading recurring net profit to 166 million euros versus 183 in 2010. Moving to chart 11, we can see the cash flow evolution. The operating cash flow after these liabilities was in the period equal to 300 million versus 353 million outstanding level achieved in 2022 when the group implemented several actions delivering a considerable improvement in terms of operating and non-operating work.\n\nNet capex increased significantly by 34 million euros to almost 140 million euros as, during 2023, we invested strongly not only in people but also in our network, in our digital innovation, and in our digital transformation, leading free cash flow at $116 million. Net cash-out for M&A posted a significant increase to over 180 million euros from 85 million last year following the strong acceleration of bolt-on M&A with over 340 shops acquired during the NFB and about 852 million euros after remarkable investment of around 315 million euros in CAPEX, and Moving to slide 12, we have a look at the debt profile trend and key financial ratios. As mentioned, the net financial debt closed at 852 million euros, with the liquidity accounting for 194 million, short-term debt for 327 million, and the medium-long-term debt for 719 million.\n\nFollowing the IFRS 16 application, lease liabilities amounted to $497 million, leading the sum of net financial debt and lease liabilities to $1.35 billion. Equity ended up at around 1.1 billion. Looking at financial ratios, net debt over EBITDA ended up at 1.50, slightly decreasing versus 1.52 in December last year, after the very strong investment in CapEx, M&A, and dividends. Net debt over equity ended up at 0.77 versus\n\nI would now hand over to Enrico for an update on our ESG achievements and on the 2024 outcome. Thank you, Gabriele. So now let's discuss our further significant step up in our sustainability journey. First, in 2023, we strongly accelerated our environmental responsibility. We delivered on our green objectives, increasing the share of renewable energy from 50% to well above 70%, exceeding our target. We formalized our commitment to the science-based target initiatives to define a near-term decarbonization target, underwent an in-depth climate change risk assessment, and adopted our new environmental policy globally. The strong improvement to Score B of the CDP is also a testament to our increasing transparency and focus on environmental and climate topics.\n\nSecond, we continued delivering on our commitment to people and, first of all, to our employees, our most important asset. We provided almost 420,000 hours of training, and following the adoption of our diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging policy, the percentage of women in managerial roles increased from 44 to 47 percent. We are therefore very pleased to have been included among the 100 most loved workplaces 2023 globally and to have received the Top Employer certification. Finally, this year, we worked hard on the definition of our new sustainability plan since the first ended in 2023. The new plan, which will be released in our 2023 annual report and presented in the coming weeks, will include new and ongoing ambitious medium and long-term targets integrated with our business and financial strategy and linked to management remuneration.\n\nHence, we look forward with real excitement to our journey towards an even more sustainable company. Let's move now to chart 14, or the Outlook. Here we are at the end, the last chart of today's presentation, where you can find our key comments regarding 2024. Firstly, after a softer 2023, we expect the European market to normalize and come back to solid growth. Same for Australia and New Zealand.\n\nWe also expect the U.S. market to continue to grow healthily. Hence, we see a more balanced global market growing next year somewhere around 4%. Considering this market development, we aim to grow high single-digits at constant exchange rates thanks to organic growth above market and the contribution of Volton acquisitions above 2%. We are also very positive on profitability.\n\nIn fact, thanks to all the different productivity measures taken to realign our field structure in Europe in the second half of last year, we see a meaningful improvement in the company, with an EBITDA margin above 24.6%. Then, as usual, I also wanted to share with you some insights about how we started the year. In January and February, we saw strong momentum in sales, especially considering that last year's first quarter was the strongest.\n\nAlso, as said at the beginning, we see the benefit of the work done in productivity, hence in profitability, already in these early months of the year. Obviously, March will be crucial to confirm this trend. And regarding Mars, considering that it has on average about two working days less than last year due to the earlier Easter this year.\n\nAll in all, March looks good so far, and we are positive for the entire Q1. Finally, during Q4 and these first two months of 2023-24, we closed many bolt-on acquisitions, particularly in the Americas and China. In China, as anticipated, we can now count more than 400 stores.\n\nAnd we are running fast towards a similar number in our direct store network in the U.S., where we now have more than 350 stores. All in all, we are proceeding at full speed, following our strategic priorities, and I'm optimistic that 2024 will be a year of strong profitable growth for our company. With this, we thank you for your attention, and we look forward to taking your questions. Francesca?\n\nThanks, Enrico. I kindly ask the operator to open today's Q&A session. Please kindly limit your questions to a maximum of two initially in order to give everybody the opportunity to ask questions. Now, I turn over the call to Sabrina in order to open the Q&A session.\n\nThank you. Thank you. This is the Corusco conference operator. We will now begin the question and answer session. Anyone who wishes to ask a question may press star and 1 on their touchtone telephone. To remove themselves from the question queue, please press star and T. We kindly ask you to use the handsets when asking questions.\n\nAnyone who has a question may press star and 1 at this time. The first question is from Hassan Al-Waqeel of Barclays. Please go ahead. Hi, good afternoon.\n\nThank you for taking my questions. I'll keep it to two, please. Firstly, can you talk a bit about the competitive landscape on the manufacturer side, given there seems to be a shortening of the product lifecycle and whether you expect to see more pricing concessions on the manufacturer side than normal, and whether you foresee any meaningful changes in the share of your wallet across suppliers? And then, secondly, can you walk us through the drivers of the greater than 60 basis points of margin improvement for this year and the key building blocks? And what do you think is a realistic upper bound or upper end for this year in terms of the margin, assuming you continue to invest sufficiently in the business, and how much of this margin improvement is a mirror and mix and how much is pricing? Thank you. Okay, thank you.\n\nThank you for the questions. I would start with the second one and, therefore, our target for profitability for next year and our target to increase our profitability by more than 60 basis points. So the key driver for this profitability increase is mainly related to what I was talking about. I told you during the presentation and, in particular, the productivity measures that we have taken, especially in Europe, in order to improve our labor costs on sales in Europe, which was the main point about the profitability decrease in Europe last year. Here, what we have done, we have been working very hard, I have to say, during all the second part of last year, and we have worked, for example, on our protocols in the stores, we have worked on agenda management, we have also worked on training, and this kind of productivity measures that we have taken allowed us to basically hire the number of people that we needed to hire this year, also given the investment that we made already last year, so basically, the productivity I think that for now, it is a very good goal to go above 24.6.\n\nClearly, also, it will depend on the kind of revenue growth that we will be able to achieve. In terms of pricing, the effect of pricing will normalize this year. Of course, we had quite a good benefit coming from pricing last year, but this year, we will come back to our usual pricing fine-tuning. We do not see prices going down, eventually going up, but definitely in a more limited way than last year. With regard to the first question and, therefore, the competitive landscape amongst the different manufacturers, I can't really mention anything which is going to significantly change the future of the last few years, so there is nothing major to be mentioned. Okay, that's helpful.\n\nJust if I can just follow up on the margin point, could 25% be realistic with high single-digit growth, or would it need to exceed that? Well, as I said, I think that we have given today quite detailed, detailed, detailed guidance. Again, it depends, it depends, if we will be, the profitability increase will be higher, of course, if we will be in the upper range of revenue growth. Perfect, I'll jump back.\n\nThank you. The next question is from Hugo Solvet of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Hi, hello. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two as well.\n\nFirst, on current trading, you mentioned strong growth in January and February. Can you maybe give us a bit more detail? Are you tracking, or are you tracking again the three or 24 guidance for growth at or above a single digit and on margins at or above the 60 basis point improvement? And can you give us any details on the regional dynamics? Second, you mentioned that in the medium term, you're very positive about the growth prospect. Taking a step back in 2021, you gave us three-year guidance for single-digit growth and about 40 basis points of margin improvement per year. Going forward, my question is, do you see the same pace continuing, or are countries of a larger scale better mixing and investments now behind? Do you believe that there is room to push that higher?\n\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you for your questions. So with regard to the current trading, we are very happy about how January and February started in terms of both safe growth and profitability. In terms of regional dynamics, I would say that you can expect EMEA to be the one that improves profitability the most amongst the three regions, exactly as I was telling you before and, in particular, all the different productivity measures that we took in the second part of last year in the EMEA region. In terms of sales growth, as usual, you should expect America to be the fastest in terms of growth.\n\nBut we are also very happy about the kind of results that we are achieving in the APAC region, basically in all the different markets in which we are operating as of today. So, let me say that this is definitely more balanced growth, and all the three different regions are contributing to what I believe will be a good first quarter. With regard to the trajectory for the next years, of course, today I'm not going to give you guidance for the medium and long term, in the medium term, but, of course, we are positive. We are positive that we can restart the trajectory of positive growth also in profitability going forward. Okay, thank you.\n\nAnd if I can just squeeze one quick follow-up question, what are you expecting with regard to a wave of renewals in France in late 2024 and possibly in 2025? In terms of, please say again, the wave of renewals following the implementation of Fulgram-Boffin. Absolutely, absolutely.\n\nYes, clearly, I mean, we already see a more balanced mix between new customers and returning customers, and we expect this trend to actually continue in 2024. In 2025, we will anniversary the RAC0 reform in France.\n\nAnd this will definitely give a positive contribution also to the mix of returning customers. So yes, as of today, we definitely see a much more balanced mix between the new and returning customers. The next question is from Niccol Storer of Kepler.\n\nPlease go ahead. Good afternoon, Enrico and Gabriele. Two questions. The first one is on growth for the first two months, in particular in Europe, because I see that four quarters were still a quarter of 4% growth, which I imagine translates into no growth in volume terms. So my question is, have you already seen an inflation point on the European market in terms of volumes in January and February? And, in particular, if you can elaborate on Germany and France.\n\nThe second question is on profitability. If, in your guidance for this at least 60-bit expansion, you are also factoring in some improvements in the APAC region after years of decline, thank you. Thank you for the questions. I would start with the second...\n\nSo about the profitability for this year, yes, we expect the main contributors to the profitability increase for 2024 to be first of all EMEA, the EMEA region, and after EMEA APAC, also despite the increase in Chinese business. As usual, instead, we see more limited profitability increases in the Americas. But this is mainly related to the fact that, as you know, we are growing very fast in terms of transforming and increasing our network of direct-operated stores. With regard to the growth of January and February, I would say EMEA, perhaps in terms of market growth, should be in the region of something like 3%, while last year was negative.\n\nSo we definitely see a rebound, and we see that also in the two key markets of France and Germany, and in particular in France. I think that also during 2023, the market is improving in France throughout the year. What I mean is that, still, in Q4 it was slightly negative, but definitely much less negative than at the beginning of the year. So we also expect these two markets to come back to positive growth, which is good. Thank you. The next question is from Veronika Dubajova of Citi. Please go ahead. Hi guys, good afternoon, and thank you for taking my call. Hi, I have two please.\n\nThe first one is I just want to circle back to the productivity measures, Enrico, because if I look at the fourth quarter, there doesn't seem to be any benefit from these. So I'd love to understand a little bit more exactly what has changed. As you've gone through the course of the fourth quarter, and I guess as you think about the impact of these productivity measures on profitability through the year, does it get better each quarter, or is it already significant in Q1? So if you could elaborate on that. That would be helpful.\n\nAnd then my second question is just around America, and if you guys could give us the U.S. growth rate for the fourth quarter so that we can see what the clean U.S. number is on an organic growth basis, and then talk through your expectations about your ability to keep outgrowing the U.S. hearing aid market in 2024. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, Veronika.\n\nSo with regard to the first one and in particular the productivity measures that we have been working on in the second, basically, these measures were aimed at improving the productivity of our stores operation. During, before, actually, we worked on our protocols, we worked on our agendas in order to optimize the agendas of our audiologists, and we worked on training. And basically, at the end of the day, this allowed us to significantly reduce the number of people that we needed to hire in 2024 at the beginning of 2024 to sustain our growth path. Also, given the fact that this kind of investment was carried out already during the first part of last year. So, and why were not able to reap the benefits of these measures already in Q4? Basically, because there is an obvious time lag between the implementation of actions and the achievement of results.\n\nBut I can definitely confirm to you that in this first month and in this first quarter of this year, we are going to see the full benefit of all the work that we did in the last part of last year. With regard to the organic growth of the Americas in Q4, of course, I think that Gabriele already mentioned the fact that on the total Americas organic performance, there is an effect related to inflation accounting which is related to Argentina in the region of 10 percentage points. Let me say that in America, even after considering this, we are very strong in terms of organic growth.\n\nWe continued to outperform the market, so we continue to see very good results coming from our strategy implemented in the U.S. for a while. So we are very happy about how we are growing in the U.S. As you know, the U.S. is our priority number one in terms of growth going forward. And Enrico, can I just follow up on that? So did the U.S. grow 10%, 15%, somewhere in between? I'm just trying to understand that, and if indeed the number was just 10%, I mean, if I look at the HIA stats, the private market was very strong in the fourth quarter. So even if you did grow 10 to 15%, this just seems like less outperformance than we have seen from you historically. So I'm just trying to understand that.\n\nNo, no, I wouldn't say this. The US grew very, very strongly in terms of organic growth, well above 10%, let me say. So we have been, again, I think, outperforming the market and, More than this, it's really very difficult to ask. Also, please, if you are referring to the comparison with the reported number by HIA, which is the Association of Manufacturers.\n\nPlease always remember that these numbers are related to sell-in data, which can be affected by the launch of new products, stocking in large accounts, and so on and so forth. According to our estimation, we continue to outperform the U.S. market. Definitely. Thank you, guys.\n\nThank you. The next question is from Julien Ouaddour of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. So I have two as well. The first one is on Italy.\n\nSo do you have any update on the Italian government investigation into the hearing aids market? And should we expect any kind of decision in the coming months? Also, if you can run through sort of different potential scenarios you have, and what you would foresee for this, that would be helpful. The next question. So it's still in the US.\n\nYou've recently announced a large acquisition of franchises. Could you maybe update us on your US strategy for the short term and also for the midterm? So are there more large franchises, networks that you can buy?\n\nAnd if I'm correct, part of the growth you're seeing in the US comes from the fact that you capture much more of the value chain today by having direct retail as opposed to franchise. So as you continue this sort of intra-group acquisition, is it fair to believe America could continue to grow, let's say, at a double-digit growth rate organically, also underpinned by South America, and can manage care, which is growing very fast? Thank you. Thank you, Julien.\n\nSo with regard to the investigation by the competition authority in Italy, first of all, no, we don't have any further updates since last time, actually. I think that while some time ago the outcome was expected around February-March, now it is, I think, unlikely that a conclusion will be ready in the next few weeks, so perhaps it will come a bit later, but you know these are not things which are in my control, and therefore I can't really give you any more specific detail about that, as well as it is still very premature to make any conjectures. With regard to the second question and for our strategy in the U.S., we are super, pleased with how our business is performing in the U.S. Definitely the strategy to be more present through a direct-operated store network is definitely the winning one.\n\nAs you know, also in the case of the last acquisitions, as soon as we are able to manage directly some of our franchisees' operations, we are able to improve their performance quite significantly. This will make us confident that this is the right strategy going forward, and for sure, we will continue to pursue it. Pagianni, Michele Dellecour, Bruno Almosto, Francesca Rambaudi. With regard to what will be the growth of the Americas going forward, it is, you know, I don't give you precise guidance by region, but definitely the Americas and the U.S., in particular, thanks to this strategy that I just mentioned, and thanks also to the fact that a manager, I mean, our Amplifon hearing care And should we expect a bit more acquisition of franchises this year, or are you done with the 50 stores? No, no, no, no.\n\nFor sure, we are working in order to continue and to continue to accelerate our growth in the U.S., also pursuing our strategy. Sorry, it's not finished. Perfect, thank you very much. Thank you. The next question is from Shubhanji Gupta of HSBC. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two, please.\n\nFrance and Germany have been seeing some positive growth momentum. Could you comment on other European markets like Italy and Spain? What is the growth pattern you are seeing there? And second, for your FY24 growth outlook, what is your expectation for the U.S.? Because, as I understand it, the U.S. is more exposed to disposable income and has no social reimbursement.\n\nOkay, thank you, thank you. So, in general terms, let me say that we see the European market going back to positive growth. I mentioned before that I expect this growth, of course, to be underpinned by some growth both in France and Germany. France was negative last year, but also in Italy and Spain. We see a positive market also in this very early part of the year. So, we expect a more normalized European market in 2024 for sure. With regard to the second question and the development of the U.S. market, for sure, we also expect the U.S. market to be the fastest growing market amongst the mature markets in which we operate. Difficult to say a number, but it definitely will be higher than Europe.\n\nI would not expect the same kind of growth that we saw in 2023, though. So that's definitely very solid, very strong, but below 2024. I would say something in the region of 5-6%.\n\nThank you. The next question is from Oliver Metzger of Odo BHF. Please go ahead. Yeah, good afternoon.\n\nThanks a lot for taking my questions. The first one is on your bottom line guidance. So, potentially, I'm just missing something, but we see on the one hand quite good growth, in particular in Europe, which is the most profitable region, to my understanding. You have also initiated the productivity gains, giving both the operating leverage. I would have expected something even stronger, a bottom line or margin improvement, in particular as, basically, you target the 22 levels. So potentially, you can also talk about what are right now the factors which basically hold back profitability. And the second question is, in Europe, in particular in Germany, so we saw quite a... The strange situation with all the health insurances prolonged the repurchase cycle. Now, do you see some stabilization that is, that is the new normal, or do you also see the potential that it might be returned to previous shorter cycles? Thank you very much. Right, I will answer the second one, and I will leave the first one to Gabriele.\n\nSo, with regard to Germany, I would expect this year, let's say, to come back to the usual kind of growth that we have been experiencing in the last few years. I do not expect any change, at least as of today, in the way that the reimbursement rules were set by a large insurance company last year, so I do not see anything major changing there. With regard to the first question instead, maybe Gabriele?\n\nAbout the bottom line, Oliver, of course, this year we suffered a bit from the market situation. I mean, as you know, we are investing a lot, and we have been investing a lot over the last year. And so we did this year.\n\nThese, of course, raised the level of depreciation, not only in terms of normal depreciation but also in terms of BPA. And on the other hand, the increase in the interest rate, even if our credit lines are mostly at a fixed rate, of course, increased in light of the very important jump in terms of the cost of money. So moving forward, we are improving our EBITDA margin. We are improving our revenue, as Enrico was commenting before. So we should be reverting to a much more positive impact on lines below EBITDA. And what I can tell you is that the kind of improvement we were discussing before with Enrico in terms of EBITDA margin can also be reflected below at the level of EBIT margin. Then on the tech side, generally, we go on improving a little bit on a yearly basis. Okay, just a very quick follow-up, if it's possible in this context. So, what would you describe as one of the two most prominent headwinds on IBITDA?\n\nIs it still labor inflation, or is it obviously investments in growth? Not sure. Oliver, you're asking the headwind on EBITDA, for example, labor... Yes, yes, yes, yes, for 24. I just want to understand the dynamics a bit better.\n\nWell, actually, for 2024, we are positive that EBITDA is going to increase pretty significantly, as we mentioned before, by more than 60 basis points. Then, as I also said, of course, this number can be exceeded or not. It will, well, it can be exceeded by..., something or not, it will depend on revenue growth. Clearly, if we are in the upper part of the guidance, of the outlook in terms of revenue growth, maybe we can do better. So, but as of today, I would stick to what I said before, and I think it's a very.., very good objective for this year, but, in general terms, I'm positive, as I said before that 2024 will be a very good year and also that we can also continue a positive trajectory going forward in terms of profitability. Okay, I will leave it. May we go to the last two in the queue, please, so we can finish off? Operator, sorry. Excuse me?\n\nCan we go to the last two people in the queue, so we finish off, please, thank you. Okay, so the next question is from Robert Davies or Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a couple.\n\nOne was just on, I guess, a quantification of the size of the investment in field capacity you made last year, just so we can sort of see how big of an impact that had on the margins over the year. I know you made a comment that you made some investments. I just wondered if you could quantify that.\n\nAnd the second was just on your expectations for CapEx spend. I noticed the free cash flow this year came in a bit weaker than expected. I just wanted to get some clarity around what your expectations for CapEx for 2024 and beyond are. Thank you. Absolutely, well, in terms of field capacity in 2023, in total, we had a significant number of additional people, including, of course, the acquisitions that we made to increase our headcount in the field. In total, actually, it was up by more than 1,000 people, so a significant number of a significant number of people, the very vast majority of which was actually in the field.\n\nAs I said, this investment was made at the beginning of the year forecasting a definitely a much more positive market for Europe and, therefore, faster growth in Europe, which did not happen. As soon as we realized this, which means, let's say, last May or June, we started to work on the productivity measures that I've mentioned before, which at the end of the day resulted in the fact that this year we are not going to have additional people from an organic viewpoint. We will have more people, of course, coming from the acquisitions, but from an organic viewpoint, we will not be needing any meaningful number of additional people, and this will result in a much better ratio of labor cost to sales and, therefore, on productivity and, therefore, on profitability. With regard to Caprex,\n\nYeah, in terms of Caprex, as you know, we invested in the past something a bit lower compared to 2023, so I believe that 2023 was quite an exceptional year in terms of strong investment. Also, to recover a little bit some of the non-strategic investment that maybe we sacrificed. Moving forward, I believe that we should figure out something a little bit lower compared to 2023. So 2023 was 1.39; I would say something in the range of 1.30, maybe more realistic for 2024.\n\nThank you. Thank you. Last one.\n\nThe last question is from David Adlington of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Hey guys, thanks for the questions. Most of them have been answered, but maybe just on, following on from Robert's question about CapEx, that's also had a spike, and that's resulting in some higher depreciation and also some higher debt levels. Maybe you could give us some quick guidance for depreciation and amortization and also net financials for FY24? And then just related, again, following on the free cash flow point, thank you for the CapEx guidance. Just wondered if you're expecting free cash flow, obviously down quite a lot in 23, is it expecting a decent recovery in 24, and could you get back to 2022 levels? Thanks. Yeah, yeah.\n\nI mean, looking at depreciation, our depreciation has been increasing around 20 million per year over the last year, including M&A and activation. So, I believe something in line with this kind of increase may be feasible. In terms of financial expenses, I believe that this year we were in a mixed situation in the sense that, on the one hand, we saw interest rates among the highest in our history. On the other hand, it's also true that we benefited from a huge portion of financial debt negotiated at a fixed interest rate during 2020 and 2021. So, moving forward, we should have on the one side a larger portion of variable interest rate debt. On the other side, we should see some lower interest rates on the short-term ones.\n\nAll in all, of course, 2024 is going to be a little bit higher compared to the 49.5 million euros we saw. In terms of free cash flow, it's true that this year we were lower compared to last year, but it's also true that last year, 2022, and 2021 were two peculiar years when we implemented a lot of action on operating and non-operating working capital. So in terms of the ability to regenerate, it should include some sort of release of working capital, both in the 2021 and 2022 free cash. Of course, this year we also suffered because of a lower EBITDA, because we invested a lot not only in capex but also in people, as Enrico was mentioning. So next year I'm quite positive about degeneration, because we should be able to leverage a very much more positive EBITDA at a certain point compared to this year, and then, as I was commenting in the previous question, also in terms of capex, so we should be investing something less, so strict cash flow is guaranteed.\n\nThank you. I think this concludes today's call. So, thank you all for your interest and attendance, and we kindly ask the operator to disconnect. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us. The conference is now over. You may disconnect your telephones. Thank you. You don't want to see me dancing with somebody if you don't believe that anything could stop me. You don't know me."

Welcome, and thank you for joining the Amplifon Third Quarter and 9 Months 2023 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Francesca Rambaudi, Investor Relations and Sustainability Senior Director of Amplifon. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nFrancesca Rambaudi\n\nInvestor Relations Director\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Amplifon's Conference Call on Third Quarter and First 9 months. Before we start, a few logistic comments. Earlier today, we issued a press release related to our results, and this presentation is posted on our website in the Investors section. Second, the call can be accessed also via webcast and dial-in details are on Amplifon's website as well as on the press release.\nI have to bring your attention to the disclaimer on Slide 2 as some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements. With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Amplifon's CEO, Enrico Vita.\n\nEnrico Vita\n\nCEO, MD & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Francesca, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our Q3 results conference call. As always, let's begin commenting on the quarter's results, starting with the top line.\nWe posted excellent revenue growth of more than 11% at constant exchange rates and close to 6% at current exchange rates, fueled by a very good organic growth at 9%, one of the highest organic growth ever. This performance is particularly remarkable considering we operated in a context of global market demand that is clearly moving at a different speed.\nIn fact, we saw a strong market growth in the U.S. at circa plus 10%, while we estimate that Europe, our core market, was still slightly negative circa minus 1%, minus 2%. And clearly, this development in Europe was unexpected for us, also considering the easier comparison based to the previous year.\nAustralia and New Zealand combined are in the middle of the 2 regions with a slightly positive combined growth of around plus 1%, plus 2%. About Europe, we estimated that the key markets like France and Germany were in negative territory, in particular, France, the largest market in Europe, suffered a market decrease versus previous year, close to 10%.\nWith specific reference to France, we believe that this very negative performance was mainly because of the effect of the [ Rank 0 ] reform back in 2021, early 2022, that distorted the baseline for this year and also, although to a lesser extent, to the fact of the shift from both GFPs and ENT is being able to prescribe hearing gate to new customers in 2022, basically only ENTs in 2023. However, we are positive that for both France and Germany, the market demand will normalize and return to positive growth rates during 2024.\nIn such market scenario, we grew very strongly, gaining a significant market share, also thanks to a clear decision that we made. The decision to accelerate investments to gain market share and strengthen our global leadership further. In fact, we are convinced that playing offense is the right choice at such time. And I'm pleased to see that this choice is paying off in terms of sales growth.\nAs you can see from our very strong organic growth, one of the highest ever, as I said earlier on. In such a context, I cannot avoid highlighting once again, our performance in Americas nor geographies and in particular, in the U.S., where our growth led by Miracle-Ear direct network and Amplifon Hearing Health Care was again excellent.\nIn the region, we reported growth of almost 25% at constant ForEx. At this time, I would like also to highlight the performance in the APAC region, where we grew more than 16% at constant exchange rate, outperforming also here the market in all key countries. And today, I'm pleased also to share the achievement of an important milestone of our journey in China. In the beginning of October, we have passed the mark of 300 stores. And today, I can also tell you that we are confident that we can reach about 400 stores by the end of the year by January at the latest.\nLet me say that I'm very happy about the work and the execution capabilities of our team in building a very solid and future-proof platform in a country which will represent one of our sources of growth in the medium and long term. Even in EMEA, we grew faster than the market, although it was our lowest growth region, but this only because of the weaker-than-expected market demand I mentioned earlier.\nFinally, revenues from M&A continued to develop strongly and according to our plan. In fact, the contribution from acquisition was above 2 percentage points. Commenting about profitability, as said, we have taken a precise decision to invest in 2 key areas of our business. First of all, and mainly in our field organization to better serve our customers. You may recall that we discussed about a tight audiologist market in some key countries, in particular, in France and Australia.\nHere, we have conducted a comprehensive recruiting plan in a few of this market, of our market to ensure that audiologists are not longer limitation to our current and future growth. Second, we have continued to invest in Europe, both in marketing and in our brand, which is the most appropriate choice at time of lower consumer confidence. Clearly, the already mentioned lower growth in EMEA is also affecting our group profitability from a pure geographical viewpoint, being EMEA, our most profitable region.\nWith that, I now hand over to Gabriele to give you more details about our regional performance in more detail.\n\nGabriele Galli\n\nExecutive of Financial Reporting & Corporate Accounting Information and CFO\n\nThanks, Enrico, and good afternoon to everybody. Moving to Slide #4. We have a look at the group financial performance in Q3, which, as already commented by Enrico posted an excellent revenue growth at 11.4% at constant ForEx, with a record organic growth at 9% despite a softer-than-expected European market and 1 trading day less.\nOur organic performance was clearly driven by significant share gains and positive pricing development. M&A contribution from bolt-on acquisition in France, Germany, U.S., Canada and China was a remarkable 2.4%. FX had a significant negative impact accounting for minus 5.7% due to the depreciation of U.S. dollar, Australian dollar and Argentine peso.\nEBITDA recurring came in at EUR 110 million, with margin at 20.7% versus the extremely challenging comparison base in Q3 2022, which posted, as you may remember, a record profitability with an EBITDA margin of 21.8%. The profitability reduction versus '22 is due to lower operating leverage in EMEA due to softer-than-expected market primarily related to France and Germany, strong investments in audiologists capacity and marketing, as pointed out by Enrico, a less favorable geographic mix and finally, a negative ForEx impact.\nMoving to Chart #5, we have a look at our financial performance in the first 9 months. Revenues were up around 10% at constant ForEx, with a very strong and above market organic growth at 7.6% and M&A contribution at over 2% and the negative FX impact at around 3%. EBITDA recurring amounted to EUR 386 million, up 4.4% versus 9 month '22, with margin at 23.5%, down 50 basis points versus '22 in light of the previously mentioned results.\nMoving to Slide 6. We have a look at EMEA performance. Revenue growth at constant ForEx was around 6% versus '22 with a well above market organic growth up 5%, driven by share gains and positive pricing development in a still slightly negative market demand and with a negative impact of 1 trading day less. M&A contribution in France and Germany was close to 1%. EBITDA amounted to EUR 83 million, up around 1% versus '22 with margin at 25%, down 110 basis points versus a challenging comparison base last year, which posted an EBITDA margin October 26%, plus 60 basis points versus '21.\nThe result was driven by the reduced operating leverage in a softer-than-expected market while strongly investing in audiologists capacity, especially in France, and the marketing to unlock constraints and take advantage versus other players. In the 9 months, revenue growth was circa 5% with a solid and above market organic growth at 4% and around 1% contribution coming from M&A. EBITDA amounted to over EUR 300 million, up 3% versus 22% with margin of 28.1%.\nMoving to Slide 7. We have a look at another outstanding performance of Americas, despite a very challenging '22 comparison base, which posted a revenue growth of 27% versus Q3 '21. Revenue growth was around 25% at constant FX with an excellent organic growth at over 17%, driven by an outstanding performance in the U.S. of both Miracle-Ear direct retail and Amplifon Hearing Health Care.\nM&A contribution primarily related to U.S. and Canada was over 7%. FX effects had a significant negative impact of 16.6% driven by the strong euro appreciation versus the U.S. dollar and the very strong devaluation of the Argentine peso. EBITDA amounted to EUR 26.8 million with margin at 24.6%, in line versus 2022, also after the strong acceleration of Miracle-Ear retail business. In the 9 months, revenues were up 22.7% at constant ForEx driven by an excellent organic growth of around 16% despite the '22 very strong comparison base.\nEBITDA amounted to EUR 84 million, up 14.5% [ with ] '22 very strong comparison base. EBITDA amounted to EUR 84 million, up 14.3% versus '22 with margin up 10 basis points at 26.1%. Moving to Slide 8. We have a look at Asia Pac, where we posted an excellent performance. Revenues were up over 16% at constant ForEx, mainly driven by an outstanding organic growth at 14% with all markets of the region performing double digits. M&A contribution was 2.5% related to China expansion plan. FX headwind was strong at minus 12.2%.\nEBITDA was at EUR 23.8 million, with margin at 26.5% and up 10 basis points versus '22, even after the very strong China growth. In the 9 months, revenue were up over 15% at constant ForEx and 7.4% at current ForEx, driven by an excellent organic growth of around 14%. EBITDA amounted to EUR 66.5 million, up 6% versus '22 with margin at 26%, with a contraction of 30 basis points due to the onetime cost for the change of leadership in the region in Q2.\nMoving to Slide #9. Finally, let me spend a few words on China since we have surpassed the 300-plus stores, a key milestone in our journey. We have, in fact, entered the fast-growing Chinese market only in 2018. And in just a few years, we have become one of the most important players with over 300 points of sales covering the [ teen ] provinces and special municipalities, over 700 employees, of which 600 are hearing care professionals.\nChina represents a very important opportunity for the Amplifon's medium and long-term growth given the market size and the exceptional growth potential. As a result of our recent and successful acquisition strategy, Amplifon's global network has now reached 9,500 points of sales globally. Moving to the next chart. We appreciated the Q3 profit and loss. As previously mentioned in the quarter, total revenues at constant FX increased by 11.4% with a record 9% organic and a 2.4% acquisition growth, with the revenues of current FX growing by 5.7% at over EUR 530 million.\nEBITDA recurring came in at EUR 110 million, with a margin at 20.7% versus 21.8% in 2022 record level. When we implemented some cost containment measures, related to the non-strategic investments. As previously mentioned, the profitability reflects the lower operating leverage in EMEA and the less favorable geographic mix due to the softer-than-expected demand -- market demand in Europe, coupled with very strong investments in the business. EBITDA reported was around EUR 108 million after EUR 2 million one-off costs. D&A, including PPA increased by EUR 4 million versus last year in light of the increased investment in network, IT infrastructure and innovation.\nLeading the recurring EBITDA to EUR 45.4 million versus EUR 49 million in Q3 '22. Net financial expenses amounted to EUR 13.2 million versus EUR 8.3 million in Q3 '22 due to the increase in interest rate and short-term debt and on the limited portion of long-term facilities at variable rate since, as you know, most of our long-term debt is at fixed rate. The nonmonetary negative impact of inflation accounting on the Argentinian subsidiary. And finally, the higher figurative interest expenses on network leases following the application of IFRS 16.\nTax rate posted a 10 bps reduction versus '22, leading recurring net profit at around EUR 23.5 million versus EUR 29.7 million in Q3 '20. Moving to Slide 11. We see the 9-month profit and loss evolution. Total revenues increased by 9.7% at constant ForEx with an outstanding 7.6% organic component and a 2.1% M&A contribution, and by 6.8% at current ForEx to EUR 1.645 billion. Recurring EBITDA increased by 4.4% to EUR 386 million, with margin at 23.5%, down 50 basis points versus 9 months '22 record level for the previously mentioned reasons.\nD&A, including PPA increased by around EUR 14 million, leading the recurring EBIT to EUR 193 million, with a growth of around a couple of million versus 9 months '22. Net financial expenses accounted for EUR 36.9 million in light of the previously mentioned factors in addition to some FX differences related to swings in North and South America, leading profit before tax to around EUR 156 million from EUR 165.7 million in the 9 months '22. Tax rate ended at 27.7% leading recurring net profit to EUR 113 million versus EUR 120 million last year.\nMoving to Slide #12. We appreciate the cash flow evolution. Operating cash flow after lease liabilities was in the period equal to EUR 169 million versus EUR 218 million exceptional level achieved in 2022. When the group implemented several actions delivering a considerable improvement of the working capital. Net CapEx increased significantly by almost EUR 25 million, to circa EUR 100 million. As mentioned by Enrico, we are, in fact, strongly investing not only in people and marketing, but also in our network, IT infrastructure and innovation.\nAfter CapEx, free cash flow amounted to EUR 69 million. Net cash out for M&A posted a significant increase as well to EUR 83 million versus EUR 52 million last year, following the strong acceleration of bolt-on M&A with 220 shops acquired in the first 9 months of 2023. NFP ended at EUR 918 million after a remarkable investment for around EUR 250 million in CapEx, M&A and dividend.\nMoving to Slide 13. We have a look at the debt profile trend and key financial ratios. As mentioned, the net financial debt closed at EUR 918 million, with liquidity accounting for EUR 200 million, short-term debt accounting for EUR 450 million and the medium long-term debt accounting for EUR 666 million. Following the IFRS 16 application, lease liabilities amounted to EUR 488 million, leading the sum of the net financial debt and lease liability to EUR 1.4 billion.\nEquity ended up at around EUR 1.07 billion. Looking at financial ratios. Net debt over EBITDA ended at 1.63x billion, slightly increasing versus 1.52x December last year after the strong investments in CapEx, M&A and dividends. Net debt over equity ended at 0.86x. I would now hand over to Enrico for the outlook and the closing remarks.\n\nEnrico Vita\n\nCEO, MD & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Gabriele, and let's go to the final chart of our presentation. First, let me remark that even if some key European markets, like France and Germany, currently present some temporary challenges. Please remember that, for example, France accounts for about 25% of the total European market. Our revenue growth in Q3 was very strong, significantly above market and in line with our plans.\nLooking that to Q4, we expect still a healthy market in the U.S., while we expect the European market still to be somewhat subdued until the end of the year. again, mainly due to Germany and above all, France. However, as said, we believe that there are some contingent and specific reasons for that performance, in particular in the French market. And therefore, we expect the market demand in both markets to normalize and return to positive growth rates during 2024. In light of this context, as we approach the year-end, today, we can give you the following more detailed outlook for 2023.\nWe expect our revenues to develop in line with our plan and the outlook we gave you in early May. Net, of course, the negative currency impact versus the previous currency assumptions, impact that now we can estimate of about EUR 30 million on sales. Numbers, this means that we expect revenues in the region of EUR 2.29 billion for the year. So corresponding to EUR 2.32 billion at previous currency assumptions. This forecast implies for the full year.\nRevenue growth at constant exchange rate of circa 11%, of which almost 9% is organic. And let me tell you that I'm very satisfied with this growth especially considering the weaker-than-expected market in our core geography, which is Europe. Regarding profitability, because of our accelerated investments, mainly in audiologist capacity in particular in EMEA in order to unlock some [ motornecks ] and support future growth. We now see an EBITDA recurring at circa EUR 550 million after the negative impact versus the previous assumptions of about EUR 10 million. Hence, corresponding to EUR 560 million at the outlook of ForEx.\nWe are very convinced, in fact, we must play offense as we see a concrete opportunity to gain market share and further strengthen our leadership position and also prepare ourselves for a more normalized market development next year. With this, I will turn the floor to Francesca for the Q&A session. Francesca?"

This is the Chorus Call conference operator. Welcome, and thank you for joining the Amplifon Second Quarter and First Half 2023 Results Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Francesca Rambaudi, Investor Relations Director of Amplifon. Please go ahead, madam.\n\nFrancesca Rambaudi\n\nInvestor Relations Director\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Amplifon Conference Call on Second Quarter and First Half of 2023 results.\nBefore we start, a few logistic comments. Earlier today, we issued a press release related to our results, and this presentation is posted on our website in the Investors section. The call can be accessed also via webcast and dial-in details are on Amplifon's website as well as on our press release.\nI have to bring your attention to the disclaimer on Slide 2 as some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements.\nWith that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Amplifon's CEO, Enrico Vita.\n\nEnrico Vita\n\nCEO, MD & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Francesa, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our Q2 results conference call. So let's start commenting on our revenue growth for the quarter in a market, which was softer than we expected only a few months ago, confirming that some volatility still persist in the market. In fact, we estimate our reference market in Q2 was slightly positive by circa 1% with still a solid growth in the U.S. at circa 5% in APAC. But with negative development in Europe.\nWe estimate that the European market in Q2 contracted by circa 2%, 3%. Nevertheless, -- in Q2, our growth was very strong in absolute terms and also compared to the market environment that I just described. In fact, despite this, our revenues increased by circa 9% at constant ForEx and by 6% at current exchange rate.\nAlso, I wanted to highlight the organic component of the growth that was very strong at circa 7%. Revenues for -- from M&A continues to develop strongly as well and according to our plans. In fact, the contribution from acquisitions was above 2 percentage points. In such a context, I cannot avoid highlighting our performance in the America and in particular, in the U.S., where our growth led by Miracle-Ear direct network and Amplifon Hearing Health Care was again very strong, well above the growth of the market from only a pure organic viewpoint.\nAnother performance that confirms that our strategy in the U.S. continues to work very well. In the region, we reported growth of more than 23% at constant ForEx and 15% at current exchange rates, thanks also to an excellent contribution from Latin America.\nFinally, on a global level, we estimated that also during this quarter, our revenues have led us to market share gains in all core markets. Then passing to profitability, EBITDA was up circa 4%, while the percentage margin was 60% -- 60 basis points below Q2 of last year, when we posted record profitability. On top of a very challenging comparison base, this decrease was mainly due to some temporary adverse factors. Plus, as you know, EMEA is our most profitable region. As EMEA, agree less than other regions, this geographic mix had a negative effect on total group of profitability.\nAnd EMEA itself reported lower profitability due to the lower-than-expected growth albeit above market and therefore, lower operating leverage. Finally, regarding Asia Pacific, we just appointed a new leader for the region and the cost related to this leadership transition impacted the profitability of the region as one-off.\nWith this, I now hand over to Gabriele to give you more colors about our financial performance.\n\nGabriele Galli\n\nExecutive of Financial Reporting & Corporate Accounting Information and CFO\n\nThanks, Enrico, and good afternoon to everybody. Moving to Slide #4. We have a look at the group financial performance in Q2, which, as already commented by Enrico, posted a very strong revenue growth at [ 8.8% ] at constant ForEx, with an above-market organic growth at 6.6% despite a softer-than-expected global market demand mainly due to a lower level of returning customer in EMEA.\nU.S. is growing at a healthy 5% though at a slower pace than Q1, one trading day less, which accounts for around 1.6% growth. The organic performance was driven by share gains and positive pricing development. Many contribution from bolt-on acquisition in France, Germany, U.S., Canada and China was at a remarkable 2.2%, probably accelerating since October 2022.\nForEx had a significant negative impact accounting for minus 2.8% due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, Australian dollar and adjusting peso. EBITDA recurring came in at EUR 152.5 million, with margin at 26.6% after strong reinvestment in the business, versus the extremely challenging comparison base in Q2 2022, which posted, as you may remember, a record profitability with an EBITDA margin of 27.2%, plus 40 basis points versus 2021.\nProfitability was affected by some temporary adverse factors already mentioned by Enrico, a less favorable geographic and business mix due to the slower growth in EMEA and the fast-growing direct retail business in the U.S. The lower operating leverage in EMEA due to the lower-than-expected growth [ bit ] above market and the shift to more costly new customers and then the onetime cost related to the change in leadership in Asia Pac.\nMoving to Slide 5. We have a look to our financial performance in H1. Revenues were up 9% at constant ForEx versus 2022 with a very strong and above market organic growth at 7%. M&A contribution of 2% and a negative ForEx impact at 1.6%. EBITDA recurring amounted to EUR 276 million, up around 6% versus H1 '21, with margin up 24.8%, down 30 basis points versus 2022 record profitability. In light of the previously mentioned results.\nMoving to Slide 6. We have a look at the EMEA performance. Revenue growth at constant ForEx was 3.2% versus 2022 with an above-market organic growth at 2.2%, achieved also thanks to a positive pricing development in a still negative market due to returning customers and with a negative impact of 1 trading day less corresponding to around 1.6 percentage point growth. M&A contribution in France and Germany was positive by 1%. EBITDA amounted to EUR 117.4 million, up around 1% versus 2022, with margin at 31.2%, down 70 basis points versus an exceptionally challenging comparison base in 2022, which posted a record EBITDA margin at 32% plus 90 basis points versus 2021.\nThe result was driven by reduced operating leverage following the lower organic performance, but without compromising on investment to enlarge the competitive advantage versus other players. In H1, revenue growth was 4.4% with an above-market 3.5% organic growth and 1% contribution coming from M&A. EBITDA amounted to circa EUR 217 million up 3.6% versus H1 2022 with margin at 29.6%.\nMoving to Chart #7. We have a look at another outstanding performance of Americas, despite the very challenging comparison base in 2022, which posted a revenue growth of over 21% versus Q2 '21. Revenue growth was 23.5% at constant ForEx with an excellent organic growth of 16.6%, driven by a very strong performance in the U.S. of both Miracle-Ear direct retail and Amplifon Hearing Health care, together with a double-digit organic growth in Latin America. M&A contribution primarily related to U.S. and Canada was almost 7%. ForEx had a negative impact of 8%, driven by the strong euro appreciation versus the U.S. dollar and the higher inflationary environment in Argentina.\nEBITDA amounted to EUR 32.3 million with margin at 28.9% increasing 10 basis point versus the remarkable comparison base of Q2 2022, when the group delivered a 100 basis point margin expansion versus in 2021. In H1, revenues were up 21.6% at constant ForEx, driven by an excellent organic growth of around 15%, despite the 2022 remarkable comparison base when the region grew by 25% versus H1. EBITDA amounted to EUR 57.1 million, up 17.6% versus H1 '22 with margin stable at 26.9% despite the strong acceleration of Miracle Ear retail business.\nMoving to Slide 8. we have a look at Asia Pac performance, where we posted an excellent revenue growth, further accelerating. Revenues were up over 16% at constant ForEx, mainly driven by the outstanding organic growth across all countries, boosted by the double-digit organic growth in Australia and the outstanding performance in China. M&A contribution was 1.5% related to China expansion plan and the ForEx headwind was minus 8.9%. EBITDA was EUR 20.9 million, with margin at 24.3% versus 25.7% in 2022. The 140 basis point contraction is entirely due to the onetime cost related to the change in leadership in the region.\nIn H1, revenues were up around 15% constant ForEx and around 9% of current ForEx driven by an excellent organic growth of around 14%. EBITDA amounted to EUR 42.6 million up circa 7% versus H1 '22 with margin up 25.8% with a contraction of 50 basis points due to the change of leadership commented before.\nMoving to Slide #9. We appreciate the Q2 profit and loss, in the quarter, total revenue increased by 6% to EUR 574 million with an excellent 6.6% organic growth versus Q2 '22. EBITDA recurring came in at EUR 152.5 million, with margin at 26.6% versus 27.2% 2022 record level. When we implemented some cost contending measures related to nonstrategic investments. As previously mentioned, the profitability reflected the less favorable geographic business mix and the onetime cost related to the changing leadership in Asia Pac and was achieved even after very strong reinvestment in the business.\nEBITDA reported was around EUR 149 million, up around EUR 4 million versus 2022 after EUR 3.4 million one-off cost primarily related to the application of IFRS 2 accounting principle for the share assignment previously communicated. D&A, including BBA, increased by EUR 6 million versus last year in light of the increased investment in network, IT infrastructure and innovation, leading the recurring EBITDA to EUR 86 million versus EUR 87 million in Q2 2022.\nNet financial expenses amounted to EUR 11.8 million versus EUR 8.9 million last year due to the no nonmonetary negative impact of inflation accounting on the Argentinian subsidiary. The higher figurative interest expenses on network leases following the application of IFRS 16, some exchange differences in America and some slightly higher interest rates on short-term credit lines. Even if, as you know, most of our debt is at fixed rate. Tax rate posted a 10 basis point reduction versus 22, leading recurring net profit at around EUR 54.5 million versus EUR 57 million in Q2 last year.\nMoving to Slide #10, we see the H1 profit and loss evolution. Total revenues increased by 9% at constant ForEx and 7.4% of current ForEx to EUR 1.14 billion. Recurring EBITDA increased by 6.1% to EUR 276 million with margin up 24.8% down 30 basis points versus H1 '22 for the previously mentioned regions. D&A, including PPA, increased by around EUR 11 million, leading the recurring EBIT to around EUR 148 million with a growth of around 3.7% or EUR 5 million versus H1 last year.\nNet financial expenses accounted for EUR 23.7 million in light of the previously mentioned regions, leading profit before tax to around EUR 124 million from EUR 125 million in H1 last year. Tax rate ended at 27.8%, leading recurring net profit to EUR 89.3 million, in line with H1 2022.\nMoving to Slide 11. We appreciate the cash evolution Operating cash flow after lease liabilities was in the period equal to EUR 130 million, EUR 18 million below the EUR 156 million, outstanding level achieved in 2022, when the group implemented several actions delivering a considerable improvement in the working capital. Net CapEx increased by almost EUR 14 million to circa EUR 62 million, leading free cash flow to over EUR 76 million.\nNet cash out for our M&A posted a significant increase to almost EUR 60 million versus EUR 31 million last year, following the significant acceleration of postal amenity with 140 shops acquired in the first month of 2022. MSP ended EUR 884 million, posting a seasonal increase versus December '22 after strong investment or over EUR 185 million in CapEx M&A in dividends and posted a reduction of around EUR 11 million versus June 2022 comparison period.\nMoving to Slide 12. We have a look at the debt profile and key financial ratios. As mentioned is the net financial debt closed at EUR 884 million with liquidity accounting for EUR 215 million, shorter net accounting for around EUR 432 million and medium long-term debt accounting for around EUR 667 million. Following the IFRS 16 application, lease liability amounted to around EUR 482 million leaving the sum of net financial debt and lease liability to EUR 1.37 billion.\nEquity ended up at around EUR 1 billion. Looking at financial ratios. Net debt over EBITDA ended at 1.57x, slightly increasing versus 1.5x at December last year. after strong investment in CapEx, M&A and dividends, while posting an [ lessoned ] decrease versus the 1.67x in June 2022. And debt over equity ended at 4.85x.\nMoving to Chart 13. We have a look at the additional finance of up to EUR 650 million secured during the first semester. In June, we signed a new sustainability linked the revolving credit facility with a pool of tax for a total amount of EUR 300 million. This facility has a 3-year term and an extension option for additional 2 years at the company's discretion. In July, we signed a EUR 300 million loan agreement with the European Investment Bank to further accelerate our innovation and digitalization process. It is lower part of the EUR 350 million financing approved by the European investment bank, may be drawn in several tranches over the next 24 months and are then a further 9-year maturity with a very favorable financial conditions compared to those currently available in the market.\nThese 2 facilities allow the group to further optimize the gross financial structure, both in terms of cost of funding and expansion of average maturity and confirm the very strong financial profile of the group with a financial headroom of over 800 million, including available liquidity and undrawn committed last year. I would now hand over to Enrico for the outlook and the closing remarks.\n\nEnrico Vita\n\nCEO, MD & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Gabriele . So some key messages to conclude with today's presentation. No doubt some volatility still persist in the current external environment for all the very well-known reasons. In this context, our growth in H1 was strong, above market and overall in line with our plans. So a couple of comments looking ahead to the second half of the year. First, the comparison base will ease in H2, and particularly in Q4. Then Q3 started positively with revenues showing a strong growth also in July at around 10% at constant exchange rate. In any case, we as usual, expects to continue to grow faster than the market also in H2.\nAll that said and assuming has already shared the market back to growth in 2023 in the region of plus 2%, 3%, we can today confirm our overall guidance for the year. With this, I turn the floor to Francesca for the Q&A session.\n\nFrancesca Rambaudi\n\nInvestor Relations Director\n\nThanks, Enrico, I kindly ask operator to open today's Q&A session.

The cost in the access also via webcast and dial-in details are on Amplifon's website as well as on our press release.\nI have to bring your attention to the disclaimer on Slide 2 as some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements.\nWith that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to our CEO, Enrico Vita.\n\nEnrico Vita\n\nCEO, MD & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Francesca. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Today, I'm pleased to comment on a great quarter. One of our best quarters, even above our expectations. Definitely, I would say the best way to start the new year after all the turbulences of last year. Our performance was supported by a market demand finally better to a positive growth, but also by our relative performance once again above market.\nSo let's immediately review some of the quarter's key numbers and achievements together. Revenues were up 9% at current exchange rates and 9.3% at constant exchange rates. More importantly, the composition of the growth was excellent. And in fact, the organic growth was at a remarkable 7.4%.\nClearly, the pricing actions I anticipated to you during our last conference call, supported this high organic growth. And today, I can share that these actions have been executed very well, and the current outcome is even above our initial expectations.\nM&A contribution was also strong at almost 2%. Thanks to our bolt-on acquisitions, which has accelerated, as already discussed, in the last part of last year and during this first quarter, also thanks to decreasing multiple expectations by the sellers.\nRegarding the recurring EBITDA, we delivered around EUR 124 million, increasing by almost 10% versus 2022, while the margin increased by 10 basis points to 22.9%. Then we posted a net profit recurring of EUR 35 million increasing by 6% versus 2022.\nFinally, the net financial position was at EUR 826 million, further reducing versus year-end despite the lower seasonality of our business in Q1. All in all, we are very healthy about our results in this initial part of the year. And now I hand it over to Gabriele to give you more color about our financials.\n\nGabriele Galli\n\nExecutive of Financial Reporting & Corporate Accounting Information and CFO\n\nThanks, Enrico, and good afternoon, everybody. Moving to Chart #4, we have a quick look at the group financial performance in Q1, which as already commented by America after the truly excellent start to the year. In the quarter, revenues at constant ForEx increased by over 9% versus '22 with an excellent above-market organic growth at 7.4%, despite the very tough comparison base. In fact, revenues in Q1 '22 were 16% higher than in Q1 '21. The very strong organic performance was driven by a market demand but back into positive territory, primarily for the U.S. product market, share gains and positive pricing development.\nM&A contribution strongly accelerating since October was around 2%. ForEx was negative for 0.3%, primarily for the Argentine peso and the Australian dollar impact, more than offsetting the U.S. dollar [indiscernible]. EBITDA recurring changing at almost EUR 124 million, with a margin of 22.9%, up 10 basis point versus thanks to solid operational leverage while strongly investing for the growth.\nMoving to Chart #5. We have a look at being a very strong performance. Revenue growth at [indiscernible] ForEx was 6% versus '22, with a strong and above market organic growth of 5%. Despite still some market-related softness and the challenging comparison base.\nM&A contribution related to bolt-on in France and Germany was around 1%. Strong organic growth was reported in Italy and Germany as well as a sequential recovery versus year-end '22 in Spain and France. EBITDA amounted to EUR 100 million, up 7% versus '22, with margin of 27.8%, up 30 basis points, thanks to strong operational efficiency.\nMoving to Chart #6. We have a look at another outstanding performance of Americas despite a very challenging comparison base. In fact, last year, revenues grew 30% versus Q1 '21. Revenue growth was over 19% at constant ForEx with an excellent organic growth of around 13%, driven by an outstanding performance in the U.S., especially for Miracle-Ear and divest retail and Amplifon Hearing Health Care in LatAm.\nM&A contribution primarily related to U.S. and Canada was over ForEx success was positive for 0.6%, driven by U.S. dollar appreciation, partially offset by the high inflation in Argentine. EBITDA amounted to EUR 24.8 million, with margin at 24.6%, in line with the Q1 '22 after strong investment in the business.\nMoving to Slide #7, we have a look at Asia Pac performance, where we posted an excellent revenue growth as well as profitability improvement. Revenues were up over 15% at constant ForEx, mainly driven by the outstanding organic growth boosted by Australia in China after the negative impact of [indiscernible] in 2022.\nM&A contribution related to China was 0.8%. ForEx [indiscernible] was minus 2%. EBITDA reached EUR 21.7 million, an increase of 12.5% compared with '21, with margin at 27.3%, 20 basis points higher versus Q1 '22 being back to positive operating leverage also after significant continued investment in the business.\nMoving to Slide #8. We appreciate the Q1 profit and loss. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 9% to EUR 540 million, with an excellent 7.4% organic growth versus Q1 '22. By far the strongest quarter last year with an outstanding 9% organic growth versus 2021.\nEBITDA recurring came in at EUR 123.5 million, increasing 9.5% or around EUR 11 million with margin of 22.9%, 10 basis points above Q1 '22 record level after stronger reinvestment in the business versus last year when we implemented some cost containment measures related to nonstrategic investments and other operating costs due to the softer-than-expected market conditions.\nEBITDA reported was around EUR 116 million, up around EUR 6 million versus 2022. After around EUR 8 million one-off nonmonetary costs, primarily related to the application of IFRS 2 accounting principle to the share of assignment to the CEO already communicated with [indiscernible].\nOrdinary D&A and PPA were EUR 62 million versus EUR 58 million last year in light of the increased investment in network, IT infrastructure and innovation. Net financial expenses amounted to EUR 11.9 million versus EUR 8.4 million in Q1 2022. In light of the extraordinary exchange differences related to ForEx wins in America and of the increase in interest rates although, as you know, our credit line are mostly at fixed rates.\nTax rate, as usual, is slightly higher in the first quarter versus the following quarter due to seasonality of the 10 basis point reduction versus leading recurring net profit of around EUR 35 million versus EUR 32.8 million in Q1 2022.\nMoving to Slide #9, we appreciate the cash evolution. Operating cash flow after lease liabilities was in the period equal to EUR 73 million almost in line with the EUR 74.5 million outstanding level achieved in 2022.\nNet CapEx increased by EUR 5 million to EUR 27 million, leading free cash flow to over EUR 46 million. Net is out for M&A posted a significant increase to around EUR 39 million versus EUR 24 million last year following the significant acceleration of bolt-on M&A primarily in France, Germany, Canada and China with around 70 shops acquired in the quarter. [indiscernible] ended at EUR 826 million, posting an improvement versus year-end 2022 after strong CapEx and M&A effect.\nMoving to Slide 10. We have alluded a debt profile trend and key financial ratios. As mentioned, the net financial position closed at EUR 826 million with liquidity accounting for EUR 195 million, short-term debt accounting for around EUR 274 million and medium long-term debt accounting for around EUR 747 million. This confirms the very strong financial profile of the group with a financial headroom of over EUR 350 million, including the undrawn revolving credit facilities after the repayment of the U.S. PP we completed in general.\nFollowing the IFRS 16 application, lease liabilities amounted to around EUR 280 million, leading the sum of net financial debt and lease liability to EUR 1.3 billion. Equity ended up at around EUR 1.6 billion. Looking at net financial ratios, net debt over EBITDA ended at 1.48, improving versus 1.52 of December last year despite the seasonality and after the strong CapEx and bolt-on [indiscernible].\nNet debt over equity ended at 4.79.\nI would now hand over to Enrico for the [indiscernible] remarks.\n\nEnrico Vita\n\nCEO, MD & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Gabriele. So we are at the end of today's presentation, which contains several key very positive messages. First, the market demand is back to growth after 3 quarters of negative development. Second, our pricing actions have been implemented smoothly and are delivering strong results. Third, we continue to increase our share in most core markets and delivering on enabled funds.\nYearly, we are very satisfied about our performance in Q1, which further increases our confidence about a very positive 2023. In fact, this confidence translates into our outlook for the year. In terms of revenues, we now see our revenues growing in the region of EUR 2.3 billion, EUR 2.35 billion.\nRegarding EBITDA recurring we aim to end in the EUR 570 million, EUR 585 million region, also thanks to an easier comparison base, particularly in second half. Definitely, let me say, a strong set of good news for today. And with this, I want to thank you all for your attention, and we look forward to taking your questions. Francesca, over to you.\n\nFrancesca Rambaudi\n\nInvestor Relations Director\n\nThanks, Enrico. I kindly ask the operator to open today's Q&A session.

Equity markets were down 19% year-over-year, with the average equity markets down 3% sequentially. So far this year, we're starting to see markets rebound to some extent as inflation eases, However, inflation is still at a high level. The question is, will the Fed have to continue to raise rates a bit more? Or will they maintain higher rates for longer if inflation remains stickier? With that backdrop, Ameriprise continues to be in a strong position.\nRevenues were good at $3.6 billion, only down 2% from a year ago relating to the impact of the equity and fixed income markets. Earnings were up nicely with EPS up 13% for the quarter and 11% for the year, both on new records, and ROE continued to be excellent among the best in the industry. Importantly, we're also managing expenses well with total expenses down 5% compared to a year ago.\nAssets Under Management and Administration were down to $1.2 trillion largely driven by the steep decline in equity markets, lower fixed income markets and a difficult foreign currency translation and Asset Management. As in previous quarters, our combination of businesses generates a consistent level of free cash flow and good returns across market cycles. We're able to consistently invest in the business, which is strengthening our competitive position and our ability to deliver differentiated results.\nNow I'll talk more about our businesses. In Advice & Wealth Management, we continue to deliver very strong results and build on our leadership positions. We had good client flows in the quarter as clients remained engaged working closely with their advisers and benefiting from our comprehensive advice and solutions. Total client flows for the quarter were more than $12 billion, which is very strong, and in fact, the second highest quarter we had and just below our record fourth quarter last year. And I'll highlight that client flows were a record for the year at nearly $43 billion.\nWith the investment climate this year, we've seen an even split into the mix of flows into advisory and non-advisory accounts, which is appropriate in this environment. We're maintaining an appropriate level of cash balances with good growth in our certificate business and the Ameriprise Bank, which is a key growth area for us.\nWith regard to the bank, we've been consistently investing to expand our capabilities. The bank provides important flexibility in this interest rate environment and enables us to further engage and deepen our relationships with clients. Our bank has grown more than 50% this year to nearly $19 billion. We have good growth in our pledged loan business, and we're on track to launch more deposit and lending-based products this year. Our certificate company has also grown to nearly $10 billion, up $4 billion for the year.\nClearly, 2022 was a very challenging year for investors to navigate the market volatility. That's why our high level of engagement and advice is so important. Clients highlight the positive experience they're having with Ameriprise and our advisers. And that satisfaction leads to a strong level of trust, which we're being recognized for. And just recently, we ranked #2 for trust in 2022 in Forrester's new Financial Services Customer Trust Index, and that complements our Newsweek rating as one of America's most trusted companies last year.\nLet's look at adviser productivity, which also remained strong, up 4% to nearly $830,000 per advisers in a challenging market environment. One of the reasons our advisers are so productive as the level of support and tools we provide, we're making important investments, including our branding, marketing and integrated technology. We're helping advisers engage clients really well in driving growth in their practices. And for the fourth consecutive year, Ameriprise was recognized by J.D. Power for providing outstanding customer service experience for phone support for advisers.\nTurning to recruiting. We had another good quarter with 72 highly productive advisers joining the firm. Advisers are attracted to our value proposition and the strength and stability of the firm, and the pipeline looks good. So overall, we are consistently investing in the business, including the bank, which is helping to drive organic growth and continue to generate strong results. Advice & Wealth Management continue to drive the firm's results with earnings up 41% year-over-year.\nNow let's turn to Retirement & Protection Solutions, where earnings were up 25% in the quarter due to the improved rate environment and our ability to invest out. As part of our strategy, we focused on products that meet our risk tolerances. Overall, sales were down consistent with the industry. We're very much focused on variable annuities without living benefits, our structured products of variable universal life and DI products given our move away from fixed products. This business is very stable and delivers a very good cash flow and returns. I'd note that RiverSource was recently ranked as one of the most profitable life insurers.\nNow I'll cover Asset Management. 2022 was a tough year when navigating the volatility as we focused on our clients and execute our strategic priorities. Similar to the industry, our Asset Management business faced significant headwinds due to markets depreciating in the U.S. and globally, which pressured earnings. Equity markets were down 19%. With this, assets under management were down 23% to $584 billion, driven by market declines as well as a negative FX impact. Overall flows in the quarter were $0.4 billion out that included $1.7 billion of legacy insurance partner outflows. In retail, overall, we were in net outflows of $3.7 billion, including reinvested dividends, which were driven by the weak market conditions that both pressured gross sales and increased redemptions. In addition, in the U.S., we believe there was a heightened level of tax loss selling in December.\nTurning to Global Institutional, we were in net inflows of $5 billion, excluding legacy insurance partners with some nice wins in LDI strategies. With regard to investment performance, we continue to have solid 3-, 5- and 10-year numbers. However, we have weakness in one year's numbers given market volatility. In Asset Management, we are maintaining our expense discipline while continuing to invest in long-term priorities. They include our investment research, alternatives, responsible investment globalizing our operations and BMO integration, which is on track. We have a strong lineup of products and capabilities, a clear focus on serving our clients. And as the environment improves, we will be well situated.\nOverall, Ameriprise is in a position of strength entering 2023, and we're very much focused on engaging our clients and continuing to execute well in this environment. And with the strength and diversification of our business, including the growth of the bank, we continue to be able to invest across the firm, while continuing to return capital to shareholders at a differentiated level. In the fourth quarter alone, we returned $610 million to shareholders.\nI'll turn it over to Walter, and then we'll take your questions.\n\nThomas George Gallagher\n\nSenior MD, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division\n\nThank you, Jim. Results this quarter were very strong, and we continue to demonstrate the strength of the Ameriprise value proposition. Adjusted EPS increased 13% to $6.94 in the quarter and increased 11% for the full year. Our diversified business mix supports good performance across market cycles, which was certainly demonstrated in the quarter. Fundamentals & Wealth Management, particularly in its cash businesses were very strong. In total, Wealth Management now represents 64% of adjusted operating earnings up from 48% a year ago. Asset Management, like the industry, is facing substantial headwinds and earnings from this segment declined in the quarter. And the Retirement & Protection Solutions business continues to generate solid financial results and free cash flow.\nWe remain focused on the aspects of the business that we can control. We are executing our priorities, including investing for profitable business growth, expanding the bank and completing the integration of BMO all while meeting and exceeding client needs and maintaining a disciplined approach to managing expenses. In fact, total expenses, excluding BMO, were flat for the year. Our balance sheet fundamentals and free cash flow generation remains strong.\nIn the quarter, we returned $610 million of capital to shareholders, totaling $2.4 billion for the full year while continuing to grow the bank and certificate company. We have dedicated significant capital to grow these businesses.\nLet's turn to Slide 6. As you would expect in these markets, Assets Under Management and Administration ended the quarter at $1.2 trillion, down 17%. This was driven by depreciating markets with equity and fixed markets down 19% and 12%, respectively. Additionally, Asset Management AUM levels were impacted by the weakening of the pound and the euro, with 36% of Asset Management AUM outside the U.S. at the end of the year. Despite the lower AUMA levels, operating net revenues declined only 2% to $3.6 billion as a result of higher interest earnings and pretax earnings reached a new high of $973 million reflecting the diversified revenue dynamics I discussed, coupled with the excellent expense discipline.\nLet's turn to Advice & Wealth Management on Slide 7. Wealth Management continues to deliver strong organic growth and business momentum, a reflection of our differentiated value proposition. With the challenging market backdrop, clients' assets declined 12% to $758 billion in 2022. However, we have sustained growth of 4% over the past 2 years. Total client net flows remained very strong at over $12 billion in the quarter, and reached a record $43 billion for the full year.\nWhile we continue to see a solid level of flows into ARAP accounts. There has been a distinct pickup in flows going to brokerage accounts and certificates as clients navigate the market backdrop. Revenue per adviser reached $827,000, up 23% over the past 2 years from continued enhanced productivity and business growth.\nOn Slide 8, you can see Wealth Management profitability was exceptional, up 41% and reached a record margin of 30% as strong organic growth and higher interest earnings exceeded pressure from market depreciation and lower transactional activity. Adjusted operating expenses declined 5% with distribution expenses down 10%, reflecting lower transactional activity and lower client assets. G&A increased 11% in the quarter. And for the full year, G&A grew 8%. Expense growth in the quarter was driven by continued investments in the bank and higher volume-related activity from strong organic growth. Additionally, the prior year included unusually low expenses relating to staff levels and T&A.\nCash balances in the quarter increased year-over-year and sequentially to $47 billion, which included $10 billion of certificate balances. Cash rebalances have declined slightly, bringing it closer to historic levels. However, certificates have grown 76% year-over-year as clients are laddering liquidity to garner higher yields. As a complement to our certificate offering, we are continuing to build out our savings and deposit products in the bank this year to meet the growing client appetite for yield.\nAs a reminder, the majority of our clients sweep cash balances are working cash accounts with the average account size being only $8,000 and constituting over 60% of our total cash balances. And our operating rates continue to remain competitive with continuous benchmarking against the industry. This has translated into higher interest earnings in the quarter. The gross fee yield in the quarter reached 373 basis points, up 300 basis points from the prior year and over 100 basis points sequentially with bank and certificates driving most of it. The bank ended the year with assets of $19 billion with additional capacity to grow further. This provides flexibility to capture the benefits of rising entries by investing in high-quality, longer duration securities.\nThese investments will create sustainable multiple year benefits regardless of interest rate changes over that period. New mine purchases in the quarter were approximately 250 basis points above the spreads from worth balance sheet cash. This has been supplemented with strong growth within our certificate company, with assets growing to nearly $10 billion in the quarter and a gross fee yield of nearly 400 basis points.\nAs we move into 2023, we are on a trajectory to generate growth in interest earnings from the bank and on our incremental yield while continuing to maintain high credit quality. In the first half of the year, we were moving $3 billion on to the bank's balance sheet. We expect to transfer additional balances in the back half of 2023. And as we previously indicated, we will reinvest approximately $3 billion of maturities into our yielding assets throughout the course of the year.\nLet's turn to Asset Management on Slide 9. In 2022, the backdrop remained challenging for both us and the industry. AUM and was $584 billion, down 23%. This decrease was driven by double-digit equity and fixed income market depreciation as well as negative pound and euro foreign exchange impacts. Flows during the period remained challenged as global institutional net inflows during 2022 were more than offset by ongoing retail pressure. As a reminder, 2021 net flows benefited from the $17 billion BMO U.S. asset transfer, which had limited impact in 2022.\nOn Slide 10, you can see asset manage financials reflect the continuation of the challenging market environment and reflect deleveraging that occurs in this business. Earnings were $146 million, a 56% decline as a result of market depreciation and net outflows. In addition, the prior year period included $35 million in performance fees, while the current quarter only included $5 million as well as $12 million of unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments. As a result, margin in the quarter declined to 29%. Importantly, we are focused on the areas we can control and on executing our strategic priorities.\nExpenses remain well managed, Total expenses were down 12% with G&A and other expenses down from continued expense disciplines, lower performance fee compensation and timing of mark-to-market expenses. As a reminder, results last year include a partial quarter of BMO-related expenses. As we move forward, we will continue to make market-driven trade-offs and discretionary spending and remain committed to managing expenses very tightly based on the revenue environment.\nLet's turn to Slide 11. Retirement & Protection Solutions earnings increased 25% and with strong cash flow generation and a clearly differentiated risk profile. Results in the quarter were driven by enhanced yield from repositioning of the investment portfolio, lower deferred acquisition cost amortization and lower sales levels. We remain well capitalized with an estimated RBC ratio of 545% at year-end.\nConsistent with the industry, Sales in the quarter declined as a result of the volatile market environment as well as the impact from our actions to discontinue sales of variable annuities with living benefits. Now only $43 billion of account value is in products with living benefit guarantees, a $14 billion decline from past year.\nProtection sales remain concentrated in higher-margin asset accumulation [VUL] which represents 1/3 of total insurance in-force assets. The increase in investment income was a direct result of the actions taken to reposition the investment portfolio. In the quarter, we repositioned $600 million primarily into longer-duration corporate bonds while maintaining a high-quality portfolio. These actions will generate higher investment income in 2023.\nOn Slide 12, our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong and our diversified AA-rated investment portfolio is well positioned. During the quarter, new money purchases were AA+ rated at yields that were accretive to the overall portfolio. Despite continued market volatility in the quarter, VA hedging effectiveness remained very strong at 97%, and excess capital and holding company liquidity remains strong.\nOur diversified business model generates significant and stable free cash flow. This enables the company to deliver a consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders while continuing to invest for growth. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares returning a total of $610 million of capital to shareholders, bringing the total for the year to $2.4 billion. Our capital return strategy over the past 5 years has reduced our share count by 28%.\nWith that, we'll take your questions."

My name is Lisa, and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Alicia Charity. You may begin.\n\nAlicia A. Charity\n\nSVP of IR, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's Third Quarter Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'd be happy to take your questions.\nTurning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website. On Slide 2, you will see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website.\nSome statements that we make on this call may be forward looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our third quarter earnings release and our 2021 annual report to shareholders and our 2021 10-K report. We make no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.\nOn Slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the third quarter. Below that, you'll see our adjusted operating results, followed by operating results excluding unlocking, which management believes enhances the understating of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. We completed our annual unlocking in the third quarter. Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.\n\nJames M. Cracchiolo\n\nChairman & CEO, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. What I'd like to do is give you my perspective on the environment and how Ameriprise is performing, then Walter will cover the financials. In terms of the market environment, both equity and fixed income markets continued to decline in the third quarter, both here and in Europe. Inflation remains high and sticky, and geopolitical risk is elevated. This is causing a high level of volatility, keeping investors on the sidelines a bit more. With that, short-term interest rates were up 300 basis points so far this year with 150 basis points raised just in the third quarter. I believe that the Fed and other central banks have been playing catch-up, and that they will have to continue in increasing rates to get inflation under control.\nHaving said that, it will lead to a slowing of the U.S. and European economies and at this juncture, it looks more like we're heading for a mild recession. Therefore, I expect there will be more volatility ahead. So for Ameriprise, the diversity and strength of our business allows us to deliver good outcomes even in challenging times, and you certainly saw that in our results this quarter. We continue to remain in strong client inflows and wealth management. And the rise in interest rates, the growth of the bank and the stability of the retirement protection businesses helped to more than offset the effect of depreciating markets and foreign exchange that impacted our asset management business.\nThe investments we made in our business over the years in our technology, client service, product solutions and advice value proposition are paying dividends as we continue our strong focus on our clients and helping our advisers navigate a difficult environment.\nNow I'd like to discuss our third quarter results in more detail. Total assets under management administration were $1.1 trillion, which is down 9% from a year ago. Assets were impacted by the steep decline in both equity and fixed income markets and the strength of the dollar, which affected the foreign exchange rate in our European business. In terms of adjusted operating financials, excluding unlocking, revenues were $3.5 billion, up 1%. With that, earnings per share were up 9% to $6.43, and the return on equity was strong at 47.9%, which is consistent with this time last year.\nNow let's talk a bit more about our businesses. I'll start with Advice & Wealth Management, where we continue to deliver strong results. Despite the environment, we had good client flows as clients remained engaged. Total client flows were up 11% in the quarter to more than $11 billion. The mix of our flows reflect the environment we're in. We saw strong growth in brokerage, cash, certificates and other products. As we expected, cash balances continue to be up sharply to more than $46 billion compared to more than $40 billion just a year ago. We're seeing good growth across our cash offerings.\nVery importantly, our adviser productivity remains strong as we continue to reinforce our personal relationships and the value of advice. It was up 7% to $819,000 per adviser. We recently met with our top advisers to recognize their success and discuss growth opportunities at Ameriprise. Engagement was terrific. Advisers are highly satisfied with the firm and the support we provide, and they like the technology and the capabilities we've added, which is helping them grow.\nWhich brings me to recruiting. We had another very good quarter adding 89 highly productive advisers. Advisers consistently tell us they recognize the strength of our value proposition, our brand and the stability of the firm. It's a competitive marketplace, and I feel good about our pipeline. In the third quarter, as we have all year, we continue to invest steadily in the business. We continue to release additional tools, capabilities and enhancements that help our advisers engage and meet with clients, deliver actionable advice and improve efficiency of their practices.\nAs part of our investment agenda, we've been very much focused on expanding our cash offering and growing our bank. The bank provides important flexibility in this rising interest rate environment and will continue to be a good opportunity for us to further engage and deepen our relationships with clients. We continue to move cash to the bank, adding $3.1 billion in the third quarter. And with that, we've been able to invest appropriately to garner additional spread. Today, our bank has grown to nearly $19 billion. We also continue to see good growth in our pledge loan business, and we'll be launching more products in the bank as we move forward. Overall, the Advice & Wealth Management business continues to generate strong profitable growth and margins reached 27.8%, up 540 basis points.\nNow let's turn to Retirement & Protection Solutions. Starting with variable annuities, we have narrowed our focus to concentrate on products that are good for clients in this environment and for the firm. And with that strategy in place, we have continued to generate solid sales in variable annuities without living benefits as well as our structured products as we have shifted away from annuities with guarantees. Therefore, our sales are down but in line with the industry.\nWe also made a shift in protection away from fixed insurance to focus on VUL and DI products. Life sales were also down given the climate, but again, results were in line with the industry. Based on what we've done to appropriately risk adjust these businesses, they continue to generate good earnings, stability and solid returns and cash flow as a complement to our other businesses.\nNow I'll cover asset management. As you've seen across the industry, markets have impacted asset levels from an equity and fixed income perspective. As a global asset manager with sizable presence in Europe, we were also affected by the depreciation of the sterling and the euro versus the dollar. Assets under management were down 6% to $546 billion given the equity and fixed income markets and the FX impact I've mentioned, more than offsetting the BMO acquisition. Consistent with what you've seen in the industry, investors have more of a risk-off perspective and you have a level of tax loss harvesting taking place based on market depreciation. Very critically in this environment, we are maintaining good investment performance, and we're continuing to maintain good 3-, 5- and 10-year track records.\nWhile there's been a lot of volatility over the course of the year, over 70% of our funds are above meeting on an asset-weighted basis. Our short-term performance has been impacted in some of our fixed income strategies based on the spike in interest rates. And in Europe, some of our equity strategies were impacted because of our quality growth positioning.\nLet's turn to flows. In the quarter, we had outflows of $2.4 billion that included $1 billion of legacy insurance partner outflows. Positive flows in institutional were more than offset by the ongoing pressure we've seen in retail. In retail overall, we're in net outflows, but it improved a bit from a tougher second quarter for us in the industry. We ended the third quarter with lower gross sales and higher redemptions than a year ago, given the markets. This resulted in $5.3 billion of net outflows driven by weak conditions.\nIn U.S. retail, equity outflows remain generally in line with the industry, and fixed income results were behind given our product mix. In EMEA, though retail flows remained under pressure, we did see some improvements in Continental Europe and overall flows were a bit better than the industry for the quarter.\nTurning to Global Institutional. Excluding legacy insurance partners, net inflows were $3.9 billion, and we're seeing fundings get extended given the markets and some asset allocation calls. In Asset Management, we expect the environment will remain challenging.\nHowever, we think there will be opportunities as markets settle down over time and interest rates stabilize. At the same time, we've been very much focused on integrating our BMO EMEA business, and that's going well. We continue to make good investments in the business overall, ensuring that we have the right focus to move forward in distribution as well as servicing and platform capabilities. But we also have a very strong eye towards managing expenses in this market. And adjusted for the BMO EMEA acquisition, we brought G&A expenses down by 7%, and we'll continue to be very focused there. As I look ahead for Ameriprise, I believe we will continue to be operating in these markets for a while. So as you expect from us, we're very much focused on what we can control. That includes continuing our strong engagement with clients and advisers as well as leveraging our investments as we continue to manage our expenses tightly moving forward. Importantly, I feel like the strength of our businesses and the growth of the bank will allow us to navigate these markets very well and generate a consistent level of free cash flow and good returns for our shareholders.\nAnd what's very important and critical for the firm and what we deliver is the engagement of our people and advisers, I feel very good about the team. We just conducted our employee and adviser surveys, and we continue to see high levels of engagement and satisfaction industry-leading, and we know how important this is going through a challenging environment to keep our focus on our clients. In total, I feel really good about the mix of our business, the flexibility we have and how we're positioned for both the challenges and the opportunities ahead.\nNow I'll turn it over to Walter, and then I'll take your questions.\n\nWalter S. Berman\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you. As Jim said, results this quarter continue to demonstrate the strength of the Ameriprise value proposition as adjusted EPS, excluding unlocking, increased 9% to $6.43 in a challenging market environment. Both management business momentum, higher interest rate environment and expense discipline more than offset equity and fixed income market depreciation, coupled with significant weakening of the pound and the euro in the quarter.\nWe continue to benefit from strong growth in wealth management, which represented 60% of adjusted operating earnings in the quarter, up from 49% a year ago. Across the firm, we continue to manage expenses tightly relative to the revenue opportunity within each segment. As a result, we've continued to make investments in the bank and other growth initiatives particularly in wealth management, while prudently managing overall firm-wide expenses. On a year-to-date basis, G&A expenses are flat, excluding BMO. We expect that for the year, G&A will be down 1%.\nOur balance sheet fundamentals remained strong despite continued market depreciation in the quarter, and we returned $632 million of capital to shareholders. For the full year, we remain on track to return approximately 90% of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders.\nLet's turn to Slide 6. Assets under management administration ended the quarter at $1.1 trillion, down 9%. While AUMA benefited from strong client flows and the addition of BMO late last year, we experienced significant market impacts. Equity in fixed markets were down 19% and 14%, respectively. In addition, Asset Management AUM levels were substantially impacted by a significant weakening of the pound and the euro, with the AUM of non-U.S. businesses down to approximately 35% of the total. Overall pretax earnings remained strong in this environment, up 6% from last year, excluding unlocking, with meaningful benefits from interest rates and strong client flows more than offsetting significant negative equity and fixed income markets and foreign exchange impacts that largely occurred in September.\nLet's turn to individual segment performance, beginning with Wealth Management on Slide 7. Wealth Management client assets declined 12% to $711 billion as a result of significant market depreciation over the past year, partially offset by our strong organic growth. Total client net flows remained strong at $11.2 billion, up 11% from last year, with $6.4 billion of flows into wrap accounts and $4.8 billion into non-advisory accounts, specifically certificates and retail brokerage as anticipated in this environment. Revenue per adviser reached $819,000 in the quarter, up 7% from the prior year from continued enhanced productivity and business growth.\nOn Slide 8, you can see wealth management profitability increased 30% in the quarter, with the significant benefit from interest rates and strong organic growth exceeding negative impacts from market depreciation and lower transactional activity. Pretax operating margin reached nearly 28%, up over 500 basis points year-over-year and up 390 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating expense declined 3% with distribution expenses down 7%, reflecting lower transactional activity and asset balances.\nG&A is up 12% in the quarter and up 7% on a year-to-date basis. The higher-than-normal year-over-year increase in the third quarter was driven by unusually low prior year expenses relating to staffing levels and G&A, timing of expenses in the current year and continued expenses associated with higher volumes and continued investments in the bank and [lower] growth initiatives. We anticipate that the full year will be in line with the 7% year-to-date growth pace. We expect the higher interest rate pattern to drive a substantial and sustainable benefit in the fourth quarter of '22 as well as 2023.\nLet's discuss the components in more detail. First, cash balances remain high at $46 billion this quarter with multiple products available to meet client needs, including brokerage cash, bank and certificates. The majority of our brokerage cash is in working cash accounts for our clients, where half of the balance is less than a $100,000. And our client [catering] rates are continuously benchmarked and remain competitive. As a result, we have not experienced cash sorting issues to the extent of others in the industry. Our certificate products offer another solution for clients looking to ladder their liquidity and garner some additional rate upside in the multiple product offerings.\nSecond, the bank provides flexibility to optimize the benefits from higher rates by investing in high-quality, longer duration securities creating sustainability of interest earnings. Our bank reached nearly $19 billion in the quarter, up from $10 billion a year ago. In 2023, we plan to grow the bank to the $22 billion range. In the quarter, the pickup from investments in the bank is approximately 150 to 200 basis points above the spreads from (inaudible) balance sheet cash. Over the past several years, our total client cash balances have been consistently 5% to 6% of total client assets. This positions us well to capture the opportunity from rising rates and lock in those benefits over the medium term. In 2022, spread earnings will increase by over $600 million versus the prior year, and we expect this trend to continue into 2023.\nLet's turn to Asset Management on Slide 9. We are managing the business well through a challenging market. Total assets under management declined 6% to $546 billion, primarily from equity and fixed income market depreciation and unexpected significant negative pound and euro foreign exchange impact. As I mentioned, the BMO acquisition broadened our geographic diversification with about 35% of the assets in EMEA. However, this diversification increased our foreign exchange translation exposure. As a management like the industry was in outflows in the quarter.\nContinued strength in our global institutional business offset a meaningful portion of retail outflows. Like others, we experienced pressures from global market volatility, a risk off investor sentiment and geopolitical strain in EMEA. Margin in the quarter declined to 35.6%, which is slightly above our target range of 31% to 35%. Decline versus last year is attributable to broad market depreciation and foreign exchange impacts. Given the material market depreciation and foreign currency weakening in September, we expect additional margin erosion next quarter.\nOn Slide 10, you can see asset management financial results reflect the market environment. Earnings declined to a $191 million, reflecting double-digit market depreciation, significant foreign exchange weakening and outflows. Importantly, we continue to manage the areas we can control. Expenses remain well mannered. Excluding BMO, total expenses were down 13%, aided by a 7% decline in G&A. We continue to make market-driven trade-offs and discretionary spend and remain committed to managing expenses very tightly in the current revenue environment. And the fee rate remained stable in the quarter at 48 basis points.\nLet's turn to Slide 11. Retirement & Protection Solutions continued to deliver stable earnings and free cash flow generation, a clear result of our differentiated risk profile. Pretax adjusted operating earnings, excluding unlocking, were $203 million. In the quarter, we completed our annual actuarial assumption update, which resulted in an unfavorable pretax impact of a $172 million.\nSales in the quarter, similar to the industry, declined as a result of the volatile market environment as well as management action to discontinue sales of variable annuities with living benefits to reduce the risk profile of the business. Protection sales remain concentrated in higher-margin asset accumulation VUL, which now represents 1/3 of total insurance in-force assets. Annuity sales in the quarter were lower risk products without guarantees and structured variable annuities. These products represent over 40% of our total VA account value.\nWe have begun to reposition our investment portfolio to capture the interest rate opportunity. We have remained short on duration in this portfolio given the low rate environment over the past several years. We now have the opportunity to enhance yield by extending asset duration and changing the mix of investments without increasing the credit risk.\nNow let's move to the balance sheet on Slide 12. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong, and our diversified high-quality investment portfolio remains well positioned. In total, the average credit rating of the portfolio is AA, with only 1.6% of the portfolio in below investment-grade securities. Despite significant market dislocation in the quarter, VA hedge effectiveness remained very strong in the quarter at 97%. Our diversified business model benefits from significant and stable free cash flow contributions from all business segments. This supports the consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders even during periods of market depreciation like we experienced this quarter. During the quarter, we returned $632 million to shareholders and excess capital and holding company liquidity remains strong. We are on track to return approximately 90% of the adjusted operating earnings to shareholders in 2022.\nWith that, we'll take your questions."

My name is Vanessa, and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. You may begin.\n\nAlicia A. Charity\n\nSVP of IR, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's Second Quarter Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'd be happy to take your questions.\nTurning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website. On Slide 2, you'll see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website.\nSome statements that we make on this call may be forward looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our second quarter 2022 earnings release, our 2021 annual report to shareholders and our 2021 10-K report. We make no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.\nOn Slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the second quarter. Below that, you'll see our adjusted operating results, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.\n\nJames M. Cracchiolo\n\nChairman & CEO, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Ameriprise performed well in a significantly more challenging environment and delivered a solid quarter. Clearly, high inflation in the U.S. and globally as well as geopolitical uncertainty continued to cause greater volatility in pressured markets. With the Fed raising rates and concern about a potential recession, markets are experiencing headwinds, and that's weighing on investor sentiment. .\nWhile the environment impacted our results, particularly in Asset Management, we delivered strong profitability, good client flows and wealth management and strong results at the bank. We're continuing to serve clients well, managing our expenses prudently and investing in the business to drive near and longer-term growth.\nLet's move to second quarter results. Compared to a year ago, total assets under management and administration declined 3% to $1.2 trillion. We benefited from the BMO EMEA acquisition and the cumulative impact of Ameriprise client net inflows, but assets were affected by a negative foreign exchange and the steep decline in both equity and fixed income markets.\nIn terms of adjusted operating financials, revenues grew 3% to $3.5 billion, as good business performance offset market impacts. With that, earnings were up 4% with EPS up 10% to $5.81, and ROE was very strong at 48.8% compared to 37.5% a year ago.\nI'll turn to Advice & Wealth Management, where we delivered another strong quarter. We had good activity in a tough market environment. We're serving clients well with our goal-based advice, driving strong engagement and earning strong satisfaction. Total client net inflows were $8.6 billion, down 10%, but quite good in this environment. Our wrap net inflows also declined to $6.2 billion. Cash balances were up sharply to more than $47 billion compared to more than $39 billion a year ago.\nEven in a more challenging operating environment, our adviser productivity was strong, up 11% to $814,000 per adviser. We recently hosted our national conference for our top advisers and the level of engagement was terrific. They're excited about growing their practices at Ameriprise and appreciate the investments we've made and the support we provide.\nWe're also seeing nice engagement with adviser recruits. We had another good quarter in terms of recruiting, adding 99 highly productive advisers. Our value proposition stands even taller in choppier markets. When experienced advisers join us, they routinely say, our culture, technology, financial planning capabilities and ability to grow are key reasons they make the move. We're driving meaningful momentum, and I feel good about our pipeline.\nNow I'll give you some perspective on our growing cash business, which represents a significant future revenue and earnings opportunity for us. First, we're beginning to generate more revenue from our off-balance sheet cash as the Fed increases short rates. Second, we continue to move more assets to Ameriprise Bank garnering additional spread, including moving $2.3 billion to the bank late in the second quarter. For perspective, total bank assets are now at $17.1 billion. Assets have more than doubled since the beginning of 2021, and we're positioned to take this further.\nAn important takeaway for you is that as we move through the second half of 2022 and into 2023, the growth of our cash business and rising interest rates will provide an offset to equity market weakness.\nThat leads me to AWM's financials. We continue to generate strong pretax income, up 16% to nearly $500 million, and our margin continues to accrete, up 250 basis points to nearly 24%, even after the impact of substantial market declines.\nMoving to Retirement & Protection Solutions. The business is performing well in this environment and reflects our strategy to focus on our core products. I'll start with variable annuities. Overall, sales were down 29%, given our move away from living benefit guarantees. We continue to prioritize annuities without living benefits in our structured products.\nIn Protection, Life sales declined 23%, given the climate and our move away from fixed insurance. We remain focused on our VUL and DI products, which have good profitability and are appropriate for our clients. In terms of earnings, they were in line with our expectations, and our financial results and free cash flow look good, and our risk profile remains well managed.\nNow let's turn to Asset Management. We've already referenced the challenging operating environment that has resulted in asset declines and tough retail flows for the industry. We're experiencing that pressure, too. However, we feel like the business is performing well, and we're making appropriate adjustments as we move forward.\nAssets under management was up a bit year-over-year as a result of the BMO acquisition and the cumulative impact of net inflows, offset by market declines and a significant foreign exchange impact in the quarter. Revenue was essentially flat overall.\nLet's start with investment performance. Our long-term numbers continue to show good consistency for our 3-, 5- and 10-year time periods, with over 75% of our funds above medium on an asset-weighted basis. Regarding 1-year performance, it's been a tough period in both equities and fixed income.\nDomestic equity results were good, driven by our larger funds moving back above the median. In international equities, our quality positioning has been more of a challenge in these markets. In fixed income, results have been solid in Europe, but in the U.S. were impacted by our longer duration positioning in our quality focus and credit. We do feel with market conditions beginning to stabilize, we should see some improvement.\nLet's turn to flows, where we had outflows of $3.1 billion in the quarter that included $1.2 billion of legacy insurance partner outflows. This reflects the pressure you've seen in retail, but was partially offset by positive institutional results.\nIn retail overall, we had lower gross sales and higher redemptions, resulting in $5.8 billion of net outflows. This was driven largely by weak conditions in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in EMEA. In U.S. retail, equity outflows were generally in line with the industry, and the fixed income results were behind given our product mix. Compared to the industry, we did not participate nearly as much in short duration as interest rates stabilize and investors see opportunities, we believe our product position in [Chacara] improve flows. In EMEA, retail flows also remained under pressure. However, we did see some improvement in Continental Europe.\nTurning to Global Institutional. Excluding legacy insurance partners, net inflows were $3.9 billion. We had some good inflows in fixed income and other strategies. In addition to our broad lineup of traditional institutional strategies, we're bringing more focus to multi-asset and solutions as well as alternatives.\nI was with the team in London in June, and they're feeling good about the core business, the integration and the extensive capabilities we offer clients. In fact, just a few weeks ago, we announced the rebranding of BMO strategies to Columbia Threadneedle, which was an important step as we move forward.\nI'll close Asset Management with the financials. Our margin was 38.5%, and that incorporated the BMO business, which has lower margins based on their mix. Given market decline and impact on revenue, we're taking steps to continue to control discretionary expenses thoughtfully. We'll be paying close attention to market environment as we move forward.\nSo overall, Ameriprise remains in a strong position. We have a proven track record of navigating tougher times and will continue to do so. We're highly engaged with our clients and helping them stay on track. And from a financial perspective, rising interest rates will act as an offset to compressed markets as we move through the balance of the year. We will be focused on managing our discretionary expenses even more tightly as we move forward.\nImportantly, our balance sheet fundamentals remain very good. We continue to generate strong returns and substantial free cash flow, which provides flexibility. In the quarter, we returned $600 million to shareholders and are on track to return 90% of operating earnings to shareholders in 2022.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Walter to provide his perspective in more detail on the quarter, and then we'll take your questions.\n\nWalter S. Berman\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you. As Jim said, results in the quarter were strong with earnings up 4% to $665 million and EPS up 10% to $5.81 in face of substantial market declines. This demonstrates the underlying strength of our business model and highlights the diversification benefit each segment provides across market cycles as well as initial interest rate benefits and overall expense discipline throughout the firm.\nAs we move into the second half of the year, benefits from rising rates and higher cash balances are expected to offset the realized pressures from the market volatility. Our high-quality, diversified investment portfolio and head [count] continue to support strong balance sheet fundamentals, and our business is generating good free cash flow.\nDespite the elevated level of market volatility in the quarter, Ameriprise returned $600 million of capital to shareholders and maintained significant excess capital of $1.6 billion. We are on track to return approximately 90% of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders this year.\nLet's turn to Slide 6. We ended the quarter with assets under management and administration of $1.2 trillion, down 3%, reflecting equity and bond market depreciation and as well as foreign exchange. We are executing our growth strategies, including the integration of the BMO business.\nThe BMO business contributed to our geographic diversification, with international assets now representing 36% of asset management, AUM, up from 27% prior to the BMO acquisition. And we continue to benefit from strong underlying organic growth momentum with $69 billion of wealth and asset management flows over the last 12 months. Total flows in the quarter were $6 billion, with $9 billion of inflows in Wealth Management, offset by $3 billion of outflows in asset management.\nLet's turn to individual segment performance, beginning with Wealth Management on Slide 7. Wealth Management client assets declined 9% to $735 billion. Despite the exceptional market depreciation in the quarter with equities down 15% and bonds down 10%, we generated strong client flows from new client acquisition, excellent experienced adviser recruiting and deeper client relationships. Our advisers had strong productivity growth with revenue per adviser reaching $814,000 in the quarter, up 11% from the prior year.\nOn Slide 8, you can see Wealth Management profitability benefited from organic growth and the initial rise in interest rates. Adjusted net operating revenues increased 4% or $76 million to $2.1 billion as market depreciation and lower transactional activity during the quarter was more than offset by rising interest rates and client flows.\nCash balances increased to $47 billion, up 21% from last year. At the same time, the gross fee yield doubled versus last year driving higher interest earnings in the quarter. Expenses remain well managed. G&A expenses increased $15 million or 4%, primarily from higher volume-based expenses over the past year. Overall, Wealth Management profitability remained strong with pretax adjusted operating earnings of $492 million, up 16% from last year, and our pretax operating margin reached 23.9%, up 250 basis points.\nAs you can see on Slide 9, we are well positioned to realize significant incremental benefits from rising rates on our cash products this year and going forward. In the quarter, we transferred $2.3 billion of brokerage sweep balances on to the bank's balance sheet in 2- and 3-year duration strategies with yields above 4%, on average. In July, yields on new money purchases at the bank increased further and are in the 4.5% range.\nWe continue to feel good about the credit quality of the portfolio with most of the portfolio in the AAA rated structured assets. We plan to bring an additional $3 billion of assets on to the balance sheet during the third quarter bringing the full year increase to $7 billion.\nOur model leverages both broker-dealer suite program and the bank to optimize earnings from cash products. Currently, we have about 1/3 of the client cash balances at the bank, and we expect it to be nearly 40% by the end of the year. In addition, our certificate business is another area that benefits from rising interest rates.\nIn total, we expect to generate substantially more interest-related revenue in 2022 relative to 2021, which would offset current market-related impacts. Based upon our current assumptions, the interest rate benefit will increase further in 2023.\nLet's turn to Asset Management on Slide 10, where performance was in line with the macro environment. Total assets under management increased 1% to $598 billion. As the acquisition of BMO business was largely offset by market depreciation and foreign exchange translation.\nAsset Management flows were negative in the quarter with continued strength in our global institutional business, offsetting a meaningful portion of retail outflows. Like the industry, we continue to experience pressures from global market volatility, a risk off investor sentiment and geopolitical strain in EMEA.\nMargin in the quarter declined to 38.5%. It should be noted that BMO reduces our margins by approximately 400 basis points. Going forward, our new margin toggle will be in the 31% to 35% range, reflecting the addition of BMO, which is primarily an institutional business.\nOn Slide 11, you can see Asset Management financial results were a reflection of the challenging market backdrop. Adjusted operating revenues were essentially flat at $881 million as the addition of BMO offset the impact of double-digit market depreciation, foreign exchange rates and outflows. Likewise, earnings in the quarter declined $31 million.\nImportantly, we are managing the areas we can control. The underlying fee rate remained stable in the quarter at 48 basis points. Expenses remain well managed with G&A expenses down 6%, excluding BMO. We are currently in the process of evaluating all discretionary spend and high rate. We remain committed to managing expenses very tightly in the current revenue environment.\nLet's turn to Slide 12. The Retirement & Protection Solutions continued to deliver stable earnings and free cash flow generation as a result of its differentiated risk profile. Pretax adjusted operating earnings were $179 million.\nSales in the quarter declined as a result of market dislocation and management actions to reduce the risk profile of the business. Most notably, [variable] new sales declined 29%, reflecting the uncertain market environment as well as our decision to exit manufacturing products with limiting benefit riders, which was completed in June. Account value with living benefit riders represent less than 60% of the overall book, down nearly 3 percentage points from last year. Our risk profile remains strong with 94% VA hedge effectiveness in the quarter and an estimated RBC ratio of 530%.\nNow let's move to the balance sheet on Slide 13. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong, and our diversified high-quality AA-rated investment portfolio remains well positioned. These strong fundamentals allow us to deliver a consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders even during periods of market volatility that we experienced this quarter.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $600 million to shareholders, and excess capital is at $1.6 billion. We remain on track to return approximately 90% of the adjusted operating earnings to shareholders in 2022.\nWith that, we'll take your question."

    "content": "Full Year 2021 AMP Ltd Earnings Call\n\nFull Year 2021 AMP Ltd Earnings Call\n\nAMPASXFEB 9, 8:30 PM\n\nAlexis Ann George\n\nCEO & Director, AMP Limited\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to AMP's financial results for 2021. Let me start by paying my respects to our First Australians. I'd like to acknowledge the traditional custodians on the land on which we meet today. For me, that is the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation. And I'd like to pay my respects to all custodians of the lands past, present and emerging.\nI'm disappointed that we are again holding this event virtually in the financial year and to highlight the achievements in what has been a very unusual period. I'm joined today by our CFO, James Georgeson, and CEO of the AMP Capital Private Markets business, Shawn Johnson, who you'll hear from shortly.\nIn November, at our Investor Day, we outlined our strategy for the AMP Limited and private markets business in a separated environment. Today, we'll share how the businesses have performed in '21 and give further directions to the outlooks for '22.\nBefore turning to the results, it would be remiss of me not to comment on the environment in which we're operating. COVID continues to impact how we operate our business, although like many we've had and have adapted. We have prioritized support for our people, which is enabling them to continue to work hard to deliver for our clients, shareholders and the community.\nWhile COVID has hurt certain sectors of our economy, a broader economic recovery is gathering pace. With this, however, has come concerns of rising inflation and increased interest rates. Upbeat unemployment and wage growth forecasts have brought forward our expectations of the RBA lifting rates. While our house view has been for a rate increase in August, this could come as soon as June or July. We don't expect these increases to impact the economic recovery, but we do expect a slowdown in the property market, and there could still be some share market volatility over the near term. These conditions are front of mind for us as we look ahead over the next 12 to 24 months.\nWe're particularly confident in the resilience of our bank. We benefit from having a quality mortgage book with owner-occupied loans at almost 70% and lower res experience. It's now been almost 6 months since I started in the role. In that time, we have set out clear strategic priorities and a path forward for the 2 businesses, which we will demerge this year.\nToday, you'll see progress and delivery against those priorities. We said we're focused on growing the bank, and we hit 2x systems growth in Q4. We also said we'd build stronger relationships with external financial advisers and you'll see 18% growth in inflows in that area. We further simplified and reduced costs in super, and we're taking steps to accelerate the transformation of advice.\nWe're also on track to deliver on our 3-year $300 million run rate cost out target set in FY '19. You'll also see that we hit some key milestones for demerger. It's important we continue to deliver on these promises we have made as consistency remains a focus. The progress we've made so far leaves me confident that we have the right strategy in place, and we're building the right team to execute on it. I continue to be impressed by the drive and focus of our people and leadership team and in our ability to attract quality professionals to AMP.\nWe've announced a new CTO for AMP Limited, Felicia Truen to drive our focus on data and digital customer experience, strong appointments in our investments and advice teams and a new head of lending in the bank.\nIn private markets, we have new board appointments and a new CFO, and you'll hear more about that soon. So to today, let's start with an overview of the year. We've achieved a solid underlying NPAT result for FY '21 at $356 million, and it was up almost 53% on '20.\nThis was supported by our bank, which is achieving strong lending growth and which benefited from the release of credit loss provisions due to the improved outlook for the economy. Our focus will be on continued strong lending while managing our NIM.\nPlatforms is also contributing to profit growth where our focus on investing in technology and increasing our investment options to restore the grow North platform AUM. Performance fees also saw AMP Capital deliver a strong rise in underlying profit. This came from the successful sale of assets in our infrastructure equity business in the last quarter, which delivered strong returns for clients. We've continued to deliver a significant reduction in our cost base to meet our 3-year cost-out target. We've achieved this through organizational restructures and teams and simplifying our infrastructure and technology. And in advice, we've established a new services model for the Alliance network, and we've had strong buy-in from our advisers on the professional services business we are looking to build.\nWe reported that we closed the FY '21 year with surplus capital of $383 million above our target. There will be material movements in our capital position in the first half '22 as we realize sale proceeds from Resolution Life and infrastructure debt and deploy capital to support the previously announced real estate funds as well as the demerger costs.\nAs flagged at our Investor Day, we continue to maintain a conservative approach to our capital management to support our transformation and will not declare a dividend for the '21 year. Demerger is obviously a key focus and priority for us. We have achieved many milestones already and remain on track towards completing the demerger in the first half of '22.\nWe also announced the sale of our infrastructure debt business, which allows us to strengthen the balance sheet of both organizations, and we expect this to complete soon. The Gafisa will also complete in Q1, and the transfer of MAG from AMP Capital to Wealth Management is well progressed with the investment team already transferred. This has established a clear perimeter between AMP Limited and private markets.\nSince our Investor Day in November, we've also established the principles for balance sheet separation, which James will cover and we have a new brand for private markets, which I know Shawn is excited to talk about.\nOn top of demerger, our first half focus will be on accelerating the strategies for both businesses, which I will get into in detail a little later. We have good momentum in our transformation, repositioning our core capabilities to take advantage of the opportunities ahead of us as we move towards and beyond demerger. I firmly believe that a business is purpose-led focused on delivering for customers and members supports its people and is community-minded will deliver better business performance and shareholder outcomes in the long run. So that's why it's important that we share these key people, customer and stakeholder updates with you.\nI'll only highlight a few points, though. We've delivered reduced fees across Super and platforms and achieved good performance for our MySuper Lifecycle members with an average 20% return. We know financial education is a key area where we can play a role in our inter-fund advice team are now delivering free retirement health checks for members in the latter stage of their working life. We've invested in technology to improve the experience for our bank customers, including consistently fast turnaround times in our home loans.\nOn the people side, culture is and remains very important for our continued success. We've been engaging with our people to define our refreshed purpose and values, and I look forward to launching those in the next month. Our employee satisfaction scores lift from 67 to 71 in '21, and we've met our gender targets at board, metal management and across the workforce generally. Our community initiatives included the delivery of more than half the actions involved in the next phase of our ramp.\nThe work of our AMP Foundation cannot be ignored where we gave more than $3 million to charities and people last year, making a real difference in the community.\nSo on that note, I'd like to hand over to James to talk through the financials in detail.\n\nJames Gladstone Georgeson\n\nCFO, AMP Limited\n\nThank you, Alexis, good afternoon all. Today, we'll cover 3 key topics, being the 2021 reported financial results for each of the businesses, certain pro forma financial impacts of the demerger and a summary of our group capital and corporate debt positions.\nThe turnaround in the underlying result we're reporting today reflects the recovery in the profitability following the impact of COVID across most of our businesses in 2020 and the improved performance across most of our divisions this year.\nYou will see today that we've continued with the enhanced disclosures by breaking out the Wealth Management and AMD Capital results into their respective subdivisions. The extra details can be found in our investor report and the appendices to the presentation.\nOn Slide 7, we show the full year '21 profit summary where underlying profit is up 53% to $356 million. The recovery in earnings was largely driven by improvements in the bank from the release of loan loss provisions related to COVID, stronger investment income in our group office from our Resolution Life and China investments and performance fees in AMP Capital.\nInvestor markets also helped to support both of our Australian and New Zealand wealth businesses with good growth in AUM. However, you can see our bottom line result includes some large impairments and a number of nonrecurring items, which we have previously announced, totaling $608 million in 2021. Taking all these into account, the bottom line statutory result for the year is a loss of $252 million.\nTurning to Slide 8, which shows the key items reported below underlying profit. The key items of note here include the client remediation related costs of $78 million, which reflect the final provisioning the advice remediation look back program in costs pertaining to the APRA in force undertaking, which we committed to at the end of last year. We incurred $133 million of ongoing transformation spend on the $300 million cost out program. And the impairments announced in November last year was settled at $312 million, comprising of deferred tax asset impairments, impairments of intangibles and the cost of recognizing onerous property lease contracts. As previously guided, we also incurred costs on the demerger of approximately $75 million in the period.\nAnd finally, other items, which were a net gain of $11 million across the year related to the gain on the sale of the New Zealand Precinct joint venture in the first half mostly offset by the costs associated by the sale of the resolution stake in the second half.\nMoving to Slide 9, which summarizes the full year '21 results on a pro forma basis post the merger for both AMP Limited and PMCo. The table illustrates how the group's 2021 reported underlying earnings of $356 million would have been split between AMP Limited, which would have comprised $259 million; and Private Markets Co, which would have comprised $108 million. The split reflects the perimeter changes of moving MAG and CLAMP from AMP Capital to AMP Limited. This moves $57 million of earnings in 2021 to AMP Limited, of which $41 million was for MAG.\nThe table also shows the adjustments to the AMP Capital result to derive the PMCo result being, firstly, the removal of the GEFI business, which recorded a net loss of $12 million in 2021. This business has been sold to Macquarie with the transaction expected to settle in the first quarter of this year.\nThe upfront proceeds on that transaction are now expected to be approximately $80 million, reflecting the AUM runoff since the deal announcement in July. Secondly, the removal of the infrastructure debt business, which recorded earnings of $1 million across 2021. This business was sold to Ares Management in late December. And the transaction is expected to settle imminently for the full cash consideration of $428 million. And thirdly, the transfer of MAG and CLAMP from AMP Capital to AMP Limited, which removes $57 million of earnings, as already discussed.\nMoving to AMP Bank on Slide 10, which has performed well. The net profit of $153 million was up 38% on full year '20. The result included the benefit of the reversal of $26 million of pretax loan loss provisions previously taken in respect of COVID. NIM across 2021 actually increased 3 basis points to 162. However, NIM declined in the second half due to the competitive market conditions, as shown in the graph on the right-hand side of this table. This is reflective of the competitive environment with the main drivers of the 18 basis point reduction in the second half being about 8 bps from lower average margins and about 13 bps from a mix impact, which reflects significantly more fixed rate loans written in 2021.\nResidential mortgages grew 7.7% to $21.7 billion during the year. Mortgage growth was really strong in the second half of the year, including 2.1x systems growth in Q4 and almost 1.4x system growth across the full year. The bank also continued to maintain its focus on costs, with only a marginal increase to $126 million across 2021. As a result, the cost-to-income ratio remained steady at about 39.5%.\nOn the next slide, on Slide 11, we show additional information on the bank and our progress towards growing the book. Pleasingly, we are seeing good momentum. And as you can see from the graph, we saw strong growth in the second half. Ares rates also continue to perform well. The 30-day Ares rate has improved from 115 basis points to 78 and the 98-day Ares rate has improved from 62 bps to 50 bps.\nAnd pleasingly, approval times have improved across the year despite the significant growth in the book. Looking forward for the bank, we continue to see positive mortgage book momentum and are targeting 2x system growth in 2022. However, we will continue to focus on writing mortgages profitably in the face of a continuing competitive lending market. And as such, we are targeting NIM at or around the 150 basis point level subject to market conditions and the interest rate outlook.\nTurning to Slide 12. We outlined some of the highlights in our Wealth Management business across 2021. Underlying profit decreased 25% to $48 million. This reflects a number of items. Firstly, lower AUM-based revenues following pricing and simplification changes and the cessation of grandfather remuneration. As well, there was a $27 million impact from the network reshape activities on revenues, and there was an $18 million impact from the impairment of advice-related assets taken in the first half of '21. However, these items were offset by $27 million improvement in variable costs from phasing out adviser support payments, a $28 million improvement in controllable costs and a $12 million improvement from higher investment income on the North Guarantee product.\nAUM was 8% higher at $134 billion, reflecting the strong performance in investment markets over the last 12 months. Total net cash outflows of $5.2 billion for the year, improved from an outflow of $7.8 billion in 2020. The improvement primarily relates to a number of one-off items that did not repeat in 2021. The 2 main ones of these was the $1.8 billion of lost corporate super mandates and the $1.8 billion of early release of super payments that occurred last year.\nFrom the chart, you can see that North is beginning to gain traction with the EFA market with AUM growing strongly and cash flow is building momentum each quarter in 2021. Total Wealth Management revenue margins declined to 66 basis points, a 7 basis point reduction in line with our guidance. The movement primarily relates to the impact of the Master Trust simplification, pricing changes on our North platform and the cessation of grandfather remuneration.\nOn Slide 13, we outlined some of the key highlights across each of the subdivisions in 2021. In the platform's area, underlying profit of $110 million is $7 million higher than full year '20 due to the impact of favorable investment markets, offsetting the impact of pricing and increased costs. AUM here was up strongly, up 13% to $71.1 billion. Revenue margins did compress from 56 basis points to 50 basis points from the repricing actions we took and the cessation of grandfather remuneration.\nIn Master Trust, underlying profit of $90 million was $23 million lower than full year '20 due to the repricing changes from our simplification efforts, but were also offset with lower controllable costs. increased modestly here, up 3% to $62.9 billion. However, margins did compress during the period, down 8 basis points to [85], mainly from the ongoing simplification efforts, and this will again impact 2022.\nIn advice, the loss is $146 million, which is broadly in line with our 2020 result. This year's numbers were impacted by impairments in advice-related assets. A decline in revenue from the end of grandfather remuneration and the advice network reshape. Cost to continue to remain a focus with effort ongoing to deliver our ambition of making advice breakeven by 2024. Savings have been achieved across both variable and controllable costs from the phasing out of adviser support payments, the divestment of our own advice network and the ongoing cost-out activity within the business. As a result, the second half results have already shown improvement with a loss of $61 million in the second half versus $85 million for the first half.\nOn the next slide, on Slide 14, we present the pro forma split of the Australian Wealth Management division post the transfer of the MAG business from AMP Capital. The transition of MAG into Wealth Management will affect both the platforms and Master Trust businesses. The MAG transition would improve the Master Trust 2021 result by approximately $21 million and the platform's 2021 result by $13 million.\nGoing forward, the MAG transition is expected to emerge approximately $55 million of higher revenues mainly in platforms, $45 million of lower investment management expenses, mainly in Master Trust and $70 million higher controllable costs (inaudible). We do expect the $41 million uplift in MAG in 2021 will moderate a little in 2022, given the lower opening AUM position and some expected cash outflows and margin compression in that division.\nOn Slide 15, we move to our New Zealand results. Our New Zealand business continues to perform well, with operating earnings up 11% to $39 million. The result was assisted by stronger investment markets and good cost performance. During the year, the change in investment strategy towards an index-based investment philosophy was successfully implemented.\nClosing AUM of $12.2 billion decreased only modestly from full year '20. This small reduction is despite the conclusion of our key resale default status, which resulted in a large net cash outflow position for the year. Strong investment markets helped offset the cash outflows.\nTurning to Slide 16, which shows our AMP Capital results. The financial results were up with underlying profit of $154 million, an increase of 18%. There are a number of trends impacting the results. These include AUM-based revenues fell 3% from both lower average AUM from cash outflows and a number of fee concessions, which were implemented to stabilize the business. However, these items were offset by higher performance and transaction fees, including the recognition of $58 million in performance fees in Q4 following the sale of 2 large infrastructure equity investments, ESVAGT and Angel Trains. Shawn will talk about these in a second.\nSeed and sponsor income was $18 million, up from $6 million in 2020. This was driven by a post COVID recovery in real asset valuations across the portfolio as well as strong performance in certain individual assets. Controllable costs across AMP Capital decreased 2% to $515 million, reflecting tight cost control.\nNet cash outflows were $27.6 billion for the year. This outflow included $9.2 billion from the transfer of New Zealand Wealth Management's investment mandate to BlackRock, $4.2 billion from the loss of the AMP Capital diversified property fund to Dexus and a $4.1 billion -- or total of $4.1 billion of divestments of assets in our infrastructure series return to investors. As a result of the cash outflows in the year, average AUM decreased by approximately $10 billion to $183.8 billion at the end of this year.\nOn Slide 17, we show the breakdown of the main group items within the group office division. Group office costs reduced 22% to $66 million, reflecting the benefits of the cost-out program. Both periods have been updated for the revised cost allocations as detailed in our investor report. Interest expense reduced to $51 million, benefiting from the $700 million pay down in corporate debt through the year and lower weighted average cost of debt. And investment income more than doubled to $79 million, reflecting the higher cash on hand following the sale of AMP Life, more favorable derivative impacts from last year, improved earnings from our China investments and a half year investment return from our Resolution Life stake. Heading into 2022, other investment income will be lower following the sale of our interest in the Resolution Life stake and reduction in surplus liquidity.\nTurning to controllable costs on Slide 18. This chart outlines the controllable cost movements across the year, which shows a 7% reduction, ending the year at $775 million, in line with our guidance. The key movements during the year include: the $11 million of COVID-related costs in full year '20, which did not repeat this year. A total of $52 million of CPI reinvestment and regulatory and compliance cost increases across the year. But offsetting this, a total of $100 million of reductions from the cost-out program, reflecting actions we took last in 2020 and 2021. The $100 million comprises $39 million from simplifying organizational structures, $52 million from simplifying our infrastructure and technology assets and $9 million from reducing our total property footprint.\nOverall, this is a strong result for costs with the actions we've been taking to reduce costs emerging as net cost reductions this year. We've now delivered approximately $260 million of the $300 million cost out program. And in full year '20, we are targeting controllable costs, excluding AMP Capital, of $725 million or $795 million when we factor in the transition of MAG, a further $50 million reduction on this year.\nOn Slide 19, we show the capital movements in 2021. Surplus capital as at the 31st of December is $383 million surplus to our target requirements. The first 3 columns reflect the $252 million statutory loss which AMP reported for the year. And as we noted in November, a portion of the impairment had no capital impact. So this is less than what appears in the P&L. The group has been able to utilize increased utilization of existing hybrid instruments resulting in a $250 million increase to the surplus capital position. These instruments have previously backed the AMP Life capital base.\nThe previously announced share buyback was completed during Q2 with $196 million of surplus capital used. There was $29 million of business capital usage, mainly driven by the ongoing growth in the bank. The $383 million surplus at December will be used to invest in the transformation strategy support the business growth and to complete the various separation activities to demerge the private markets business. Given this, and as previously guided, the Board has resolved not to declare a final 2021 dividend. Our prudent approach has been taken in capital and the lead up to the demerger.\nAnd as Alexis alluded to, over on the next slide on Page 20, we've highlighted a number of the large capital movements that we expect this year. In the first half of '22, we expect a number of the previously announced transactions to settle, being the sale of the Resolution Life stake as well as the proceeds from the infrastructure debt sale that we announced only in December last year. Offsetting these amounts are approximately $100 million of the residual cost out spend expected across the full year of 2022, the $470 million of capital required to support the real estate business, $120 million of the demerger costs as we previously guided, and also the transfer of between $250 million and $350 million of surplus capital required to set up the stand-alone private markets business, which also -- which includes the portion of the AMP Capital surplus as at the end of December, which was $241 million.\nThe final balance sheet separation to effect the demerger is still being finalized. However, the chart here shows the major movements we currently respect. The workers will advance, but does remain subject to regulatory and rating agency reviews. At demerger, we expect to create 2 sustainable capital structures such that the private markets business will carry minimal debt and will have liquidity for future sponsor investments and the AMP Limited Group will further deleverage commencement with the reduction in the size of the group as well as having sufficient capital for transformation and future growth.\nAs a result, AMP Limited is expected to maintain an up to 20% passive minority shareholding in Private Markets code to provide balance sheet resources and financial flexibility.\nOn Slide 21, this highlights our summary of our guidance points for the various businesses across 2022. In Australian Wealth Management, we expect earnings to be broadly flat as the impact of the Master Trust simplification and advice network reshape is offset by cost out in the business. We expect approximately 10 bps of revenue margin across the wealth business in 2022. At a divisional level, we expect platform revenue margins to remain at approximately 50 basis points with the impact of the pricing changes taken in mid-2021, mostly offset by MAG uplifts.\nIn the Master Trust business, we expect revenue margins to fall from 85 bps to 65 bps and following the full run rate impact of the Master Trust simplification actions that were taken only in Q3 of this year -- sorry, of 2021.\nHowever, the transfer of MAG will deliver approximately 7 bps of investment management expense reduction. And as a result, we expect gross margins being AUM-based revenue less investment management expenses at the total wealth management level to reduce from 44 bps to 41 bps in full year '20, including those MAG impacts.\nWith AMP Bank, we continue to focus on driving stronger mortgage growth this year, taking 2x system growth for the full year of 2022. We do expect additional pressure with margins and a targeting NIM over the course of the year of approximately 150 basis points. From an earnings perspective for the bank, the $26 million of loan loss provision reversals will not repeat in 2022. AMP Capital continues to focus on delivering for clients and completing the planned demerger in the first half of '22.\nFrom an earnings perspective, AUM-based revenue is expected to be lower. This reflects the full year impact of the fee discounts, and the loss of ADPF, and we're expecting a more subdued outlook for the performance fees in full year 2022 after a strong end of this year.\nNew Zealand is performing well. However, we expect NPAT to be approximately 10% lower in full year '22 given ongoing margin pressures and lower general insurance revenues as the new 5-year contract removes insurance profit share revenues.\nStepping back, the full year '21 results show a good recovery in earnings, which was helped by favorable investment markets benefited from strong performance and transaction fees and higher investment income on our strategic investments. A number of payments have been taken to reset the balance sheet ahead of the demerger this year and aligning with the revised growth strategy of the business. We are beginning to see the benefits from the cost-out program with the business delivering a net $50 million reduction in cost in 2021, and we expect to deliver the same reduction again in 2022. So another year of heavy lifting across the organization, we've continued to simplify and reset the organization while making good progress towards the demerger of PMCo at the same time.\nI'll now hand to Alexis to take us through an update on our strategic priorities.\n\nAlexis Ann George\n\nCEO & Director, AMP Limited\n\nThanks, James. Last November, we outlined our strategic priorities. And I just want to remind you of those. Given it wasn't long ago, I'll just give a few updates on where early progress is being made. Let's start with our strategic approach. The focus is reposition AMP with a focus on growth in those 2 areas of bank and platforms and delivering stable earnings for Master Trust in New Zealand as well as transforming our advice areas. Simplify through the execution of the demerger and rightsizing the operating model, also disciplined capital management, and we are exploring new business opportunities, which for us right now includes establishing digital direct-to-consumer propositions, fintech partnering and developing a leading position in retirement. There are no changes to these progresses.\nThis leads us to our 6 priorities. And again, no new news, complete the demerger, reduce the cost base, grow our bank and focus on those EFA flows. Explore new business opportunities and absolutely focused on being a purpose-led organization with values that we all live by.\nSo let me just examine each of these in a little more detail. Firstly, the demerger. There are a number of critical pieces delivering the demerger. We've delivered on important meetings in terms of operational separation including board, key management team appointments in private markets, establishing the MEP and of course, the new brand. We now need to focus on completing the MAG transfer, the sale of GEFI finalizing the ID sale. We also continue to establish PMCo to be ready for listing, establishing the governance, further board appointments and the rollout of the new brand. We will also publish our scheme of arrangement information in April as well as preparing for our court and shareholder meetings and a share consolidation.\nNow to the cost base. We've demonstrated our commitment and capability to meet our cost targets. We have achieved $260 million of cumulative gross cost savings since 2019, many were on track to meet the $300 million by FY '22. We will deliver that additional $40 million of net cost out this year to complete the existing program.\nAn additional $115 million of net cost will be taken out between now and '24, and I'm absolutely committed to delivering on this. So to the bank. I think I've made it pretty clear how important the bank is for our future direction. We are well positioned, benefiting from the digital investments we've made to reduce loan turnaround times and increase customer experience. Our auto credit decisioning rate has increased by 75% to be above 60% for '21. And that means faster and more consistent approvals, which will support our growth ambitions. This year, we are also targeting to improve our customer time to yes for mortgage approvals by 30%. We do aim to maintain our deposit to loan ratio of more than 75%, and we're in a good position as it currently sits at about 81%.\nWith the potential for slower conditions in the housing market, we will be focused on maintaining credit quality while we grow our home loan book. We're also expanding our business development team to support growth outside of New South Wales, where we have been strong.\nIt's also really important to us that while we grow, we continue to manage our NIM in a very competitive environment. So to financial advisers. We're committed to making the platform business more competitive and attractive to all advisers, particularly targeting those external financial advisers. As we've shown today, there is good momentum here. We've continued to develop our positioning in platforms by addressing the managed equity portfolio deficiency, competitive pricing and developing our administrative capability. This year, we are focused on a new retirement solution on the North platform, and we've brought some great expertise into the team to help achieve this. We'll also be transforming North sales and service capability and building on the work already done to the platform's digital experience and functionality.\nCertain new business opportunities. It's important that we look at ways to create new growth opportunities within the business. As I said, we're exploring a digital direct-to-consumer mortgage offer in our bank and we see the direct-to-consumer channel down the track also having a role in our wealth management business. As I mentioned at the beginning, we're very happy to have a new CTO starting in the next few weeks, who will support us in helping build our data analytics capability to better target and serve our customers.\nAnd finally, to purpose and values. I think it is important to highlight the work that we have done on purpose, values and culture. We've delivered inclusive leadership training to all employees launched a new inclusion and diversity policy and uplifted our employee support capabilities. As I've mentioned before, my experiences of the culture at AMP has been a positive one, and I set a group of people who are committed to having AMP succeed. We'll continue to build on the foundations for high-performance culture and the team needs to get behind a shared purpose and values. We have been engaging with employees and customers on this, and so I'm very much looking forward to launching that soon.\nI now want to hand over to Shawn for an update on AMP Capital Private Markets.\n\nShawn C. D. Johnson\n\nCEO, AMP Capital Investors Limited\n\nThanks, Lex, and hello, everyone. First, I want to say, yes, I am in Australia. So thank you for that. And I really want to thank Lex and James. It's been wonderful to spend some time face-to-face rather than ours on a video screen in all hours of the day. So thank you for that. Second, I want to thank the team within AMP and AMP Capital for such a warm welcome since I've been here. that's really been delightful and everyone in the last couple of weeks seems to be apologizing for the weather, which -- to which I reply everything in life is relative. The day I left, it was minus 28 degrees C in my driveway. And so I love a little rain in Sydney. It's perfectly fine.\nWith that, I have a few slides to share with you to update you on the private markets business. We'll go through the second half of 2021 and some updates on 2022 and what we're planning on, and then I'll turn back to Lex.\nThe first thing to update you on is the infrastructure debt sale that occurred at the end of December. So what was sold was our infrastructure debt business, principally out of New York and London, total of $7 billion in assets under management. The transaction perimeter of that to explain it were our open-ended funds, those are ones that are currently open in fund raise mode. We sold the contractual management rights along with the seed and sponsor capital in the carried future carried interest that may accrue. And then we sold the management rights for those funds that were closed, meaning they were already fully invested. We retained our seed and sponsor capital in those funds and our future carried interest and simply named Ares as the sub-adviser for those funds.\nThe expenses moving across are the direct expenses of the investment team themselves and the operations and finance teams that directly support that business. Some of the allocated costs we will retain which will be absorbed by the rest of the business.\nOn the financial summary, it was a cash payment will be received $428 million. And then because we maintained our seed and sponsor capital and our carried interest, we'll receive approximately $66 million in sponsor capital coming back in the years ahead and should carry interest come back we estimate about $84 million. But of course, that's subject to the performance hurdles that exist in those funds, which have to be met in the coming years. The total economic value of that is about $578 million, all totaled.\nAs we look at the business that remains at Private Market Co, we are now about $42 billion in assets broken up between our real estate platform, largely domestic here in Australia and our infrastructure equity business, which is both a core infrastructure business here in Australia and our global infrastructure business, principally based in London and New York. You see the assets are not quite 50-50. The real estate business is slightly larger.\nThere's a team of real estate professionals of about 500 people in that business. We have over 50 investment professionals in our infrastructure equity business. Our real estate business has 59 institutional clients located primarily here in Australia, some of the large superannuation funds, obviously. And our infrastructure equity business has over 245 institutional clients around the world. Both businesses are very -- in the top 10 of their market categories. And you can see the sector expertise of those businesses at the bottom of the slide. The historical earnings profile of the business, this has been updated to reflect the exiting of the infrastructure debt business. So these data points are updated. And you can see both -- each of the areas of revenue base management fees, our non-AUM-based management fees, our performance and transaction fees, the carried interest that we might receive and our season sponsor revenue broken out on the bar charts. Pretty consistent EBIT margin business. We should fall below that going forward in 2022 recovering more in the 2023 time frame.\nRecent developments, as was alluded to earlier, the Angel Trains and ESVAGT dispositions took place. Those were very positive results for our clients. Angel Trains was part of the old British rail system. The ESVAGT is an offshore oil platform and offshore wind farm servicing business in Europe. We did lose the Diversified Property Fund this year. That's approximately $26 million in revenue. We have given some fee concessions in our core infrastructure and real estate business to protect those businesses. That's about $30 million annually, although it reduces slightly beginning in 2023. We have had subdued fundraising activities in 2021 and 2022, just based upon the status of the demerger.\nI did want to update you to explain the volatile nature of parts of our income statement. This is a historical look at 3 line items in our P&L performance fees, carried interest and transaction fees. So you can see that for 2019, 2020 and 2021. The performance fees, if you just look at those bars in each of the years, it goes from [40] to [17] to [8]. That does reflect performance in investment assets that may have been impacted by COVID, such as airports, for example.\nOur carried interest is perhaps the most volatile line. You can see there were no carried interest payments in 2019. In 2020, we had a carried interest payment that was related to the debt business. And then in 2021, as James alluded to earlier, there was $58 million in carried interest booked in the fourth quarter.\nOur transaction fees also are related to activities that we received compensation for individual transactions, and those also vary from year-to-year. So this does give you some idea of how volatile that part of the income statement is. This is the same slide that I shared previously about our strategy. First is operational separation, which took place in December. We have all of our TSAs negotiated in place with the group. Second, we're simplifying the business, the infrastructure debt sale as part of that. We have implemented a global organizational structure, and we do have cost efficiencies to take out of the business, which I'll touch in a moment.\nNext, we will then grow our client base. We do have to scale the existing funds go back into the market for our global infrastructure series after demerger. And lastly, we'll be launching new products in the future to diversify our product offering across our client base. It's all enabled by a strong balance sheet and a cost management discipline within the firm. ESG is embedded across everything that we do. And we have a great group of talented people and our remuneration plan is now in place.\nLooking at the second half of 2021, what was accomplished. Yes, I did join. We have GEFI business has sold -- we brought in our new Chairman Designate and Patrick Snowball, well known to some of you. Andy Fay, will be our Deputy Chairman designate. I've already spent time working with both of them, finalized our operational model for Private Markets Co. Our management equity pan has been announced and is in place and granted to key employees, with the transfer of the MAG business took place in December, and we also sold the infrastructure debt platform in December.\nGoing forward in 2022, we've announced Nadine Lenny as the new Chief Financial Officer. She'll start in April. Thrilled with that announcement and glad to have her joining the team. Our new brand announcement, I'll just talk about in a moment, our infrastructure debt sales should be finalized quite imminently. The global equity and fixed income sales should be completed here in the first quarter. The public markets operation will then be transferred over to AMP as well. We'll have a couple of new nonexecutive directors appointed to Private Markets Co the first half of 2022 prior to our demerger. The Annual General Meeting will take place and the shareholder scheme booklet approved in May.\nAnd then the private markets listing will occur in June of 2022. To touch on the transition of our cost base, you can see a 2020 year-end costs were $522 million for AMP Capital. This bar chart shows you where the MAG transfer is happening and where that comes out at $67 million. There's $26 million associated with the GEFI sale. ID sale, principally the direct cost will go out, then the residual mag and GEFI cost will be transferred over to AMP Australia. The $74 million is the cost target that we have to take out within AMP Capital that's well underway, and we know exactly where to go get those costs from. And then our establishment cost is actually an add back. It will take us about $10 million to $15 million to stand up as a stand-alone business, targeting a forward cost run rate of [2 75] to [2 80] by the time we get to the beginning of 2023.\nNow our client base to update you post the infra debt sale. We'll have approximately 297 clients strong growth offshore, 61% of our institutional clients are actually outside of Australia. You'll notice in the middle circle there, 64% of our assets are actually from Australian clients. That represents a smaller group of clients but larger mandates. On the right-hand side, the majority of our clients are actually global pension fund clients. Interestingly, the U.S. market is largely untapped by our business, which presents us with a significant opportunity.\nWe have had strong performance raising assets from clients in South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, and I expect we will continue to have good success across Asia. Europe is actually our most established market outside of Australia. As we look at the business units themselves, the real estate platform had accomplished a great many things in 2021. The retail trust recapitalization at $2.2 billion, I understand is the largest of its kind in the history of Australia. AMP Capital also was retained as the trustee and manager for AWOF. We delivered $800 million in the Caring up shopping center, achieved delivery of our key quarter tower. I just toured the key quarter, really a tremendous a tremendous building and took our ownership position in Brookfield Place, all in the second half of 2021. In our infrastructure equity business, we were retained as the manager for COMF. We accomplished a number of transactions and investments in -- across our core infrastructure business here in Australia. As I mentioned earlier, we sold our Angel Trains position in ESVAGT out of our core -- our global infrastructure business. And now over 50% of the gift 1 fund has been returned to investors.\nAs we look to real estate in 2022, we'll be raising new funds in that and also securing some separate accounts in that business going forward and also be deploying new capital. In our infrastructure equity business following our demerger, there will be a fundraise to go towards gift 3. We are looking at diversifying our geographic profile on our fund client base in Australia and commencing a global core infrastructure launch as well.\nLastly, I'd like to talk about our new brand, Collimate. This is a wonderful milestone for the team and for the business. The word Collimate is actually a scientific word, it means to align the raise of light, and it talks to the way in which we want to align ourselves with our clients. For those of you that happen to study optics or look in telescopes or a camera person, a lens which perfectly Collimate light is set to have a focal length of Infinity. So it talks about our vision for the future, our long-term orientation in terms of value creation and in alignment with our clients. It incorporates a lot of research with our team. Over 400 people have participated in developing our client value proposition, our employee value proposition, all of which will be rolled out as we go forward towards the merger. And today really begins the beginning of that with the announcement of the new brand.\nSo I'm going to turn it back now to Lex. Thank you.\n\nAlexis Ann George\n\nCEO & Director, AMP Limited\n\nThank you very much, Shawn. I love hearing an investment guy talk about a new brand. So thank you. I know we want to get to questions. But before we do that, I would like to reiterate that we have delivered a solid underlying result. We show the strength of the 2 businesses. We have the banking platforms that are well positioned for growth, and we have a clear plan for how we'll drive improved performance out of our Super and advice businesses. We have delivered our cost-out target we have clear plans for achieving the further $40 million of net cost out in the next 12 months.\nExecuting the demerger remains a clear priority as is readying these 2 businesses to perform strongly as separate entities. I'm pleased with the progress we have made and are managed by the work we have ahead of us.\nAnd with that, we'll now hand over to the moderator for Q&A. So thank you."

On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'd be happy to take your questions.\nTurning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website. On Slide 2, you will see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website.\nSome statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our fourth quarter 2021 earnings release, our 2020 annual report to shareholders and our 2020 10-K report. We make no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.\nOn Slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the fourth quarter. Below that, you'll see our adjusted operating results, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.\n\nJames M. Cracchiolo\n\nChairman & CEO, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter call. I hope you're all doing well. Ameriprise delivered another strong quarter, completing an exceptional year in 2021. We continue to execute well and produced record results. Importantly, we helped our clients navigate the environment while driving profitable organic growth, advancing key strategic initiatives and reinforcing our strong position in the marketplace. At the same time, Ameriprise continued to generate excellent shareholder returns.\nIn terms of the environment, with the economy continuing its recovery, U.S. equity markets finished the year strong. In Europe, the environment improved but continue to lag the U.S. As we've seen, higher inflation is pressuring the Fed to move on raising short-term rates, causing greater volatility in the equity markets.\nLet's move to the highlights for the quarter. Total assets under management and administration were up 29% over last year and reached a new high of $1.4 trillion. In the quarter, we added $136 billion from our acquisition of BMO EMEA's asset management business and $40 billion in total client flows, also a new record.\nTurning to our fourth quarter adjusted operating results. Revenues were $3.7 billion, up 18%, fueled by strong organic growth I've mentioned and equity market appreciation. Earnings were -- 29% with earnings per share up 36%, reflecting robust business growth and sound capital management. And ROE, excluding AOCI and unlocking was at a record 50.7% compared to 36.1% a year ago.\nOur fourth quarter results are consistent with the record results we delivered for the full year. Excluding unlocking, revenues were $13.8 billion, up 17%. Earnings rose 29% to $2.7 billion, with earnings per share up 35%, $22.75. We continue to execute our strategy, investing strongly in our higher multiple businesses, which now represent 80% of our 2021 adjusted operating earnings for the year while continuing to generate strong returns from our high-quality Retirement & Protection Solutions business.\nLet's move to Advice & Wealth Management, where we continue to generate strong momentum and growth. It was a standout quarter. Clients were active, working closely with their advisers, benefiting from our comprehensive advice and solutions and the strategic investments we've made over many years. Engagement is high and a large number of our clients are utilizing our extensive digital capabilities to track and achieve their goals.\nThis is leading to robust client activity, asset flows and client acquisition. For the quarter, total client assets were up 17% to $858 billion. Client inflows were up 29% to a record $12.5 billion driven by strong client acquisition and deepening client relationships. Wrap net inflows remained strong at $10.5 billion, up 17%, driving ramp assets under management to a record $465 billion.\nClient cash balances grew to $43.8 billion. Transactional activity grew for another quarter, up nearly 9% over last year with good volume across a range of product solutions. Our advisers are highly engaged. The training, coaching and full suite of tools we provide advisers is helping them build and deepen client relationships, track prospects and run and grow their practices on our fully integrated platform. This is driving strong adviser productivity growth, up 18% to nearly $800,000 per adviser.\nWith regard to recruiting, we added another 86 highly productive advisers in the quarter. Helping advisers grow their practices is a top priority, along with continuing to recruit experienced productive advisers. We recently surveyed hundreds of advisers who joined Ameriprise over the last few years. 90% said they had better client-facing technology, financial capabilities and are better able to serve and acquire clients at Ameriprise than they did with their prior firms. That's terrific, and it's an example of why we feel so strongly about our value proposition and the ability to grow.\nThe strength of our value proposition is also reflected in the recognition we're receiving. That includes being named the #1 Most Trusted Wealth Manager and clients consistently rating us 4.9 out of 5 in overall satisfaction. In fact, we're showcasing this strength in our latest national advertising campaign that we launched this week called Advice Worth Talking About. It's a distinct platform that conveys how we help clients feel so confident with their experience that they're referring Ameriprise to their friends and family.\nTurning to the bank. Total assets grew to nearly $12.5 billion in the quarter, up from $8.1 billion a year ago. And we feel well positioned as we transition to a rising rate environment. We continue to have strong demand from our lending solutions, especially our pledge loan products.\nAs we move through 2022, there's clearly an opportunity as interest rates rise. We would have a direct benefit in wealth management, where in addition to what we currently have at the bank, we have our cash sweep deposits and certificate businesses that would benefit.\nTo wrap up AWM, our metrics and financials are excellent. Pretax income was $472 million, up 34% and margin was strong at 22.3%, up 250 basis points, which compares very well in the industry.\nNow I'll turn to our asset management business, where we delivered a strong year. We stay focused on meeting our clients' needs and drove the business forward while completing a significant and complementary acquisition that added $136 billion in acquired assets, significantly expanding our capabilities and reach. Total asset management assets under management increased 38% to $754 billion, also a new record.\nAs an active manager, we start with our research, which is excellent. It's foundational to our business as we focus on generating consistently strong investment performance for clients. That's across equity, fixed income and asset allocation strategies. At year-end, well over 80% of our funds were above the median on an asset-weighted basis over 3-, 5- and 10-year time periods. This is terrific performance. And when we compare it to a broad group of U.S. peers we tracked, we performed at or near the top of the Lipper ratings for multiple time periods.\nOverall, we had net inflows of $27.5 billion. We're able to earn a significant level of flows from BMO's U.S. clients that elected to transfer their assets to us in both retail and institutional strategies. This is a great example of the value we can realize from our strategic relationship with them. Global retail net inflows were $13.6 billion, including reinvestment dividends as well as strong flows from U.S. BMO clients.\nIn terms of fixed income, our results were good and in line with the industry as we've made significant progress in increasing our market share. In equities, our flow rate declined a bit and is consistent with the industry average after outperforming in recent quarters. As you've seen, there has been more volatility given concerns about monetary policy and the pandemic.\nIn EMEA retail, we had inflows on the continent. In the U.K., market conditions remain challenging. And while we experienced some net outflows, flows continued to improve over the past 2 quarters.\nLooking ahead for global retail, as we navigate this period of heightened volatility, we have a strong lineup of high-performing strategies across equities, fixed income and asset allocation. 13 of our U.S. investment strategies had over $1 billion in sales last year, and that's up from 4 just 2 years ago. We will continue to execute our successful strategies and reinforce relationships with advisers and our partner firms that have driven strong results over multiple years.\nTurning to global institutional. Excluding legacy insurance partners, net inflows were $14.8 billion driven strongly by U.S. BMO client transfers as well as mandate wins and top-ups from existing clients.\nIn terms of our BMO EMEA acquisition, I feel good about how we're tracking and the teams we have in place. Executing the integration is a top priority, and I'm encouraged by our progress in these initial months together. We've seen that BMO is now in our numbers, and Walter will take you through that further.\nTo wrap up asset management, I feel good about the business, the progress we've made over recent years and our priorities to drive long-term growth.\nMoving to Retirement & Protection Solutions. Our results were strong with strong sales in the quarter. Variable annuity sales were up 15% driven by our structured product and traditional RAVA product without living benefits. And in Protection, sales were up 41% driven by our VUL product with sales nearly doubled as it is an appropriate product in this low rate environment.\nAs you know, we have been taking strategic actions within the annuity business, and that continued in the quarter as we further narrowed our variable annuity offerings. As part of our focus on products without living benefits, effective January 1, we discontinued 3 of our 4 living benefit riders. These 3 riders represented 98% of our living benefit sales for the past year. And by the end of the second quarter of 2022, we will have stopped all new sales of our 1 remaining rider, which represents a very, very small part of our business.\nOn the insurance side, we're making similar moves in the product line, where we discontinued 2 products in our UL lineup. We've built differentiated Retirement & Protection Solution businesses over many years that delivers superior financial results, returns and steady free cash flow, consistent with our other business lines.\nOverall, Ameriprise delivered a record year, and we're positioned exceptionally well for 2022. Listen, across our business, we're driving terrific results. We ended the year with excellent organic growth, a strong balance sheet and a significant excess capital position. And Ameriprise continued to generate one of the highest ROEs in financial services, above 50%. And that's with our asset-light and higher returning balance sheet businesses and while maintaining strong excess capital position.\nSo to close, our team is focused on executing our successful strategy, delivering for our clients and continuing to drive profitable growth. Now Walter will review the numbers in more detail, and then we'll take your questions.\n\nWalter S. Berman\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered strong financial results across all our businesses. We reached new record levels of revenue, pretax adjusted operating earnings and return on equity in the quarter and for the year. We delivered strong flows, earnings growth and margin expansion in our core wealth and asset management businesses, with Wealth and Asset Management now representing 81% of Ameriprise's earnings in the quarter. This compares favorably to 75% of total earnings a year ago.\nOur Retirement and Protection Solutions businesses continue to perform well as we further optimize our risk return profile. We continue to generate robust free cash flow across all our businesses. Our balance sheet fundamentals are excellent. And we returned nearly 90% of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders in the quarter and for the year, consistent with our target. We ended the year with a significant $2 billion in excess capital position.\nLet's turn to Slide 6. We delivered on our profitable growth strategy in our core Wealth and Asset Management Businesses. In the quarter, our organic strategy was supplemented with the acquisition of BMO's EMEA Asset Management business, which added $136 billion of AUMA. In addition, we were able to add a net $15 billion of flows and AUM in the quarter primarily from BMO's U.S. clients that elected to transfer additional retail and institutional assets to us. Overall, AUMA was up 29% to $1.4 trillion and Wealth and Asset Management client flows reached $40 billion. On a full year basis, our flows were up nearly 140%, representing the successful execution of our growth strategies in each of these businesses.\nLet's turn to Slide 7, where you can see that we are delivering profitable organic growth. Revenues in Wealth and Asset Management grew 23% to $3.2 billion with pretax operating earnings of $802 million, up 45%. This drove a blended margin of 28.3%, up 420 basis points from a year ago.\nLet's turn to the individual segment performance, beginning with Wealth Management on Slide 8. Our strategy of providing best-in-class tools and technology to enable advisers to grow their practices has generated strong organic growth results. In the quarter, we generated record client flows of $12.5 billion, including $10.5 billion into our wrap program.\nOrganic growth, combined with strong markets led to client assets of $858 billion, up 17%. Advisor force continued to deliver exceptional productivity growth, with revenue per adviser reaching a new high of $796,000 in the quarter, up 20% from the prior year.\nTurning to Slide 9. You can see that the results in the quarter are a continuation of our strong trends for the past 2 years. Flows increased, and we continue to see excellent transactional activity levels from a differentiated client engagement. Total client assets grew 33% to $858 billion over the past 2 years with client flows more than doubling over the same period. And over the past 2 years, advisor productivity was up 28%.\nOn Page 10, you can see that our focus on profitable growth is showing up in excellent financial results and wealth management -- reach record levels. Adjusted operating net revenues grew 19% over $2.1 billion, fueled by robust client flows, an 8% increase in transactional activities, supplemented by strong markets while management pretax adjusted operating earnings increased 34% to $472 million.\nAmeriprise Bank is a broad driver of wealth management. In total, the bank has $12.5 billion of assets after moving an additional $4 billion of sweep cash onto our balance sheet in 2021. Expenses remain well managed. G&A expenses increased 2% as higher activity-based expenses and performance-based compensation were largely offset by expense discipline.\nAs we move into 2022, we will continue to manage expenses in light of the strong revenue environment, and we expect proportional expense growth. In the quarter, our pretax adjusted operating margin was 22.3%, an excellent result with an increase of 250 basis points from the prior year without a benefit from short interest rates.\nLet's turn to Asset Management on Slide 11, where we continue to deliver excellent organic growth that was supplemented by the closing of the BMO acquisition in the quarter. Assets on demand were up 38% to $754 billion, including $136 billion of assets acquired from BMO EMEA. Net flows were also strong at $27.5 billion in the quarter, up from $7 billion a year ago.\nClosing this quarter included a net $15 billion of inflows and AUM related to BMO. This included $16.9 billion of inflows in the U.S. from a decision by BMO U.S. clients to transfer retail and institutional assets to us as well as $1.9 billion of outflows in EMEA, about 40% of which was deal-related breakage. And margin in the quarter was quite strong at 46%, up from just under 40% last year.\nOn Slide 12, you can see these strong results are a continuation of the trends over the past couple of years. Assets under management grew 53% and underlying flows improved $35 billion, excluding BMO over this time period. The operating leverage in the Asset Management is significant with margins from the trailing 12 months of 46%, up from 36% 2 years ago.\nAdditionally, you saw in our press release that we made some enhancements to our AUM disclosure. Specifically, we broadened our definition for alternative assets to better demonstrate our underlying business and the additional assets from BMO.\nAlternatives are an important point and growing part of our business with about $40 billion of AUM across various strategies.\nTurning to Page 13. You see that these organic growth trends are generating excellent financial performance and asset management. Adjusted operating revenues increased 33% to $1.1 billion. The acquisition of BMO's EMEA Asset Management business contributed about $60 million to our revenues for 2 months. Excluding BMO EMEA, underlying revenue growth remains very strong at 25%, reflecting the cumulative benefit of net inflows over the past year, market appreciation and higher performance fees.\nThe fee rate in the quarter was 54 basis points, which benefit from higher performance fees, partially offset by the negative impact of 2 months of BMO EMEA in our results. Excluding the impact from performance fees and BMO, our fee rate was in line with our prior quarters at approximately 52 basis points.\nExpenses remain well managed and in line with expectations given the revenue growth. G&A expenses were up 12%, excluding BMO, as well-managed underlying expenses was elevated by performance fee compensation.\nPretax adjusted operating earnings was $330 million, up $129 million from last year, including $22 million of higher performance fees and a $4 million pretax earnings contribution from BMO. This demonstrates the unwind strength of our asset management business. We delivered a 45.7% margin in the quarter, which included BMO EMEA for 2 months of the quarter. Excluding BMO EMEA, the margin in the quarter was 48.6%. If BMO had been in our results for a full quarter, we expect our overall adjusted margin to decline by approximately 3 to 4 percentage points.\nWith the BMO transaction closed in November and a couple of months with BMO under the Ameriprise umbrella, the business fundamentals and financial performance are in line with our expectations. This includes our expectations around accretion targets, synergies and integration expenses.\nLet's turn to Page 14. Retirement and Protection Solutions include blocks of business with a differentiated risk profile that generates substantial free cash flow. The business is performing well with pretax adjusted operating earnings of $183 million, up slightly from a year ago.\nAs Jim said, we continue to focus on optimizing our risk profile and shifting our business mix to lower risk offerings. We're accelerating that shift with our recent product announcements to exit VA living benefits, universal life with secondary guarantees and our UL/LTC combo product.\nThese announcements caused an uptick in living benefit sales at the end of December. With a total of 67% of variable annuity sales without leaving benefits for the full quarter. Now value with leading benefits represent only 61% of the overall book now, down another 240 basis points in the past year.\nIn 2022, we would expect less than 1% of our new sales to include living benefit riders. We had a similar trend in protection with sales driven by higher-margin VUL sales. This mix in sales and account values for both retirement and protection products are expected to continue.\nNow let's move to the balance sheet on Slide 15. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain excellent. We had holding company available liquidity of $2.4 billion and excess capital of $2 billion at the end of the quarter following the acquisition of BMO. Our diversified high-quality AA-rated investment portfolio remains well positioned, and our hedge program was 95% effective in 2021. These strong fundamentals allow us to deliver a consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders.\nAs I mentioned, we returned nearly 90% of earnings to shareholders in 2021, consistent with our target. This, we announced an additional $3 billion share repurchase authorization to be used through March 31, 2024, and feel good about our ability to continue to return capital to shareholders.\nWith that, we'll take your questions."

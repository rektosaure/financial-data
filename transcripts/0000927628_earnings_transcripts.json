Welcome to the Capital One Q3 2025 Earnings Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\n[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP, Global Finance\n\nThanks very much, Josh, and welcome, everybody, to tonight's earnings call. To access the live webcast of this call, please go to the Investors section of Capital One's website, capitalone.com. A copy of the earnings presentation, press release and financial supplement can also be found in the Investors section of the Capital One website, capitalone.com, by selecting Financials and then Quarterly Earnings Release. With me this evening are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Andrew Young, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Andrew are going to walk you through this presentation that summarizes our third quarter results for 2025.\nPlease note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials. Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements. For more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-Looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section of our annual and quarterly reports accessible at our website and filed with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew?\n\nAndrew M. Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the third quarter, Capital One earned $3.2 billion or $4.83 per diluted common share. There were multiple adjusting items related to the Discover acquisition in the quarter, including integration costs, intangible amortization expense and loan and deposit fair value mark amortization. Net of these adjusting items, third quarter earnings per share were $5.95.\nAs expected, we continue to refine our purchase accounting assumptions while we are in the measurement period. In the quarter, our adjustments included a modest increase to goodwill along with other refinements. You can find the revised purchase consideration walk and amortization schedules in the appendix of tonight's presentation.\nThe results in the third quarter were impacted by the full quarter effect of the Discover acquisition. On a GAAP and adjusted basis, revenue in the third quarter increased $2.9 billion or 23% compared to the second quarter. Noninterest expense increased 18% or 16% net of adjustments, and pre-provision earnings were up 29% or 30% net of adjustments. Our provision for credit losses was $2.7 billion in the quarter. Excluding the $8.8 billion initial allowance build for Discover that we recognized last quarter, provision for credit losses increased about $50 million. Higher net charge-offs from the full quarter impact of Discover was roughly offset by a larger allowance release.\nTurning to Slide 4. I'll now cover the allowance in greater detail. The $760 million of allowance release in the quarter brought the allowance balance to $23.1 billion. Our total portfolio coverage ratio decreased 22 basis points and now stands at 5.21%.\nI'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. In our Domestic Card segment, we released $753 million of allowance in the quarter. The primary drivers of this quarter's release were continued observed credit favorability in both losses and recoveries as well as a slight improvement in the forecasted unemployment rate. These factors were partially offset by greater consideration of potential economic downside. The domestic card coverage ratio now stands at 7.28%. The allowance balance in our Consumer Banking segment was largely flat at $1.9 billion. Growth in the auto business was largely offset by observed credit favorability and continued strong vehicle prices. The ending coverage ratio of 2.26% was down 3 basis points from the prior quarter. And finally, in our Commercial Banking segment, we released $37 million of allowance in the quarter. The allowance release was largely driven by recent favorable credit performance. The commercial banking coverage ratio declined 5 basis points and now stands at 1.69%.\nTurning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves ended the quarter at $143 billion, down roughly $1 billion from last quarter. Our cash position ended the quarter at $55.3 billion, $3.8 billion lower than the second quarter. Our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio increased slightly during the third quarter to 161%.\nTurning to Page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our third quarter net interest margin was 8.36%, 74 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Recall that in the second quarter, the partial quarter benefit from the acquisition of Discover was roughly 40 basis points. The full quarter of Discover in the third quarter drove approximately 45 basis points of incremental net interest margin. The remaining increase in NIM in the quarter was largely driven by higher yield on legacy Capital One domestic card loans and 1 additional day in the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 8, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 14.4%, approximately 40 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Income in the quarter was partially offset by $1 billion in share repurchases, dividends and an increase in risk-weighted assets. In the third quarter, we completed our bottoms-up capital assessment for the combined franchise. Based on the results of that analysis, we believe the long-term capital need of the combined company is 11%. Now that we've completed this work our Board of Directors has approved a new repurchase authorization of up to $16 billion of the company's common stock. This new authorization becomes effective today and supersedes our previous repurchase authorization. In addition, we expect to increase our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.60 per share to $0.80 per share beginning in the fourth quarter, subject to board approval. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?\n\nRichard D. Fairbank\n\nFounder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows third quarter results in our credit card business. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. Similar to the second quarter, the Discover acquisition was the dominant driver of third quarter domestic card results, including the impact of a full quarter of combined operations, a combined quarter end balance sheet and purchase accounting effects. Looking through the Discover impact, the combined domesticcard business delivered another quarter of top line growth, strong margins and improving credit. Year-over-year purchase volume growth for the quarter was 39%, driven primarily by the addition of a full quarter of Discover purchase volume.\n[Audio Gap]\nExcluding Discover, year-over-year purchase volume growth was about 6.5%. Ending loan balances increased 70% year-over-year, largely as a result of adding Discover card loans. Excluding Discover, ending loans grew about 3.5% year-over-year. While competitive intensity remains high, we continue to see good traction across our legacy card business, including strong growth with heavy spenders at the top of the market. The legacy Discover Card loans continued to contract slightly and will likely continue to face a growth headwind due to Discover's prior credit policy cutbacks and some trimming around the edges that we will implement going forward.\nWhile that will create a short-term loan growth brownout, we continue to see good opportunities to grow the Discover Card business on the other side of our tech integration, where we can implement growth expansions powered by our unique technology and underwriting. Revenue was up 59% from the third quarter of 2024 with a full quarter of Discover revenue. Excluding Discover, year-over-year revenue growth was about 6.5%, driven by underlying growth in purchase volume and loans.\nRevenue margin for the quarter was 17.3%, including the impact from a full quarter of combined operations and amortization of the purchase accounting fair value mark. The third quarter domestic card charge-off rate was 4.63%, down 62 basis points from the prior quarter and 98 basis points from a year ago. The third quarter is the seasonal low point for our card losses. But the linked quarter improvement we saw was significantly beyond what we would expect from normal seasonality. And our charge-off rate has been improving on a seasonally adjusted basis throughout 2025, following the trend of improving delinquencies that started in late 2024 and supported by strong recoveries. A small share of the linked quarter improvement about 10 basis points was the result of incorporating the Discover card portfolio for the full quarter. Our domestic card delinquency rate at quarter end was 3.89%, down 64 basis points year-over-year and up 29 basis points from the prior quarter.\nThe quarterly increase was consistent with expected seasonality. Domestic Card noninterest expense was up 62% compared to the third quarter of 2024, reflecting a full quarter of combined operations and purchase accounting amortization, operating expense and marketing both increased year-over-year. Total company marketing expense in the quarter was about $1.4 billion, up 26% year-over-year.\nOur choices in domestic card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. Compared to the third quarter of 2024, domestic card marketing in the quarter included the addition of Discover marketing, higher media spend and increased investment in premium benefits and differentiated customer experiences.\nOur marketing continues to deliver strong new account originations and to build an enduring franchise with heavy spenders at the top of the market. Fourth quarter marketing will likely be somewhat above recent seasonal patterns. Slide 12 shows third quarter results in our Consumer Banking business. Global Payment network transaction volume for the quarter was about $153 billion. Auto originations were up 17% from the prior year quarter, driven by overall market growth and our strong position to pursue a resilient growth in the current marketplace. Consumer Banking ending loan balances increased $6.5 billion or about 8% year-over-year.\nAverage loans were also up 8%. Compared to the year ago quarter, ending and average consumer deposits grew about 35%, driven largely by the addition of Discover deposits. Looking through the Discover impact, our digital-first national consumer banking business continues to grow and gain traction. Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter was up about 28% year-over-year, driven predominantly by the full quarter of Discover as well as growth in auto loans. Noninterest expense was up about 46% compared to the third quarter of 2024, driven largely by the full quarter of Discover as well as increased auto originations, higher marketing to drive growth in our National Consumer Banking business and continued technology investments.\nThe auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.54%, down 51 basis points year-over-year. largely as the result of our choice to tighten credit and pull back in 2022, auto charge-offs are improving on a seasonally adjusted basis. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.99%, down 62 basis points year-over-year.\nSlide 13 shows third quarter results for our commercial banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances were up 1%. Average loan balances were flat compared to the linked quarter. Ending deposits were up about 2% from the linked quarter. Average deposits were down 2%. We continue to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances.\nThe commercial banking annualized net charge-off rate for the second quarter decreased 12 basis points from the sequential quarter to 0.21%. The commercial criticized performing loan rate was 5.13%, down 76 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized nonperforming loan rate was up 9 basis points to 1.39%. Pulling up, the full quarter of Discover operations and the related purchase accounting impacts dominated our reported results in the third quarter. But looking through these effects, our adjusted earnings, top line growth credit results and capital generation continued to be strong.\nThe Discover integration continues to go well. We continue to expect that integration costs will be somewhat higher than our original estimate and we remain on track to deliver $2.5 billion in combined synergies. Revenue synergies are largely driven by moving our debit business to the Discover network. That effort is going well, and we expect it to be largely completed in early 2026. So we expect revenue synergies to ramp up in the fourth quarter and in early 2026.\nWe're also making good progress on operating expense synergies. Many expense synergies are linked to platform conversion events, which happen at various points throughout the integration period with some conversions coming closer to the end of integration. Before we get to your questions, I want to pull up and reflect once again on where we are. As a result of years of strategic preparation, we have a wealth of opportunities today that put us in an advantageous position to grow and win in the marketplace as it continues to change dramatically. To capitalize on these opportunities at this special moment, we need to make significant and sustained investments. Our acquisition of Discover enhances and accelerates some of these opportunities, and of course, brings new opportunities as well.\nLet me start with the Discover Network. This network is a rare and valuable asset, but it is very subscale in a scale-driven business. We are already underway with our announced plan to move our debit volume and a portion of our credit card volume to the network. These moves are powering our revenue synergies. To fully capitalize on the strategic benefit of being one of the few payment networks, we aspire to move more of our volume onto the network.\nThat will require additional investments in international acceptance and the network brand. While Discover is an extraordinary and unique addition to Capital One's strategic portfolio, I want to save the unique position legacy Capital One is in as a result of years of strategic transformation. We are in the 13th year of an all-in technology transformation. This transformation has been from the bottom of the tech stack up, essentially building a modern technology company that does banking. As we move up the tech stack, the opportunities are accelerating. We also stand on the shoulders of our data and analytics capability on which the company was built and our journey to create a national lending brand -- excuse me, just a national brand.\nOne of the most unique journeys at Capital One has been the building of our national retail bank. We have built what we believe is the bank of the future with full-service digital banking capabilities enhanced by thin physical distribution of showroom branches in iconic locations. We are the only major bank building a national bank organically, and we are enjoying a lot of traction. Having our own debit network accelerates this journey, but an organic growth model requires a lot of investment in marketing for many years and those investments are growing.\nLet me turn to our credit card business. We are one of a very small number of players who are sustainably investing to win at the top of the market with heavy spenders. The fastest-growing part of our card business is with these heavy spenders. But it is very clear that winning in this part of the market takes a lot of sustained investment in standout products, amazing customer experiences, access to exclusive events, and the premium brand. It is not lost on us that our biggest competitors in this space have hugely stepped up their levels of investment, and we need to do the same. And a new front in this battle will be AI-driven experiences. We are gearing up for that.\nAs we moved up the tech stack, we are finding accelerating opportunities in new growth vectors. Some of the ones you have seen are Capital One shopping, Capital One Travel and Auto Navigator. These opportunities are growing rapidly, and we are investing to seize the moment in the marketplace. All of these opportunities stand on the shoulders of our modern technology stack. We continue to invest significantly in those shoulders. There are a number of -- excuse me, there are a small number of large modern technology companies fully in the cloud, built on modern applications and data they are in a unique position to win as the world continues to evolve. We are one of them. Since the beginning of our technology transformation, our journey has been focused on bringing AI into the heart of the business. Many companies will be bringing in third-party AI applications, which will help transform how work is done, but transforming the business model of banking with AI requires AI to be deeply embedded in the technology, operations, processes, risk management and customer experiences of the company.\nThat is what we have been working backwards from for all of these years in our tech transformation. These opportunities require significant investment in AI and AI talent, and we are doing that. Having founded this company and spent these many years building an adaptive company to capitalize on the rapidly changing marketplace, I am struck by the opportunity all around us, but I also know what it took to get here. And that was investing what it takes to be in a position to win. Our opportunities are many and they are large, but so too is the investment to get there. But these investments will also be the basis for our sustained growth and strong returns over the longer term.\nThe opportunities we are describing here have been years in the making, and you have heard me talking about them for quite some time. Importantly, the earnings power of our combined company that we envision on the other side of the deal integration is consistent with what we assumed at the time of our deal announcement, even though some individual variables have moved along the way. We are excited for the opportunities that lie in front of us. It is our imperative to lean in and capitalize on them. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP, Global Finance\n\nThanks, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session.\n[Operator Instructions]\nIf you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Josh, please start our Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Jesse Curtis, Head of Funds Management. Please go ahead.\n\nJesse Curtis\n\nHead of Funds Management\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining Centuria Office REIT's 2025 Financial Year Results Presentation. My name is Jesse Curtis, Head of Funds Management for Centuria Capital. Presenting today with me is Belinda Cheung, Fund Manager of the Centuria Office REIT, and Cameron Mullen, Senior Fund Analyst. Also in the room with us is Grant Nichols, Head of Listed Funds; Tim Mitchell, Head of Investor Relations; and Jason Huljich, Joint CEO of Centuria Capital Group.\nStarting on Slide 3. I would like to commence today's presentation with an acknowledgment of country. We are joining you from the lands of the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation. Centuria manages property throughout Australia and New Zealand and pays its respects to the traditional owners in each country, to their unique culture and to their elders, past and present. The outlook for the office sector is showing stronger indicators of market improvement. Diminishing new office supply and a reduction in existing office stock is providing a backdrop to normalized vacancy and signs of improved tenant demand. This is particularly the case for metropolitan office where supply is becoming extremely constrained as office development feasibilities remained challenging, which we anticipate will drive market rents in the medium-term.\nOffice supply is further reduced with the rising trend of secondary assets being withdrawn for conversion to alternative uses, creating additional demand for displaced tenants. These trends bode well for existing A-grade office landlords and reaffirm our optimism for the future of metropolitan office markets. In today's presentation, Belinda and Cameron will cover an overview of COF's full year performance, COF's financial results, COF's portfolio and conclude with a market overview and guidance.\nMoving to Slide 4. Centuria Office REIT is managed by Centuria Capital Group, which has over $20 billion of assets under management. COF unitholders benefit from Centuria's deep real estate expertise, including a fully integrated property, facilities and asset management platform. Synergies across the group's wider office portfolio and strong alignment as Centuria is COF's largest unitholder and the manager's interests are strongly aligned with yours as unitholders.\nMoving now to Slide 6. COF's long-standing strategy and vision remains unchanged. We aspire to be Australia's leading pure-play office REIT with a focus on generating sustainable and quality income streams and executing initiatives to create value across our portfolio of quality office assets within metropolitan and near city markets that are differentiated by sustainability, amenity and connectivity. The results that Belinda and Cameron present today reflect the execution of this strategy, supported by the deep real estate capability of the broader Centuria team to drive value for unitholders. I will now pass over to Belinda.\n\nBelinda Cheung\n\nThank you, Jesse, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 7. COF had a solid performance during the 2025 financial year and delivered funds from operations of $0.118 per unit and distributions of $0.101 per unit, in line with guidance. Key highlights for the year include an $18 million property valuation gain in the second half, supported by market rental growth across most office markets, which marks the first period of portfolio growth since peak valuations were recorded in June 2022. Leasing terms were agreed for more than 24,000 square meters or 9% of the portfolio net lettable area across 44 separate deals, bringing occupancy to 91.2%, well above the National Metropolitan office occupancy level of 82%. All facilities financed with renegotiated covenants, allowing greater headroom to LVR and ICR covenant requirements and extending expiry to FY '28, and completion of a 1.1-megawatt edge data center, which has contributed to a 19% uplift in asset valuation and further diversifies the rental income streams in the REIT.\nCOF continues to execute its strategy as well as asset and capital management initiatives. Despite this, leasing Centuria markets are challenging and continue to weigh on earnings in FY '26, which is detailed on Slide 8. We provide FY '26 FFO guidance of $0.111 to $0.115 per unit and distribution guidance of $0.101 per unit. Key drivers of this outlook on earnings include forecast downtime associated with current vacancy and FY '26 expiries. We have conservative downtime assumptions, including no income for full floor vacancies and expiries in FY '26. Should we complete any incremental leasing, there will be potential upside to earnings.\nInterest rate cuts are another factor to the range. We anticipate COF's all-in cost of debt will be about 5.2%, which remains relatively consistent with a marginal cost of debt. There may be potential earnings upside should interest rate cuts be made beyond what is forecasted today. As always, leasing is a major focus, and we are well progressed on multiple leasing negotiations for the upcoming expiries, and we'll provide further updates in the first quarter update.\nLet's look more broadly at the Australian metropolitan office markets on Slide 9. Higher replacement costs continue to impact office development feasibilities, and we are seeing the strain on supply play out in the current market, including a growing number of muted or delayed projects. The future pipeline in metropolitan markets is meager compared to what was delivered during the past 5 years. And COF's portfolio will have minimal exposure to these buildings with less than 8% of the new stock built in directly competing markets. Costs are escalating economic rents, widening in metro and fringe markets compared to CBDs. This discourages tenants from pre-committing to new builds and instead shifts that demand to existing office buildings like COF's assets, which re-offer high-quality office spaces accessible to amenity and transport and by comparison, can offer more compelling value.\nOn to Slide 10. Replacement costs have increased by at least 40% since 2020, driven by escalations in material pricing and financing costs, labor as well as leasing-related incentives. The hypothetical cost to build an A-grade office in Metro Sydney has grown by our estimate from $11,000 a square meter to over $15,000 a square meter since 2020. At $15,000 a square meter, replacement costs are more than 2x COF's current average valuation at $6,900 per square meter, and this is 2.5x its implied value based on the recent trading price.\nMoving to Slide 11. Further adding to the supply stream is the significant shift in office withdrawal strategies of landlords from office redevelopment to conversion to alternate use. Looking back at the last 5 years, 3/4 of all withdrawn office stock was refurbished and reintroduced to the market as office stock. Looking forward to the next 5 years, we expect this to change significantly to over 90% of forecast future withdrawals converted to other uses. The driver for these drastic changes includes population growth outpacing housing supply and the introduction of government housing policies such as transport-oriented development or the Housing Development Authority, which are focused on metro markets due to its proximity to public transport, entertainment and civic precincts. Metropolitan markets have experienced higher levels of vacancy to date due to it having a higher concentration of low-grade underutilized office, which now presents an attractive case for conversion as the higher and better use shifts to other sectors like living, data center and life sciences and underpins the land value of metro office.\nIn more detail on Slide 12, it's estimated that by 2030, 10% of total office stock in Metro Sydney will be withdrawn and converted to non-office uses, displacing existing tenants of those buildings. Colliers expects over 100,000 square meters of office demand from these displaced tenants. Adding this to the forecast absorption numbers meaningfully improves the forecast vacancy in Metro Sydney to 8.7% by the end of 2030. I will now hand over to Cameron to take you through the financial results and portfolio overview.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Belinda. Moving to our financial results on Slide 14. COF delivered funds from operations of $70.4 million or $0.118 per unit. Gross property income decreased primarily due to asset divestments executed during FY '24 and higher portfolio vacancy. The average all-in cost of debt incurred for FY '25 was 5.4%. COF declared and paid distributions of $0.101 per unit across the period in quarterly installments, representing a payout ratio of 85.7%.\nSlide 15 details COF's capital management. At the beginning of the year, COF completed an $862 million loan refinance with existing lenders, resulting in beneficial outcomes such as renegotiated debt covenants, extended debt duration and no change to margin. COF maintains sufficient liquidity and debt covenant headroom with no debt expiring until FY '28.\nNow turning our attention to COF's portfolio, starting on Slide 17. The COF portfolio provides quality, highly connected and affordable office space that is consistent with the style of workspace that both occupiers and investors increasingly seek. That is new generation buildings that provide high-quality accommodation with healthy lifestyle-orientated work environments, efficient floor plates and improved amenity while being competitively priced. Furthermore, there is increased demand to be located in areas that provide efficient commutes to improve employee satisfaction and attract the best talent. When looking specifically at the COF portfolio, it has been positioned to deliver on many of these qualities by offering a young portfolio with an average of 18 years, high-quality assets with 93% meeting an A-grade specification, highly efficient buildings with 5-star average NABERS energy rating, significant geographic diversification, providing exposure to Australia's high-performing office markets and locations that are easily accessible by both public and private transport with generous car parking availability.\nMoving to the portfolio overview on Slide 18. COF's portfolio comprises young quality assets position in Australian metropolitan and near city office markets. COF's portfolio of 19 assets is truly diversified with no single state exposure greater than 26%. Importantly, the portfolio is underpinned by quality tenants, posting over 75% of portfolio income being derived from government, multinational corporations and listed entities. The ability to attract quality tenants is reinforced by a large proportion with 62% of our tenant base being larger corporates, occupying space exceeding 2,000 square meters.\nI will now hand back to Belinda to take you through the leasing summary for the period.\n\nBelinda Cheung\n\nThanks, Cam. Turning to Slide 19. During the period, lease terms were agreed for over 24,000 square meters across 44 deals, representing 8.9% of COF's total portfolio NLA. Average rents increased by 4.5%, and we have reached full occupancy in WA. We continue to focus on leasing existing vacancies and upcoming expiries across the portfolio, particularly in Docklands and St. Leonards. Despite having faced a challenging leasing environment with higher market vacancy rates during the period, terms agreed for over 6,000 square meters in these markets. Achieving high portfolio occupancy is a key management focus, and we are actively seeking outcomes to further improve COF's lease expiry profile, focusing on improving tenant amenity, aligning asset strategies with market conditions and finding cost-effective solutions for tenants.\nMoving to valuations on Slide 20. Pleasingly, COF's portfolio reported an $18 million valuation gain in the second half, marking the first period of valuation growth for the COF portfolio since FY '22. Further to that, 66% of the portfolio increased in value or had stable valuations, indicating that metro market valuations are stabilizing and potentially at an inflection point. The portfolio's weighted average capitalization rate further expanded to 6.89%. However, this softening has been offset in some valuations by market rent growth at an average of 4% across the portfolio.\nNow turning to sustainability on Slide 21. COF continued to demonstrate its commitment to environmental, social and governance initiatives. COF achieved a 5-star NABERS Sustainability Portfolio Index rating and is targeting 0 Scope 2 emissions by 2028. More than half of COF's portfolio is now electrified, including 100% of our Queensland assets.\nContinuing on Slide 23. Looking ahead to the medium-term, there are a growing number of drivers supporting the Australian office markets. We touched on some of these earlier in the presentation, including high replacement cost supply, and office withdrawals significantly restricting future supply and improving vacancy levels in metro markets, transport infrastructure being at the center of conversion feasibilities and rental growth potential resulting from the supply and demand dynamics. We also believe Australia will benefit from high population growth forecasts, driving a larger contingent of white-collar workers and the shift in occupier sentiment towards office-centric workforces increasing demand for office space. This has also contributed to increased levels of interest in the office sector from investors looking beyond the short-term volatility. We saw improvement in transaction volumes resulting from the narrowing price gap between buyer and seller expectations, which demonstrated the growing positive sentiment to the sector and returning investor appetite, both domestically and globally.\nCOF's FY '25 priorities are outlined on Slide 24. From here, we continue to focus on maintaining high portfolio occupancy, improve portfolio quality and preserve a solid balance sheet, maintaining sufficient liquidity and debt covenant headroom. I draw this presentation to a close on Slide 25 with the FY '26 FFO and distribution guidance. Thank you for your continued interest in Centuria Office REIT. I will now hand back to the operator and welcome any questions you may have.",

I want to begin tonight by welcoming our colleagues at Discover to the Capital One journey. As you know, we completed our acquisition of Discover on 18 May, and we're fully mobilized and hard at work on integration, which is going well. It's still early days, but we very much like what we've seen so far. We share key cultural attributes with Discover, including a deep shared commitment to customers. And we're as excited as ever by the expanding set of opportunities to grow and create value as a combined company. From our founding days, we've been on a quest to build a great financial institution, an integrated banking and global payments platform that's positioned at the forefront of the opportunities that will come as technology and data transform financial services. Discover enhances and accelerates our progress on this quest. I'll share additional thoughts on the hard work, investments, and compelling opportunities we see going forward at the conclusion of tonight's call. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Andrew to discuss the balance sheet and purchase accounting impacts of the deal, as well as our financial performance in the Q2. Andrew.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. As Rich just discussed, we closed the acquisition of Discover on 18 May. We have now completed provisional purchase accounting and incorporated Discover's business lines into our reported segments, with Discover's domestic card and personal loans now included in our credit card segment, and Discover's deposits and network businesses in our consumer segment. As part of the acquisition, we acquired $98.3 billion of domestic card loans with a net fair value discount of $220 million. We also acquired $9.9 billion of personal loans with a net fair value discount of $114 million. We acquired $106.7 billion of deposits with a net fair value discount of $30 million. The amortization of these net fair value marks decreased net interest income by $85 million in the quarter.\nThe full loan and deposit amortization schedule is included on Slide 17 of the appendix. We also acquired $7.9 billion of home loans, which have been marked as held for sale and are now included in discontinued operations. The net credit mark on the Discover loan portfolio increased the allowance on the balance sheet by $8.4 billion, with $8.8 billion of provision expense for Non-PCD loans flowing through the P&L. I will discuss the allowance in greater detail in a moment. There were multiple amortizing intangibles created as a result of the acquisition. We recognized a core deposit intangible of $1 billion, a purchased credit card relationships intangible of $10.3 billion, and network and financial partner relationships intangibles of $1.5 billion. The amortization of these intangibles increased non-interest expense by $255 million in the Q2. We have included a full intangible amortization schedule on Slide 18 in the appendix.\nWe also recognized two intangibles with indefinite lives: a network intangible of $3.1 billion and brand and trade name intangibles of $2.3 billion. And finally, we recorded goodwill of $13.2 billion. Including the impact of purchase accounting and the allowance build, the partial quarter impact of the legacy Discover businesses contributed $2 billion of revenue and a $6.4 billion net loss to the results from continuing operations. I'll also note that as we bring the two companies together, there are financial reporting presentation realignments and business changes that impact the reporting geography of revenue, marketing, and operating expense recognition. In total, these moves increased the operating efficiency by roughly 30 basis points and the total efficiency by roughly 15 basis points in the Q2.\nLooking ahead, we expect the run rate impact of these changes to result in a roughly 90 basis points increase to the operating efficiency ratio and a roughly 50 basis points increase to the total efficiency ratio, all else equal. There is no impact from the reclassifications to the timing of recognition in either the Q2 or in future quarters, so the net impact to the bottom line is negligible. Turning to Slide 4, I'll cover the Q2 financial highlights for the combined company. Our results for the quarter were significantly impacted by the completion of the Discover acquisition. On a GAAP basis, we had a net loss of $4.3 billion, or a loss of $8.58 per diluted common share. Included in the results for the quarter were multiple adjusting items related to Discover, as well as a small addition to our legal reserves.\nNet of these adjusting items, net income in the quarter was $2.8 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $5.48. There was also one notable item in the quarter. A law change in the state of California increased our effective tax rate, but also created a one-time $128 million tax benefit as a result of truing up our deferred tax asset. Revenue in the Q2 increased $2.5 billion, or 25%, compared to the first quarter. Adjusted revenue increased 26%, or $2.6 billion. Non-interest expense increased 18%, or 14%, net of adjustments. Pre-provision earnings in the Q2 were up 34% relative to the first quarter. Net of adjustments, pre-provision earnings increased by 40%. The increase in pre-provision earnings was largely driven by the partial quarter impact of Discover, while also benefiting from strong legacy Capital One results.\nOn a GAAP basis, our provision for credit losses was $11.4 billion in the quarter. Excluding the $8.8 billion initial allowance build for Discover, provision for credit losses was $2.7 billion, an increase of $294 million compared to the prior quarter. The increase was more than driven by $324 million in higher net charge-offs. A decline in charge-offs at legacy Capital One was more than entirely offset by the addition of the partial quarter of the Discover portfolio. Turning to Slide 4, I'll now cover the allowance in greater detail. We built $7.9 billion of allowance in the quarter, bringing the allowance balance to $23.9 billion.\nThe primary drivers of the change in allowance related to the Discover acquisition, which included an $8.8 billion expense for non-PCD loans and a $2.9 billion initial allowance for PCD loans, offset by a $3.3 billion benefit from the expected recoveries of acquired Discover loans that are fully charged off. Excluding these Discover impacts, the allowance balance declined by approximately $400 million. Our total portfolio coverage ratio increased 52 basis points to 5.43%, driven largely by the mix shift of our portfolio. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 6. In our credit card segment, we built approximately $8 billion of allowance in the quarter. Roughly $760 million of the build is driven by the acquisition of Discover's personal loan portfolio, with the remaining $7.2 billion build in the domestic card business. The domestic card build was driven by two factors.\nFirst, we released approximately $400 million of allowance in the legacy Capital One portfolio. This legacy card release was driven by continued favorable credit performance in the quarter, partially offset by a modestly worse economic outlook. And second, we built $7.6 billion of allowance for the Discover domestic card loans added in the quarter. The combination of incorporating an updated economic outlook, aligning allowance methodologies, and reserving for growth in the portfolio led to a roughly $400 million increase in the allowance for Discover's card loans relative to the equivalent balance as a standalone company at the end of Q1. The consolidated domestic card coverage ratio now stands at 7.62%. The allowance balance in our consumer banking segment was largely flat at $1.9 billion. Observed credit favorability and the impact of stable auction prices was largely offset by growth in the auto business.\nThe ending coverage ratio of 2.29% was down 8 basis points from the prior quarter. And finally, the commercial banking allowance balance of $1.5 billion and coverage ratio of 1.74% are largely flat to the prior quarter. Turning to page seven, I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves ended the Q2 at $144 billion, up roughly $13 billion relative to last quarter. Our cash position sits at $59.1 billion, up $10.5 billion from the prior quarter. The increase in cash was primarily driven by proceeds from the sale of a portion of Discover's securities, as well as the addition of acquired cash from Discover. Our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio increased slightly during the Q2 to 157%, and our average NSFR remained roughly flat at 136%. Turning to page eight, I'll cover our net interest margin.\nOur Q2 net interest margin was 7.62%, 69 basis points higher than the prior quarter. The partial quarter impact of adding Discover increased NIM by roughly 40 basis points. This 40 basis point increase includes the roughly offsetting effects of a 6 basis point drag from the fair value marks and a 6 basis point tailwind from changing Discover's historical practice to now include late fees in interest income. The remaining nearly 30 basis point improvement in NIM was driven by legacy Capital One, which had lower rate paid on deposits, a liability mix shift towards deposits, and one additional day in the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect the full quarter benefit from the Discover acquisition to drive an additional 40 basis point increase to NIM, all else equal. Turning to Slide 9, I will end by discussing our capital position.\nOur Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 14%, approximately 40 basis points higher than the prior quarter. The impact of the equity issuance for the acquisition was partially offset by the additional goodwill and intangible assets, the increase in risk-weighted assets, the net loss in the quarter, dividends, and $150 million of share repurchases. During the quarter, the Federal Reserve released the results of their stress test. Our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement is 4.5%, resulting in a CET1 need of 9%. The new SCB becomes effective on 1 October. Now that we've closed the Discover transaction, we are working through our internal modeling of the combined company's capital need and look forward to sharing an update once our work is complete. With that, I will turn the call back over to Rich.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Andrew. Slide 11 shows Q2 results in our credit card business. Credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 12. The Discover acquisition was the dominant driver of Q2 domestic card results, including the impact of a partial quarter of combined operations, a combined quarter-end balance sheet, and purchase accounting effects. Looking through the Discover impacts, the combined domestic card business delivered another quarter of top-line growth, strong margins, and improving credit. Year-over-year purchase volume growth for the quarter was 22%, which includes $26.5 billion of Discover purchase volume. Excluding Discover, year-over-year purchase volume growth was about 6%. Ending loan balances increased 72%, largely as a result of adding $99.7 billion of Discover card loans. Excluding Discover, ending loans grew about 4% year-over-year.\nRevenue was up 33% from Q2 2024, driven largely by adding the partial quarter of Discover revenue. Excluding Discover, year-over-year revenue growth was about 8%, driven by underlying growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin for the quarter was 17.3%, including a 121 basis point impact from the partial quarter of combined operations and amortization of the purchase accounting fair value mark. Excluding these Discover impacts, revenue margin would have been 18.5%. The domestic card net charge-off rate was 5.25%, down 80 basis points from the prior year quarter. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.60%, down 54 basis points from the prior year. These metrics were impacted by the addition of Discover, which has historically had lower losses and delinquencies than Capital One. The delinquency metric was also impacted by aligning methodologies between Discover and Capital One.\nCapital One's legacy domestic card portfolio would have had a net charge-off rate of 5.50%, down 55 basis points year-over-year, and a 30-plus delinquency rate of 3.92%, down 22 basis points from the prior year. Capital One's card delinquencies have been improving on a seasonally adjusted basis since October of last year, and our losses have been improving since January of 2025. Discover's card credit metrics peaked about a quarter later, but are now improving steadily following a similar path to what we observe on the legacy Capital One portfolio. Domestic card non-interest expense was up 42% compared to Q2 2024. Operating expense and marketing both increased year-over-year. Total company marketing expense in the quarter was $1.35 billion, up 26% year-over-year. Our choices in domestic card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see compelling growth opportunities in our domestic card business.\nOur marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business and build an enduring franchise with heavy spenders at the top of the market. Compared to the Q2 of 2024, domestic card marketing in the quarter included the addition of Discover marketing, higher direct response marketing, higher media spend, and increased investment in premium benefits and differentiated customer experiences. As always, all of our marketing and origination choices are informed by our continuous monitoring of portfolio trends, market conditions, and consumer and competitor behaviors. Slide 13 shows Q2 results in our consumer banking business. Global payment network transaction volume from the 18 May 2024 close of the Discover acquisition through quarter-end was about $74 billion. Auto originations were up 28% from the prior year quarter, driven by overall market growth and our strong position to pursue resilient growth in the current marketplace.\nConsumer banking ending loan balances increased $5.6 billion, or about 7% year-over-year. Average loans were up 6%. Compared to the year-ago quarter, ending consumer deposits grew at 36%, and average consumer deposits were up about 21%, driven largely by the addition of Discover deposits. Looking through the Discover impact, our digital-first national consumer banking business continues to grow and gain traction, powered by our technology transformation and our compelling no-fees, no-minimums, and no-overdraft fees customer value proposition. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter was up about 16% year-over-year, driven predominantly by the partial quarter of Discover, as well as growth in auto loans.\nNon-interest expense was up about 37% compared to the Q2 of 2024, driven largely by the partial quarter of Discover, as well as increased auto originations, the legal reserve addition that Andrew mentioned, higher marketing to drive growth in our national consumer banking business, and continued technology investments. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.25%, down 56 basis points year-over-year. Largely as the result of our choice to tighten credit and pull back in 2022, auto charge-offs are improving on a seasonally adjusted basis. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.84%, down 83 basis points year-over-year. Slide 14 shows Q2 results for our commercial banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, both ending and average loan balances were up 1%. Ending deposits were down about 2% from the linked quarter. Average deposits were down 4%. We continue to manage down selected, less attractive commercial deposit balances.\nQ2 revenue was up 6% from the linked quarter, and non-interest expense was up by about 1%. The commercial banking annualized net charge-off rate for Q2 increased 22 basis points from the sequential quarter to 0.33%. The commercial criticized performing loan rate was 5.89%, down 52 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate was down 10 basis points to 1.30%. As we close this presentation and before we open it up for Q&A, I want to pull up and reflect not just on the quarter, but also on where we are. In Q2, bringing on Discover for a partial quarter and the related purchase accounting impacts dominated our reported results. But looking through these effects, our adjusted earnings, top-line growth, credit results, and capital generation continued to be strong.\nWe completed the Discover acquisition on 18 May 2024, and we continue to be very excited about the opportunity. Here are some early financial observations. They are, of course, still subject to change, but we wanted to share our thoughts with you. Let me start with integration costs. Our integration budget covers a wide array of expenses, including deal costs, moving Discover onto our tech stack, integrating their products and experiences, making additional investments in risk management and compliance, and integrating the talent and taking care of the associates along the way. The integration is off to a great start, but as we have gotten more granularity on each of these efforts, we expect our integration costs will be somewhat higher than our previously announced $2.8 billion. Let me turn now to synergies.\nWe are on track to deliver the $2.5 billion in total net synergies we discussed on the April earnings call. There are significant cost savings, and also significant real revenue synergies, and we have line of sight to achieving them. I also want to savor this moment and where we are. We are on the cusp of even greater opportunities down the road. These opportunities come both from this deal, and also from Capital One's transformation to be at the frontier of a rapidly changing marketplace. These opportunities are exciting, but they will require significant investment to bring them home. Let me start with the opportunities with Discover. The revenue synergies we have already identified come from moving our debit business and a portion of our credit business onto the Discover Network.\nTo move more volume and capitalize on the tremendous scale benefits of the network, we need to achieve greater international acceptance and then build a global network brand. This will enable moving bigger spenders onto the Discover Network. These additional moves require sustained investment for a number of years, and we will begin to undertake these investments first in acceptance, and then when we get the network to critical mass, we will invest in the network brand. There are only two banks in the world with their own network, and we are one of them. We are moving to capitalize on this rare and valuable opportunity. With all the discussion of Discover, we can lose sight of the very important place legacy Capital One is in. We are in the 13th year of an all-in technology transformation.\nWhile most companies have invested in transforming technology at the top of the tech stack, in other words, leading with customer-facing applications, we have taken the much harder but ultimately necessary journey. We have been rebuilding the company from the bottom of the tech stack up, essentially building a modern technology company that does banking. As we move up the tech stack, the opportunities are accelerating. We are also the beneficiary of decades of investment in our data and analytics capabilities and the building of a well-known national brand. Together with our leading technology capabilities, they are the enablers of our many opportunities. Take our retail bank. The universal playbook in banking is to build a national bank through acquisitions. However, we are doing it organically on the shoulders of our modern tech stack, our full-service digital banking offerings, our thin physical distribution of showroom branches, and our national brand.\nWe are enjoying a lot of traction, and the acquisition of a network propels us forward even more. Building the national bank requires sustained investment in marketing, and we are doing that, and we expect to lean in even more. Let me turn to our card business. After building a mass-market credit card business, we declared in 2010 we were launching a quest to win at the top of the market with heavy spenders. Few card players have chosen sustainably to take on this quest. We have been steadfast. We have had a lot of success in this journey, but it is a long one. Our two biggest competitors are investing heavily, and we know we will need to keep leaning into this big opportunity. As we have moved up the tech stack, we have seized the opportunity to pursue emerging growth opportunities across our company.\nSome of the salient ones you have seen and hopefully experienced, like Capital One Shopping and Capital One Travel. Another example is Auto Navigator, which is a third-party platform designed to reduce friction for consumers and dealers in buying and financing a car. Most importantly, we continue to invest in our modern technology stack. The gap between the modern technology companies fully in the cloud, built on modern applications and data, and the rest of corporate America continues to grow. The modern tech companies are well-positioned to win as the world continues to evolve, and we have spent years to become one of them. The rage of the world is AI. Some aspects of the AI revolution will be broadly accessible to all companies, and other aspects will be very exclusive.\nMost companies will benefit from the transformation in how work is done that will be available through third-party AI tools. But only the companies built on a modern tech stack and deeply invested in data will be in a position to reinvent their business model to put AI at the heart of operations, risk management, and the customer experience. The opportunities are transformational, and we are well-positioned in that quest. But these opportunities require sustained investment in AI and in AI talent, and we are doing that. In a company built for innovation and organic growth, I am struck by the number of compelling opportunities for innovation and value creation that we see. These opportunities are made possible by the choices we have made over the last many years.\nAs I have been saying, these opportunities require investment, and for many of them, timing is critical as we strive to seize competitive advantage. Collectively, these investments across Discover and legacy Capital One are significant, but they also will be the basis for our sustained growth and strong returns over the longer term. The opportunities we are describing here have been years in the making, and you have heard me talking about them for quite some time. Importantly, the earnings power of our combined company that we envision on the other side of the deal integration is consistent with what we assumed at the time of our deal announcement, even though some individual variables have moved along the way.\nWhen I reflect on our journey from founding the company to where we are today, we got here by always working backwards from where winning is and driving the continual transformations and investments to get there. The choices we made over the years also created the opportunity for us to acquire Discover. And in the spirit of that quest, 38 years after the founding idea for Capital One, we find ourselves as well-positioned as we've ever been to drive future success and value creation. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff. Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. Remember, as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the investor relations team will be available. Josh, please start the Q&A session.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. One moment for questions. Our first question comes from Terry Ma with Barclays. You may proceed.\n\nTerry Ma\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays Plc\n\nHey, thank you. Good evening. Now that you've closed the acquisition, and I do appreciate the updated financial observations, do you have any kind of updated thoughts on economics of the deal that you can share, whether it's earnings power over time or some sort of return targets that investors should be kind of thinking about?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nTerry, thank you. We were really glad to be in a position of finally being able to close the deal, and we're a number of weeks into being on the other side of that. I shared some comments in the prepared remarks about how we're thinking about continuing to be very much believing in the earnings power of our combined entity. And also, of course, we're leaning into the opportunities that are classic Capital One in terms of really laying the foundation for longer-term earnings power on top of that. So we don't have any really, other than my earlier comments. I don't have any further specific updates on that, but we certainly are very bullish about the deal and the economics, earnings power, and opportunities on the other side.\n\nTerry Ma\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays Plc\n\nGot it. And then as a follow-up, just on capital level, which you mentioned you guys are doing your internal work, any sense of kind of timing of when you would kind of get that informed view and communicate that to investors? As I kind of take a step back, you guys are at 14% CET1. That's meaningfully above what legacy Capital One's target was of 11% and Discover's of 10% to 11%. Is there any reason why on a consolidated basis it would be kind of meaningfully different? Thank you.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nYeah, Terry, having closed the deal just a couple of months ago, we are just getting full access to all of Discover's customer-level data, and we need to run all of that information through our models. While we received the SCB from the Fed and it declined to 9%, as you well know, that number's fluctuated from 10.3% to 7% over the last handful of years. We think about capital largely through the lens of our internal assessment of our longer-term capital need versus the Fed's, which is why we need to do that modeling. We are still in the middle of that work right now. I will say that we're not finding anything surprising at all in our analysis, and we feel comfortable that at 14%, we're operating with excess capital above the long-term need of the combined company, and we have the flexibility with our repurchase actions as we're operating under the SCB, but we need to complete that work. As we get closer to finishing the work, I think it's reasonable to assume that we'll begin to step up our repurchases from recent levels, but we look forward to sharing an update more broadly on our work when it's complete.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\n\nRick Shane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThanks for taking my question. Look, I'm going to break my own personal rule here. Congratulations on this completion of the acquisition. It's transformational, and it's going to be very interesting to see what happens from here. Rich, you had alluded to the fact that the integration expenses are going to be above the initial $2.8 billion target. Could you help us understand that more specifically? Also, could you put into context where you're seeing the opportunity for incremental investment so that that way we can sort of translate what the opportunity would be?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nTo that, Rick, thank you. Thanks for your congratulations. It's been a long time coming. We're all very excited about it, and we know our investors are pretty excited as well. With respect to the integration costs, I think when one embarks on a thing at the very beginning as we're undertaking a deal, we do our very best to take all the different things that would be involved in integration, go around the house, ask everybody what they think, and add it up. Basically, this is just a matter of as we get deeper into it, it is coming in. Well, first of all, we don't have an absolute definitive final estimate of it, but it's coming in somewhat higher. It's not in any one thing. It's really just across a variety of the many elements of this deal. As we got a sense it was going to be somewhat higher, we just wanted to flag that. The investments, let me talk about the investments here.\nEverything that I talked about in my remarks a few minutes ago about investments, our investments and opportunities, we've been talking about for some period of time. We're not unveiling something brand new that we've never talked about before. The point I really wanted to make and why I took the time to share that conversation is that all of these opportunities we have been pursuing for a long period of time, and they stand on the shoulders of investments we have been making for a very long period of time, most notably the investment in transforming the tech stack of Capital One, but also very much investments in brand, and deep, deep investments over many, many years on data and analytics and things like machine learning and AI itself.\nThe point that I was sharing with you is as we move up the tech stack and get deeper and get closer in the pursuit of these opportunities, we find these opportunities are, we're very excited about these opportunities, and some of the opportunities are sort of accelerating as we look at them. The only way to get there from here is to lean into the investments. We've been investing for quite some time, but our point was we're going to really be leaning in from here to pursue this set of opportunities that, if I calibrate relative to the whole history of founding and building Capital One, the portfolio of opportunities we have is the broadest and biggest set of opportunities that I've seen in our history. The only way to get there is with investment. You know the Capital One philosophy.We get very rigorous about what the opportunity is and what it costs to get there, but we lean into those investments, and I think that the value creation for our investors on the other side of this, consistent with the philosophy we've taken in the whole history of building Capital One, I think there's a lot of value creation opportunity. We're going to invest significantly to get there.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. You may proceed.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods\n\nThanks. Rich, obviously, Discover was working through a number of credit issues and not really leaning into growth like Capital One had been. I guess since credit's now somewhat under control there, do you expect to sort of lean into growth at Discover as well inside of Prime as we look forward?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nYeah. Sanjay, we do plan to lean into growth opportunities with Discover. Let me comment just a little bit about their card business, and you've seen this from the outside, but just sort of standing back and talking about it. It's an amazing franchise they've built over the years. The credit losses got higher than they expected, probably higher than anyone expected, due to a number of choices that were made in the preceding years. They very proactively stepped in, dialed back, and went a little bit more back to the basics of how they had built their franchise. That has muted their originations and their growth over this period of time, but they were very important choices, and it's also been powering their good credit performance.\nJust as an example, their most recent vintages are coming in a lot better than prior years, and it's a manifestation of pulling back. Now, when pulling back happens, the growth is somewhat muted, and that's the situation that they're in. Now, we're coming in and getting to know them and their impressive card business, and we like the products, so we plan to continue their flagship credit card product. They have an amazing student lending business that we're very excited to continue to—not student lending, sorry—student credit card business. We're excited to continue to lean into that. They've been very successful in a secured card, starter card business that they have had. From a product point of view, we're going to continue to lean into the business. We've spent a lot of time looking at their customer experience.\nThey score very high on metrics that we ourselves collect, not just their own collected metrics, but we ourselves in calibrated metrics in the industry. Great customer experiences, and very high levels of customer engagement. We are adopting a lot of the sort of customer technology choices that they have made. They have a great servicing experience that we're going to very much try to just continue pretty much exactly what they're doing there. From a brand point of view, of course, Discover won't be a corporate brand anymore, but on the credit card side, envision it, Sanjay, as a very salient product brand. We will lean into the opportunities there. It's going to be in the context of a little bit of muted growth at the moment. I think as we fully get into there, there'll probably be a few areas we'll dial back around the edges, and I'm pretty confident there will be some areas where we will lean even harder into growth than they were. It is certainly one of our goals to lean in to grow the franchise and try to preserve the very special things that enabled them to build one of the great credit card companies in America.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods\n\nThank you. Just a follow-up for Andrew. Sorry to ask this question because I'm sure I can parse through all of this excellent disclosure that you provided, and your comments, to get to some of my conclusions. Just as we look ahead, what are some of the variables that we need to think about as a result of these purchase accounting changes?I heard you mention the NIM having a 40 basis point tailwind because of the reclass of late fees and such. Maybe, Andrew, could you just help us think through some of the progression of the major line items as a result of this? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nWell, appreciate the acknowledgment. Sanjay worked really hard to disclose a lot, and I think you'll find not only in the presentation itself and in some of the footnotes, but also the monthly AK data that went out today. There's some additional disclosures around delinquency and charge-offs as well. We really did our best to provide visibility into all of those pieces. Reluctant to try to give you the full reconciliation of all of the metrics, I'd really point you to the couple of Slides in the appendix because that very clearly spells out what are the implications to NIM, what are the implications to operating expenses. In the footnote there, you will see that we not only gave annual views, but we gave a quarterly view of this year. For instance, you can see that NIM, given the very short life, for instance, of the non-PCD card loans, which are marked above par, actually creates a net drag in the immediate term, but that burns off very quickly. The non-PCD—I'm sorry, the PCD that carries forward is actually going to be a good guy to NIM over the course of multiple years. It's really hard to give you a succinct summary of all of those pieces, which is why we did our best to lay everything out as best we can. Of course, these are subject to some revisions over time, which is why I phrased it in the way that we did, but we're hopeful that these ultimately end up being the final marks.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.\n\nGood evening, everyone.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nHey, Ryan.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nHey, Ryan.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.\n\nRich, you talked about significant sustained investment. I think the phrase was used several times to talk about acceptance, marketing, the tech stack, and AI. I think this will obviously create questions about how much all of this is going to cost. Is there anything that you can share that can give the market comfort that there isn't significant synergy reinvestment risk and that eventually this will result in a more efficient consolidated company over time?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Ryan. When you think about the opportunities that we're talking about investing in, there are things I think investors have come to know over the years, and we have talked a lot about them. It starts with the tech transformation itself. As I say, we're in the 13th year of our technology transformation. The world continues to evolve, and we continue to build the most fully modern aspect up and down the tech stack. There's still work to do with respect to that, but we've had amazing progress, and we're not just trying to modernize the company, but rebuild it in a way that is really way more efficient, way more able to scale up innovation, way more able to more effectively manage risk, credit risk, fraud risk, operating risk, and to create enhanced customer experience. Collectively, we have found virtually all the things that we would like, the capabilities we'd like for our company to have, they all have the same shared path, which is through the modernization of technology. We will continue to invest there. I don't think there's anything from an investor point of view that would surprise them with respect to that.\nAs we move up the tech stack, it's a lonely journey when you're in the bottom of the tech stack modernizing one piece of core infrastructure because until a lot of other things are modernized, it's hard to see the tangible benefits. Moving up the tech stack moves one closer in the ability to more monetize the opportunities. Of course, beyond that, we have now the whole Discover opportunity, and there's lots we're investing in terms of integration and things like that. Specifically, I call out that after this first wave of moving all of our debit card business and a portion of our credit card business onto the network to really capitalize on the tremendous scale, the scale economics in the network business, we really want to work to move more volume there.\nAll roads in that quest lead through investing in international acceptance and then a global network brand. I think we've talked a lot to investors about that. We're very compelled by the opportunities on the other side, but it's very clear to us that's a multi-year journey, and it's going to require quite a bit of investment. Additionally, let's talk about our national bank. We're the only major bank that I know of that is trying to build a national full-service bank organically. Everybody else is doing it through acquisitions. That requires a lot of investment. We've had a lot of success in building this. Now, bringing on the Discover Network and seeing the traction that we're getting collectively in our business, these are very attractive. We see great opportunity to continue to lean in, in fact, even lean in harder on building our national bank.\nOf course, there's the quest at the top of the market. We all see what, even including over the last week or so, what players, the small number of players who are really focused on winning at the very top of the market, they're investing hard. There's a reason they're investing hard, because there is a great opportunity at the top of the market, and it's not an opportunity that is available widely to all the credit card companies. It requires a lot of sustained investment, brand building, technology, experiences, and products, etc. We're very pleased with the traction there. Ryan, each year in our quest, we find that while we're getting good growth in our card business, the fastest growing part of our card business has been with the heavier spenders.\nIt's a continued indication of the success as we keep moving higher in the marketplace, build the strength of our brand a little bit more each year. That's something we're excited about. The traction we're getting is validation to us of the payoff of continuing to invest there. As we have moved up the top of the tech stack, we also are building customer experiences to capitalize on being a company. If you pull up, Ryan, and think about this, we're not trying to just build a bank like the next bank down the street. We're trying to build a bank that is right at the heart of consumers' and businesses' financial lives, with primary banking relationships and primary spending relationships.\nWe now have well over 100 million customers and the ability to, over time, leverage that franchise of very highly engaged customers with not just banking and credit card products, but, in fact, build a much broader franchise with those highly engaged customers. That's why we're leaning into opportunities like Capital One Shopping, Capital One Travel, and Auto Navigator, each of which is much more deeply expanding our franchise. Each of them is getting significant growth and traction, and also able to leverage the size of our franchise, which, by the way, just got quite a bit bigger with this acquisition. My point to investors is, in a calibration across all the years I've been building Capital One, we've always taken the philosophy of working backwards from where winning is and investing with our pencils sharpened, and very rigorously from a value creation framework, investing on what it takes to win as the marketplace evolves. Where we are at this time in the evolution of the company has probably the best opportunities that I've seen, and we are leaning into this. Also, as I mentioned, the earnings power, even as we look at the investments we're talking about here, the earnings power remains consistent in our estimation, remains consistent with what we expected at the announcement.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.\n\nAppreciate the call. I'm going to step back and let somebody else ask a question.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS Securities LLC\n\nHi. Good afternoon. I'm going to just move off the expense question for a second and re-ask the question on capital. Fully appreciate that you're going through a review and fully appreciate the statement that you've found nothing yet that's surprising. As we think about the 14% versus the legacy targets of Capital One and Discover, I guess another way to ask the question is, how much time will you give yourself to optimize the capital to where you think the right level is for the company?\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nYeah. Well, there's two parts, I think, to that question, Erika. One is kind of what level are we heading towards, which is also impact at any point in time of what's just happening more broadly around us, which then spills into the second piece of it of how much do we want to be repurchasing at any one moment in time. I don't have a precise answer for you. Of course, there is some upper bound in terms of SEC limitations to repurchases. What I would point you to is we're going to work through the customer-level data, determine our longer-term capital need. As we move towards finishing that work, I think the operative phrase that I said earlier is we'll likely begin to step up our repurchases from recent levels. Once that work is complete, which we're doing as quickly as we can, we'll provide an update at that time.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS Securities LLC\n\nJust a quick follow-up for me. Ryan mentioned it was so important to investors. I just picked up on something that Rich said at the end of his answers to Ryan, which is that EPS power remains consistent with how you thought about it in the beginning of this journey with Discover. If I break it down, your integration expenses are coming in a little heavier than the $3.8 billion. You did mention, you did reiterate the synergy targets, which I would surmise include the expense synergy targets. I guess the last piece that everyone's trying to get at is the run rate of expense growth, for lack of a better word, legacy Capital One accelerate. I guess based on the explanation of what you're investing in, it seems like that would have been the case. Rich threw in EPS power should remain consistent with what you originally saw. Again, I know we're belaboring a point, but I think it's critical for investors as they think about the pro forma EPS power of this company.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nYeah. Erika, I think you were breaking up a little bit, but we got the essence of what you were saying there. Capital One and Discover have both historically had strong earnings power. In combining them, we can create a very strong institution and, of course, also add synergies. There have been many moving pieces since we announced the deal in both companies' actual operating results, investment choices, and, of course, in the broader economic, competitive, and credit backdrop. Since the deal announcement, individual line items have, of course, drifted, but the net drift has so far been in a favorable direction. At the same time, the opportunities and the investment associated with them have also grown. We estimate that the net earnings power of our combined company as it emerges from integration is similar to our estimates in the deal model.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen",
    "content2": "Great. Thanks. Rich, a couple of times you kind of alluded to competition in the high end of the card business. I was hoping you could kind of give us your sense as to how that's likely to evolve this year given what you've got going on at two of the major competitors, perhaps three, if you include all of the ones that have made announcements thus far, and whether there are any elements of the transaction that will be kind of helpful to Capital One in addressing that. I do have a follow-up. Thanks.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nYes, Moshe. When we look at the competitive environment, I've said for years, competition is very intense in the card business. Certainly, most striking of late has been competition at the very top of the market. Before we get into specifically sort of things that happened over the last couple of weeks, two areas that the stakes have gone up and the investment required has sort of gone up to be at the highest level is in lounges. You see a little bit of the sort of like an arms race. That's probably not the right word, but certainly the effort of the biggest players at the top of the market to build their own lounges in addition to offering a partnership, a network of lounges through partners. Capital One has been doing that, and we're very, very pleased with the four lounges, I guess five lounges that we have now, I guess five plus what we call The Landing, the one we have at Reagan National Airport. That's one of the areas that there's a lot of competition.\nThe research shows people really care about lounges. We understand that's part of the game. We are very pleased with the customer reaction there, the traction, the volumes, and the pickup in our own originations that we think is coming from that. Another area of competition at the top of the market is competition in marketing spend, and competition in creating unique access for customers. We also, in this space, have been very pleased with some of the unique access we've been able to offer. Obviously, our Taylor Swift partnership has been a special opportunity for us. This is the flip side of some of the investments required, that a small number of players, I think, are separating from the pack relative to their offerings and the extent of their commitment to this space.\nI think competitively, there are real opportunities on the flip, on the other side of the sort of higher stakes of investment. We then get to the products. It is striking that at the top of the market, both Chase and American Express have made announcements about things that, well, with American Express, we still have not seen what they are going to come out with. Certainly, on the Chase side, we have seen a higher fee on the one hand, but also ramping up some of the rewards, and also extending the list significantly of sort of the opportunities more on a coupon-type basis that can come. It is very clear. Amex seems to be, they have already been on a similar path there for a number of years. I think that we would expect they will come out with some enhanced offerings there.\nWe have crafted our strategy at the top of the market to not just be going out and try to exactly copy what the others do, but to try to create something that, in its own way, for the right customers, is an absolutely best-in-class experience. Take our Venture X product. First of all, in terms of the earn rates on Venture X, it's earning at the 2x rate, which is the higher earn rate than some of the competitive products. Other products have co-brand relationships with airlines, and there are both a lot of expenses there, but also unique offerings. We instead have the any airline and sort of the unique aspects of the 2x on everything with Venture X. What I would share with you is we are very pleased with the traction on Venture X. You've seen us on television continuing to tell our story.\nI think that as other competitors come out with their plays that are different from ours, there continues to be, I think, quite a lot of open space at our price point, and our collective set of offerings and experiences that really, I think, offers a lot of opportunity for us. We're leaning in hard with Venture X, and we're continuing to build enhanced capabilities across digital experiences, product offerings, lounges, and special preferred access that I think will continue to position Capital One in a very attractive way in the competitive environment. You ask about the network. Basically, adding Discover, what impact will that have? Certainly, adding the scale of Discover certainly helps us with respect to just more opportunity to, even though Discover was not a top-of-the-market player. I think also, Moshe, down the road, longer term, I think we see opportunities on the network side of the business relative to the higher end of the market. I think that's an opportunity that is more way down the road than one in the near term.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you. Got it. Thanks. Maybe just as kind of a follow-up, I think one of the things that we've thought about a little bit is using the benefit of unregulated debit interchange to help build the banking franchise and to go to a rewards checking model. You talked about the banking franchise and some of those impacts. Could you talk about how you see that now that you've got access to this and can start migrating your debit accounts?\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nOur national bank strategy has always been about offering industry-leading products backed by a business model that can economically support that. When you think about that, we have a full-service digital bank. There are a lot of folks out there with digital banking capabilities. A key differentiator is Capital One has full-service digital banking. We do believe physical presence matters, and our research continues to confirm that. Even ironically, so many people say, yeah, I never go into branches. In their choices, physical presence does matter to a lot of people. That is why we have built our thin distribution model of these sort of showroom branches. Again, importantly, working backwards from having the economics, that is different from a branch on every corner kind of a thing. The economics of this have supported a product offer that is industry-leading.\nNo fees, no minimums, and no overdraft fees. No other major bank has a primary offering that matches that. Actually, our product offer is democratizing banking by making it available to anyone at no cost. Customers have responded very positively. Now, let me turn to Discover. Discover has a small portfolio of cashback debit cards. We plan to keep those customers in their current product. With the benefit of the network now and bringing Discover on, we are raising the investment levels in our flagship product to help propel our national bank growth with the very successful, industry-leading value proposition that has gotten us here. We are keeping what Discover had for its customers, and we will lean into our industry-leading banking product going forward.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\n\nDon Fandetti\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nRich, can you share a little bit more about your international acceptance build-out plans? I am just trying to think if there's a way you can help size it or talk about how the expenses get funded because I guess the revenue benefit of moving the bulk of the credit cards over to the network happens after you get the acceptance. If there are any sort of guideposts or targets that you have, that would be helpful.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nDon, we, of course, haven't been in the network business. Over the course of our—what was it?—15 or 16 or 17 months of pre-deal, we did everything we could to learn about the network business. We brought in a bunch of consultants to teach us everything they knew about that. Now, especially as we get on the other side of this, we are really going to school on the amazing learnings we're able to get with Discover. I really want to say I've seen a lot of scale businesses in my days, and just about every banking business I've ever seen is really quite scale-driven. I've never seen any business as scale-driven as a network, because the marginal cost of a transaction is virtually zero, and the fixed costs are high in a business like that. It's not an accident that there are two—Visa and Mastercard are enormous companies—and that most banks around the world don't have enough scale to have their own network, even if they could solve the chicken-and-egg problem to get there. We look at this, and we're certainly blessed to have a network.\nI am struck that given Discover's really small-scale, domestically pretty small-scale, but globally strikingly modest scale, I am struck at how extensive the international acceptance that they have already built is. Now, it's not up to the levels that we would really want it to be in order to move more internationally traveling customers there. I certainly was surprised at how good it is relative to the scale and sort of thinking about the challenge they have to get there. Here's the inspiring thing. They've already built pretty good international acceptance, and they have a playbook to do it that is the same playbook one would use to get quite a bit more international acceptance.\nThere are four ways, basically, to build international acceptance, and four ways that Discover has cobbled together this international network acceptance: partnering with other networks, partnering with merchant acquirers, partnering with card-issuing financial institutions, and finally, going directly to merchants. They used a combination of all four of those. We have sat with them and said, how feasible is it to get more, and how would you get more? The answer really is continue leveraging those four, and just lean in harder and invest more than Discover has historically invested. We don't—in the calibration of the hills that Capital One has taken on over time, and the journeys and the investments we've done in the history of our company, this is right down the fairway of the kind of challenge we take on working backwards from where winning is.\nWe don't have an estimate of exactly what it will take. There's also another thing of even what acceptance level is exactly what we need because this is something, as we get into it and see our customers' experiences, it's a bit of a, you know what, when you see it, kind of a thing. What I'm comfortable with is the playbook is there, and the opportunity on the other side of this is very clear because that is the path to help us move more volume to the other side. That plus the building of—I mean, Discover already has a network brand. When I talk about building a global network brand, picture something that has a more global, more of a global brand, more of a market brand. These are things working backwards from where we would try to go with our business down the road. To us, it's a very clear path. It is classic Capital One, and we have taken on many challenges, many opportunities like this, and patiently worked backwards from demonstrated opportunities. This is right in the wheelhouse of that.\n\nDon Fandetti\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nThank you.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGood evening. Just to go back to the cost topic again, the expense topic, sorry to go back to it. Just to clarify, what type of costs are included in the upfront integration costs that you indicated are likely to come in higher? What types of investments are netted against the $1.5 billion in cost savings that you set out?\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nJohn, I want to ask for clarification on the back half of your question. But in terms of what is included in the integration costs, we had deal costs. We are making additional investments in their risk management. We're integrating their people. We're moving them to our tech stack. So those are the components that were included in the integration costs. So it's not one specific thing that I would point you to in terms of what is increasing the integration and signaling that we think they might be somewhat higher. But I didn't quite follow the second half of your question. So could you just repeat that?\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah. I was just trying to determine the difference between the type of costs that are included in the upfront integration costs that are coming in higher versus the type of investments, like the investments in the network and the investments in regulatory areas that may be netted against the net cost savings that you set out.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nYeah. So investments would include things like building out additional capabilities for debit on the network to enable future spend and increase customer engagement, as opposed to in the integration costs that just reflects the sheer act of taking our debit volume and moving them onto their system. So philosophically, hopefully, that provides a bit of a window into the distinction between what is an integration spend versus what is an ongoing investment.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nRight. So there's investments, there's ongoing investments that you mentioned, being that they are netted against the cost savings and that you feel good about, or that you had indicated in your prepared remarks that you are on track to achieve the expected two and a half billion synergies. So is it fair to assume that there's no implied expected change in those investments that are within that two and a half billion?\nThere are three pieces to this. Maybe I'll put it in my language to make sure we're saying the same thing. One are the integration costs, the $2.8 billion number that Rich referenced in his prepared remarks. And those are the necessary expenses, deal costs, people costs, integrating them onto our tech stack, moving our debit onto their network. The second piece are the cost synergies that we have identified as a result of bringing our two organizations together. And those cost synergies are fully intact. The third piece to it is additional investments that, in some ways, like Rich enumerated, that we will be making beyond the current levels of investments in certain areas that we're making today. So that is distinct from the achievement of the cost synergies that you articulated in the bucket. And I think you are netting the second and third category in your question, but I really want to create a firm distinction between those two things because the additional investments are things that will power future growth and create additional value. The window or the evaluation process that we use for considering those investments are just like any other investment that we would make in Capital One, which is importantly distinct from achieving the synergies that we laid out in announcing the deal.\nOkay. All right. Thank you.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\n\nJeff Adelson\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just on the debit conversion, I know you sort of characterized this as something that can happen relatively quickly. Can you just give us an update on where you are in that process, how quickly you'll be able to pull that off, achieve the full debit interchange benefit on a run rate basis, and maybe what are some of the steps you need to take from here to go through with that and complete the conversion? And as a part of that question, have you had any discussions with some of the largest merchants where your legacy Capital One debit customers are shopping today? Are those merchants on board with some of the changes that are coming forth, or are there any sort of negotiation that needs to happen?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nOkay. Thanks, Jeff. So we began reissuing Capital One debit cards onto the Discover Network with early pilot populations in June. And we expect the conversion to continue in phases through early 2026. We expect the majority of customers to be on the debit, excuse me, on the Discover Network by Q4 2025, with all debit purchase volume running on the Discover Network by early 2026. So one of the real attractions to us of buying a network is the ability to have direct merchant relationships. It's sort of the way the market works. But when I think about founding Capital One and building a company where I always believed that the tip of the spear of the technology revolution in financial services would be payments. And so we built basically a payments company. And it's always an odd thing to have one part of the value chain, a very important part in the value chain, run by an intermediary. And of course, it's reflective of how scale-driven the industry is. And that's kind of why it happens.\nBut elsewhere in our Capital One business, we have been working really hard to go direct to merchants and build direct merchant relationships because we have 100 million customers. Every merchant has the same objective function. They want to drive more sales. We have over 100 million customers that want to have better deals. Another sort of wing of Capital One is going direct to merchants and really being able to leverage our huge customer base and the massive investment we have made in data, technology, and, over time, AI to be able to create more value for merchants in areas like reducing fraud. We're way down that path in direct relationships with merchants, direct specific merchant-funded deals.\nSo we're excited that the Discover acquisition allows us to now take this one piece of the value chain that was entirely run through intermediaries and, for some of our business, to really go direct. So as we do that, Jeff, we will continue to have conversations with merchants about, and we also like to bring them data to show them the value that we're adding and the benefits of all of this. And the debit, and now moving more of our debit business, will be another part of those conversations and the growing relationship with merchants. But we look forward to all of that and the big picture point of a company, the scale of Capital One, really increasingly building a direct-to-merchant business model.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brian Foran with Truist Securities. You may proceed.\n\nBrian Foran\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nHi. I know you haven't been big users of guidance historically, but there have been times where you set out these guideposts, whether it's the OpEx efficiency target. I think there was threading the seam at one point, loss guidance, EPS guidance, those kinds of things when you're helping investors navigate periods of transition or trying to understand an issue. I know you're kind of deferring to give specific guidance right now, but is that something you're contemplating? I mean, it is hard to look at the kind of numbers for Q2 with the mid-quarter close and all the adjustments and really get comfortable or confidence of what the core is going to look like over the next couple of quarters. Is it kind of—is there a thought of giving guidance on some high-level metrics or targets on returns or something like that, or is it going to be a little bit more of a let the chips fall where they may philosophy?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nBrian, thank you for your question. If I stand back, I go back to the day we launched the IPO of Capital One. I had spent a lot of years as a strategy consultant before that, a lot of time looking at companies and being inside companies. One thing I was struck by is the role that guidance played in sometimes a well-intentioned thing ended up becoming the objective function of the business instead of really creating value for investors. So what we have tried to do is not run the company through guidance, but instead, what we have done from the founding days is one of the first things that we built is a business model of what I call horizontal accounting, where we were very struck that companies would make choices that, working backwards from vertical earnings instead of rigorously measuring horizontal returns, the value of—and we believe every choice that's made in the company, it has a cost upfront and return. We measure before, during, and after what is the value that got created. Our business model is absolutely focused on, while we invest a lot, very focused on making sure that it's creating value on the other end of that. That's been a hallmark of what we do.\nNow, along the way, so we have hopefully tried to build a brand and a credibility with investors that our business model is one that builds long-term value. Hopefully, our track record speaks for that. We have chosen to give guidance from time to time where there are specific things that we think it's really important that investors understand on something that matters a lot to them and something where we have a perspective that can be very, very useful there. What we try to do is to really help investors understand why we are making the choices we're making and how everything we're doing is focused on building a franchise for the long term and create long-term growth and earnings power for our investors.\nSo when I think about this important moment here as we bring Discover into Capital One and think about all the earnings power and the opportunities that we have, my comments at the beginning were intended to sort of give sort of a little bit of a bounding of how we're thinking about things by my comments about the earnings power, even in an environment where some of the metrics have already moved the individual line items and in an environment where we see a particularly significant number of investment opportunities to indicate to investors that the earnings power we see out the other side of this is pretty consistent with what we saw at the beginning, knowing that everyone will take a back-of-the-envelope and try to do their own estimations of that. But generally, we—so I guess that I would say our guidance is situational. It's not that we never give it. I'm sure we will in the future on certain things. But I wouldn't want to set an expectation for investors that at a certain point here, coming out of the gate with Discover, that we're going to lay out specific numbers because it's probably not what we're going to do.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Hecht\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies LLC\n\nAfternoon. Thanks for fitting me in. And thank you for all the information on the Discover, the update on the Discover journey. I guess my question is going back to some of the traditional questions we'd ask you, Rich, is what's your—I guess a two-part question is all I have—is what's your opinion on the state of affairs of the US consumer? Has that changed in the last quarter? Have you noticed anything different between your customer set and the Discover customer set in terms of payment behaviors or spend behaviors?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nYes. Thank you so much. So the US consumer is in a great place here that we continue to—we see the US consumer as a source of strength in the economy. The unemployment rate remains low and stable. Job creation remains healthy. Real wages are, of course, growing steadily. Consumer debt servicing burdens remain stable and near pre-pandemic levels. In our card portfolio, we're seeing improving delinquency rates and lower delinquency entries. And payment rates are improving on a year-over-year basis. Now, of course, the circumstances of individual consumers and households will vary as they always do. And as we've mentioned in past earnings calls, some pockets of consumers are feeling pressure from the cumulative effects of inflation and higher interest rates.\nWe're still seeing some delayed charge-off effects from the pandemic, although the improving trend in our delinquency suggests these effects are moderating. But on the whole, I'd say the US consumer is in really quite good shape. And of course, like all of you, we're keeping a close eye on the potential impact of tariffs and other public policy changes. And sort of with the tariffs, there's been a lot of uncertainty. But for now, even in that area, of course, we've all seen markets rebound. Most economic metrics have remained strong. And we haven't seen any adverse signals in our credit performance, in spend, or in payments, even in the most leading-edge data. We're also watching closely as student loan repayments and collections resume after a pause of almost five years.\nSpecifically, we're watching the performance of card and auto customers with student loans and especially those customers whose student loans are now being reported as delinquent. So far, we haven't seen any spillover effects in these segments, but we'll continue to monitor this closely. So pulling way up, there's a lot of positive momentum in our performance, in our improving overall credit metrics, and in the performance of our front book of new originations. So we'll keep a very watchful eye on the economy here. But I think in a world of a lot of turbulence, and if you read the news every day, you can think the world's falling apart. But actually, if we don't read the news and just look at what our customers are telling us with their behaviors, it is a picture of strength.\nThe Discover card performance, as we brought them on, we've been able to start unpacking performance across a number of dimensions. We're seeing credit improving in recent months. The loan and purchase volume growth has been muted due to their originations pullbacks in recent years. The customer engagement and loyalty metrics continue to be very strong. Discover has a little bit more of a revolver-oriented portfolio. All of us have revolvers. They have been a little bit more of a revolver-led business. We've been a little bit more of a spend-driven business model that, of course, has a bunch of revolving. And so we look forward very much to rolling up our sleeves and looking at some of the differences. And I'm sure many of the great similarities between the two. But pulling way up, the consumer is in a good place. Both companies, card performance, credit performance is really very positive.\n\nJohn Hecht\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies LLC\n\nThank you very much.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThat concludes our session for this evening.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Fairbank. Rich?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good evening to everyone on tonight's call. I want to begin tonight by welcoming our colleagues at Discover to the Capital One journey. As you know, we completed our acquisition of Discover on 18 May 2024, and we're fully mobilized and hard at work on integration, which is going well. It's still early days, but we very much like what we've seen so far. We share key cultural attributes with Discover, including a deep shared commitment to customers. And we're as excited as ever by the expanding set of opportunities to grow and create value as a combined company. From our founding days, we've been on a quest to build a great financial institution, an integrated banking and global payments platform that's positioned at the forefront of the opportunities that will come as technology and data transform financial services. Discover enhances and accelerates our progress on this quest. I'll share additional thoughts on the hard work, investments, and compelling opportunities we see going forward at the conclusion of tonight's call. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Andrew to discuss the balance sheet and purchase accounting impacts of the deal, as well as our financial performance in the Q2. Andrew.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. As Rich just discussed, we closed the acquisition of Discover on 18 May. We have now completed provisional purchase accounting and incorporated Discover's business lines into our reported segments, with Discover's domestic card and personal loans now included in our credit card segment and Discover's deposits and network businesses in our consumer segment. As part of the acquisition, we acquired $98.3 billion of domestic card loans with a net fair value discount of $220 million. We also acquired $9.9 billion of personal loans with a net fair value discount of $114 million.\nWe acquired $106.7 billion of deposits with a net fair value discount of $30 million. The amortization of these net fair value marks decreased net interest income by $85 million in the quarter. The full loan and deposit amortization schedule is included on Slide 17 of the appendix. We also acquired $7.9 billion of home loans, which have been marked as held for sale and are now included in discontinued operations. The net credit mark on the Discover loan portfolio increased the allowance on the balance sheet by $8.4 billion, with $8.8 billion of provision expense for non-PCD loans flowing through the P&L. I will discuss the allowance in greater detail in a moment. There were multiple amortizing intangibles created as a result of the acquisition.\n\nOperator\n\nWe recognized a core deposit intangible of $1 billion, a purchased credit card relationships intangible of $10.3 billion, and network and financial partner relationships intangibles of $1.5 billion. The amortization of these intangibles increased non-interest expense by $255 million in Q2. We have included a full intangible amortization schedule on Slide 18 in the appendix. We also recognized two intangibles with indefinite lives: a network intangible of $3.1 billion and brand and trade name intangibles of $2.3 billion. Finally, we recorded goodwill of $13.2 billion. Including the impact of purchase accounting and the allowance build, the partial quarter impact of the legacy Discover businesses contributed $2 billion of revenue and a $6.4 billion net loss to the results from continuing operations.\nI'll also note that as we bring the two companies together, there are financial reporting presentation realignments and business changes that impact the reporting geography of revenue, marketing, and operating expense recognition. In total, these moves increase the operating efficiency by roughly 30 basis points and the total efficiency by roughly 15 basis points in the Q2. Looking ahead, we expect the run rate impact of these changes to result in a roughly 90 basis point increase to the operating efficiency ratio and a roughly 50 basis point increase to the total efficiency ratio, all else equal. There is no impact from the reclassifications to the timing of recognition in either the Q2 or in future quarters, so the net impact to the bottom line is negligible. Turning to Slide 4, I'll cover the Q2 financial highlights for the combined company.\nOur results for the quarter were significantly impacted by the completion of the Discover acquisition. On a gap basis, we had a net loss of $4.3 billion, or a loss of $8.58 per diluted common share. Included in the results for the quarter were multiple adjusting items related to Discover, as well as a small addition to our legal reserves. Net of these adjusting items, net income in the quarter was $2.8 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $5.48. There was also one notable item in the quarter. A law change in the state of California increased our effective tax rate, but also created a one-time $128 million tax benefit as a result of truing up our deferred tax asset. Revenue in the Q2 increased $2.5 billion, or 25%, compared to the first quarter. Adjusted revenue increased 26%, or $2.6 billion.\nNon-interest expense increased 18%, or 14%, net of adjustments. Pre-provision earnings in the Q2 were up 34% relative to the first quarter. Net of adjustments, pre-provision earnings increased by 40%. The increase in pre-provision earnings was largely driven by the partial quarter impact of Discover, while also benefiting from strong legacy Capital One results. On a GAAP basis, our provision for credit losses was $11.4 billion in the quarter. Excluding the $8.8 billion initial allowance build for Discover, provision for credit losses was $2.7 billion, an increase of $294 million compared to the prior quarter. The increase was more than driven by $324 million in higher net charge-offs. A decline in charge-offs at legacy Capital One was more than entirely offset by the addition of the partial quarter of the Discover portfolio. Turning to Slide 5, I'll now cover the allowance in greater detail.\nWe built $7.9 billion of allowance in the quarter, bringing the allowance balance to $23.9 billion. The primary drivers of the change in allowance related to the Discover acquisition, which included an $8.8 billion expense for non-PCD loans and a $2.9 billion initial allowance for PCD loans, offset by a $3.3 billion benefit from the expected recoveries of acquired Discover loans that are fully charged off. Excluding these Discover impacts, the allowance balance declined by approximately $400 million. Our total portfolio coverage ratio increased 52 basis points to 5.43%, driven largely by the mix shift of our portfolio. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 6. In our credit card segment, we built approximately $8 billion of allowance in the quarter.\nRoughly $760 million of the build is driven by the acquisition of Discover's personal loan portfolio, with the remaining $7.2 billion build in the domestic card business. The domestic card build was driven by two factors. First, we released approximately $400 million of allowance in the legacy Capital One portfolio. This legacy card release was driven by continued favorable credit performance in the quarter, partially offset by a modestly worse economic outlook. Second, we built $7.6 billion of allowance for the Discover domestic card loans added in the quarter. The combination of incorporating an updated economic outlook, aligning allowance methodologies, and reserving for growth in the portfolio led to a roughly $400 million increase in the allowance for Discover's card loans relative to the equivalent balance as a standalone company at the end of Q1. The consolidated domestic card coverage ratio now stands at 7.62%.\nThe allowance balance in our consumer banking segment was largely flat at $1.9 billion. Observed credit favorability and the impact of stable auction prices was largely offset by growth in the auto business. The ending coverage ratio of 2.29% was down 8 basis points from the prior quarter. Finally, the commercial banking allowance balance of $1.5 billion and coverage ratio of 1.74% are largely flat to the prior quarter. Turning to page seven, I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves ended the Q2 at $144 billion, up roughly $13 billion relative to last quarter. Our cash position sits at $59.1 billion, up $10.5 billion from the prior quarter. The increase in cash was primarily driven by proceeds from the sale of a portion of Discover's securities, as well as the addition of acquired cash from Discover.\nOur preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio increased slightly during the Q2 to 157%, and our average NSFR remained roughly flat at 136%. Turning to page eight, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our Q2 net interest margin was 7.62%, 69 basis points higher than the prior quarter. The partial quarter impact of adding Discover increased NIM by roughly 40 basis points. This 40 basis point increase includes the roughly offsetting effects of a 6 basis point drag from the fair value marks and a 6 basis point tailwind from changing Discover's historical practice to now include late fees in interest income. The remaining nearly 30 basis point improvement in NIM was driven by legacy Capital One, which had lower rate paid on deposits, a liability mix shift towards deposits, and one additional day in the quarter.\nLooking ahead, we expect the full quarter benefit from the Discover acquisition to drive an additional 40 basis points increase to NIM, all else equal. Turning to Slide 9, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 14%, approximately 40 basis points higher than the prior quarter. The impact of the equity issuance for the acquisition was partially offset by the additional goodwill and intangible assets, the increase in risk-weighted assets, the net loss in the quarter, dividends, and $150 million of share repurchases. During the quarter, the Federal Reserve released the results of their stress test. Our preliminary Stress Capital Buffer requirement is 4.5%, resulting in a CET1 need of 9%. The new SCB becomes effective on 1 October. Now that we've closed the Discover transaction, we are working through our internal modeling of the combined company's capital need and look forward to sharing an update once our work is complete. With that, I will turn the call back over to Rich.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation",
    "content3": "Thanks, Andrew. Slide 11 shows Q2 results in our credit card business. Credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 12. The Discover acquisition was the dominant driver of Q2 domestic card results, including the impact of a partial quarter of combined operations, a combined quarter-end balance sheet, and purchase accounting effects. Looking through the Discover impacts, the combined domestic card business delivered another quarter of top-line growth, strong margins, and improving credit. Year-over-year purchase volume growth for the quarter was 22%, which includes $26.5 billion of Discover purchase volume.\nExcluding Discover, year-over-year purchase volume growth was about 6%. Ending loan balances increased 72%, largely as a result of adding $99.7 billion of Discover card loans. Excluding Discover, ending loans grew about 4% year-over-year. Revenue was up 33% from the Q2 of 2024, driven largely by adding the partial quarter of Discover revenue. Excluding Discover, year-over-year revenue growth was about 8%, driven by underlying growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin for the quarter was 17.3%, including a 121 basis point impact from the partial quarter of combined operations and amortization of the purchase accounting fair value mark. Excluding these Discover impacts, revenue margin would have been 18.5%. The domestic card net charge-off rate was 5.25%, down 80 basis points from the prior year quarter. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.60%, down 54 basis points from the prior year.\nThese metrics were impacted by the addition of Discover, which has historically had lower losses and delinquencies than Capital One. The delinquency metric was also impacted by aligning methodologies between Discover and Capital One. Capital One's legacy domestic card portfolio would have had a net charge-off rate of 5.50%, down 55 basis points year-over-year, and a 30-plus delinquency rate of 3.92%, down 22 basis points from the prior year. Capital One's card delinquencies have been improving on a seasonally adjusted basis since October of last year, and our losses have been improving since January of 2025. Discover's card credit metrics peaked about a quarter later but are now improving steadily following a similar path to what we observe on the legacy Capital One portfolio. Domestic card non-interest expense was up 42% compared to Q2 2024. Operating expense and marketing both increased year-over-year.\nTotal company marketing expense in the quarter was $1.35 billion, up 26% year-over-year. Our choices in domestic card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see compelling growth opportunities in our domestic card business. Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business and build an enduring franchise with heavy spenders at the top of the market. Compared to Q2 2024, domestic card marketing in the quarter included the addition of Discover marketing, higher direct response marketing, higher media spend, and increased investment in premium benefits and differentiated customer experiences. As always, all of our marketing and origination choices are informed by our continuous monitoring of portfolio trends, market conditions, and consumer and competitor behaviors. Slide 13 shows Q2 results in our consumer banking business.\nGlobal payment network transaction volume from the 18 May close of the Discover acquisition through quarter-end was about $74 billion. Auto originations were up 28% from the prior year quarter, driven by overall market growth and our strong position to pursue resilient growth in the current marketplace. Consumer banking ending loan balances increased $5.6 billion, or about 7% year-over-year. Average loans were up 6%. Compared to the year-ago quarter, ending consumer deposits grew at 36%, and average consumer deposits were up about 21%, driven largely by the addition of Discover deposits. Looking through the Discover impact, our digital-first national consumer banking business continues to grow and gain traction, powered by our technology transformation and our compelling no-fees, no-minimums, and no-overdraft fees customer value proposition. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter was up about 16% year-over-year, driven predominantly by the partial quarter of Discover as well as growth in auto loans.\nNon-interest expense was up about 37% compared to the Q2 of 2024, driven largely by the partial quarter of Discover as well as increased auto originations, the legal reserve addition that Andrew mentioned, higher marketing to drive growth in our national consumer banking business, and continued technology investments. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.25%, down 56 basis points year-over-year. Largely as the result of our choice to tighten credit and pull back in 2022, auto charge-offs are improving on a seasonally adjusted basis. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.84%, down 83 basis points year-over-year. Slide 14 shows Q2 results for our commercial banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, both ending and average loan balances were up 1%. Ending deposits were down about 2% from the linked quarter. Average deposits were down 4%. We continue to manage down selected, less attractive commercial deposit balances.\nSecond quarter revenue was up 6% from the linked quarter, and non-interest expense was up by about 1%. The commercial banking annualized net charge-off rate for the Q2 increased 22 basis points from the sequential quarter to 0.33%. The commercial criticized performing loan rate was 5.89%, down 52 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate was down 10 basis points to 1.30%. As we close this presentation and before we open it up for Q&A, I want to pull up and reflect not just on the quarter, but also on where we are. In the Q2, bringing on Discover for a partial quarter and the related purchase accounting impacts dominated our reported results. But looking through these effects, our adjusted earnings, top-line growth, credit results, and capital generation continued to be strong.\nWe completed the Discover acquisition on 18 May 2024, and we continue to be very excited about the opportunity. Here are some early financial observations. They are, of course, still subject to change, but we wanted to share our thoughts with you. Let me start with integration costs. Our integration budget covers a wide array of expenses, including deal costs, moving Discover onto our tech stack, integrating their products and experiences, making additional investments in risk management and compliance, and integrating the talent and taking care of the associates along the way. The integration is off to a great start, but as we have gotten more granularity on each of these efforts, we expect our integration costs will be somewhat higher than our previously announced $2.8 billion. Let me turn now to synergies.\nWe are on track to deliver the $2.5 billion in total net synergies we discussed on the April earnings call. There are significant cost savings and also significant real revenue synergies, and we have line of sight to achieving them. I also want to savor this moment and where we are. We are on the cusp of even greater opportunities down the road. These opportunities come both from this deal and also from Capital One's transformation to be at the frontier of a rapidly changing marketplace. These opportunities are exciting, but they will require significant investment to bring them home. Let me start with the opportunities with Discover. The revenue synergies we have already identified come from moving our debit business and a portion of our credit business onto the Discover Network.\nTo move more volume and capitalize on the tremendous scale benefits of the network, we need to achieve greater international acceptance and then build a global network brand. This will enable moving bigger spenders onto the Discover Network. These additional moves require sustained investment for a number of years, and we will begin to undertake these investments first in acceptance, and then when we get the network to critical mass, we will invest in the network brand. There are only two banks in the world with their own network, and we are one of them. We are moving to capitalize on this rare and valuable opportunity. With all the discussion of Discover, we can lose sight of the very important place legacy Capital One is in. We are in the 13th year of an all-in technology transformation.\nWhile most companies have invested in transforming technology at the top of the tech stack, in other words, leading with customer-facing applications, we have taken the much harder but ultimately necessary journey. We have been rebuilding the company from the bottom of the tech stack up, essentially building a modern technology company that does banking. As we move up the tech stack, the opportunities are accelerating. We are also the beneficiary of decades of investment in our data and analytics capabilities and the building of a well-known national brand. Together with our leading technology capabilities, they are the enablers of our many opportunities. Take our retail bank. The universal playbook in banking is to build a national bank through acquisitions. However, we are doing it organically on the shoulders of our modern tech stack, our full-service digital banking offerings, our thin physical distribution of showroom branches, and our national brand.\nWe are enjoying a lot of traction, and the acquisition of a network propels us forward even more. Building the national bank requires sustained investment in marketing, and we are doing that, and we expect to lean in even more. Let me turn to our card business. After building a mass-market credit card business, we declared in 2010 we were launching a quest to win at the top of the market with heavy spenders. Few card players have chosen sustainably to take on this quest. We have been steadfast. We have had a lot of success in this journey, but it is a long one. Our two biggest competitors are investing heavily, and we know we will need to keep leaning into this big opportunity. As we have moved up the tech stack, we have seized the opportunity to pursue emerging growth opportunities across our company.\nSome of the salient ones you have seen and hopefully experienced, like Capital One Shopping and Capital One Travel. Another example is Auto Navigator, which is a three-party platform designed to reduce friction for consumers and dealers in buying and financing a car. Most importantly, we continue to invest in our modern technology stack. The gap between the modern technology companies fully in the cloud, built on modern applications and data, and the rest of corporate America continues to grow. The modern tech companies are well-positioned to win as the world continues to evolve, and we have spent years to become one of them. The rage of the world is AI. Some aspects of the AI revolution will be broadly accessible to all companies, and other aspects will be very exclusive.\nMost companies will benefit from the transformation in how work is done that will be available through third-party AI tools. But only the companies built on a modern tech stack and deeply invested in data will be in a position to reinvent their business model to put AI at the heart of operations, risk management, and the customer experience. The opportunities are transformational, and we are well-positioned in that quest. But these opportunities require sustained investment in AI and in AI talent, and we are doing that. In a company built for innovation and organic growth, I am struck by the number of compelling opportunities for innovation and value creation that we see. These opportunities are made possible by the choices we have made over the last many years.\nAs I have been saying, these opportunities require investment, and for many of them, timing is critical as we strive to seize competitive advantage. Collectively, these investments across Discover and legacy Capital One are significant, but they also will be the basis for our sustained growth and strong returns over the longer term. The opportunities we are describing here have been years in the making, and you have heard me talking about them for quite some time. Importantly, the earnings power of our combined company that we envision on the other side of the deal integration is consistent with what we assumed at the time of our deal announcement, even though some individual variables have moved along the way. When I reflect on our journey from founding the company to where we are today, we got here by always working backwards from where winning is and driving the continual transformations and investments to get there. The choices we made over the years also created the opportunity for us to acquire Discover. And in the spirit of that quest, 38 years after the founding idea for Capital One, we find ourselves as well-positioned as we've ever been to drive future success and value creation. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. Remember, as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the investor relations team will be available. Josh, please start the Q&A session.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. One moment for questions. Our first question comes from Terry Ma with Barclays. You may proceed.\n\nTerry Ma\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays Plc\n\nHey, thank you. Good evening. Now that you've closed the acquisition, and I do appreciate the updated financial observations, but do you have any kind of updated thoughts on economics of the deal that you can share, whether it's earnings power over time or some sort of return targets that investors should be kind of thinking about?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nTerry, thank you. We were really glad to be in a position of finally being able to close the deal, and we're a number of weeks into being on the other side of that. I shared some comments in the prepared remarks about how we're thinking about continuing to be very much believing in the earnings power of our combined entity. Also, of course, we're leaning into the opportunities that are classic Capital One in terms of really laying the foundation for longer-term earnings power on top of that. So we don't have any really, other than my earlier comments, I don't have any further specific updates on that, but we certainly are very bullish about the deal, the economics, earnings power, and opportunities on the other side.\n\nTerry Ma\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays Plc\n\nGot it. And then as a follow-up, just on capital levels, which you mentioned you guys are doing your internal work, any sense of the kind of timing of when you would kind of get that informed view and communicate that to investors? And then as I kind of take a step back, you guys are at 14% CET1. That's meaningfully above what legacy Capital One's target was of 11% and Discover's of 10% to 11%. Is there any reason why on a consolidated basis it would be kind of meaningfully different? Thank you.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nYeah, Terry, having closed the deal just a couple of months ago, we are just getting full access to all of Discover's customer-level data, and we need to run all of that information through our models. And so while we received the SCB from the Fed and it declined to 9%, as you well know, that number's fluctuated from 10.3% to 7% over the last handful of years. So we think about capital largely through the lens of our internal assessment of our longer-term capital need versus the Fed's, which is why we need to do that modeling. And so we are still in the middle of that work right now. I will say that we're not finding anything surprising at all in our analysis, and we feel comfortable that at 14%, we're operating with excess capital above the long-term need of the combined company, and we have the flexibility with our repurchase actions as we're operating under the SCB, but we need to complete that work. So as we get closer to finishing the work, I think it's reasonable to assume that we'll begin to step up our repurchases from recent levels, but we look forward to sharing an update more broadly on our work when it's complete.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\n\nRick Shane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThanks for taking my question. Look, I'm going to break my own personal rule here. Congratulations on this completion of the acquisition. It's transformational, and it's going to be very interesting to see what happens from here. Rich, you had alluded to the fact that the integration expenses are going to be above the initial $2.8 billion target. Could you help us understand that more specifically? And also, could you put into context where you're seeing the opportunity for incremental investment so that that way we can sort of translate what the opportunity would be?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nSo, Rick, thank you. Thanks for your congratulations. It's been a long time coming. We're all very excited about it, and we know our investors are pretty excited as well. With respect to the integration costs, I think when one embarks on a thing at the very beginning as we're undertaking a deal, we do our very best to take all the different things that would be involved in integration, and go around the house and ask everybody what they think and add it up. Basically, this is just a matter of, as we get deeper into it, it is coming in. So it's coming in. Well, first of all, we don't have an absolute definitive final estimate of it, but it's coming in somewhat higher. But it's not in any one thing. It's really just across a variety of the many elements of this deal. So as we got a sense it was going to be somewhat higher, we just wanted to flag that. The investments, let me talk about the investments here.\nEverything that I talked about in my remarks a few minutes ago about investments, our investments and opportunities, we've been talking about for some period of time. So we're not unveiling something brand new that we've never talked about before. But the point I really wanted to make and why I took the time to share that conversation is that all of these opportunities we have been pursuing for a long period of time, and they stand on the shoulders of investments we have been making for a very long period of time, most notably the investment in transforming the tech stack of Capital One, but also very much investments in brand and deep, deep investments over many, many years on data and analytics, and things like machine learning and AI itself.\nSo the point that I was sharing with you is as we move up the tech stack and get deeper and get closer in the pursuit of these opportunities, we find these opportunities, we're very excited about these opportunities, and some of the opportunities are sort of accelerating as we look at them. But the only way to get there from here is to lean into the investments. We've been investing for quite some time, but our point was we're going to really be leaning in from here to pursue this set of opportunities that if I calibrate relative to the whole history of founding and building Capital One, the portfolio of opportunities we have is the broadest and biggest set of opportunities that I've seen in our history. But the only way to get there is with investment. And you know the Capital One philosophy. We get very rigorous about what the opportunity is and what it costs to get there, but we lean into those investments. I think that the value creation for our investors on the other side of this, consistent with the philosophy we've taken in the whole history of building Capital One, I think there's a lot of value creation opportunity. But we're going to invest significantly to get there.\n\nRick Shane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThank you.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. You may proceed.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods\n\nThanks. Rich, obviously, Discover was working through a number of credit issues and not really leaning into growth like Capital One had been. I guess since credit's now somewhat under control there, do you expect to sort of lean into growth at Discover as well inside of Prime as we look forward?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nYeah, yes. Sanjay, we do plan to lean into growth opportunities with Discover. Let me comment just a little bit about their card business and sort of, you've seen this from the outside, but just sort of standing back and talking about it. It's an amazing franchise they've built over the years. The credit losses got higher than they expected, probably higher than anyone expected, due to a number of choices that were made in the preceding years. They very proactively stepped in and dialed back and went a little bit more back to the basics of how they had built their franchise. That has muted their originations and their growth over this period of time, but they were very important choices, and it's also been powering their good credit performance.\nJust as an example, their most recent vintages are coming in a lot better than prior years, and it's a manifestation of pulling back. Now, when pulling back happens, the growth is somewhat muted, and that's the situation that they're in. Now, we're coming in and getting to know them and their impressive card business, and we like the products, so we plan to continue their flagship credit card product. They have an amazing student lending business that we're very excited to continue to, not student lending, sorry, student credit card business. We're excited to continue to lean into that. They've been very successful in a secured card starter card business that they have had. So from a product point of view, we're going to continue to lean into the business. We've spent a lot of time looking at their customer experience.\nThey score very high on metrics that we ourselves collect, not just their own collected metrics, but we ourselves in calibrated metrics in the industry. Great customer experiences and very high levels of customer engagement. So we are adopting a lot of the sort of customer technology choices that they have made. They have a great servicing experience that we're going to very much try to just continue pretty much exactly what they're doing there. And from a brand point of view, of course, Discover won't be a corporate brand anymore, but on the credit card side, envision it, Sanjay, as a very salient product brand. So we will lean into the opportunities there. It's going to be in the context of a little bit of muted growth at the moment.\nAnd I think as we fully get into there, there'll probably be a few areas we'll dial back around the edges. And I'm pretty confident there will be some areas where we will lean even harder into growth than they were. But it is certainly one of our goals to lean in to grow the franchise and try to preserve the very special things that enabled them to build one of the great credit card companies in America.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods\n\nThank you. Just a follow-up for Andrew. Sorry to ask this question because I'm sure I can parse through all of this excellent disclosure that you provided and your comments to get to some of my conclusions. But just as we look ahead, what are some of the variables that we need to think about as a result of these purchase accounting changes? I heard you mention the NIM having a 40 basis points tailwind because of the reclass of late fees and such. But maybe, Andrew, could you just help us think through some of the progression of the major line items as a result of this? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nWell, appreciate the acknowledgment. Sanjay worked really hard to disclose a lot, and I think you'll find not only in the presentation itself and in some of the footnotes, but also the monthly 8K data that went out today, there's some additional disclosures around delinquency and charge-offs as well. So we really did our best to provide visibility into all of those pieces. Reluctant to try to give you the full reconciliation of all of the metrics, I'd really point you to the couple of Slides in the appendix because that very clearly spells out what are the implications to NIM, what are the implications to operating expenses. In the footnote there, you will see that we not only gave annual views, but we gave a quarterly view of this year. But for instance, you can see that NIM, given the very short life, for instance, of the non-PCD card loans, which are marked above par, that actually creates a net drag in the immediate term, but that burns off very quickly. And so the non-PCD, I'm sorry, the PCD that carries forward is actually going to be a good guy to NIM over the course of multiple years. So it's really hard to give you a succinct summary of all of those pieces, which is why we did our best to lay everything out as best we can. Of course, these are subject to some revisions over time, which is why I phrased it in the way that we did, but we're hopeful that these ultimately end up being the final marks.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.\n\nGood evening, everyone.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nHey, Ryan.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nHey, Ryan.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.\n\nSo Rich, you talked about significant sustained investment. I think the phrase was used several times to talk about acceptance, marketing, the tech stack, and AI. And I think you know this will obviously create questions about how much all of this is going to cost. So is there anything that you can share that can give the market comfort that there isn't significant synergy reinvestment risk and that eventually this will result in a more efficient consolidated company over time?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Ryan. So when you think about the opportunities that we're talking about investing in, there are things I think investors have come to know over the years, and we have talked a lot about them. But it starts with the tech transformation itself. As I say, we're in the 13th year of our technology transformation. The world continues to evolve, and we continue to build the most fully modern aspect up and down the tech stack. There's still work to do with respect to that, but we've had amazing progress, and we're not just trying to modernize the company, but rebuild it in a way that is really way more efficient, way more able to scale up innovation, way more able to more effectively manage risk, credit risk, fraud risk, operating risk, and to create enhanced customer experience. And collectively, we have found virtually all the things that we would like, the capabilities we'd like for our company to have; they all have the same shared path, which is through the modernization of technology. So we will continue to invest there. And so I don't think there's anything from an investor point of view that would surprise them with respect to that.\nIt's just that as we move up the tech stack, it's a lonely journey when you're in the bottom of the tech stack modernizing one piece of core infrastructure because until a lot of other things are modernized, it's hard to see the tangible benefits. But moving up the tech stack moves one closer in the ability to more monetize the opportunities. Then, of course, beyond that, we have now the whole Discover opportunity, and there's lots we're investing in terms of integration and things like that. But specifically, I call out that after this first wave of moving all of our debit card business and a portion of our credit card business onto the network to really capitalize on the tremendous scale, the scale economics in the network business, we really want to work to move more volume there.\n\nOperator\n\nAll roads in that quest lead through investing in international acceptance and then a global network brand. So I think and we've talked a lot to investors about that. We're very compelled by the opportunities on the other side, but it's very clear to us that's a multi-year journey, and it's going to require quite a bit of investment. Additionally, let's talk about our national bank. We're the only major bank that I know of that is trying to build a national full-service bank organically. Everybody else is doing it through acquisitions. That requires a lot of investment. We've had a lot of success in building this, now bringing on the Discover Network and seeing the traction that we're getting collectively in our business. These are very attractive. We see great opportunity to continue to lean in, in fact, even lean in harder on building our national bank.\nAnd then, of course, there's the quest at the top of the market. We all see what, even including over the last week or so, what players, the small number of players who are really focused on winning at the very top of the market, they're investing hard. But there's a reason they're investing hard because there is a great opportunity at the top of the market, and it's not an opportunity that is available widely to all the credit card companies. It requires a lot of sustained investment, brand building, technology, experiences, and products, etc. So we're very pleased with the traction there. And Ryan, each year in our quest, we find that while we're getting good growth in our card business, the fastest growing part of our card business has been with the heavier spenders.\nAnd it's a continued indication of the success as we keep moving higher in the marketplace, build the strength of our brand a little bit more each year. And that's something we're excited about. And the traction we're getting is validation to us of the payoff of continuing to invest there. As we have moved up the top of the tech stack, we also are building customer experiences to capitalize on being a company. If you pull up, Ryan, and think about this, we're not trying to just build a bank like the next bank down the street. We're trying to build a bank that is right at the heart of consumers' and businesses' financial lives with primary banking relationships and primary spending relationships.\nWe now have well over 100 million customers and the ability to, over time, leverage that franchise of very highly engaged customers with not just banking and credit card products, but in fact, build a much broader franchise with those highly engaged customers. That's why we're leaning into opportunities like Capital One Shopping, Capital One Travel, and Auto Navigator, each of which is much more deeply expanding our franchise. And each of them is getting a significant growth and traction and also able to leverage the size of our franchise, which, by the way, just got quite a bit bigger with this acquisition. So, my point to investors is, and in a calibration across all the years I've been building Capital One, we've always taken the philosophy of working backwards from where winning is and investing with our pencils sharpened and very rigorously from a value creation framework, investing on what it takes to win as the marketplace evolves. Where we are at this time in the evolution of the company has probably the best opportunities that I've seen, and we are leaning into this. And also, as I mentioned, the earnings power, even as we look at the investments we're talking about here, the earnings power remains consistent in our estimation, remains consistent with what we expected at the announcement.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.\n\nAppreciate the call. I'm going to step back and let somebody else ask a question.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Erica Najarian with UBS. You may proceed. Hi.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS Securities LLC\n\nGood afternoon. I'm going to just move off the expense question for a second and re-ask the question on capital. I fully appreciate that you're going through a review, and I fully appreciate the statement that you've found nothing yet that's surprising. As we think about the 14% versus the legacy targets of Capital One and Discover, I guess another way to ask the question is, how much time will you give yourself to optimize the capital to where you think the right level is for the company?\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nYeah. Well, there's two parts, I think, to that question, Erica. One is kind of what level are we heading towards, which is also impact at any point in time of what's just happening more broadly around us, which then spills into the second piece of it of how much do we want to be repurchasing at any one moment in time. So I don't have a precise answer for you. Of course, there is some upper bound in terms of SEC limitations to repurchases. But really, what I would point you to is we're going to work through the customer-level data, determine our longer-term capital need. And as we move towards finishing that work, I think the operative phrase that I said earlier is we'll likely begin to step up our repurchases from recent levels. But once that work is complete, which we're doing as quickly as we can, we'll provide an update at that time.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS Securities LLC\n\nAnd just a quick follow-up for me. Ryan mentioned it was so important to investors. And I just picked up on something that Rich said at the end of his answers to Ryan, which is that EPS power remains consistent with how you thought about it in the beginning of this journey with Discover. I guess if I break it down, your integration expenses are coming in a little heavier than the $3.8 billion. You did mention, you did reiterate the synergy targets, which I would surmise include the expense synergy targets. I guess the last piece that everyone's trying to get at is the run rate of expense growth, for lack of a better word, legacy Capital One accelerate. I guess based on the explanation of what you're investing in, it seems like that would have been the case. But then Rich threw in EPS power should remain consistent with what you originally saw. So again, I know we're belaboring a point, but I think it's critical for investors as they think about the pro forma EPS power of this company. Yeah.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nErica, I think you were breaking up a little bit, but we got the essence of what you were saying there. So Capital One and Discover have both historically had strong earnings power. And in combining them, we can create a very strong institution and, of course, also add synergies. There have been many moving pieces since we announced the deal in both companies' actual operating results and investment choices, and of course, in the broader economic, competitive, and credit backdrop. Since the deal announcement, individual line items have, of course, drifted, but the net drift has so far been in a favorable direction. At the same time, the opportunities and the investment associated with them have also grown. So we estimate that the net earnings power of our combined company as it emerges from integration is similar to our estimates in the deal model.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks. Rich, a couple of times you kind of alluded to competition in the high end of the card business. I was hoping you could kind of give us your sense as to how that's likely to evolve this year given what you've got going on at two of the major competitors, perhaps three if you include all of the ones that have made announcements thus far, and whether there are any elements of the transaction that will be kind of helpful to Capital One in addressing that. And I do have a follow-up. Thanks.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nYes, Moshe. So when we look at the competitive environment, I've said for years competition is very intense in the card business. Certainly, most striking of late has been competition at the very top of the market. Before we get into specifically sort of things that happened over the last couple of weeks, two areas that the stakes have gone up and the investment required has sort of gone up to be at the highest level is in lounges. You see a little bit of the sort of like an arms race, that's probably not the right word, but certainly the effort of the biggest players at the top of the market to build their own lounges in addition to offering a partnership, a network of lounges through partners. Capital One has been doing that, and we're very, very pleased with the four lounges, I guess five lounges that we have now, I guess five plus what we call The Landing, the one we have at Reagan National Airport. But so that's one of the areas that there's a lot of competition.\n\nOperator\n\nBut the research shows people really care about lounges. And so we understand that's part of the game. And we are very pleased with the customer reaction there, the traction, the volumes, and the pickup in our own originations that we think is coming from that. Another area of competition at the top of the market is competition in marketing spend and competition in creating unique access for customers. We also, in this space, have been very pleased with some of the unique access we've been able to offer. Obviously, our Taylor Swift partnership has been a special opportunity for us. But this is the flip side of some of the investments required, is that a small number of players, I think, are separating from the pack relative to their offerings and the extent of their commitment to this space.\nSo I think competitively there are real opportunities on the other side of the sort of higher stakes of investment. We then get to the products. And it is striking that at the top of the market, both Chase and American Express have made announcements about things that, well, with American Express, it's still we haven't seen what they're going to come out with. But certainly, on the Chase side, we have seen a higher fee on the one hand, but also ramping up some of the rewards, and also extending the list significantly of sort of the opportunities more on a coupon-type basis that can come. So it's very clear. And Amex seems to be they've already been on a similar path there for a number of years. And I think that we would expect they'll come out with some enhanced offerings there.\nWe have crafted our strategy at the top of the market to not just be going out and try to exactly copy what the others do, but to try to create something that in its own way for the right customers is an absolutely best-in-class experience. So take our VentureX product. First of all, in terms of the earn rates on VentureX, it's earning at the 2X rate, which is the higher earn rate than some of the competitive products. Other products have co-brand relationships with airlines, and they're both a lot of expenses there, but also unique offerings. We instead have the any airline and sort of the unique aspects of the 2X on everything with VentureX. But what I would share with you is we are very pleased with the traction on VentureX. You've seen us on television continuing to tell our story.\nI think that as other competitors come out with their plays that are different from ours, there continues to be, I think, quite a lot of open space at our price point and our collective set of offerings and experiences that really, I think, offers a lot of opportunity for us. So we're leaning in hard with VentureX, and then we're continuing to build enhanced capabilities across digital experiences, product offerings, lounges, and special preferred access that I think will continue to position Capital One in a very attractive way in the competitive environment. You ask about the network. Basically, adding Discover, what impact will that have? Certainly, adding the scale of Discover certainly helps us with respect to just more opportunity to even though Discover was not a top-of-the-market player. But then I think also, Moshe, down the road, longer term, I think we see opportunities on the network side of the business relative to the higher end of the market. But I think that's an opportunity that is more way down the road than one in the near term. Thank you.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThanks. Maybe just as kind of a follow-up, I think one of the things that we've thought about a little bit is using the benefit of unregulated debit interchange to help build the banking franchise and to go to a rewards checking model. And you talked about the banking franchise and some of those impacts. Could you talk about how you see that now that you've got access to this and can start migrating your debit accounts?\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nSo our national bank strategy has always been about offering industry-leading products backed by a business model that can economically support that. So when you think about that, we have a full-service digital bank. There are a lot of folks out there with digital banking capabilities. A key differentiator is Capital One has full-service digital banking. We do believe physical presence matters, and our research continues to confirm that. Even ironically, so many people say, \"Yeah, I never go into branches.\" But in their choices, physical presence does matter to a lot of people. And that's why we have built our thin distribution model of these sort of showroom branches. But again, importantly, working backwards from having the economics, that's different from a branch on every corner kind of a thing.\nSo the economics of this have supported a product offer that's industry-leading: no fees, no minimums, and no overdraft fees. No other major bank has a primary offering that matches that. Actually, our product offer is democratizing banking by making it available to anyone at no cost. Customers have responded very positively. Now, let me turn to Discover. Discover has a small portfolio of cashback debit cards. We plan to keep those customers in their current product. With the benefit of the network now and bringing Discover on, we are raising the investment levels in our flagship product to help propel our national bank growth with the very successful industry-leading value proposition that has gotten us here. So we are keeping what Discover had for its customers, and we will lean into our industry-leading banking product going forward.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\n\nDon Fandetti\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nRich, can you share a little bit more about your international acceptance build-out plans? And just trying to think if there's a way you can help size it or talk about how the expenses get funded because I guess the revenue benefit of moving the bulk of the credit cards over to the network happens after you get the acceptance. And if there are any sort of guideposts or targets that you have, that would be helpful.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nDon, we, of course, haven't been in the network business. So over the course of our, what was it, 15 or 16 or 17 months of pre-deal, we did everything we could to learn about the network business. We brought in a bunch of consultants to teach us everything they knew about that. And now, especially as we get on the other side of this, we are really going to school on the amazing learnings we're able to get with Discover. And I really want to say I've seen a lot of scale businesses in my days. And just about every banking business I've ever seen is really quite scale-driven. I've never seen any business as scale-driven as a network because the marginal cost of a transaction is virtually zero, and the fixed costs are high in a business like that. So it's not an accident that there are two, Visa and Mastercard are enormous companies, and that most banks around the world don't have enough scale to have their own network, even if they could solve the chicken-and-egg problem to get there. So we look at this, and we're certainly blessed to have a network.\nI am struck that given Discover's really small-scale, domestically pretty small-scale, but globally strikingly modest scale, I am struck at how extensive the international acceptance that they have already built is. Now, it's not up to the levels that we would really want it to be in order to move more internationally traveling customers there. But I certainly was surprised at how good it is relative to the scale and sort of thinking about the challenge they have to get there. But here's the inspiring thing. They've already built pretty good international acceptance, and they have a playbook to do it that is the same playbook one would use to get quite a bit more international acceptance.\nThere are four ways, basically, to build international acceptance and four ways that Discover has cobbled together this international network acceptance: partnering with other networks, partnering with merchant acquirers, partnering with card-issuing financial institutions, and finally, going directly to merchants. They used a combination of all four of those. We have sat with them and said, \"How feasible is it to get more, and how would you get more?\" The answer really is continue leveraging those four and just lean in harder and invest more than Discover has historically invested. We don't—we're in the calibration of the hills that Capital One has taken on over time and the journeys and the investments we've done in the history of our company. This is right down the fairway of the kind of challenge we take on working backwards from where winning is.\nWe don't have an estimate of exactly what it will take. There's also another thing of even what acceptance level is exactly what we need because this is something, as we get into it and see our customers' experiences, it's a bit of a, \"You know what? When you see it,\" kind of a thing. But what I'm comfortable with is the playbook is there, and the opportunity on the other side of this is very clear because that is the path to help us move more volume to the other side. That plus the building of, I mean, Discover already has a network brand. When I talk about building a global network brand, picture something that has a more global, it's more of a global brand, more of a market brand. And these are things working backwards from where we would try to go with our business down the road. To us, it's a very clear path. It is classic Capital One, and we have taken on many challenges."

Now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on slide three of tonight's presentation. In the Q4, Capital One earned $1.1 billion, or $2.67 per diluted common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $4.8 billion, or $11.59 per share. Included in the results for the Q4 were adjusting items related to Discover integration costs and a legal reserve build. Net of these adjusting items, Q4 earnings per share were $3.09. Full-year adjusted earnings per share were $13.96. We also had one notable item in the quarter, which was $100 million of accelerated philanthropy contributions.\nPre-provision earnings of $4.1 billion in the Q4 were down 13% from the Q3, driven by higher noninterest expense. The linked-quarter increase in noninterest expense was driven by increases in both operating expense and marketing spend.\nRevenue in the linked quarter increased 2%, driven by higher non-interest income. Provision for credit losses was $2.6 billion in the quarter, up about $160 million relative to the prior quarter. The quarterly increase in provision was driven by higher net charge-offs, partially offset by a larger allowance release. Turning to slide four, I will cover the allowance in greater detail. We released $245 million in allowance this quarter, and our allowance balance now stands at $16.3 billion. The decrease in this quarter's allowance was driven by releases in our commercial banking and commercial segments.\nOur total portfolio coverage ratio decreased 20 basis points to 4.96%. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on slide five. The allowance balance in our domestic card business was flat.\nThe coverage ratio declined 33 basis points, primarily driven by seasonal balances, as well as favorable near-term credit trends. In our consumer banking segment, we released $131 million in allowance, resulting in a 22 basis points decrease to the coverage ratio. Vehicle values were stable in the quarter, resulting in an improved recovery outlook, which drove the release. And finally, our commercial banking allowance decreased by $130 million, resulting in a 15 basis points decrease to the coverage ratio.\nThe release was primarily driven by the reduction in criticized loans, and, to a lesser extent, by charge-offs in the quarter. Turning to page six, I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter decreased by about $8 billion to approximately $124 billion. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $43 billion, down about $6 billion from the prior quarter.\nThe decline in cash was largely driven by seasonally higher card loans and funding maturities, which were partially offset by continued strong growth in our consumer banking business deposits. Our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the Q4 was 155%. Turning to page seven, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our Q4 net interest margin was 7.03%, eight basis points lower than last quarter and 30 basis points higher than the year-ago quarter. The linked quarter decrease in NIM was primarily driven by lower asset yields, which were only partially offset by lower deposit and wholesale funding costs. Turning to slide eight, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity tier one capital ratio ended the quarter at 13.5%, 10 basis points lower than the prior quarter.\nNet income in the quarter was more than offset by the impact of loan growth, dividends, and $150 million of share repurchases. As a reminder, the announcement of the acquisition of Discover constituted a material business change. Therefore, we continue to be subject to the Federal Reserve's pre-approval of our capital actions until the merger approval process has concluded. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows Q4 results in our credit card business. Credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on slide 11. In the Q4, our domestic card business delivered another quarter of steady top-line growth, strong margins, and stable credit. Year-over-year purchase volume growth for the quarter was 7%. Ending loan balances increased $8 billion, or about 5% year-over-year. Average loans increased about 6%, and Q4 revenue was up 9% from the Q4 of 2023, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans.\nRevenue margin for the quarter increased 55 basis points from the prior year quarter to 18.6%, largely driven by the impact of the end of the Walmart revenue sharing agreement. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 6.06%.\nThe impact of the end of the Walmart loss sharing agreement increased the Q4 charge-off rate by roughly 40 basis points. Excluding this impact, the charge-off rate for the quarter would have been 5.66%, up 31 basis points year-over-year. After 20 consecutive months of second derivative improvement, the 30+ delinquency rate crossed into actual year-over-year improvement. The 30+ delinquency rate at the end of December was 4.53%, down eight basis points from the prior year. As a reminder, the end of the Walmart loss sharing agreement did not have a meaningful impact on delinquency rate.\nOn a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 45 basis points. The 30+ delinquency rate was flat compared to the linked quarter. Domestic card non-interest expense was up 13% compared to the Q4 of 2023. Operating expense and marketing both increased year-over-year.\nTotal company marketing expense in the quarter was $1.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Our choices in domestic card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see compelling growth opportunities in our domestic card business. Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business. Compared to the Q4 of 2023, domestic card marketing in the quarter included higher media spend and increased investment in premium benefits and differentiated customer experiences, like our travel portal, airport lounges, and Capital One Shopping.\nSlide 12 shows Q4 results in our consumer banking business. Auto originations were up 53% from the prior year quarter. A portion of this growth can be attributed to overall market growth, while the remainder is the result of our strong position to pursue resilient growth in the current marketplace.\nAs a reminder, our choices to tighten credit and pull back in anticipation of credit score inflation and declining vehicle values were still in effect in the Q4 of 2023, resulting in relatively low originations. These choices also drove out, you know, really basically, they drove strong and stable credit performance that positioned us to lean into current marketplace opportunities and return to originations growth in 2024. With four consecutive quarters of originations growth in 2024, consumer banking loan balances returned to growth in the Q4.\nEnding loans increased $2.7 billion, or about 4% year-over-year, and average loans were up 1%. On a linked quarter basis, ending loans were up 2% and average loans were up 1%. Compared to the year-ago quarter, ending consumer deposits grew about 7% and average consumer deposits were up about 8%. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter was up about 1% year-over-year.\nGrowth in loans and deposits was partially offset by a higher year-over-year average deposit interest rate. Non-interest expense was up about 10% compared to the Q4 of 2023, driven largely by the unique Q4 items Andrew discussed, as well as increased auto originations and continued technology investments. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.32%, up 13 basis points year-over-year.\nThe 30+ delinquency rate was 5.95%, down 39 basis points year-over-year. Largely as the result of our choice to tighten credit and pull back in 2022, auto charge-offs have been strong and stable on a seasonally adjusted basis. Slide 13 shows Q4 results for our commercial banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances were essentially flat. Average loans were down about 1%. Both ending and average deposits were up about 4% from the linked quarter.\nQ4 revenue was up 7% from the linked quarter and non-interest expense was up by about 5%. The commercial banking annualized net charge-off rate for the Q4 increased 4 basis points from the sequential quarter to 0.26%. The commercial criticized performing loan rate was 6.35%, down 131 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate decreased 16 basis points to 1.39%. In closing, we continued to post strong and steady results in the Q4. We delivered another quarter of top-line growth in domestic card loans, purchase volume, and revenue.\nIn the auto business, we posted growth in originations for the fourth consecutive quarter and a return to year-over-year growth in loan balances, and consumer credit trends remained stable.\nOur full-year operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments was 42.35%, consistent with our guidance of the low 42s, even after incurring $100 million in accelerated philanthropy contributions. Turning to the Discover acquisition, the shareholder votes are scheduled for 18 February, and we continue to work closely with the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the Department of Justice as our applications continue to work their way through the regulatory approval process. We remain well-positioned to complete the acquisition early in 2025, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.\nPulling way up, the acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity. It will create a consumer banking and global payments platform with unique capabilities, modern technology, powerful brands, and a franchise of more than 100 million customers. It delivers compelling financial results and offers the potential to enhance competition and create significant value for merchants and customers.\nNow we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nThank you, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. Remember, as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the investor relations team will be available after the call. Josh, please start the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. One moment for questions. Our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. He may proceed.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director of Regional Banks and Consumer Finance, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon, everyone.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nHey, Ryan.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nHey, Ryan.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director of Regional Banks and Consumer Finance, Goldman Sachs\n\nSo, you know, Rich, you know, delinquencies have been in line or better for nine straight months, you know, losses, and you talked about delinquencies now being down on a year-over-year basis, and, you know, losses have sort of followed suit but at a little bit of a slower pace. And, you know, you've outlined a lot of the reasons, you know, deferred charge-offs, the press recoveries, but when you think about credit from here, just, you know, broadly, what are you seeing from the consumer, and how are you thinking about loss performance as well as any other factors that could be impacting losses, and do you think we're on a downward trajectory from here? Thank you, and I have a follow-up.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nThank you, Ryan. So let me start by just talking about the health of the consumer, and then maybe I'll turn and talk about the credit performance at Capital One. So the US consumer continues to, you know, to be a source of strength in the overall economy. The labor market remains strong, and we saw signs of softening in the first half of 2024, but in the second half of the year, the unemployment rate has been stable, and job creation data has shown renewed strength. Incomes are growing steadily in real terms as inflation, you know, settles out a bit. Consumer debt servicing burdens are stable, near pre-pandemic levels.\nConsumers have higher bank account balances than before the pandemic.\nNow, of course, the circumstances of individual consumers and households are highly variable, and so, you know, talking in averages doesn't always, you know, fully, you know, cover what's going on. We do see some pockets, as I've been saying for some time now, we do see some pockets of pressure related to the cumulative effects of inflation and elevated interest rates among consumers whose incomes have not kept up with inflation or who have high debt servicing burdens. Of course, there's, you know, still some inflation pressure, and longer-term interest rates strikingly have increased since the Fed started lowering rates in September.\nSo, you know, we do see a bit of a disconnect between the average consumer and the folks, you know, closer to the margin. And you can see that, for example, in payment rates in our card business.\nOn the one hand, card payment rates remain on average meaningfully above pre-pandemic levels, and this is true overall and within each of our major customer segments. On the other hand, the proportion of customers making just the minimum payment is also running somewhat above pre-pandemic levels, which is consistent with our card delinquencies, you know, running above pre-pandemic levels. Now, I should add that we're seeing this minimum payment effect across this credit spectrum. I'm not making a point here about the low end of the market or even about subprime. In fact, if anything, the lower end appears to be doing relatively better at the moment.\nSo, you know, just pulling up, I believe we're almost certainly still seeing some pandemic-related effects, like delayed charge-offs from the period of unprecedented stimulus and forbearance in 2020, 2021, and 2022.\nThis effect is impossible to isolate, but we can infer it from our own credit trends and industry credit trends over the past several years. But sort of pulling up on the consumer, I think consumers are in good shape compared to most historical benchmarks. You know, there are, as we've been saying for some time, there are pockets of pressure that have to, you know, work their way through before levels can get down, you know, credit loss levels can get down to sort of pre-pandemic levels. But I think the consumer story is very consistent with what I've been saying for a number of quarters, and it is very solid.\nSo let me turn to Capital One Credit. Over the course of 2024, our card delinquencies have moved in line with normal seasonality, with losses following about a quarter behind.\nAs a reminder, earlier this year, we flagged that changes in the level and timing of tax refunds due to tax law changes were probably changing seasonal credit patterns in our card business. We derived new seasonality benchmarks for card delinquencies based on post-pandemic performance, and those benchmarks have less amplitude in both directions than in the past. So we've now had a full year to look at, you know, what we were hypothesizing as the new seasonality benchmark.\nAnd, you know, as we now look at the whole year, this experience is very confirmatory, and we very much sort of believe that we've got the benchmark right. And, you know, when we first saw delinquencies settling out, it is clear that, you know, for really for the whole year now, we've been calling stabilization.\nWe've not been declaring a peak or declaring that credit would improve from here, but we can now look at the whole year and see a really nice stabilization. In Q4, and again, you saw this in the month we just reported, we saw our delinquencies improve on a seasonally adjusted basis in the quarter for the first time since normalization began. And, you know, they ended the year slightly lower on a year-over-year basis. So that's certainly an encouraging sign. You know, looking ahead, we're not, you know, giving guidance on future credit, but over time, there are a number of forces that play out. Our recoveries inventory will continue to rebuild, and that should be a gradual tailwind to our losses over time, all else equal.\nStill, high interest rates will probably remain a source of pressure for some consumers, especially those with higher debt servicing burdens. There still is, we believe, the phenomenon of delayed charge-offs. And, of course, this effect is hard to measure and certainly hard to forecast, but over time, it should play through. But, you know, how long it plays out, that's just something, you know, that is just a matter of speculation. I think we will eventually get back to the place where traditional labor market indicators are the main drivers of change in consumer credit, but that'll, you know, will still take some time.\nAnd finally, as we move into the new year, we'll keep an eye on the level and timing of tax refunds since we know these can materially affect seasonal movements in credit card.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director of Regional Banks and Consumer Finance, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Thanks for the call. If I can throw in one high-level follow-up. So, Rich, efficiency improvement has been a hallmark of Capital One for, you know, the last seven or eight years, except a small period during COVID. You know, you recently talked about investments you wanted to make in the network, you know, once the deal hopefully closes at some point in the Q1.\nI guess the question is, do you expect to continue to be on an efficiency journey, fully recognizing that the cost savings obviously make it easier? But just curious how you're thinking about efficiency for the consolidated company over the medium term, fully recognizing that there's going to be a lot of noise in the results.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nSo, you know, we look forward to, you know, the completion of our deal and actually really getting inside the financials, the performance, and all the details of the business. The business is at this rather remarkable company, Discover. But as we've talked about, you know, when we look still from the outside, we see just a great opportunity there. And, of course, you know, we have said there are, you know, three areas that are going to need in, you know, continued investment.\nWhen we think about virtually anything that, you know, all the strategic upside of this Discover deal, it sort of all roads lead through three areas, kind of obvious areas of continued investment. And the first, of course, is compliance and risk management.\nYou know, Discover has really been leaning into that, and we, of course, are doing everything we can to prepare to continue to lean into that, and we'll do whatever it takes on that front. Obviously, that's an investment. The second is, you know, network acceptance. We've talked about how struck we are and how struck we were to, you know, find out and confirm just how good the acceptance is in the United States for Discover. You can see, in fact, they've been putting some ads on TV sort of touting that, and it's a very good story. Internationally, they've been investing there and focusing on where their customers travel, and they've made a lot of progress there.\nWhen we look at, you know, our customer base at Capital One and, you know, where we would love to be over time in terms of being in a position to add more and more volume onto the Discover Network, we think an incredibly important objective is to increase the depth and breadth of acceptance internationally, scoping the work, of course, working backwards from where our customers and Discover's travel.\nSo that, you know, that's going to be a multi-year thing that, you know, that's a very important strategic imperative, I think, for us. And then the third one will be building the network brand. We plan to keep the name Discover for the network. We think it's a great brand, and we're really happy with the underlying reality of where acceptance is.\nWe know there are challenges in terms of consumer perception relative to those realities, and we know also we need to, in fact, build the international reality and then the brand perception that follows that. So those are the three strategic, the kind of, you know, obvious and strategic investment areas that we've been identifying really since the start of the deal.\nAnd back to your question about what do we think, how do you think, how do we think that fits in relative to efficiency ratio? We, of course, on the Capital One side have had a long decade-long journey of continuing to improve operating efficiency ratio, and it's striking that that improvement has come even as we have continued to really ramp up investment in technology.\nNow, the way that paradox works is the technology is we're also investing more in technology and, at the same time, getting all the benefits on the efficiency side, both in terms of growth and in terms of cost, that come from such an investment in technology. So, the engine that drives operating efficiency ratio strategically will continue at Capital One, and it should continue with the combined institution as well.\nNow, then you ask, will the big three investment areas that we talk about, what will that do to operating? You know, I think, you know, we always at Capital One have strategic imperatives that we're investing in. I think the overall picture of how Capital One's tech journey helps pay, you know, one of the important ways investors get paid is through operating efficiency improvement.\nI think that story to me stays strategically intact even as we have new investment areas because we'll also have new areas to capture synergy and growth opportunities and things that really wouldn't have been possible for either of our companies alone. So thanks for the question. Operating efficiency is a really important way that we create value for investors, and in the long run, we continue to really see increased opportunities there.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from Terry Ma with Barclays. He may proceed.\n\nTerry Ma\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, thank you. Good evening. I wanted to follow up on credit first. It seems the trend that we've seen for the second derivative suggests there's room for that to continue to go lower. Is there some sort of framework to think about how much lower DQs can trend going forward? And is there anything in the near term that can cause the second derivative to inflect higher again? That's a follow-up.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nSo, Terry, yes. So thank you for the question. Obviously, well, you know, since the founding of the company, we've always had our microscopes out looking at delinquencies because they're the single best predictor of credit of all the metrics. There are many metrics we watch, but that certainly is at the top of the list. And it is, I think, a really important, you know, it's certainly a gratifying milestone to where finally the second derivative, you know, crossed the horizontal axis effectively. And, you know, we certainly note that milestone. The first thing I would say about as we all get our microscopes out to look at trends on a monthly basis is to just talk about seasonality itself.\nYou know, we don't publish a seasonality curve per se because there's no precise benchmark with which to do it, but we certainly like to guide our investors about how we think about that. Seasonality for Capital One has tended to have more amplitude up and down over the course of a year than most other card players. One might ask, why is that?\nYou know, we believe that the biggest driver of seasonality, while there are several, the biggest driver of seasonality is tax refunds. Since we have a larger subprime book than most other players who really don't do subprime, those customers do tend to have higher seasonality in their credit performance than folks higher up market. So I think that's why Capital One has a greater seasonality effect.\nFor these customers in particular, tax refunds certainly in terms of the monthly flow of cash can end up creating something very nice that comes seasonally, and some of that makes its way into payments. Now, the changes in the tax withholding rules a few years ago led to fewer tax refunds and lower average refund payments. The IRS was also paying certain refunds later than before. So, you know, that created a lot of noise. As I've been saying on recent calls, you'd think it would be easy to reestablish a seasonality curve, but while credit was normalizing so dramatically, it was sometimes swamping the seasonality effect.\nWe created sort of this detrended seasonal curve from 2023 to the best we could, and that turned out to really be right on for 2024.\nIf I were to pull up and kind of summarize what we saw in 2024, 2024 settled out with fewer refunds paid than before the pandemic, and about 25% lower total refund volume in real terms. Delinquencies moved with our new post-pandemic seasonality benchmarks, which have similar timing. But if I were to summarize what this new curve versus the one we've had for many years, it appears to have about 35% to 40% less amplitude in both directions than in the past.\nBy the way, just a note for a second on auto, all of this also happens in auto seasonality, but in an even faster and more concentrated way. We tend to see auto delinquencies at their seasonal low in Q1 and losses in Q2. And this year, that seasonal improvement was delayed a bit.\nSo that's the backdrop for now, you know, talking about the credit performance that we see. You know, if you start, Terry, with the sort of foundation that the consumer is in very good shape, the economy is in quite good shape overall, you know, one would certainly feel there's sort of a gravitational pull toward, you know, even better credit in the business. That is helped by the math associated with recoveries, that our recoveries rate has been very constant, but the recovery inventory that we have had to collect on got very small during the pandemic, and that has been replenishing. So there's sort of a good vibe gradually coming as recoveries fully restore.\nAnd then that really gets us to whatever effects there are of inflation, whatever effects there are on the consumers on the tails that are not in as good shape as sort of the averages that we all look at. What we see there is probably the way actually that the delayed charge-offs are actually playing out. They're probably playing out exactly through these consumers on the tail that, you know, are not, they're still struggling at the margin.\nSo the credit metrics are looking great. We have more solid benchmarks, Terry. The consumer's in a great place, but I think the, you know, the sort of bigger picture phenomenon of delayed charge-offs that, you know, still has, you know, intuitively, you know, to play out.\nSort of these effects going on at the tail puts us in a position not to be declaring that things are headed down from here, but it's certainly, you know, positive indicators that we see at the margin.\n\nTerry Ma\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Maybe just to talk about the auto business. You called out the loan book return to growth this quarter. So we expect you to lean into that and see loan growth accelerate. And maybe can you just talk about the overall profitability of the loans you're booking today versus what you've seen historically? Thank you.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nSo we feel very good about the auto business. You know, the credit performance is really striking. And in fact, let's just savor something that is, I think, an outlier relative to the industry, but our auto delinquencies have remained consistently below pre-pandemic levels, and they've been lower on a year-over-year basis for the past two quarters.\nAnd, you know, so the auto business is, you know, there are many similar things about our card business and the auto business, but if you were to compare the two, the degree with which we sort of intervened in the business and trimmed credit around the edges. It might have been even more dramatic than the term around the edges, what we did in the auto business over the last, you know, over the last few years when we were worried about margin pressures in the business as prices were not being sort of passed, inflation pressures were not being passed through.\nSo there were margin pressures, there were declining vehicle values, and there was inflation of credit scores. So all of that led us to pull back. And each of those have sort of, you know, have been resolving themselves. You asked about margins.\nThe margins are sort of much more sort of normal in the business right now. The great inflation on credit scores is resolving itself as credit normalizes. Vehicle values, you know, we'll have to, you know, continue to keep an eye on those. But pulling way up on the shoulders of a lot of the changes that we have made and the technology that we have massively invested in this business, in underwriting and in originations and in our Auto Navigator platform, all of those put us in a position to feel bullish about leaning into auto. And, you know, I think we, you know, all the trends that we see on margins, credit, and competition, we feel good about, and that lines up to a story of leaning in on the auto business.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\n\nRick Shane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking my question. Hey, Rich, you did a great job laying out the factors that have caused the historical relationship between labor and credit to weaken. One of the factors you mentioned was the impact of rates. That makes sense. Credit cards are, you know, one of the two largest classes of floating-rate consumer debt. As we think about reversion to historical norms, should we expect charge-off rates to be structurally higher as long as interest rates are structurally higher, or is it possible to get back to historic loss rates in a high-interest rate environment?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nYou know, it's a great question. It's interesting how, you know, all of us, you know, some of us were around doing similar things back when, well, Capital One, we hadn't even come up with the idea for Capital One back when inflation was really raging the last time around. So I think we would be speculating there. But I think, Rick, if we pull up and think about, you know, interest rates and their impact, you know, we think about, you know, how, you know, higher rates as a thing affect consumer credit. So debt servicing burdens for consumers, of course, can get affected.\nThe higher rates, as they work their way through consumer products gradually, but not immediately, sort of make their way into higher debt burdens. So, you know, you have mortgages that tend to have fixed rates. Auto loans have fixed rates.\nSo you have time delays before interest rates make their way to more pressure on consumers. But still, that effect obviously can continue. Most credit cards have variable APRs, so rising interest rates have, you know, tended to lead to somewhat higher minimum payments for consumers overall. But if we pull up, I think that if wages, you know, if things stabilize and wages tend to keep up with inflation, I would think on the credit card side, it is plausible that charge-off rates could be very consistent with what they've been in a lower ambient rate environment. I think it gets very challenging when they're suddenly in motion up.\nBut if they stabilize, I'm just speculating here at a moderate level that's higher than they were for the last couple of decades, I think as wages sort of stabilize to make real incomes move the way they should.\nI would think that credit numbers could be very consistent with historical patterns. I think the biggest driver of why they're not right now, if I were to speculate, probably number one on my list is really the just unprecedented number of years of which charge-offs, with all the government stimulus and the forbearance that so many consumers got a lifeline, that those for whom that lifeline was a little more temporary in its benefit, some of those issues are still resolving themselves in terms of current charge-offs.\nIt's always an interesting thing to just take a look at the area under the curve in credit losses for, you know, if we look back over the last number of years and look at where credit losses would typically have been versus where they were, and you look at the area under the curve and ask yourself, well, what if all of that were delayed charge-offs? You know, you still have a majority of that area under the curve that would still have to play out in terms of delayed charge-offs. Now, we don't believe that anything close to all of the area under the curve would need to come on the other side.\nBut I think if, you know, a one-sentence soundbite to me of why in such a benign environment credit losses in businesses like credit cards are running higher than pre-pandemic, it is the delayed charge-off effect. And, you know, time should be our friend there. That should resolve itself over time. And there are a lot of positive factors behind that that are putting sort of good gravitational pull in the right direction in this industry.\n\nRick Shane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you very much, Rich.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGood evening. Just on the efficiency side, just a follow-up to Ryan's line of questioning. I know you've guided to an operating efficiency ratio in the low 42% range for 2024. You know, does this 42% range remain the case as you look at 2025, or do you see a change to the upside or the downside off of this level? Thanks.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nSo, you know, I think the operating efficiency ratio has really been, you know, hopefully our investors share our excitement that, you know, this 700 basis point improvement that has happened since we began our tech transformation in 2013 has, you know, certainly been a great guide. There are multiple things behind that, but the biggest driver is the technology transformation.\nAnd even as we invest a lot, there are also ways to create savings, savings through, you know, reduced vendor costs, the really high cost of a lot of legacy technology, the benefits on the cloud, and really the ability to then, on the other side of the technology transformation, sort of rebuild the company and how it operates, you know, on a foundation of modern technology. And so that's a journey that continues. And so we see, you know, benefits there.\nI do want to say, though, also. You have, you know, we've had a lot of beneficial increase in the ratio in the last couple of years. You know, I wouldn't want people to just draw, you know, take the curve and say, wow, that thing almost looks like it's accelerating down. You know, we don't give guidance in the short term. There are a lot of things, very important investments, we're making in the business.\nBut what I like to do is really just point out that when we stand back over a longer time frame and look at the journey of Capital One, this has been a journey for which the efficiency was never the objective function. It was one of the many benefits of a tech transformation, but it's very gratifying to see that continue.\nBut I think the extrapolation from, you know, any one year to the next is not something that we would recommend. And so, but it's a great long-term story.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGot it. Okay. Thanks, Rich. And then one quick second one. I assume this will be a pretty quick answer, but would be helpful if there's any, have you, you know, made any changes to your expected deal metrics tied to the Discover deal, either the 15% or greater of EPS accretion in 2027 or the expense efficiencies or the timing of adding the $175 billion in purchase volume to the network? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nHey, John. Yeah, what I'll say is it's two independent public companies. You know, we still are operating separately at this point. And there are a number of variables that have moved and will continue to move between now and legal day one. And so I'm not going to specifically comment on how any one of those, you know, variables or metrics are changing since the deal model. What I will say is, you know, we considered a wide range of outcomes across each of the line items, and we continue to be comfortable with the estimates that we included in the deal model. We feel very good both strategically and financially about the deal today as we did nearly a year ago when we announced it.\nAnd so as we get to legal day one and, you know, put the marks on the balance sheet, we'll provide updates on the relevant metrics at that point.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. You may proceed.\n\nMihir Bhatia\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to start first by just talking about NIM a little bit. You called out the Walmart impact this quarter. Any other callouts for the quarter? It just feels banks have been quite disciplined about lowering savings accounts interest rates as the Fed has reduced rates. Do you think that continues, or are you starting to see some demand for deposits or deposit competition ramping as we start contemplating loan growth here into 2025? I guess just related to that, if you could just talk about some of the puts and takes on NIM in 2025, that'd be great. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nSure, Mihir. Well, let me start with, you know, just reminding everyone that the one thing for sure we know is that in Q1, we have two fewer days. And so that will drive a 15 basis point roughly decrease in NIM. But if I kind of pull up and think beyond day count and look at a longer term, the longer term, a lot of the same forces that I've been describing for the last number of quarters as potential headwinds and tailwinds still exist today. So, you know, if you think about the headwinds, first of all, were very modestly asset sensitive. And so you'd see a small decrease in NIM if rates continue to decrease. And you saw a little bit of that effect here in this quarter.\nThe other one you bring up, deposit beta, of course, in our rate risk modeling, we make assumptions around deposit betas. So to the extent that betas are lower or slower on the way down, you know, we would be a little bit more asset sensitive in that scenario. So those could be headwinds. But on the tailwind side, you know, the steepening yield curve relative to forwards would be a good guy if that persists.\nBut then probably the single biggest factor, and we've seen this play out over the last number of quarters, is the card growth and card becoming a bigger percentage of our balance sheet, all else equal, is a pretty meaningful tailwind to NIM. So those are really the forces at play that I would highlight for you.\n\nMihir Bhatia\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Thank you. And then maybe just turning quickly to capital return. You've been doing $150 million in buybacks last few quarters. Your CET1 is up to 13.5. We understand with the deal, you have to get approval, right, for any capital actions. But the question is, two-part question there. A, is that approval keeping you a little conservative right now? And two, once the deal is approved, should we assume you'll be pretty aggressive in getting that down, or would it probably be fair to assume it stays elevated for a little bit, even post-deal as you get through the integration?\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nYeah, I'll wrap my answer to both of those questions into one for you, Mihir. You know, first of all, just, you know, goes without saying, but I will say it, which is we clearly recognize that over the longer term, capital return is a key component of shareholder value creation. And you've seen in prior periods, we've executed substantial share repurchases. But in the near term, our pending deal is certainly influencing our approach to capital in a few ways. You know, as you said, we're still under regulatory pre-approval rules for each of our capital actions.\nAnd second, we will need to run our own bottoms-up analyses as a combined company to just assess our view of the combined capital need. And we continue to be two separate companies and therefore, you know, don't have the ability to do that analysis until after close.\nAnd then third, we will need the Fed's approval to go back to operating under the SCB framework. So, you know, if I pull up from there and put all of those together, I think it's likely we're going to stay at a slower repurchase pace until we resolve these factors. But after that, we'll have more flexibility.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research Securities. You may proceed.\n\nBill Carcache\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research Securities\n\nThank you. Good evening, Rich and Andrew. It was good to hear all the references to the Capital One Arena around the inauguration. I wanted to ask about your ability to better compete against the big banks in debit, assuming the Discover transaction closes as you expect. We know debit rewards for Visa and Mastercard issuers essentially went away after the forced reduction in interchange under Dodd-Frank. But would reintroducing debit rewards be something that you'd consider given the greater flexibility that owning the Discover Network will afford you?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nHey, Bill. So obviously, a really key part of the deal is our excitement about getting the network and being able to add such a key dimension in vertically integrating our business. And, you know, we talk so much about credit cards all the time. The debit business is a really important one. And on little cat feet, Capital One has really been investing in our national banking business. So I, and by the way, having our own network will be valuable there and we'll be able to enjoy the vertically integrated economics of owning a network and, you know, and the scale that comes, of course, from pulling Discover and a bunch of Capital One's volume together.\nNow, I just want to pull back and just talk a little bit about Capital One's consumer banking strategy, and therefore, you know, and debit is, of course, right, you know, in the transaction business, right at the heart of that. If you pull way up and think about consumer banking, you know, way back to when banks began, you had banks with branches on every corner. And then in the last, you know, 15 or 20 years, there have been the evolution of direct banks, and they have been savings only, offering higher rates, and they have no physical distribution whatsoever.\nAnd we, of course, also through our acquisitions, have acquired several, you know, banks with branches on every corner. And we also acquired the nation's largest direct bank.\nAnd I announced at the time of that acquisition, this is a great financial trade, but it is also a strategic game changer for Capital One. That was back, you know, like 12 years ago. So since then, we have been very steadily, systematically, relentlessly, and patiently, if I could put so many adjectives on, adverbs on that, pursuing a business model that actually doesn't really exist right now because we have those two endpoints. But what we're really trying to do is build, in a sense, the bank of the future. And we believe that bank of the future is not just a direct bank. It's also not a bank with a branch on every corner. It is a bank with thin physical distribution.\nFor us, we've, you know, got branches, but then also in major metropolitan areas, we have put in cafés that are really basically, you know, less about coffee, but really more about being sort of a hybrid of a branch and a showroom for Capital One and a place people can go and understand Capital One's there to help them and get a sense for really what this company is about and how it may be able to help them live their life more effectively. So this strategy has been about, you know, if we work backwards from what we believe is the bank of the future, from a distribution point of view, that's thin physical distribution and, you know, highlighted by these café showrooms.\nIt also, a very central part of that, is digital capabilities that enable something that's a very, very difficult thing to do, which is to take, you know, just about everything that can be done in a branch and make it available digitally. Now, there's some things like safe deposit boxes. We haven't figured out how to create a digital safe deposit box for your valuables.\nAnd there are a few things that just, you know, you can't get there on a, you know, a digital basis. But as we've looked at this, we said just pretty much, you know, virtually all the activities that people go to branches for, we want to be able to deliver to them through our thin physical distribution plus massive full-service digital capability. And that's what we've been building over these years.\nAdditionally, it requires, you know, in order to, you know, generate business, we need great products. And, you know, we've been the only major bank out there with no fees, no minimums, and even a recent move of no overdraft fees. And those better deals come from having built the, in a sense, superior economics that come from this sort of physical distribution light model.\nNow, then you ask the question, so what will be our debit card strategy? You know, we haven't completed the deal. We haven't fully gone in on the other side of exactly seeing, you know, how things are working on the Discover side. But we are very pleased with the results that we're having with our current strategy, including our current debit card strategy. And we are investing heavily to continue to grow that business.\nYou know, you look at the significant increase in marketing over the years. One of the drivers of this is that Capital One is building a national bank organically without a lot of physical distribution. And to get there, it takes a lot of marketing. So I think the best way to think about it is Discover gives a shot in the arm and a boost to a strategy we've been pursuing for more than a decade. And the best way to think about it, I think, is picture just more of the same from Capital One with a little bit of an accelerator.\n\nBill Carcache",
    "content2": "Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research Securities\n\nI appreciate all the details, Rich. Thank you.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks. Rich, you talked about, you know, better growth in auto and card, talked about the high-end card. Talk about the non-prime businesses in both card and auto, given the improved credit, how you're thinking about growth in those businesses in the coming quarters.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nMoshe, the word that I would use at the lower and the sort of lower end of the business, obviously there are parts of the market below, you know, below where we play. But if we sort of loosely call it at the lower end of the non-prime or subprime part of the marketplace, the word that I would use to describe it is stability. And stability of, let's look at the key aspects of that.\nOn the consumer credit side, actually, the first part of our business to normalize, really to settle out with respect to credit was the lower end of the market. That's been very stable. Our originations in that segment, and really pretty much across our business, the originations are coming in on top of each other for years. So that has a stability there as well.\nCompetitively, it's a very competitive, it's a very competitive part of the business that has many, in addition to, you know, regular card players, many non-traditional players as well. So the competitive intensity is high, but we, you know, we watch it very carefully. And so with the stability of performance and the strength of the consumer, we, in both the card and the auto side of the business, continue to lean in in a very similar way that we have. Well, for card, it's just been very consistent for years.\nWith auto, we kind of pulled back quite a bit in that part of the business, and we're leaning in as we often have done historically. So we're leaning into both of them, and we're really pleased with the stability and strength of the metrics that underlie those businesses.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGot it. Thanks. And maybe just as a follow-up, when you think about reserve levels, given that, you know, you are seeing or likely to see some improvement in credit losses kind of on a, you know, core basis or like for like. And, you know, it sounds like the growth is probably, you know, growth that you have in the balance sheet is probably going to come in your lower loss categories, not the higher ones. You know, thoughts about the reserve level as we move forward?\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nSure. Moshe, so what's going to happen in future quarters starts with what happened this quarter. So I just want to reiterate a couple of the drivers of this quarter as a jumping-off point. As I said in the prepared remarks, you know, coverage was down 33 basis points by two things. The bigger effect being that we typically have seasonally higher balances in Q4 that require very low levels of coverage, and that denominator effect from those balances puts downward pressure on coverage.\nThe other effect was that, you know, the allowance we needed for what I'll call non-seasonal growth was offset by favorable observed credit performance. And so we added $0 of allowance balance to the numerator, but the non-seasonal growth impacted the denominator.\nAnd so, you know, in the Q1, I just wanted to provide that backdrop to say the seasonal balances will run off. And so there will be a corresponding upward pressure on coverage, all else equal from that effect. But beyond that, it's really going to come down to growth and our loss forecast, and loss forecast specifically for the coverage. And to the extent that loss forecast improves, you know, changes in coverage could be modest in the near term as we just reflect the uncertainty of our projections in the allowance.\nBut, you know, eventually the improved loss forecast is going to flow through the allowance and continue to bring the coverage ratio down as uncertainties become more certain.\nAnd so, you know, while the direction of travel would be down, the pace and timing is going to depend on a variety of factors, one of which will include the mix of businesses, as you say. But, you know, when it's denominated to the whole portfolio, the relative growth of different forecasted loss, you know, portions of the book aren't going to have a material impact to coverage, just given that the new originations is a percentage of the overall book in any given quarter is relatively small. And then the only thing I also want to remind you of is, I know, you know, our investors look at history as a potential guide for levels of coverage.\nI just want to remind you that, you know, we called out the roughly 50 basis points of impact to coverage from the termination of the loss sharing agreement with Walmart. That created a, you know, a step function change in coverage relative to our prior history as well.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\n\nDon Fandetti\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nYes, Rich, your credit card purchase volume growth on a like account basis has picked up. I'm just trying to get a sense if this is a Q4 blip or are you thinking that the consumer is actually more confident here after the election? Are you seeing that same improvement in consumer and small business as well?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nWell, we have, if we think about our purchase volume, our growth in overall purchase volume continues to be driven by growth in our branded card customer base. And the branded card includes, you know, both our consumer and our small business. You know, the growth that you see and that we've seen for several years now is certainly a thing powering. It has been a strength in originations and some strength in originations at the higher end of the market.\nBut the other way to think about your question is at a customer level, what, you know, on a per customer basis, what's been happening to spend growth. And even as our spend metrics were growing overall, the spend growth per customer in our consumer business have been largely, you know, they had been largely flat through 2023 and really first half of 2024.\nAnd then they started to pick up midway through last year and they grew further in Q4. And I don't have in front of me the small business card numbers. They're embedded in the numbers that I gave you. So the fact that we have seen spend per customer finally pick up here is striking. Whether it will continue and exactly what's driving it is hard to say. But I did want to point out that positive trajectory as the year finished off.\n\nDon Fandetti\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Andrew, you touched on this, but your 2024 vintage, can you talk a little bit about how you're feeling, how you're seeing that shape up in terms of credit performance? I've seen some industry data that, you know, shows delinquencies are still pretty high for 2024.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nYeah, Don, why don't I take that? So recent originations in our card business, we continue to see stability in the performance of our originations. It's really striking here. We've been calling this out consistently over the past few years. Vintage over vintage, we're seeing mostly stable risk levels over time. And also striking is our overall front book of new origination vintages continues to perform in line with pre-pandemic vintages. Now, when you compare with pre-pandemic vintages, you can't look at 2019 because 2019 very quickly got sort of corrupted by the pandemic. So we're looking at 2017 and 2018 when we make these comparisons.\nSo, from a Capital One point of view, I think this stability in origination performance and, you know, quarter over quarter and the consistency with pre-pandemic is the result of our intervention to deal with, you know, inflated credit scores and the high level of industry supplies that were flooding, particularly the subprime marketplace back there. So we trimmed around the edges and continued to very closely watch the origination vintages.\nAnd that has led to a sustained stability on the part of Capital One and some of our most recent vintages. Now, again, we're still looking, you got to look like, you know, six months in the rearview mirror to see much, but we continue to see some very positive results there. We also have looked at industry data that shows some gapping out in vintages over the last couple of years.\nSo I think the industry effect is not probably consistent with what we have described. And if I were to, you know, explain why, because I think they're, you know, very capable companies doing this, I think the, I'm not sure that most of the industry adjusted for inflated credit scores. And, you know, we intervened on our models with a belief that, you know, the university was suddenly giving out A's that should be B's basically. And so we intervened and then kept validating along the way.\nBut for a while, we didn't have validation. We just intervened because we believed it was the right thing to do. So I think what we have, what has been seen, if you look at just overall industry originations, is, as you say, some gapping out. And I think that would be the biggest driver.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. You may proceed.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, KBW\n\nThank you. I guess, Rich, just one more on the deal. Given the timeline that you've outlined early this year, is it fair to assume like everything's going pretty smoothly in terms of the regulatory approval process and there hasn't been any surprises? I'm also wondering sort of where you guys are in terms of the integration efforts and how much work has been done there.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nOkay. Yeah. So no, the approval process continues to move forward. We've made substantial progress in the recent months. We remain actively engaged with the Fed and the OCC about our merger applications. And it is the Fed and the OCC who ultimately decide on our merger application. Late last year, we received approval from the Delaware State Bank Commissioner, which we needed because Discover is a state chartered bank. We, of course, had the, you know, the big public hearing in July, and that went very well, we feel.\nEarlier this month, of course, we finalized a joint proxy statement with the SEC setting up a 18 February shareholder vote. So that was good progress finally there. We are also engaged with the Justice Department as they play a key role in advising the Fed and the OCC on the competitive aspects of the deal.\nWe continue to believe that this transaction is both pro-competitive and pro-consumer, bringing our best-in-class products and services to a broader set of consumers and small businesses, and really enhancing opportunities and benefits for merchants as well. So pulling way up, it's certainly, you know, the deal process, it's a long labor, but we remain well positioned to get approval of the deal early this year. You know, we're really proud of the work everyone is doing here. We look forward to, you know, getting this over the goal line.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, KBW\n\nOkay. Just to follow up on a question Ryan asked some time ago on sort of when you put the companies together and the efficiencies and sort of the investments that need to be made. I guess when you put the two companies together, the efficiency ratio actually goes down. And obviously, there's a lot of synergies both on revenues, and expenses. Do you think those are sufficient enough to sort of accomplish? I'm just trying the question again. Do you think those are sufficient enough to make all of the investments that you sort of outlined, or do you think that there's others that you might have to make as you, you know, peel the onion a little bit when you have the company?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nSo, you know, I don't think we're in a position to. It's not just because we, you know, want to be quiet about it. We're not in a different place than we were at the time we announced the deal. You know, we should point out that we are working really hard preparing for integration, but we are still separate companies. Discover is working incredibly hard and working on their compliance. I know they're doing preparations for integration as well. We certainly are. We're not getting an inside view of their numbers, their performance, their business model.\nSo, you know, we're mostly sort of where we were at the, you know, at the outset. But if we pull up to your point, so Discover, you know, operated, operates with a significantly lower operating efficiency ratio than Capital One.\nThat's certainly a good thing for the combined company. I think it is also the case that the, you know, I think Discover has had a heritage of probably less investment in certain areas than Capital One. And in a few cases, they're sort of making up for lost time there. But I think, you know, having not seen on the other side, we assume that there are some areas that, you know, we will, and we've assumed this from the beginning, we're going to need to step up the investments in.\nObviously, on the risk management side, there's a lot of investment to be done. Whether it is, how what ultimately needs to be done compares with what they're investing in, all of that, you know, remains to be seen. We obviously had assumptions in our deal model about leaning in on that.\nBut what we get, so there's going to be a lot of effects that are all, you know, pretty significant, that just go in different directions. A company with an amazing efficiency ratio, a company that's probably underinvested in a number of areas that, relative to Capital One, and we would shore up some of those investments. We also get a lot of synergy that comes from bringing, you know, overlapping businesses together.\nThat's a very strong effect. And then these three, the investment areas, the three that we're pointing out, we are talking about, you know, investing in those at a level that's a lot different than what Discover has done traditionally. Obviously, the risk management one, we've all talked about that, and they're leaning in hard now.\nOn international acceptance, they certainly, again, I'm amazed with their not-that-great scale, what they've done, but we would expect to invest at a higher level than they have there. And in terms of the network brand relative to, I want to just make a comment about the network brand and some of this other investment. It is, we have sloped, we have taken our card business and sloped the business that we think most naturally and easily can go to the Discover Network. And it involves, you know, folks that aren't big international travelers, for example.\nSo we've sloped the work. There is, we think it's very straightforward to move this business, front book and back book business to Discover.\nAnd some of these investments that I'm talking about leaning into are particularly important for the longer-term opportunity of being able to move more business than what we put into our deal model. And again, in doing that, we, you know, we sloped, we took our whole customer base and imagined sort of sloping it in terms of what part of the business fits most naturally within the context of the capabilities and the branded Discover's network.\nAnd then as we want to move more, we're going to need, you know, the bar to be raised relative to acceptance and brand. And that's why I think, you know, these other investments we're talking about will be multi-year. They'll be over time, and there will be things that help make the deal pay off even more so in the longer term.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Hecht\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGood afternoon, guys, and thanks for fitting me in here. First question, just thinking about the mix of the overall consumer book. I mean, you've got some new cards like the VentureOne and Quicksilver, you know, and some of those, you know, are attractive to different demographic groups. And then you've got the subprime mix, and then you've got auto. Where do we see, just given kind of inbound customer mix, where do we see that going this year as a standalone business? And then, Rich, do you have any comments on what the total portfolio might look like, assuming the combination with Discover?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nYes. So thank you, John. So let me take Discover just in a minute. So if you pull way up on Capital One for, you know, a long, long time, Capital One has been a sort of a full-spectrum player. We have had for several decades a subprime business that, you know, is tailor-made for the information-based strategy we have because it's all about surviving and winning on the credit side of the business. But also in that business, we've also very, very much focused relative to others who play in the space to deal with exceptionally good deals. It's not just about sort of surviving on the credit side, but really giving great deals, helping people use credit wisely.\nAnd in fact, really, I think the deals that we're offering are very, very simple and profoundly better than a lot of the deals that are available in the marketplace. And so that business is a very stable part of what we do at Capital One. And, you know, we continue to lean into that. Probably the most dramatic thing that's been happening in the last decade in Capital One's card business is, as you reference, the quest toward the top of the market. And that is a journey that, you know, as far out as we can see, we will continue to lean into that because there is so much opportunity at the top of the market.\nAnd obviously, it takes a lot of investment, but the key indicator to us that when we stratify out the segments of our business by spend levels, the part that's growing the fastest consistently year after year at Capital One is the heaviest spenders. And there's just so much upside north of where we are. We will continue to invest in that. Now, if you stand back, just think about our card business.\nWhile our subprime business has been going along and we keep leaning into that, there has been a gradual mix shift up market for the company. And even within each segment, within the sort of the subprime book, the sort of the prime book, and certainly the top of the market, there has been a gradual mix change with a spender-first philosophy that permeates our business.\nSo that, and some of that you can see in just some of the structural changes in the payment rates at Capital One. So I believe that what you see and what you have seen for a number of, for many years, is a good prognosticator of probably how the future of legacy Capital One would likely go, meaning continued leaning in across the spectrum, but differentially an awful lot of investment toward the top of the market and the most growth opportunity there. Now, let me turn to Discover.\nDiscover, interestingly, has taken a very different approach than Capital One. While we have taken a very broad approach playing in all parts of the market, Discover has had a very focused strategy on the prime part of the business. And they've done a very, very good job there. And we certainly always admired them from the outside.\nSo, you know, we will be bringing into our company a significant increase in that portion of the market, which probably differentially got a little less emphasis if anything. It's not like we weren't playing there, but if anything, we had a greater emphasis probably north and south of that part of the business. But so from a mixed point of view, we certainly, we will be bringing in a business that's very homogeneous relative to the very heterogeneous business that we have.\nAnd then on the other side of all of that, I think that we will, if I were to summarize our strategy, it will be to continue everything we were doing as Capital One because we're getting a lot of traction in that, and then making very sure that we don't crush the butterfly of this beautiful business model that Discover has in the prime part of the market, but that we go in there and while, yes, you know, integrating things like technology and some of the risk management processes and a lot of things, do everything that we can to make sure that we don't directly or even unwittingly sort of crush the really nice butterfly of what they do.\nIn that way, we hope to bring in a growth business that Discover has and add it to the very complementary growth businesses that Capital One has and collectively continue to try to get the best of both worlds, bringing along the way some, you know, better efficiencies and really bringing top technology to all aspects of the business.\n\nJohn Hecht\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Very much appreciated. Thanks.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nWell, thank you, everyone, for joining us on the conference call today. Thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Have a great night, everybody.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nThanks, everybody.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Capital One Q4 2024 Earnings Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nThanks, Josh, and welcome, everyone. Just as a reminder, as always, we are webcasting live over the internet, and to access the call on the internet, please log on to Capital One's website, capitalone.com, and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our Q4 2024 results. With me this evening are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Andrew Young, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Andrew are going to walk you through this presentation.\nTo access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors, then click on Financials, and then click on Quarterly Earnings Release. Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements.\nInformation regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials. Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements.\nFor more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-Looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our annual and quarterly reports that are accessible at Capital One's website filed with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on slide three of tonight's presentation. In the Q4, Capital One earned $1.1 billion, or $2.67 per diluted common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $4.8 billion, or $11.59 per share. Included in the results for the Q4 were adjusting items related to Discover integration costs and a legal reserve bill. Net of these adjusting items, Q4 earnings per share were $3.09. Full-year adjusted earnings per share were $13.96. We also had one notable item in the quarter, which was $100 million of accelerated philanthropy contributions.\nPre-provision earnings of $4.1 billion in the Q4 were down 13% from the Q3, driven by higher non-interest expense. The linked quarter increase in non-interest expense was driven by increases in both operating expense and marketing spend.\nRevenue in the linked quarter increased 2%, driven by higher non-interest income. Provision for credit losses was $2.6 billion in the quarter, up about $160 million relative to the prior quarter. The quarterly increase in provision was driven by higher net charge-offs, partially offset by a larger allowance release. Turning to slide four, I will cover the allowance in greater detail. We released $245 million in allowance this quarter, and our allowance balance now stands at $16.3 billion.\nThe decrease in this quarter's allowance was driven by releases in our commercial banking and commercial segments. Our total portfolio coverage ratio decreased 20 basis points to 4.96%. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on slide five. The allowance balance in our domestic card business was flat.\nThe coverage ratio declined 33 basis points, primarily driven by seasonal balances as well as favorable near-term credit trends. In our consumer banking segment, we released $131 million in allowance, resulting in a 22 basis point decrease to the coverage ratio. Vehicle values were stable in the quarter, resulting in an improved recovery outlook, which drove the release. Our commercial banking allowance decreased by $130 million, resulting in a 15 basis point decrease to the coverage ratio. The release was primarily driven by the reduction in criticized loans and, to a lesser extent, by charge-offs in the quarter.\nTurning to page six, I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter decreased by about $8 billion to approximately $124 billion. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $43 billion, down about $6 billion from the prior quarter.\nThe decline in cash was largely driven by seasonally higher card loans and funding maturities, which were partially offset by continued strong growth in our consumer banking business deposits. Our preliminary average Liquidity Coverage Ratio during the Q4 was 155%. Turning to page seven, I'll cover our Net Interest Margin. Our Q4 Net Interest Margin was 7.03%, eight basis points lower than last quarter and 30 basis points higher than the year-ago quarter. The linked quarter decrease in NIM was primarily driven by lower asset yields, which were only partially offset by lower deposit and wholesale funding costs.\nTurning to slide eight, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 13.5%, 10 basis points lower than the prior quarter.\nNet income in the quarter was more than offset by the impact of loan growth, dividends, and $150 million of share repurchases. As a reminder, the announcement of the acquisition of Discover constituted a material business change. Therefore, we continue to be subject to the Federal Reserve's pre-approval of our capital actions until the merger approval process has concluded. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows Q4 results in our credit card business. Credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on slide 11. In the Q4, our domestic card business delivered another quarter of steady top-line growth, strong margins, and stable credit. Year-over-year purchase volume growth for the quarter was 7%. Ending loan balances increased $8 billion, or about 5% year-over-year. Average loans increased about 6%, and Q4 revenue was up 9% from the Q4 of 2023, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans.\nRevenue margin for the quarter increased 55 basis points from the prior year quarter to 18.6%, largely driven by the impact of the end of the Walmart revenue sharing agreement. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 6.06%.\nThe impact of the end of the Walmart loss sharing agreement increased the Q4 charge-off rate by roughly 40 basis points. Excluding this impact, the charge-off rate for the quarter would have been 5.66%, up 31 basis points year-over-year. After 20 consecutive months of second derivative improvement, the 30+ delinquency rate crossed into actual year-over-year improvement. The 30+ delinquency rate at the end of December was 4.53%, down eight basis points from the prior year. As a reminder, the end of the Walmart loss sharing agreement did not have a meaningful impact on delinquency rate.\nOn a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 45 basis points. The 30+ delinquency rate was flat compared to the linked quarter. Domestic card non-interest expense was up 13% compared to the Q4 of 2023. Operating expense and marketing both increased year-over-year.\nTotal company marketing expense in the quarter was $1.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Our choices in domestic card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see compelling growth opportunities in our domestic card business. Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business. Compared to the Q4 of 2023, domestic card marketing in the quarter included higher media spend and increased investment in premium benefits and differentiated customer experiences, like our travel portal, airport lounges, and Capital One Shopping.\nSlide 12 shows Q4 results in our consumer banking business. Auto originations were up 53% from the prior year quarter. A portion of this growth can be attributed to overall market growth, while the remainder is the result of our strong position to pursue resilient growth in the current marketplace.\nAs a reminder, our choices to tighten credit and pull back in anticipation of credit score inflation and declining vehicle values were still in effect in Q4 2023, resulting in relatively low originations. These choices also drove, you know, really basically strong and stable credit performance that positioned us to lean into current marketplace opportunities and return to originations growth in 2024. With four consecutive quarters of originations growth in 2024, consumer banking loan balances returned to growth in Q4 2024. Ending loans increased $2.7 billion, or about 4% year-over-year, and average loans were up 1%.\nOn a linked quarter basis, ending loans were up 2%, and average loans were up 1%. Compared to the year-ago quarter, ending consumer deposits grew about 7%, and average consumer deposits were up about 8%. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter was up about 1% year-over-year.\nGrowth in loans and deposits was partially offset by a higher year-over-year average deposit interest rate. Non-interest expense was up about 10% compared to the Q4 of 2023, driven largely by the unique Q4 items Andrew discussed, as well as increased auto originations, and continued technology investments. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.32%, up 13 basis points year-over-year. The 30+ delinquency rate was 5.95%, down 39 basis points year-over-year. Largely as the result of our choice to tighten credit and pull back in 2022, auto charge-offs have been strong and stable on a seasonally adjusted basis.\nSlide 13 shows Q4 results for our commercial banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances were essentially flat. Average loans were down about 1%. Both ending and average deposits were up about 4% from the linked quarter.\nQ4 revenue was up 7% from the linked quarter, and non-interest expense was up by about 5%. The commercial banking annualized net charge-off rate for the Q4 increased 4 basis points from the sequential quarter to 0.26%. The commercial criticized performing loan rate was 6.35%, down 131 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate decreased 16 basis points to 1.39%. In closing, we continued to post strong and steady results in the Q4.\nWe delivered another quarter of top-line growth in domestic card loans, purchase volume, and revenue. In the auto business, we posted growth in originations for the fourth consecutive quarter and a return to year-over-year growth in loan balances, and consumer credit trends remained stable.\nOur full-year operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments was 42.35%, consistent with our guidance of the low 42s, even after incurring $100 million in accelerated philanthropy contributions. Turning to the Discover acquisition, the shareholder votes are scheduled for 18 February, and we continue to work closely with the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the Department of Justice as our applications continue to work their way through the regulatory approval process.\nWe remain well-positioned to complete the acquisition early in 2025, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. Pulling way up, the acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity. It will create a consumer banking and global payments platform with unique capabilities, modern technology, powerful brands, and a franchise of more than 100 million customers. It delivers compelling financial results and offers the potential to enhance competition and create significant value for merchants and customers.\nNow we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nThank you, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. Remember, as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the investor relations team will be available after the call. Josh, please start the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. One moment for questions. And our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. He may proceed.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director of Regional Banks and Consumer Finance, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon, everyone.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nHey, Ryan.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nHey, Ryan.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director of Regional Banks and Consumer Finance, Goldman Sachs\n\nSo, you know, Rich, you know, delinquencies have been in line or better for nine straight months, you know, losses, and you talked about delinquencies now being down on a year-over-year basis, and, you know, losses have sort of followed suit, but at a little bit of a slower pace.\nAnd, you know, you've outlined a lot of the reasons, you know, deferred charge-offs, the better recoveries, but when you think about credit from here, just, you know, broadly, what are you seeing from the consumer, and how are you thinking about loss performance as well as any other factors that could be impacting losses, and do you think we're on a downward trajectory from here? Thank you, and I have a follow-up.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nThank you, Ryan. So let me start by just talking about the health of the consumer, and then maybe I'll turn and talk about the credit performance at Capital One. So the US consumer continues to, you know, to be a source of strength in the overall economy. The labor market remains strong, and we saw signs of softening in the first half of 2024, but in the second half of the year, the unemployment rate has been stable, and job creation data has shown renewed strength. Incomes are growing steadily in real terms as inflation, you know, settles out a bit.\nConsumer debt servicing burdens are stable, near pre-pandemic levels. Consumers have higher bank account balances than before the pandemic.\nNow, of course, the circumstances of individual consumers and households are highly variable, and so, you know, talking in averages doesn't always, you know, fully, you know, cover what's going on. We do see some pockets, as I've been saying for some time now, we do see some pockets of pressure related to the cumulative effects of inflation and elevated interest rates among consumers whose incomes have not kept up with inflation or who have high debt servicing burdens. Of course, there's, you know, still some inflation pressure, and longer-term interest rates strikingly have increased since the Fed started lowering rates in September.\nSo, you know, we do see a bit of a disconnect between the average consumer and the folks, you know, closer to the margin. And you can see that, for example, in payment rates in our card business.\nOn the one hand, card payment rates remain on average meaningfully above pre-pandemic levels, and this is true overall and within each of our major customer segments. On the other hand, the proportion of customers making just the minimum payment is also running somewhat above pre-pandemic levels, which is consistent with our card delinquencies, you know, running above pre-pandemic levels. Now, I should add that we're seeing this minimum payment effect across this credit spectrum. I'm not making a point here about the low end of the market or even about subprime. In fact, if anything, the lower end appears to be doing relatively better at the moment.\nSo, you know, just pulling up, I believe we're almost certainly still seeing some pandemic-related effects, like delayed charge-offs from the period of unprecedented stimulus and forbearance in 2020, 2021, and 2022.\nThis effect is impossible to isolate, but we can infer it from our own credit trends and industry credit trends over the past several years. But sort of pulling up on the consumer, I think consumers are in good shape compared to most historical benchmarks. You know, there are, as we've been saying for some time, there are pockets of pressure that have to, you know, work their way through before levels can get down, you know, credit loss levels can get down to sort of pre-pandemic levels.\nBut I think the consumer story is very consistent with what I've been saying for a number of quarters, and it is very solid. So let me turn to Capital One credit. Over the course of 2024, our card delinquencies have moved in line with normal seasonality, with losses following about a quarter behind.\nAs a reminder, earlier this year, we flagged that changes in the level and timing of tax refunds due to tax law changes were probably changing seasonal credit patterns in our card business. We derived new seasonality benchmarks for card delinquencies based on post-pandemic performance, and those benchmarks have less amplitude in both directions than in the past. So we've now had a full year to look at, you know, what we were hypothesizing as the new seasonality benchmark. And, you know, as we now look at the whole year, this experience is very confirmatory, and we very much sort of believe that we've got the benchmark right.\nAnd, you know, when we first saw delinquencies settling out, it is clear that, you know, for really for the whole year now, we've been calling stabilization.\nWe've not been declaring a peak or declaring that credit would improve from here, but we can now look at the whole year and see a really nice stabilization. In Q4, and again, you saw this in the month we just reported, we saw our delinquencies improve on a seasonally adjusted basis in the quarter for the first time since normalization began. You know, they ended the year slightly lower on a year-over-year basis.\nThat's certainly an encouraging sign. You know, looking ahead, we're not, you know, giving guidance on future credit, but over time, there are a number of forces that play out. Our recoveries inventory will continue to rebuild, and that should be a gradual tailwind to our losses over time, all else equal.\nStill, high interest rates will probably remain a source of pressure for some consumers, especially those with higher debt servicing burdens. And there still is, we believe, the phenomenon of delayed charge-offs. And, of course, this effect is hard to measure and certainly hard to forecast, but over time, it should play through. But, you know, how long it plays out, that's just something, you know, that is just a matter of speculation. I think we will eventually get back to the place where traditional labor market indicators are the main drivers of change in consumer credit, but that'll, you know, will still take some time.\nAnd finally, as we move into the new year, we'll keep an eye on the level and timing of tax refunds since we know these can materially affect seasonal movements in card credit.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director of Regional Banks and Consumer Finance, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Thanks for the call. If I can throw in one high-level follow-up. So, Rich, efficiency improvement has been a hallmark of Capital One for, you know, the last seven or eight years, except small period during COVID. You know, you recently talked about investments you wanted to make in the network, you know, once the deal hopefully closes at some point in the Q1. I guess the question is, do you expect to continue to be on an efficiency journey, fully recognizing that the cost saves obviously make it easier, but just curious how you're thinking about efficiency for the consolidated company over the medium term, fully recognizing that there's going to be a lot of noise in the results?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nSo, you know, we look forward to, you know, the completion of our deal and actually really getting inside the financials and the performance and all the details of the business. The business is at this rather remarkable company, Discover. But as we've talked about, you know, when we look still from the outside, we see just a great opportunity there. And, of course, you know, we have said there are, you know, three areas that are going to need, you know, continued investment.\nWhen we think about virtually anything that, you know, all the strategic upside of this Discover deal, it sort of all roads lead through three areas, kind of obvious areas of continued investment. And the first, of course, is compliance and risk management.\nYou know, Discover has really been leaning into that, and we, of course, are doing everything we can to prepare to continue to lean into that, and we'll do whatever it takes on that front. Obviously, that's an investment. The second is, you know, network acceptance. We've talked about how struck we are and how struck we were to, you know, find out and confirm just how good the acceptance is in the United States for Discover. You can see, in fact, they've been putting some ads on TV sort of touting that, and it's a very good story. And internationally, they've been investing there and focusing on where their customers travel, and they've made a lot of progress there.\nWhen we look at, you know, our customer base at Capital One and, you know, where we would love to be over time in terms of being in a position to add more and more volume onto the Discover Network, we think an incredibly important objective is to increase the depth and breadth of acceptance internationally, scoping the work, of course, working backwards from where our customers and Discover's travel.\nSo that, you know, that's going to be a multi-year thing that, you know, that's a very important strategic imperative, I think, for us. And then the third one will be building the network brand. We plan to keep the name Discover for the network. We think it's a great brand, and we're really happy with the underlying reality of where acceptance is.\nWe know there are challenges in terms of consumer perception relative to those realities, and we know also we need to, in fact, build the international reality and then the brand perception that follows that. So those are the three strategic, the kind of, you know, obvious and strategic investment areas that we've been identifying really since the start of the deal. And back to your question about what do we think, how do you think, how do we think that fits in relative to efficiency ratio?\nWe, of course, on the Capital One side, have had a long, decade-long journey of continuing to improve operating efficiency ratio, and it's striking that that improvement has come even as we have continued to really ramp up investment in technology.\nNow, the way that paradox works is the technology is we're also investing more in technology and at the same time getting all the benefits on the efficiency side, both in terms of growth and in terms of cost that come from such an investment in technology. So the engine that drives operating efficiency ratio strategically will continue at Capital One, and it should continue with the combined institution as well. Now, then you ask, will the big three investment areas that we talk about, what will that do to operating?\nYou know, I think, you know, we always at Capital One have strategic imperatives that we're investing in. I think the overall picture of how Capital One's tech journey helps pay, you know, one of the important ways investors get paid is through operating efficiency improvement.\nI think that story, to me, stays strategically intact even as we have new investment areas because we'll also have new areas to capture synergy, growth opportunities, and things that really wouldn't have been possible for either of our companies alone. So thanks for the question. Operating efficiency is a really important way that we create value for investors, and in the long run, we continue to really see increased opportunities there.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from Terry Ma with Barclays. You may proceed.\n\nTerry Ma\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, thank you. Good evening. I wanted to follow up on credit first. It seems the trend that we've seen for the second derivative suggests there's room for that to continue to go lower. Is there some sort of framework to think about how much lower DQs can trend going forward? And is there anything in the near term that can cause the second derivative to inflect higher again? That's a follow-up.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One",
    "content3": "So, Terry, yes. So thank you for the question. Obviously, well, you know, since the founding of the company, we've always had our microscopes out looking at delinquencies because they're the single best predictor of credit of all the metrics. There are many metrics we watch, but that certainly is at the top of the list. And it is, I think, a really important, you know, it's certainly a gratifying milestone to where finally the second derivative, you know, crossed the horizontal axis effectively. And, you know, we certainly note that milestone. The first thing I would say about, as we all get our microscopes out to look at trends on a monthly basis, is to just talk about seasonality itself.\nYou know, we don't publish a seasonality curve per se because there's no precise benchmark with which to do it, but we certainly like to guide our investors about how we think about that. Seasonality for Capital One has tended to have more amplitude up and down over the course of a year than most other card players. And one might ask, why is that? You know, we believe that the biggest driver of seasonality, while there are several, the biggest driver of seasonality is tax refunds.\nAnd since we have a larger subprime book than most other players who really don't do subprime, those customers do tend to have higher seasonality in their credit performance than folks higher up market. So I think that's why Capital One has a greater seasonality effect.\nAnd for these customers in particular, tax refunds certainly, in terms of the monthly flow of cash, can end up creating something very nice that comes seasonally, and some of that makes its way into payments. Now, the changes in the tax withholding rules a few years ago led to fewer tax refunds and lower average refund payments. And the IRS was also paying certain refunds later than before. So, you know, that created a lot of noise. As I've been saying on recent calls, you'd think it would be easy to reestablish a seasonality curve, but while credit was normalizing so dramatically, it was sometimes swamping the seasonality effect.\nBut we created sort of this detrended seasonal curve from 2023 to the best we could, and that turned out to really be right on for 2024.\nIf I were to pull up and kind of summarize what we saw in 2024, 2024 settled out with fewer refunds paid than before the pandemic and about 25% lower total refund volume in real terms. Delinquencies moved with our new post-pandemic seasonality benchmarks, which have similar timing. But if I were to summarize what this new curve versus the one we've had for many years, it appears to have about 35% to 40% less amplitude in both directions than in the past. By the way, just a note for a second on auto, all of this also happens in auto seasonality, but in an even faster and more concentrated way.\nWe tend to see auto delinquencies at their seasonal low in Q1 and losses in Q2. And this year, that seasonal improvement was delayed a bit.\nSo that's the backdrop for now, you know, talking about the credit performance that we see. You know, if you start, Terry, with the sort of foundation that the consumer is in very good shape, the economy is in quite good shape overall, you know, one would certainly feel there's sort of a gravitational pull toward, you know, even better credit in the business. That is helped by the math associated with recoveries that our recovery rate has been very constant, but the recovery inventory that we have had to collect on got very small during the pandemic, and that has been replenishing. And so there's sort of a good guy gradually coming as recoveries fully restore.\nThen that really gets us to whatever effects there are of inflation, whatever effects there are on the consumers on the tails that are not in as good shape as sort of the averages that we all look at. What we see there is probably the way actually that the delayed charge-offs are actually playing out. They're probably playing out exactly through these consumers on the tail that, you know, are not; they're still struggling at the margin. So the credit metrics are looking great.\nWe have more solid benchmarks, Terry. The consumer is in a great place, but I think the, you know, the sort of bigger picture phenomenon of delayed charge-offs that, you know, still has, you know, intuitively, you know, to play out.\nSort of these effects going on at the tail puts us in a position not to be declaring that things are headed down from here, but it's certainly, you know, positive indicators that we see at the margin.\n\nTerry Ma\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Maybe just to talk about the auto business. You called out the loan book return to growth this quarter. So we expect you to lean into that and see loan growth accelerate. Maybe can you just talk about the overall profitability of the loans you're booking today versus what you've seen historically? Thank you.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nSo we feel very good about the auto business. You know, the credit performance is really striking. In fact, let's just savor something that is, I think, an outlier relative to the industry, but our auto delinquencies have remained consistently below pre-pandemic levels, and they've been lower on a year-over-year basis for the past two quarters.\nYou know, so the auto business is, you know, when you, there are many similar things about our card business and the auto business, but if you were to compare the two, the degree with which we sort of intervened in the business and trimmed credit around the edges, it might have been even more dramatic than the term around the edges, what we did in the auto business over the last, you know, over the last few years when we were worried about margin pressures in the business as prices were not being sort of passed, inflation pressures were not being passed through.\nSo there were margin pressures, there were declining vehicle values, and there was inflation of credit scores. So all of that led us to pull back. And each of those have sort of, you know, have been resolving themselves. You asked about margins.\nThe margins are sort of much more sort of normal in the business right now. The great inflation on credit scores is resolving itself as credit normalizes. Vehicle values, you know, we'll have to, you know, continue to keep an eye on those. But pulling way up on the shoulders of a lot of the changes that we have made and the technology that we have massively invested in this business, in underwriting, and in originations, and in our Auto Navigator platform, all of those put us in a position to feel bullish about leaning into auto.\nAnd, you know, I think we, you know, all the trends that we see on margins, credit, and competition, we feel good about, and that lines up to a story of leaning in on the auto business.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\n\nRick Shane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking my question. Hey, Rich, you did a great job laying out the factors that have caused the historical relationship between labor and credit to weaken. One of the factors you mentioned was the impact of rates. And that makes sense. Credit cards are, you know, one of the two largest classes of floating rate consumer debt. As we think about reversion to historical norms, should we expect charge-off rates to be structurally higher as long as interest rates are structurally higher, or is it possible to get back to historic loss rates in a high interest rate environment?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nYou know, it's a great question. It's interesting how, you know, all of us, you know, some of us were around doing similar things back when, well, Capital One, we hadn't even come up with the idea for Capital One back when inflation was really raging the last time around. So I think we would be speculating there. But I think, Rick, if we pull up and think about, you know, interest rates and their impact, you know, we think about, you know, how, you know, higher rates as a thing affect consumer credit. So debt servicing burdens for consumers, of course, can get affected.\nThe higher rates, as they work their way through consumer products gradually, but not immediately, sort of make their way into higher debt burdens. So, you know, you have mortgages that tend to have fixed rates. Auto loans have fixed rates.\nSo you have time delays before interest rates make their way to more pressure on consumers. But still, that effect obviously can continue. Most credit cards have variable APRs. So rising interest rates have, you know, tended to lead to somewhat higher minimum payments for consumers overall.\nBut if we pull up, I think that if wages, you know, if things stabilize and wages tend to keep up with inflation, I would think on the credit card side, it is plausible that charge-off rates could be very consistent with what they've been in a lower ambient rate environment. I think it gets very challenging when they're suddenly in motion up. But if they stabilize, I'm just speculating here at a moderate level that's higher than they were for the last couple of decades.\nI think as wages sort of stabilize to make real incomes move the way they should, I would think that credit numbers could be very consistent with historical patterns. I think the biggest driver of why they're not right now, if I were to speculate, probably number one on my list is really the just unprecedented number of years of which charge-offs with all the government stimulus and the forbearance that so many consumers got a lifeline, that those for whom that lifeline was a little more temporary in its benefit, some of those issues are still resolving themselves in terms of current charge-offs.\nIt's always an interesting thing to just take a look at the area under the curve in credit losses for, you know, if we look back over the last number of years and look at where credit losses would typically have been versus where they were, and you look at the area under the curve and ask yourself, well, what if all of that were delayed charge-offs? You know, you still have a majority of that area under the curve that would still have to play out in terms of delayed charge-offs. Now, we don't believe that anything close to all of the area under the curve would need to come on the other side.\nBut I think if, you know, a one-sentence soundbite to me of why in such a benign environment credit losses in businesses like credit cards are running higher than pre-pandemic, it is the delayed charge-off effect. And, you know, time should be our friend there. That should resolve itself over time. And there are a lot of positive factors behind that that are putting sort of good gravitational pull in the right direction in this industry.\n\nRick Shane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you very much, Rich.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGood evening. Just on the efficiency side, just to follow up to Ryan's line of questioning, I know you've guided to an operating efficiency ratio in the low 42% range for 2024. You know, does this 42% range remain the case as you look at 2025, or do you see a change to the upside or the downside off of this level? Thanks.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nSo, you know, we, I think the operating efficiency ratio has really been, you know, hopefully our investors share our excitement that, you know, this 700 basis points improvement that has happened since we began our tech transformation in 2013 has, you know, certainly been a great guide. There are multiple things behind that, but the biggest driver is the technology transformation.\nEven as we invest a lot, there are also ways to create savings, savings through, you know, reduced vendor costs, the really high cost of a lot of legacy technology, the benefits on the cloud, and really the ability to then, on the other side of the technology transformation, sort of rebuild the company and how it operates, you know, on a foundation of modern technology. So that's a journey that continues. So we see, you know, benefits there.\nI do want to say, though, also you have, you know, we've had a lot of beneficial increase in the ratio in the last couple of years. And, you know, I wouldn't want people to just draw, you know, take the curve and say, wow, that thing almost looks like it's accelerating down. And, you know, we don't give guidance in the short term.\nThere are a lot of things that very important investments we're making in the business. But what I like to do is really just point out that when we stand back over a longer time frame and look at the journey of Capital One, this has been a journey for which the efficiency was never the objective function. It was one of the many benefits of a tech transformation. But it's very gratifying to see that continue.\nBut I think the extrapolation from, you know, any one year to the next is not something that we would recommend. But it's a great long-term story.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGot it. Okay. Thanks, Rich. Then one quick second one. I assume this will be a pretty quick answer, but would be helpful if there's any; have you, you know, made any changes to your expected deal metrics tied to the Discover deal, either the 15% or greater EPS accretion in 2027, or the expense efficiencies, or the timing of adding the $175 billion in purchase volume to the network? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nHey, John. Yeah, what I'll say is it's two independent public companies. You know, we still are operating separately at this point. There are a number of variables that have moved and will continue to move between now and legal day one. So I'm not going to specifically comment on how any one of those, you know, variables or metrics are changing since the deal model. What I will say is, you know, we considered a wide range of outcomes across each of the line items. We continue to be comfortable with the estimates that we included in the deal model.\nWe feel very good both strategically and financially about the deal today as we did nearly a year ago when we announced it.\nAnd so as we get to legal day one and, you know, put the marks on the balance sheet, we'll provide updates on the relevant metrics at that point.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. You may proceed.\n\nMihir Bhatia\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to start first by just talking about NIM a little bit. You called out the Walmart impact this quarter. Any other callouts for the quarter? It just feels banks have been quite disciplined about lowering savings accounts interest rates as the Fed has reduced rates. Do you think that continues, or are you starting to see some demand for deposits or deposit competition ramping as we start contemplating loan growth here into 2025?\nI guess just related to that, if you could just talk about some of the puts and takes on NIM in 2025, that'd be great. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nSure, Mihir. Well, let me start with, you know, just reminding everyone that the one thing for sure we know is that in Q1, we have two fewer days. And so that will drive a roughly 15 basis points decrease in NIM. But if I kind of pull up and think beyond day count and look at a longer term, the longer term, a lot of the same forces that I've been describing for the last number of quarters as potential headwinds and tailwinds still exist today. So, you know, if you think about the headwinds, first of all, we're very modestly asset sensitive. And so you see a small decrease in NIM if rates continue to decrease. And you saw a little bit of that effect here in this quarter.\nThe other one you bring up, deposit beta, of course, in our rate risk modeling, we make assumptions around deposit betas. So to the extent that betas are lower or slower on the way down, you know, we would be a little bit more asset sensitive in that scenario. So those could be headwinds. But on the tailwind side, you know, the steepening yield curve relative to forwards would be a good guy if that persists.\nBut then probably the single biggest factor, and we've seen this play out over the last number of quarters, is the card growth. And card becoming a bigger percentage of our balance sheet, all else equal, is a pretty meaningful tailwind to NIM. So those are really the forces at play that I would highlight for you.\n\nMihir Bhatia\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Thank you. Then maybe just turning quickly to capital return. You've been doing $150 million in buybacks last few quarters. Your CET1 is up to 13.5. We understand with the deal, you have to get approval, right, for any capital actions. But the question is, two-part question there. A, is that approval keeping you a little conservative right now? And two, once the deal is approved, should we assume you'll be pretty aggressive in getting that down, or would it probably be fair to assume it stays elevated for a little bit, even post-deal as you get through the integration?\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nYeah, I'll wrap my answer to both of those questions into one for you, Mihir. You know, first of all, just, you know, go without saying, but I will say it, which is we clearly recognize that over the longer term, capital return is a key component of shareholder value creation. You've seen in prior periods, we've executed substantial share repurchases. In the near term, our pending deal is certainly influencing our approach to capital in a few ways. You know, as you said, we're still under regulatory pre-approval rules for each of our capital actions.\nSecond, we will need to run our own bottoms-up analyses as a combined company to just assess our view of the combined capital need. We continue to be two separate companies and therefore, you know, don't have the ability to do that analysis until after close.\nAnd then third, we will need the Fed's approval to go back to operating under the SCB framework. So, you know, if I pull up from there and put all of those together, I think it's likely we're going to stay at a slower repurchase pace until we resolve these factors. But after that, we'll have more flexibility.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research Securities. You may proceed.\n\nBill Carcache\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research Securities\n\nThank you. Good evening, Rich and Andrew. It was good to hear all the references to the Capital One Arena around the inauguration. I wanted to ask about your ability to better compete against the big banks in debit, assuming the Discover transaction closes as you expect. We know debit rewards for Visa Mastercard issuers essentially went away after the forced reduction in interchange under Dodd-Frank. But would reintroducing debit rewards be something that you'd consider given the greater flexibility that owning the Discover Network will afford you?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nHey, Bill. So obviously, a really key part of the deal is our excitement about getting the network and being able to add such a key dimension in vertically integrating our business. And, you know, we talk so much about credit cards all the time. The debit business is a really important one. And on little cat feet, Capital One has really been investing in our national banking business. So I, and by the way, having our own network will be valuable there and we'll be able to enjoy the vertically integrated economics of owning a network and, you know, and the scale that comes, of course, from pulling Discover and a bunch of Capital One's volume together.\nNow, I just want to pull back and just talk a little bit about Capital One's consumer banking strategy, and therefore, you know, and debit is, of course, right, you know, in the transaction business, right at the heart of that. If you pull way up and think about consumer banking, you know, way back to when banks began, you had banks with branches on every corner. And then in the last, you know, 15 or 20 years, there have been the evolution of direct banks. And they have been savings only, offering higher rates, and they have no physical distribution whatsoever.\nAnd we, of course, also through our acquisitions, have acquired several, you know, banks with branches on every corner. And we also acquired the nation's largest direct bank.\nAnd I announced at the time of that acquisition, this is a great financial trade, but it is also a strategic game changer for Capital One. That was back, you know, like 12 years ago. So since then, we have been very steadily, systematically, relentlessly, and patiently, if I could put so many adjectives on, adverbs on that, pursuing a business model that actually doesn't really exist right now because we have those two endpoints. But what we're really trying to do is build, in a sense, the bank of the future. And we believe that bank of the future is not just a direct bank. It's also not a bank with a branch on every corner. It is a bank with thin physical distribution.\nFor us, we've, you know, got branches, but then also in major metropolitan areas, we have put in cafés that are really basically, you know, less about coffee, but really more about being sort of a hybrid of a branch and a showroom for Capital One, and a place people can go and understand Capital One's there to help them and get a sense for really what this company is about and how it may be able to help them live their life more effectively. So this strategy has been about, you know, if we work backwards from what we believe is the bank of the future, from a distribution point of view, that's thin physical distribution and, you know, highlighted by these café showrooms.\nIt also, a very central part of that is digital capabilities that enable something that's a very, very difficult thing to do, which is to take, you know, just about everything that can be done in a branch and make it available digitally. Now, there's some things like safe deposit boxes. We haven't figured out how to create a digital safe deposit box for your valuables. And there are a few things that just, you know, you can't get there on a, you know, a digital basis. But as we've looked at this, we said, just pretty much, you know, virtually all the activities that people go to branches for.\nWe want to be able to deliver to them through our thin physical distribution plus massive full-service digital capability. And that's what we've been building over these years.\nAdditionally, it requires, you know, in order to, you know, generate business, we need great products. And, you know, we've been the only major bank out there with no fees, no minimums, and even a recent move of no overdraft fees. And those better deals come from having built the, in a sense, superior economics that come from this sort of physical distribution light model. Now, then you ask the question, so what will be our debit card strategy? You know, we haven't completed the deal. We haven't fully gone in on the other side of exactly seeing, you know, how things are working on the Discover side.\nBut we are very pleased with the results that we're having with our current strategy, including our current debit card strategy. And we are investing heavily to continue to grow that business.\nYou know, you look at the significant increase in marketing over the years. One of the drivers of this is that Capital One is building a national bank organically without a lot of physical distribution. To get there, it takes a lot of marketing. I think the best way to think about it is Discover gives a shot in the arm and a boost to a strategy we've been pursuing for more than a decade. The best way to think about it, I think, is picture just more of the same from Capital One with a little bit of an accelerator.\n\nBill Carcache\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research Securities\n\nI appreciate all the details, Rich. Thank you.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks. Rich, you talked about, you know, better growth in auto and card, talked about the high-end cards. Talk about the non-prime businesses in both card and auto, given the improved credit, how you're thinking about growth in those businesses in the coming quarters?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nMoshe, the word that I would use at the lower and the sort of lower end of the business, obviously there are parts of the market below, you know, below where we play. But if we sort of loosely call it at the lower end of the non-prime or subprime part of the marketplace, the word that I would use to describe it is stability. And stability of, let's look at the key aspects of that. On the consumer credit side, actually the first part of our business to normalize, really to settle out with respect to credit was the lower end of the market.\nThat's been very stable. Our originations in that segment and really pretty much across our business, the originations are coming in on top of each other for years. So that has a stability there as well. Competitively, it's a very competitive part.\nIt's a very competitive part of the business that has many, in addition to, you know, regular card players, many non-traditional players as well. So the competitive intensity is high, but we, you know, we watch it very carefully. And so with the stability of performance and the strength of the consumer, we, in both the card and the auto side of the business, continue to lean in in a very similar way that we have. Well, for card, it's just been very consistent for years.\nWith auto, we kind of pulled back quite a bit in that part of the business, and we're leaning in as we often have done historically. So we're leaning into both of them, and we're really pleased with the stability and strength of the metrics that underlie those businesses.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGot it. Thanks. Maybe just as a follow-up, when you think about reserve levels, given that, you know, you are seeing or likely to see some improvement in credit losses kind of on a, you know, core basis or like for like. And, you know, it sounds like the growth is probably, you know, growth that you have in the balance sheet is probably going to come in your lower loss categories, not the higher ones. You know, thoughts about the reserve level as we move forward?\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nSure. Moshe, so what's going to happen in future quarters starts with what happened this quarter. So I just want to reiterate a couple of the drivers of this quarter as a jumping-off point. As I said in the prepared remarks, you know, coverage was down 33 basis points by two things. The bigger effect being that we typically have seasonally higher balances in the Q4 that require very low levels of coverage, and that denominator effect from those balances puts downward pressure on coverage.\nThe other effect was that, you know, the allowance we needed for what I'll call non-seasonal growth was offset by favorable observed credit performance. And so we added $0 of allowance balance to the numerator, but the non-seasonal growth impacted the denominator.\nSo, you know, in the Q1, I just wanted to provide that backdrop to say the seasonal balances will run off. So there will be a corresponding upward pressure on coverage, all else equal from that effect. But beyond that, it's really going to come down to growth and our loss forecast and loss forecast specifically for the coverage. And to the extent that loss forecast improves, you know, changes in coverage could be modest in the near term as we just reflect the uncertainty of our projections in the allowance. But, you know, eventually the improved loss forecast is going to flow through the allowance and continue to bring the coverage ratio down as uncertainties become more certain.\nYou know, while the direction of travel would be down, the pace and timing is going to depend on a variety of factors, one of which will include the mix of businesses, as you say. You know, when it's denominated to the whole portfolio, the relative growth of different forecasted loss, you know, portions of the book aren't going to have material impact to coverage, just given that the new originations as a percentage of the overall book in any given quarter is relatively small. The only thing I also want to remind you of is, I know, you know, our investors look at history as a potential guide for levels of coverage.\nI just want to remind you that, you know, we called out the roughly 50 basis points of impact to coverage from the termination of the loss-sharing agreement with Walmart.\nSo that created, you know, a step function change in coverage relative to our prior history as well.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\n\nDon Fandetti\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nYes, Rich. Your credit card purchase volume growth on a like account basis has picked up. I'm just trying to get a sense if this is a Q4 blip, or are you thinking that the consumer is actually more confident here after the election? Are you seeing that same improvement in consumer and small business as well?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nWell, we have, if we think about our purchase volume, our growth and overall purchase volume continues to be driven by growth in our branded card customer base. And the branded card includes, you know, both our consumer and our small business. You know, the growth that you see and that we've seen for several years now is certainly a thing powering. It has been a strength in originations and some strength in originations at the higher end of the market. But the other way to think about your question is at a customer level, what, you know, on a per-customer basis, what's been happening to spend growth.\nAnd even as our spend metrics were growing overall, the spend growth per customer in our consumer business have been largely, you know, they had been largely flat through 2023 and really the first half of 2024.\nThey started to pick up midway through last year and they grew further in Q4. I don't have in front of me the small business card numbers. They're embedded in the numbers that I gave you. The fact that we have seen spend per customer finally pick up here is striking. Whether it will continue and exactly what's driving it is hard to say, but I did want to point out that positive trajectory as the year finished off.\n\nDon Fandetti\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Andrew, you touched on this, but your 2024 vintage, can you talk a little bit about how you're feeling, how you're seeing that shape up in terms of credit performance? I've seen some industry data that, you know, shows delinquencies are still pretty high for 2024.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nYeah, Don, why don't I take that? So recent originations in our card business, we continue to see stability in the performance of our originations. It's really striking here. We've been calling this out consistently over the past few years. Vintage over vintage, we're seeing mostly stable risk levels over time. And also striking is our overall front book of new origination vintages continues to perform in line with pre-pandemic vintages. Now, when you compare with pre-pandemic vintages, you can't look at 2019 because 2019 very quickly got sort of corrupted by the pandemic. So we're looking at 2017 and 2018 when we make these comparisons.\nSo from a Capital One point of view, I think this stability in origination performance and, you know, quarter over quarter, and the consistency with pre-pandemic is the result of our intervention to deal with, you know, inflated credit scores and the high level of industry supplies that were flooding particularly the subprime marketplace back there. So we trimmed around the edges and continued to very closely watch the origination vintages. That has led to a sustained stability on the part of Capital One and some of our most recent vintages.\nNow, again, we're still looking, you got to look like, you know, six months in the rearview mirror to see much, but we continue to see some very positive results there. We also have looked at industry data that shows some gapping out in vintages over the last couple of years.\nSo I think the industry effect is not probably consistent with what we have described. And if I were to, you know, explain why, because I think they're, you know, very capable companies doing this, I think the, I'm not sure that most of the industry adjusted for inflated credit scores. And, you know, we intervened on our models with a belief that, you know, the university was suddenly giving out A's that should be B's basically. And so we intervened and then kept validating along the way.\nBut for a while, we didn't have validation. We just intervened because we believed it was the right thing to do. So I think what we have, what has been seen, if you look at just overall industry originations is, as you say, some gapping out. And I think that would be the biggest driver.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. You may proceed.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, KBW\n\nThank you. I guess, Rich, just one more on the deal. Given the timeline that you've outlined early this year, is it fair to assume like everything's going pretty smoothly in terms of the regulatory approval process and there hasn't been any surprises? I'm also wondering, sort of, where you guys are in terms of the integration efforts and how much work has been done there.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nOkay. Yeah. So no, the approval process continues to move forward. We've made substantial progress in the recent months. We remain actively engaged with the Fed and the OCC about our merger applications. It is the Fed and the OCC who ultimately decide on our merger application. Late last year, we received approval from the Delaware State Bank Commissioner, which we needed because Discover is a state chartered bank. We, of course, had the, you know, the big public hearing in July, and that went very well, we feel.\nEarlier this month, of course, we finalized a joint proxy statement with the SEC setting up a 18 February shareholder vote. So that was good progress finally there. We are also engaged with the Justice Department as they play a key role in advising the Fed and the OCC on the competitive aspects of the deal.\nAnd we continue to believe that this transaction is both pro-competitive and pro-consumer, bringing our best-in-class products and services to a broader set of consumers, small businesses, and really enhancing opportunities and benefits for merchants as well. So pulling way up, it's certainly, you know, the deal process is a long labor, but we remained well positioned to get approval of the deal early this year. And, you know, I'm really proud of the work everyone is doing here. And we look forward to, you know, getting this over the goal line.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, KBW\n\nOkay. Just to follow up on a question Ryan asked some time ago on sort of when you put the companies together and the efficiencies and sort of the investments that need to be made. I guess when you put the two companies together, the efficiency ratio actually goes down. And obviously, there's a lot of synergies both on revenues and expenses. Do you think those are sufficient enough to sort of accomplish? I'm just trying the question again. Do you think those are sufficient enough to make all of the investments that you sort of outlined, or do you think that there's others that you might have to make as you, you know, peel the onion a little bit when you have the company?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nSo, you know, I don't think we're in a position to. It's not just because we, you know, want to be coy about it. We're not in a different place than we were at the time we announced the deal. You know, we should point out that we are working really hard preparing for integration, but we are still separate companies. Discover is working incredibly hard and working on their compliance. I know they're doing preparations for integration as well. We certainly are. We're not getting an inside view of their numbers, their performance, their business model. So, you know, we're mostly sort of where we were at the, you know, at the outset.\nBut if we pull up to your point, so Discover, you know, operated, operates with a significantly lower operating efficiency ratio than Capital One.\nThat's certainly a good thing for the combined company. I think it is also the case that the, you know, I think Discover has had a heritage of probably less investment in certain areas than Capital One. And in a few cases, they're sort of making up for lost time there. But I think, you know, having not seen on the other side, we assume that there are some areas that, you know, we will, and we've assumed this from the beginning, we're going to need to step up the investments in.\nObviously, on the risk management side, there's a lot of investment to be done. Whether it is how what ultimately needs to be done compares with what they're investing in, all of that, you know, remains to be seen. We obviously had assumptions in our deal model about leaning in on that.\nBut what we get, so there's going to be a lot of effects that are all, you know, pretty significant, that just go in different directions. A company with an amazing efficiency ratio, a company that's probably underinvested in a number of areas that, relative to Capital One, and we would shore up some of those investments. We also get a lot of synergy that comes from bringing, you know, overlapping businesses together. That's a very strong effect. And then these three, the investment areas, the three that we're pointing out, we are talking about, you know, investing in those at a level that's a lot different than what Discover has done traditionally.\nObviously, the risk management one, we've all talked about that, and they're leaning in hard now.\nOn international acceptance, they certainly, again, I'm amazed with their not that great scale, what they've done, but we would expect to invest at a higher level than they have there. And in terms of the network brand relative to, I want to just make a comment about the network brand and some of this other investment. It is, we have sloped, we have taken our card business and sloped the business that we think most naturally and easily can go to the Discover Network. And it involves, you know, folks that aren't big international travelers, for example. So we've sloped the work.\nThere is, we think it's very straightforward to move this business, front book and back book business, to Discover.\nSome of these investments that I'm talking about leaning into are particularly important for the longer-term opportunity of being able to move more business than what we put into our deal model. And again, in doing that, we, you know, we sloped, we took our whole customer base and imagined sort of sloping it in terms of what part of the business fits most naturally within the context of the capabilities and the brand of Discover's network. And then as we want to move more, we're going to need, you know, the bar to be raised relative to acceptance and brand.\nAnd that's why I think, you know, these other investments we're talking about will be multi-year. They'll be over time, and there will be things that help make the deal pay off even more so in the longer term.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Hecht\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGood afternoon, guys, and thanks for fitting me in here. First question, just thinking about the mix of the overall consumer book. I mean, you've got some new cards like the VentureOne and Quicksilver, you know, and some of those, you know, are attractive to different demographic groups. And then you've got the sub-prime mix, and then you've got auto. Where do we see, just given kind of inbound customer mix, where do we see that going this year as a standalone business? And then, Rich, do you have any comments of what the total portfolio might look like, assuming the combination with Discover?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nYes. So thank you, John. So let me take Discover just in a minute. So if you pull way up on Capital One for, you know, a long, long time, Capital One has been a sort of a full spectrum player. We have had for several decades, we have had a subprime business that, you know, is tailor-made for the information-based strategy we have because it's all about surviving and winning on the credit side of the business. But also in that business, we've also very, very much focused relative to others who play in the space to deal with exceptionally good deals. It's not just about sort of surviving on the credit side, but really giving great deals, helping people use credit wisely.\nIn fact, really, I think the deals that we're offering are very, very simple and profoundly better than a lot of the deals that are available in the marketplace. So that business is a very stable part of what we do at Capital One. You know, we continue to lean into that. The, probably, the most dramatic thing that's been happening in the last decade in Capital One's card business is, as you reference, the quest toward the top of the market. That is a journey that, you know, as far out as we can see, we will continue to lean into that because there is so much opportunity at the top of the market.\nAnd obviously, it takes a lot of investment, but the key indicator to us is that when we stratify out the segments of our business by spend levels, the part that's growing the fastest consistently year after year at Capital One is the heaviest spenders. And there's just so much upside north of where we are. We will continue to invest in that. Now, if you stand back, just think about our card business. While our subprime business has been going along and we keep leaning into that, there has been a gradual mix shift upmarket for the company. And even within each segment, within the sort of the subprime book, the sort of the prime book, and certainly the top of the market, there has been a gradual mix change with a spender-first philosophy that permeates our business.\nSo that, and some of that you can see in just some of the structural changes in the payment rates at Capital One. So I believe that what you see and what you have seen for a number of, for many years, is a good prognosticator of probably how the future of legacy Capital One would likely go, meaning continued leaning in across the spectrum, but differentially an awful lot of investment toward the top of the market and the most growth opportunity there. Now, let me turn to Discover. Discover, interestingly, has taken a very different approach than Capital One. While we have taken a very broad approach playing in all parts of the market, Discover has had a very focused strategy on the prime part of the business. And they've done a very, very good job there. And we certainly always admired them from the outside.\nSo, you know, we will be bringing into our company a significant increase in that portion of the market, which probably differentially got a little less emphasis, if anything. It's not like we weren't playing there, but if anything, we had a greater emphasis, probably north and south of that part of the business. But so from a mixed point of view, we certainly, we will be bringing in a business that's very homogeneous relative to the very heterogeneous business that we have. And then on the other side of all of that, I think that we will, if I were to summarize our strategy, it will be to continue everything we were doing as Capital One because we're getting a lot of traction in that.\nAnd then making very sure that we don't crush the butterfly of this beautiful business model that Discover has in the prime part of the market, but that we go in there and, while yes, you know, integrating things like technology, some of the risk management processes, and a lot of things, do everything that we can to make sure that we don't directly or even unwittingly sort of."

Welcome to the Capital One Q2 2024 Earnings Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nThanks very much, Josh, and welcome everyone to Capital One's Q2 2024 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and the financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our Q2 2024 results. With me this evening are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Andrew Young, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Andrew will walk you through the presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors, then click on Quarterly Earnings Release.\nPlease note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements, information regarding Capital One's financial performance, and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials. Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, and for more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-Looking Information in the earnings release presentation, and the Risk Factors section in our annual and quarterly reports accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC. With that done, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nThanks Jeff and good afternoon everyone. I will start on slide three of tonight's presentation. In the Q2, Capital One earned $597 million or $1.38 per diluted common share. Included in the results for the quarter were adjusting items related to the Walmart partnership termination, Discover integration costs, and an accrual for updated estimate of the FDIC's special assessment. Net of these adjusting items, Q2 earnings per share were $3.14.\nRelative to the prior quarter period, ending loans held for investment increased 1% while average loans were flat. Ending deposits were flat versus last quarter while average deposits increased 1%.\nOur percentage of FDIC insured deposits increased 1 percentage point to 83% of total deposits.\nPre-provision earnings in the Q2 increased 7% from the Q1. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 1% driven by higher net interest and non-interest income, while non-interest expense decreased 4% driven by a decline in operating expense.\nOur provision for credit losses was $3.9 billion in the quarter. The $1.2 billion increase in provision relative to the prior quarter was almost entirely driven by higher allowance. Included in the Q2 was an $826 million allowance build from the elimination of the loss sharing provisions that occurred within the termination of the Walmart partnership.\nThe remaining quarter over quarter provision increase was driven by a $353 million higher net reserve build and a $28 million increase in net charge-offs. Turning to slide four, I will cover the allowance in greater detail.\nWe built $1.3 billion in allowance this quarter. The allowance balance now stands at $16.6 billion. Our total portfolio coverage ratio increased 35 basis points to 5.23%.\nThe increase in this quarter's allowance and coverage ratio was largely driven by a build in our card segment. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on slide five.\nIn our domestic card business, the allowance coverage ratio increased by 69 basis points to 8.54%. The substantial majority of the increase in coverage was driven by the impact of the termination of the Walmart loss sharing agreement.\nIn our consumer banking segment, the allowance decreased by $23 million, resulting in a five basis points decrease to the coverage ratio.\nAnd finally, our commercial banking allowance increased by $6 million. Coverage ratio remained essentially flat at 1.74%. Turning to page six, I'll now discuss liquidity.\nTotal liquidity reserves in the quarter decreased about $5 billion to approximately $123 billion.\nOur cash position ended the quarter at approximately $45 billion, down about $6 billion from the prior quarter. The decrease was driven by wholesale funding maturities, loan growth, and declines in our commercial deposits, partially offset by deposit growth in our retail banking business.\nYou can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during Q2 was 155%, down from 164% in Q1.\nTurning to page seven, I'll cover our net interest margin.\nOur Q2 net interest margin was 6.7%, 1 basis point higher than last quarter and 22 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The relatively flat quarter over quarter NIM was the result of largely offsetting factors. NIM in the quarter benefited from the termination of the revenue sharing agreement with Walmart as well as modestly higher yields in the auto business.\nThese two factors were roughly offset by the seasonal effects on yield in the card portfolio and a slight increase in the rate paid on retail deposits.\nTurning to slide eight, I will end by discussing our capital position.\nOur Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 13.2%, 10 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was largely offset by the impact of dividends and $150 million of share repurchases. During the quarter, the Federal Reserve released the results of their stress test. Our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement is 5.5%, resulting in a CET1 requirement of 10%.\nHowever, as we disclosed in our last 10Q, the announcement of the acquisition of Discover constituted a material business change. As a result, we are subject to the Federal Reserve's preapproval of our capital actions until the merger approval process has concluded. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nThanks Andrew and good evening everyone. Slide 10 shows Q2 results in our credit card business.\nCredit card segment results are largely a turning to our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on slide 11.\nIn Q2, our domestic card business delivered another quarter of strong results as we continued to invest in flagship products and exceptional customer experiences to grow our franchise year over year. Purchase volume growth for the quarter was 5%. Ending loan balances increased $11.1 billion, or about 8%, year over year. Average loans also increased about 8%, and Q2 revenue was up 9% driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin for the quarter remained strong at 17.9%. The revenue margin includes a positive impact of about 18 basis points resulting from the partial quarter effect of the end of the Walmart revenue sharing agreement. The charge off rate for the quarter was 6.05%.\nThe partial quarter impact of the end of the Walmart loss sharing agreement increased the quarterly charge-off rate by 19 basis points. Excluding this impact, the charge-off rate for the quarter would have been 5.86%, up 148 basis points year over year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 4.14%, up 40 basis points from the prior year. As a reminder, the end of the Walmart loss sharing agreement did not have a meaningful impact on delinquency rate.\nThe pace of year-over-year increases in both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate has been steadily declining for several quarters and continued to shrink in Q2. On a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate excluding the Walmart impact was down 8 basis points and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 34 basis points.\nDomestic card noninterest expense was up 5% compared to the Q2 of 2023, primarily driven by higher marketing expense. Total company marketing expense in the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 20% year over year. Our choices in domestic card are the biggest driver of total company marketing.\nWe continue to see compelling growth opportunities in our domestic card business our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business.\nCompared to Q2 2023. Domestic card marketing in the quarter included increased marketing to grow originations the top of the marketplace, higher media spend, and iIncreased investment in differentiated customer experiences like our travel portal, airport lounges, and Capital One Shopping.\nSlide 12 shows Q2 results for our consumer banking business after returning to positive growth last quarter. Auto originations were up 18% year over year in Q2. Consumer banking ending loans were down $1.6 billion, or 2% year over year, and average loans were down 3% on a linked quarter basis. Ending loans were up 1% and average loans were flat compared to a year ago. Quarter-ending consumer deposits were up about 7% and average deposits were up 5%. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter was down about 9% year over year, largely driven by higher deposit costs and lower average loans compared to the prior year quarter\nNon-interest expense was up about 2% compared to Q2 of 2023, driven by an increase in marketing to support our national digital bank.\nThe auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.81%, up 41 basis points year over year. The 30 plus delinquency rate was 5.67%, up 29 basis points year over year. Largely as the result of our choice to tighten credit and pull back in 2022.\nAuto charge-offs have been strong and stable.\nSlide 13 shows Q2 results for our commercial banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances decreased about 1%.\nAverage loans were also down about 1%. The modest declines are largely the result of choices we made in 2023 to tighten credit. Ending deposits were down about 6% from the linked quarter. Average deposits were down about 3%. The declines are largely driven by our continued choices to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances.\nQ2 revenue was essentially flat from the linked quarter and non-interest expense was lower by about 6%. The commercial banking annualized net charge-off rate for Q2 increased 2% basis points from the sequential quarter to 0.15%. The commercial banking criticized performing loan rate was 8.62%, up 23 basis points compared the last quarter.\nThe criticized non-performing loan rate increased 18 basis points to 1.46%.\nIn closing, we continued to deliver strong results in the Q2. We delivered another quarter of top line growth in domestic card loans, purchase volume, and revenue and a second consecutive quarter of year over year growth in auto origination. Consumer credit trends continued to show stability and our operating efficiency ratio improved. We had guided to 2024 annual operating efficiency Ratio net of adjustments to be flat to modestly down compared to 2023 assuming the CFPB Late Fee rule takes effect in October and we're on a very consistent path with what we expected when we gave that guidance.\nIf the implementation of the rule is delayed, that would be a tailwind to 2024 annual operating efficiency ratio. One thing that has changed is the Walmart relationship. Our partnership ended in Q2, which will increase charge-off rates but have a positive impact on operating efficiency ratio. Including the Walmart impact. We expect full year 2024 operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments to be modestly down compared to 2023.\nWe continue to lean into marketing to grow and to further strengthen our franchise. In the domestic card business. We continue to get traction in originations across our products and channels and our origination opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation, which enables us to leverage machine learning at scale to identify the most attractive growth opportunities and customize our marketing offers. We're also getting traction in building our franchise at the top of the market with heavy spenders.\nIt is not lost on us that competitive intensity and marketing levels are increasing at the very top of the market, and we know we have important investments to make. We continue to be pleased to see our investments pay off in customer and spend growth, and returns, and we're building an enduring franchise with annuity-like revenue streams, very low losses, and very low attrition in consumer banking. Our modern technology and leading digital capabilities are powering our digital-first national banking strategy. And we're leaning even harder into marketing to grow our national checking franchise.\nWhich has had industry-leading pricing with no fees, and industry-leading customer satisfaction. Pulling up marketing is a key driver of current and future growth and value creation across the company, and we're leaning hard into our marketing investments. We expect total company marketing in the second half of 2024 to be meaningfully higher than the first half, similar to the pattern we saw last year.\nWe are all in and working hard to complete the Discover acquisition. Our applications for regulatory approval are in process and we're fully mobilized to plan and deliver a successful integration.\nWe continue to expect that we'll be in a position to complete the acquisition late this year or early next year, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. The combination of Capital One and Discover creates game changing strategic opportunities.\nThe Discover Payments Network platform positions Capital One as a more diversified, vertically integrated global Payments platform and adding Capital One's debit spending and a growing portion of our credit card purchase volume to the Discover Network will add significant scale, increasing the network's value to merchants, small businesses, and consumers and driving enhanced networks growth in credit cards and consumer banking. We're bringing together proven franchises with complementary strategies, and a shared focus on the customer, and we will be able to leverage and scale the benefits of our 11-year technology transformation across every business and the network. Pulling way up the acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity.\nIt will create a consumer banking and global payments platform with unique capabilities, modern technology, powerful brands, and a franchise of more than 100 million customers. It delivers compelling financial results and offers the potential to create significant value for merchants and customers.\nNow we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nThanks Rich. We'll now start the Q and A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow up. If you have any follow up questions after the Q and A session, the investor relations team will be available after the call. Josh, please start the Q and A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. To ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again.\nOne moment for questions. Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. You may proceed.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nThanks, Rich. Andrew, just looking at the credit metrics, as Rich mentioned, it seems like the trends are pretty favorable. I mean, in most segments things are improving, if not stable. And then US Card, there's an improving trend in that second derivative. I'm just curious how we should think about reserve rate going forward because I think even excluding the Walmart impact, the reserve rate went higher.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nSure, Sanjay. Well, let me start by covering this quarter's allowance and then I'll talk about the future. So in the quarter, as you said, first we had the effect of Walmart. The $826 million bill that we spelled out as an adjusting item. We also reserved for the growth we saw in the quarter. You know, beyond that coverage in card as you referenced grew, I think it was just over 10 basis points, which is a little over 1% of the allowance balance. And so as part of that process, each quarter not only are we, you know, rolling forward our baseline forecast, but we're also looking at, you know, a range of macroeconomic and consumer behavior uncertainties, including, you know, things like the changing seasonal customer behavior we talked about last quarter.\nSo as a result, in this quarter, we increased the qualitative factors to reflect those uncertainties. That's what drove the modest increase in coverage this quarter. As I look ahead and, you know, talking conceptually here, but in a period where projected loss rates in future quarters are projected to stabilize and ultimately decline and might indicate decline in the coverage ratio, I would say you could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat for some period of time as we incorporate the uncertainty of those future projections into the allowance. In a period where forecasted losses are rising, you know, we're quick to incorporate those higher forecasted losses and also potentially add qualitative factors for uncertainty like you saw early in the pandemic. But I would say it is unlikely to be symmetric on the way down.\nAnd so, you know, eventually the projected, you know, stabilizing and ultimately lower losses will flow through the allowance, particularly as the uncertainties around that forecast become more certain. But, you know, at this point, I'm not going to be in the business of forecasting when that's actually going to take place for us.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nGot it. And then, Rich, maybe you could just talk about the consumer and sort of the uncertainties there. Is there any discernible, like change that you've seen since the last quarter in terms of the state of the consumer? We've obviously seen the spending trend sort of slow somewhat across the industry. But anything else to sort of point out.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nSanjay? I think what we see is something that's very stable. You know, the US consumer remains a source of strength in the overall economy. Of course, the labor market remains strikingly resilient.\nRising incomes have kept consumer debt servicing burdens relatively low by historical standards, despite high interest rates.\nYou know, when we look at our customers, you know, we see that on average they have higher bank balances than before the pandemic and this is true across income levels.\nYou know, on the other hand, inflation shrank real incomes for almost two years and we've only recently seen real wage growth turn positive again. And, you know, in this high interest rate environment, the cost of new borrowing has gone up in every major asset class. Mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. So we'll obviously keep an eye on that. And I think at the margin, these effects are almost certainly stretching some consumers financially. But on the whole, I'd say consumers are in reasonably good shape relative to most historical benchmarks. And you know, as our credit numbers came in.\n\nOperator\n\nThe person you're trying to reach is not available. At the tone, please record your message. When you have finished recording.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nSorry, can you hear me? Can you still hear me?\nYou can hear me?\nOkay, I just had some cross message coming in on my phone.\nBut with respect to credit. We were very pleased with credit performance in the quarter. You know, we had talked a bit about seasonality. Maybe people want to ask question about that, but we saw basically pulling up. We see things settling out nicely in the card business and things are very strong in the auto business.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. You may proceed.\n\nMihir Bhatia\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just turning to NIM for a second. With the Fed or at least expectations for rate cuts coming into view, can you just comment on the current backdrop for deposit competition and how do you expect deposit betas to trend during the early stages of the Fed rate cutting cycle?\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nSure. Mihir. What we've seen, at least within our walls, and you saw the evidence of it this quarter, in a quarter where seasonally you typically see a decline in deposit balances. Looking at H.8 data, we saw four, I think it was $4 billion of growth. We've been quite pleased over the course of the last couple of years with all of the investments we've made over many years in building a deposit franchise, and are certainly benefiting from that. And so with respect to the beta going forward, you know, first, looking at what we saw in the upcycle here, you know, the total cumulative beta that we've seen in this cycle this quarter, I think cumulatively was 62%.\nAssuming that the Fed's next move is to bring rates down, it's hard to precisely predict what's going to happen to deposit costs and therefore betas, and in particular the pace of those declines. Because, you know, market dynamics, competitive pricing actions, other actions related to companies looking to potentially preserve NIM, that's going to drive betas in the future cycle. But I think you get a pretty good sense for our pricing and mix based on what you saw in the up cycle, and within that backdrop that I just described, that's going to influence what happens to our beta on the way down.\n\nMihir Bhatia\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThat's helpful, thank you. Then just switching back to the health of the customer overall as you look across your portfolio. You know, we've heard a little bit of talk about people pulling back, particularly on discretionary spend and low income cohorts, etc. Is that a dynamic you are also seeing when you look at your customer base? And then relatedly, you know, Rich mentioned, how pleased he is with the progress you're making on the higher income side, if you will, on the big, on the transactor, in that high end transactor balance side. I was just wondering how does that change your portfolio as you think about it like over the next few years as you grow that book further?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nYes. Well, thank you so much. Just with respect to spending, we see pretty proportional movements in discretionary versus non discretionary spending. Nothing really striking there. When we look at the portfolio spending metrics, you know.\nThe spend per customer is really pretty flat. You know, when you see spend growth at a company like Capital One, the purchase volume growth is really being driven by, you know, the new accounts. So things are really pretty stable. Flat and stable. Healthy, but pretty flat on a per customer basis. With respect to the question about the gradual transition of our portfolio to a higher end customer, let me just pull up and talk about that. We have, you know, for decades been a company that sort of serves the mass market really from the top of the credit spectrum through to.\nYou know, even down to some subprime customers. We have continued very consistently with this strategy probably the most striking thing, though, that's happened over the last 10 or 14 years, I guess 14 years ago, is when we launched the Venture Card.\nWe have systematically leaned into going after the top of the market, not leaving the other behind, but really as an additive strategy. And we have continued through our marketing and through the products that we're offering to just keep moving higher and higher in terms of the target customers and the traction that we're getting.\nBy the way, we continue even as we're growing purchase volume overall, where we see the highest growth rates in.\nPurchase volume are as we go higher in the market. So we're very happy about that. And when we think about the portfolio effects that happened there, this is one thing that we see is that payment rates have along that journey gone up quite a bit at Capital One. And when we look to see our payment rates coming back to where they were pre-pandemic, they sort of, you know, they probably just aren't going to return all the way because that would be a reflection of the portfolio shift. We just in general have had the kind of mix shift that you'd expect with you know, higher payment rates.\nJust higher levels of spend, higher spend rates in the business. That's been very successful. But from an outstandings point of view, it doesn't. The top of the market business doesn't have that much impact on outstandings because these folks generally pay in full.\nSo you know, when you see the outstandings movement of Capital One, it's pretty consistently driven by the mass market part of our business. It's just that inside some of the portfolio metrics are moving because of the mix shift toward more spenders.\n\nMihir Bhatia\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\n\nRick Shane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking my question this afternoon. Look, given the breadth of your reach across the consumer income levels, can you talk a little bit about sort of any patterns that you're seeing? We've heard, for example, some slowdown in spending for lower income consumers. I'm curious particularly you'd made a comment earlier in the quarter about an increase in minimum payment rates. I'm curious if you're seeing anything in terms of payment behavior that we should consider by income level?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nYeah. Okay, so let's just pull up for a minute on just talking about how the subprime consumer is holding up. So you know, way back in the global financial crisis we observed that credit metrics in subprime moved earlier in both directions. Subprime also worsened less on a percentage basis than prime. But of course, in absolute deltas, it still moved more. In the pandemic, subprime credit moved more and more quickly than prime. It normalized more quickly and appears to be stable and appeared basically to stabilize sooner as well. And you know, that's in the context of lower income consumers seeing disproportionate benefits of government aid and, you know, forbearance on financial products and then the unwinding of that over time. And so subprime is of course not synonymous with lower income, although they're correlated and we saw these effects across credit.\nYou know, both in talking about the credit spectrum and also the income gradient. You know, on the other hand, just a couple of other effects just on the credit side that have happened over the recent years.\nSubprime consumers have been subject to more iIndustry credit supply, including fintech competition during and after the pandemic. That's been something we've always kept a close eye on and you know, worried about whether that was going to disproportionately impact the credit performance of subprime customers. I don't really. I mean, given the overall pretty strong performance in subprime, I think we haven't seen that effect too much.\nAnother thing to point out is that income growth has been consistently higher for lower income consumers over the past several years. This is the opposite of what we saw during and after the global financial crisis. But while no two cycles are alike, I think again we're seeing that subprime consumers and lower income consumers, again, they're not the same thing, but they tend to move earlier, but not necessarily more than the overall market.\nLet's talk a little bit about payment rates. So throughout the course of the pandemic, payment rates increased not only for us, but across the industry. More recently, payment rates have drifted down from pandemic highs as the effects of stimulus have waned.\nThe payment rates generally, we have seen this effect. So the effect that we've seen of payment rates going down relative to where they were, you know, one to two years ago, relative to their peak, basically.\nIn every part of our business, they have come down but are still above where they were pre-pandemic. Again, I think part of that is the mix effect that we talked about in the prior question. There's a mix effect not only across our whole portfolio, but even within the segments of our portfolio. We've just had more emphasis on the spender side versus the revolver side internally. So I think you see some of that showing up in the metrics. One other thing I want to say is that.\nI talk about your question about minimum payments. So we have, simultaneously, we're sort of seeing an effect where payment rates, while they're going down, continue to be well above pre-pandemic levels, even as minimum, the percentage of customers paying minimum payments. This, by the way, is not a subprime effect. This is a portfolio effect. I'm talking about the percent of customers paying minimum payments is also somewhat above pre-pandemic levels. Now, it seems a little odd to have both of those effects happening at the same time, but I think in many ways this is a very natural way that normalization is happening. You've heard us talk for a long time now about what we call the delayed charge-off effect in consumer credit that so many customers got stimulus and forbearance that I think a lot of people who otherwise would have charged off were able to avoid that charge off. Many, hopefully, were able to permanently avoid that. But for some, we have believed it was more of a deferral of an inevitability.\nThis phenomenon of delayed charge-offs, which can't be separately measured, we believe is a driving factor behind why credit has been settling out higher than pre-pandemic because I think there's just a delayed charge-off effect for some of these customers who otherwise would have charged off earlier. And that then would be consistent with a very healthy consumer payment rate generally, even being higher than pre-pandemic. But there is a tail of consumers paying a higher percentage on minimum payments, and some of them going through a charge-off that might have otherwise happened a few years earlier.\n\nRick Shane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon, Rich.\nSo maybe to ask about marketing. So I think the guide that you provided said around $2.6 billion roughly of marketing spend in the second half and you talked a little bit about the competitive intensity in the top of the market is increasing. Can you maybe just talk about how much the increase in marketing is being driven by the investing more to acquire more customers versus competition, pushing up the cost to acquire? And then just given what you just talked about around low end consumers, are you pulling back anywhere to cover the increased cost of acquiring?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nRyan, our comments about the competitive intensity. Let me just elaborate a little bit more about that. The card business is very competitively intense. You know, across the spectrum it's been consistently intense. Competition has, you know, competition in things like rewards have certainly heated up over the last couple of years.\nThe thing that I was pointing out is just something that again is not something that is like the realization of the last month or so. It's a phenomenon we've seen from some for some time.\nBut it is striking, which is at the very top of the market.\nWe are seeing you know, for the, you know, especially couple of competitors that we have the most intense play at the very top of the market. You can just absolutely see they are stepping up, investing more in lounges, in experiences in dining, investing in companies marketing levels.\nI'm sure all the investors can see it. We can all see it and they talk about it, and it's not lost on us that, you know, these are strong competitors and we certainly, you know, have.\nYou know, we already have had very important, you know investment plans in these areas and we note that others are investing heavily too. But with respect to the, let me just now kind of pull up now and just talk about the marketing sort of where we are from a marketing point of view.\nWe continue to see great opportunities and really, across our businesses, we remain very excited about the success of our origination activities, especially in our card products and channels. Of course what's happening in the bank.\nThe two big areas that are driven by marketing spend, you know. This continues to be powered by our technology transformation. Just to savor a little bit because we often point at that, why does the technology transformation help here?\nIt gives us the ability to leverage more and more data and machine learning models to identify the most attractive growth opportunities. It allows us to increasingly tailor our solutions to down to the individual customer level to ensure that we're meeting them, right where we are. So, kind of, the first point I would say, and key reason we're leaning into the marketing is we're getting a lot of traction and our tech transformation is certainly helping to power more opportunities.\nSecondly, we continue to expand on our. success in building a franchise at the top of the market and with heavy spenders and this quest. Well, for years we've been talking about you know, going after the top of the market. Every year as we get more traction we reach just a little bit higher. These customers are very attractive. In addition to the obvious spend growth they generate strong revenue, very low losses, low attrition.\nThe business helps elevate our brand really across the company. Now it's also something that we've known all along is that it's expensive and requires quite a bit of investment to build a business at the top of the market, you know, in the form of upfront costs and also in the form of a sustained commitment to customer benefits, experiences, and building a brand. So yeah, you have early spend bonuses that are important cost of doing business that shows up in the marketing line item.\nBrand makes a huge difference. Brand of course requires a long-term commitment to build as we continue to move up the market, we are moving increasingly into areas where consumers are looking for exclusive services and experiences that aren't available in the general marketplaces, such as places such as airport lounges and access to select properties and iconic experiences.\nSo we've seen at the top of the market, our two biggest competitors really lean in here.\nWe, you know, and we certainly are leaning in as well. Ryan, I wouldn't. There are some times I've seen over the years that marketing levels just rise. So you just got to market more and more and more just to hold your own. And I don't feel that we're in an environment like this.\nI feel that certainly the competitive intensity is increasing. But when we're talking about, in general, in the card business, where competitive intensity is increasing a bit, and specifically with respect to these investments at the top of the market.\nYou know, these are just important things that you have to build to win at the top of the market. But we are very pleased with the traction we're getting, the economics of our heavy spender business. This is you know, we just, it's just not lost on us. A couple of our other competitors are very focused on the same thing. So we continue to lean into growth here, both in terms of upfront customer acquisition and our ongoing investment in brand and exclusive experiences and benefits.\nNow, let me now turn to the third part of our marketing story, which is our investment in building our national bank. This has been a journey that we've been on for many, many years.\nWhen we bought ING Direct direct way back in 2012, we said this is going to be not only a great financial acquisition, but it's going to be a transformational strategic acquisition. Because now as a player with a significant branch network and a national direct bank, we have the building blocks to build a unique national bank. And that's what we're building, a digital first national bank. We've got smaller physical branch networks, so we lean more on our cafe network.\nWhich is in cafes in 21 of the top 25 MSAs. Lean very heavily into our digital experiences. Really importantly, without a branch on every corner across the United States . The role for Capital One that marketing and brand play in building this national banking business is absolutely a central role.\nSo we are very pleased with the growth that we're getting, the traction, the performance of this business.\nAnd, you know, the opportunity just gets bigger when we think about in the context of the combined entity now joining forces with Discover.\nThese are the compelling opportunities behind our marketing growth. We continue to feel really good about the success and the opportunities in front of us. And that's why we are leaning in very much into the marketing specifically with respect to the rest of the year, why we pointed to. And of course, virtually every year at Capital One, the second half of the year has quite a bit more marketing than the first half. First half, we pointed to the pattern, kind of like what we saw last year in terms of proportional increases in marketing. Thanks, Ryan.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks for the color.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research Securities. You may proceed.\n\nBill Carcache\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research Securities\n\nThank you. Good evening. Rich and Andrew, following up on your credit commentary. There had been an expectation among many investors that we would see peak charge-offs somewhere around the second half of this year. Given the delinquency trends that you're seeing, is that a reasonable expectation? And if so, it seems like your credit outlook has de-risked somewhat given an improving loss trajectory but higher reserve rate driven by qualitative factors. Is that a fair thought process? I'll just ask my follow-up as part of this. You mentioned, Andrew, that your capital return is subject to Fed approval. Given the pending acquisition, how should we think about the pace of incremental buybacks as we look ahead at the rest of the year? Thanks.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nOh yeah, Bill. Yeah. Let me make a couple comments on credit. Let me seize a moment. In the spirit of Henry Kissinger who says I hope you have questions for my answers.\nLet me just ask myself a question so I can answer it because it's gonna, it's gonna set the table for answering your question, which you may remember last quarter. We pointed at tax refund patterns and said that there may be a new seasonality pattern emerging.\nIt would be too early to call that, but it was making it a little bit; things were not following is closely on a month-by-month basis to some pre-pandemic delinquency patterns. That our hypothesis was three months ago that we're seeing a tax refund effect. Let me just talk about that for a second, and then, Bill, I'll pull up and talk about just what does this mean for sort of how I feel about where we are with respect to credit. So let's just talk for a second about how seasonality works. We've always seen seasonal credit patterns in our card business and our portfolio trend.\nYou know, they have, in general, been more. They've had more pronounced seasonal patterns than the industry average. I think that's because we have a higher subprime component and those customers are even more linked, I think, to the seasonal patterns associated with tax refunds. That would be our hypothesis there. Now the Q2 tends to be the seasonal low point for delinquencies and Q4 tends to be the seasonal high point for delinquencies. Card losses lag relative to delinquencies. The losses tend to be seasonally lowest in Q3 and highest in Q1.\nNow we believe that tax refunds again are a significant driver of these seasonal trends. Tax refund funds drive a large seasonal improvement in delinquent payments in the February-March time period, which then flows through to lower delinquencies in April and May and then to lower charge-offs.\nTax refunds also drive a seasonal uptick in our recoveries. So, the tax code actually new tax withholding rules went into effect way back in 2020. They were passed in 2019, went into effect in 2020.\nBut the pandemic and the normalization since then have kind of swamped seasonality. So we haven't really been able to get a really good read of it. So we've tended to benchmark to the seasonality of pre-pandemic, like 2018 and 2019.\nBut we've now had several more months to look at this pattern, and we're seeing a pattern. Well, let me back up. What we've done is what we call detrending of our credit metrics. So we, in hindsight, take the trends out of them to the best we can.\nSo we can see what the net seasonality effects are. On a detrended basis, last year showed a seasonality with less amplitude on the high side and the low side than had previously been seen pre-pandemic.\nWe assumed that was probably again a manifestation of the new behaviors going in with the new tax refunds.\nAs we now have seen this tax season play out, the seasonality, the payment patterns have been very close to our detrended 2023 line. So that we believe that we are seeing, and it's very plausible we are seeing a new seasonality.\nI just want to share that with investors. So you know, so later tax refunds. Later and lower sort of lowered the seasonal improvement in delinquencies. But we think the seasonal increase in delinquencies that we see in the back half of the year likely will also be less pronounced going forward than it has been in the past. All of this, by the way, happens in auto seasonality, but in an even faster, more concentrated way.\nWhat we see, we felt it was a little bit noisy last quarter when we were talking to you. We were finding each quarter things were coming in a little bit. I mean, the second derivative was still doing great things, but relative to our sort of close in expectations based on seasonality, things were a little bit off.\nWith the revised seasonality, what we see it's things very nicely settling out in credit.\nYou know, we feel very good about the last couple of months that came in relative to that new seasonality curve.\nSo I think settling out is the real word from here. Given that, you know, from to your question about peak, we're not really going to we're not giving really forward guidance about declarations of peak. But you know, from a seasonal point overview, things should head down from here in Q3.\nAnd then sort of pop up around October. October is often a month we tend to get just a little bit of an October surprise. So we'll keep an eye on that. But the other thing I just want to say about credit is our recoveries inventory is starting to rebuild, and that should be a gradual tailwind to our losses over time, all else being equal. And then, other than the economy, I think the other real factor that's going to drive credit performance for us and other issuers in the next couple of years will be what is the size of this delayed charge-off effect from the pandemic? Thank you.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nBill, with respect to the de-risk comment, Rich just provided a lot of color on our view of losses. I would just say, given the accounting rules, we forecast losses under a variety of scenarios and use qualitative factors for uncertainties around that. I would say, therefore, like we are appropriately reserved for all of that. With respect to your question around repurchases, I'll just note our agreement with Discover doesn't prohibit us from buying shares. The only restriction is that we'll need to be out of the market during the S-4 proxy vote period. However, we are not operating under the SCB. As I said in my prepared remarks, and we laid out in the last Q, the announcement of the intention to acquire Discover did constitute a material business change.\nTherefore, like we did in this recent quarter, in the Q2, we're subject to Fed preapproval of our capital actions until the merger approval process has concluded. So that's what's going to dictate the pace at which we repurchase until that process has concluded.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\n\nDon Fandetti\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nYes, Rich, can you talk a bit about how you're seeing loan growth in auto? And also, you know, as banks potentially come back in, are you seeing or worried about spread or yield compression on new originations?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nSo, hey, Don. You know, it's an interesting thing. We always think some seem to zag while others zig while others zag in the auto business.\nAs we discussed in the last quarter we have an optimistic outlook on the auto business. We're seeing a lot of success in the auto business, and our investments in infrastructure are also reaping a lot of benefits for us. So just on the numbers, our originations grew 21% versus last year in Q1 and the trend continues in Q2 with 18% growth on the year-over-year quarter.\nThe loss performance has normalized and it's stable. You know, very importantly, we intervened and made an adjustment for what we felt was credit score inflation that was happening during the pandemic, and so we pulled back in 2022 and 2023 by just, in a sense, worsening the underwriting score, as one would see under a belief that they were artificially inflated. And that enabled our vintages all through this period of time, 2022, 2023, and all through the normalization to perform very well.\nWe like the economics of the loans were originated, and we're very satisfied with the performance of the overall portfolio. So, you know, when we think about the headwinds in the business, interest rates remain high, and of course that, along with high vehicle values, continues to pressure affordability.\nYou know, auto used car prices, which are still high relative to historical standards, you know, they are probably in a position to gradually be coming down. So we'll have to keep an eye on that.\nFor a long time we were concerned about the margins in the business because competitors had not passed through higher interest rates into the cost of the auto loans. We pulled back quite a bit. John, as you remember, during that period of time, we have seen those margins basically return to where they were. So I think that's a pretty good sign there. So all things considered, with a watchful eye on used car values, we are seeing enhanced opportunities in the auto business with margins that, you know, have good resilience to them and quite a bit improved relative to the period where we were raising the alarm bells a bit about what was happening to the effective resilience in that business. Thank you.\n\nDon Fandetti\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question this evening comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuchwith TD Cowen. You may proceed.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat, thanks.\nWhen you talked about the increase in the reserve rate, you know, not the dollars of the reserve, not the Walmart piece, but the reserve rate itself.\nAndrew, you didn't mention like mix of receivables, you know. Is it? Has there been any shift, you know, towards, you know, mass market or subprime from super prime within the card business?\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nNot in any material way that would have a significant impact on the allowance. Moshe.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGot it.\nOkay.\nJust as a follow up, Rich, you know, given what's happened with Walmart and the pending Discover acquisition, could you talk a little about your thoughts on the partner or private label business kind of in the current environment? Like, what are your thoughts now in terms of your existing contracts and their tendency to want to get new ones? Any thoughts on that in this environment?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One",
    "content2": "So thank you. I think the well, the Walmart partnership was a very unique one that I think, you know, there's not a lot to extrapolate to other partners on that. I think we've ended up in a situation there where, you know, we, you know, the loss share was a very good thing.\nSo we're going to be carrying around you know, loss rates that are you know, something on the order of 40 basis points higher on our portfolio for that. So, you know, we'll have to just make sure we all see that. But we've got the, you know, the full economics on the business. Increasingly that portfolio, you know, the portfolio we inherited is now very seasoned and the rest of it is the portfolio we ourselves originated.\nSo, you know, we know it well I think that, you know, we feel very good about that. The partnership business is a very partner by partner business.\nI think where people get into trouble is feeling they've got to drive to a certain scale. We all know scale matters in the credit card business and scale matters in the partnership business. But here's the thing. We have certainly learned over time. How unique or how individual different partnerships are. We've seen great ones, we've seen not so great ones.\nHere's Moshe. What if I pull up on the patterns of what we most look for, it's first of all a healthy franchise, a company that is itself healthy. And that's certainly a good sign.\nNow the credit card business does have a pretty good default structure whereby if a partner runs into trouble and can't continue. We inherit the portfolio, which now Walmart, of course, is a very strong company.\nHere's an example of inheriting a portfolio where I think things are going to continue very successfully there. But the other thing that we really look for is what is the reason that the partner is driving this either co-brand or private label business? On one end of a continuum is it's the sheer quest for profits, and on the other end of the continuum it is having the card partnership as a centerpiece in driving a franchise. And the behaviors that a partner has the incentives that get baked into programs, they tend to be very driven by where on that continuum one is. We've walked away from a lot of opportunities over the years where things were just too focused on the card partnership as sort of the means to drive profit for the partner more so than way to really build a franchise. But those are some of the patterns. There are always exceptions to every rules.\nEvery rule but so we're still very much a believer in the card partnership business. But the key is we're going to be selective and never, you know, knowing that it's an auction-based business. That's the other thing. One has to really be willing to walk away when the price isn't right. So with that, those are my thoughts, Moshe.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nThank you, Rich. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the conference call today. Thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Have a great evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.

Welcome to the Capital One Q1 2024 earnings call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nThanks very much, Josh, and welcome to everyone. We are webcasting live over the internet this evening. To access the call on the internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our Q1 2024 results. With me this evening are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Andrew Young, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Andrew are going to walk you through this presentation.\nTo access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website and click on Investors, then click on Financials, and then click on Quarterly Earnings Release.\nPlease note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements, information regarding Capital One's financial performance, and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials, and Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rich or to Andrew. Mr. Young.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In Q1, Capital One earned $1.3 billion or $3.13 per diluted common share. Included in the results for Q1 was a $42 million additional accrual for our updated estimate of the FDIC's special assessment. Net of this adjusting item, Q1 earnings per share were $3.21.\nRelative to the prior quarter, period-end loans held for investment decreased 2% and period-end deposits increased 1%. Both average loans and average deposits were flat. Our percentage of FDIC-insured deposits remained at 82% of total deposits. Pre-provision earnings in the Q1 increased 13% from the Q4 or 6%, adjusting for the impacts of FDIC special assessments in both quarters.\nRevenue in the linked quarter declined 1%, largely driven by lower noninterest income. Noninterest expense decreased 6% on an adjusted basis, driven by declines in both operating and marketing expenses.\nOur provision for credit losses was $2.7 billion in the quarter, a decrease of $174 million compared to the prior quarter.\nThe decrease was driven by $257 million lower net reserve build, partially offset by an $83 million increase in net charge-offs.\nTurning to slide 4, I will cover the allowance in greater detail.\nWe built $91 million in allowance this quarter, bringing the balance to $15.4 billion, an increase of less than 1% from the Q4. The slight increase in allowance balance was driven by modest builds in our Auto and Domestic Card portfolios.\nOur total portfolio coverage ratio increased 11 basis points to 4.88%.\nI'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5.\nOur Baseline Economic forecast modestly improved this quarter compared to what we assumed last quarter, which generally aligns with consensus. We continue to consider a range of economic outcomes in our reserving process.\nIn our Domestic Card business, the allowance coverage ratio increased by 22 basis points to 7.85%. The increase in coverage was primarily driven by the denominator effect of the runoff of the fourth quarter's seasonal outstandings.\nIn our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance increased by $46 million, resulting in a 7 basis points increase to the coverage ratio. The allowance increase was primarily driven by a higher level of originations in the auto finance business.\nAnd finally, our Commercial Banking allowance decreased by $7 million, primarily driven by portfolio contraction. Coverage ratio increased by one basis point to 1.72%. Turning to page 6, I'll now discuss liquidity.\nTotal liquidity reserves in the quarter increased to $127 billion, about $7 billion higher than last quarter. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $51 billion, up about $8 billion from the prior quarter.\nThe increase in cash was driven by continued strong deposit growth in our retail banking business and the seasonality of our card balances.\nOur average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter remained strong and well above regulatory minimums at 164%.\nTurning to page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin.\nOur Q1 net interest margin was 6.69%, 4 basis points lower than last quarter and 9 basis points higher than the year-ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in NIM was largely driven by the impact of having one fewer day in the quarter, modestly higher asset yields were mostly offset by higher funding costs in the quarter.\nTurning to slide eight, I will end by discussing our capital position.\nOur Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 13.1%, approximately 20 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Strong earnings and lower risk-weighted assets more than offset the impact of CECL, phased-in dividends, and share repurchases. We repurchased approximately $100 million of shares in the Q1. Our repurchase activity in the quarter was impacted by blackout restrictions and daily purchase volume limitations related to the announcement of the Discover transaction. With that, I will turn the call.\nOver to Rich. Rich.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows Q1 results in our Credit Card business. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on slide 11.\nTop-line growth trends in the Domestic Card business remained strong in Q1 year-over-year. Purchase volume growth for Q1 was 6%. Ending loan balances increased $12.9 billion, or about 10% year-over-year. Average loans increased 11%, and Q1 revenue was up 12% year-over-year driven by the growth in purchase volume, and loans. The charge-off rate for the quarter was up 190 basis points year-over-year to 5.94%, about 18% above its pre-pandemic level in Q1 2019.\nThe 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 82 basis points from the prior year to 4.48%; on a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 59 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 13 basis points.\nThe linked quarter delinquency and charge off rate trends were modestly worse than what we would expect from normal seasonality. We believe this is largely driven by lower and later tax refund payments to consumers so far in 2024 relative to what we've historically observed. Tax refunds are an important factor in credit seasonality. Each year they drive an improvement in delinquency payments and recoveries starting in February. Our portfolio trends.\nGenerally have a more pronounced seasonal pattern than the industry average. Last quarter, our view was that the charge off rate was settling out about 15% above 2019 levels in the near term. That was based on an extrapolation of our delinquency inventory and flow rates over three to six months, and that was the horizon of our.\nEstimate. If the trend of lower tax refunds sustains, it could raise the level of charge off somewhat in the near term. But this does not change our view that credit is settling out modestly above pre-pandemic levels in 2018 and 2019. The continuing deceleration in the pace of credit normalization trends, sometimes referred to as the improving second derivative, supports our view. The pace of year over year increases in both the charge off rate and the delinquency rate have been steadily declining for several quarters and continued to shrink in Q1.\nDomestic Card non-interest expense was up 6% compared to Q1 2023 with increases in both operating expense and marketing expense. Total company marketing expense of about $1 billion for the quarter was up 13% year-over-year.\nTotal company marketing drives growth and builds franchise in our Domestic Card and Consumer Banking businesses and builds and leverages the value of our brand. Our choices in Domestic Card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business and in the Q1.\nDomestic Card marketing also included higher early spend bonuses driven by strong new account growth, higher media spend, and increased marketing for franchise enhancements like our travel portal, airport lounges, and Capital One Shopping. We continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our Domestic Card franchise. As always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks.\nSlide 12 shows Q1 results for our Consumer Banking business in Q1. Auto originations increased 21% from the prior-year quarter, a return to growth after several quarters of year-over-year declines. Consumer Banking ending loans decreased about $3.1 billion or 4% year-over-year on a linked-quarter basis. Ending loans were essentially flat. We posted another quarter of year-over-year growth in consumer deposits. Q1 ending deposits in the consumer bank were up just under $10 billion or 3% year-over-year compared to the sequential quarter. Ending deposits were up about 2%. Average deposits were up 6% year-over-year and up 1% from the sequential quarter.\nPowered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our digital-first national direct-banking strategy continues to deliver strong consumer deposit growth.\nConsumer banking revenue for the quarter was down about 13% year-over-year, largely driven by lower auto loan balances and higher deposit costs. Noninterest expense was down about 3% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Lower operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing to support our national digital bank.\nThe auto charge off rate for the quarter was 1.99%, up 46 basis points year-over-year. The 30 plus delinquency rate was 5.28%, up 28 basis points year over year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge off rate was down 20 basis points while the 30 plus delinquency rate was down 106 basis points. The linked-quarter charge off rate improvement modestly underperformed the typical seasonal patterns we've historically observed, driven by the tax refund trends I just discussed. Even with the tax refund effects, auto performance remains strong.\nSlide 13 shows Q1 results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances decreased about 1%. Average loans were also down about 1%. The modest declines are largely the result of choices we made in 2023 to tighten credit. Ending deposits were down about 5% from the linked quarter. Average deposits were down about 8%. The declines are largely driven by our continued choices to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances. First quarter revenue was up 2% from the linked quarter. Noninterest expense was up about 6%.\nThe commercial banking annualized net charge-off rate for the Q1 decreased 40 basis points from the sequential Q4 to 0.13%. The commercial banking criticized performing loan rate was 8.39%, down 42 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate increased 44 basis points to 1.28%.\nCommercial credit risks continue to be most pronounced in the commercial office portfolio, which is less than 1% of total company loan balances. In closing, we continued to deliver strong results. In the Q1, we posted another quarter of top line growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume, and loans. Domestic Card credit trends continue to stabilize, and auto credit trends remained stable and in line with normal seasonal patterns. We grew consumer deposits, and we added liquidity and maintained capital to further strengthen our already strong and resilient balance sheet.\nOver the last decade, we've driven significant operating efficiency improvement even as we've invested to transform our technology, and we continue to drive for efficiency improvement over time. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments to be flat to modestly down compared to 2023.\nOur expectation includes the partial year impact of the proposed CFPB late fee rule. Assuming the rule takes effect in October 2024, the timing of the new rule remains uncertain. If the rule were to take effect at an earlier date, it would be a headwind to the 2024 operating efficiency ratio. Of course, the biggest news in the quarter was our announcement that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Discover. We've submitted our applications for regulatory approval and we're fully mobilized to plan and deliver a successful integration. The combination of Capital One and Discover creates game changing strategic opportunities.\nThe Discover Payments Network positions Capital One as a more diversified, vertically integrated global payments platform, and adding Capital One's debit spending and a growing portion of our Credit Card purchase volume to the Discover Network will add significant scale, increasing the network's value to merchants, small businesses, and consumers and driving enhanced network growth in the Credit Card business. We're bringing together two proven franchises with complementary strategies and a shared focus on the customer, and we can accelerate the growth of our national digital-first consumer banking business.\nBy adding the Discover consumer deposit franchise and the vertical integration benefits of the debit network, we will be able to leverage and scale the benefits of our 11-year technology transformation across every business and the network, which will serve as a catalyst for innovation and enhanced capabilities in risk management and compliance, underwriting, marketing, and customer service.\nPulling way up the acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity. It will create a consumer banking and global payments platform with unique capabilities, modern technology, powerful brands, and a franchise of more than 100 million customers. It delivers compelling financial results, and it offers the potential to create significant value for merchants and customers, and an unparalleled strategic and economic upside over the long term. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nThank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. Remember, as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow up. And if you have follow up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Josh, please start the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. To ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. One moment for questions.\nOur first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good evening, guys.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nGood evening, Ryan.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nSo, Rich, maybe to just start off on credit, it sounds like you're running a little bit ahead of what you had outlined last quarter. But when you put aside the timing of tax refunds, can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing from the consumer? And do you think we've now reached the inflection where we can more closely follow seasonal patterns? And once the noise settles, do you think we're kind of back at that 15% level that you had outlined? Thank you.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nThank you, Ryan. Look, I think that.\nThe story continues to be one of, well, in terms of there's sort of the consumer itself. Let's just talk about the consumer for a second, and then let's talk about Capital One's credit performance, but just the health of the consumer. I think the U.S. consumer remains a source of strength in the economy. The labor market remains strikingly resilient.\nYou know, rising incomes have kept consumer debt servicing burdens relatively low by historical standards.\nYou know, when we look at our customers, we see that they have higher bank balances than before the pandemic. This is true across income levels. You know, on the other hand, of course, inflation shrank real incomes for almost two years.\nIn this high interest rate environment, the cost of new borrowing has gone up in every major asset class. And I think at the margin, these effects, you know, stretch some consumers financially. So but on the whole, you know, I'd say consumers are in reasonably good shape relative, you know, pretty darn strong shape relative to historical benchmarks. So in terms of Capital One's performance, we continue to see a settling out. We consider, you know, we believe that, you know, for Capital One, I can't speak for all card issuers, but, you know, we definitely have seen what we think is sort of a landing and our. So we feel very good about where the credit is.\nThe point that I wanted to make about the tax refunds, let's just pull up for a second on that. The tax refunds are something that.\nNobody knows for sure exactly what's behind seasonality, but I think it's, you know, we believe a very, you know, important driver of seasonality. It's a bigger effect for us than other players because I think tax refunds just play a little bit bigger role, collectively, across our customer base. So the tax refunds in the very near term affect credit performance. Ryan, what you're referring to the 15% guidance that we gave, that was not an annual guidance number, that was saying if we just extrapolate in the very near window of just what we see in terms of delinquencies and delinquency roll rates, that's where we would see charge-offs.\nCharge-offs tend to be higher in the first half of the year. So what we're doing is giving a window to the higher part of charge-offs for the year. We were saying they were settling out what looked like around 15 above 2019 levels.\nYou know, part of that. So basically what I'm saying is that includes our assumptions about what happens with tax refund and the seasonality effect, as we can see in the government data. Tax refunds are lower and later than by historical patterns. And so that affects our near-term credit performance. And actually, you know, we often talk about, well, isn't the six-month window basically once charge-offs start bubbling and going through the roll-rate buckets? You know, we can, we can pretty much see where charge-offs are going.\nTax refunds actually affect the payment rate in every bucket. So our point was in the very near term it actually leads to a bit of a higher charge-off rate than we had guided to over that near window. But that doesn't change our view that credit has settled out. But the 15% was not a guidance for the year. We haven't really given credit guidance for the year. What we're really saying is we have seen credit settle out, but we wanted to just flag that both in the Credit Card business and in our Auto business, while credit continues to be very strong and you've seen, you know, things like really improving delinquencies.\nWe just wanted to point out that in the very near term, relative to what we have seen in terms of historical seasonality and kind of confirmed by what we watch as the patterns of tax refunds, it's coming in.\nLower and later, and we just wanted to flag that effect because it affects the very near term numbers that we cited earlier.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Maybe as my quick follow up for Andrew, I guess given Rich's answer, what does that mean for the trajectory of the allowance? Seems like we've heard a handful of other issuers talk about us being at the peak or maybe even coming down and potentially being below where it ended the prior year.\nCan you maybe just talk about what you think this means for Capital One given your credit expectations?\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nYeah, sure, Ryan. I'd like to say from my perspective that there's a simple answer, but there's not. And then there's a host of things that are going to drive allowance from here, not the least of which is growth, but just focusing on coverage and assuming that's what others are pointing to. The first thing I highlight, and I said in my talking points, that fourth quarter had seasonal balances. They quickly pay off in the first quarter and therefore have negligible coverage, which we see every year. So the coverage ratio this quarter, up a bit from last quarter, is really a result of that dynamic. But if you look at coverage ratio now, it's largely in line with the preceding quarters.\nThe biggest driver as we look ahead are the projected loss rates, and as we've been seeing for a number of quarters, you know, delinquencies are the best leading indicator of that. And so every quarter we're going to look out over the next 12 months and then the reversion from there, then we're going to take into account a range of outcomes and uncertainties. And so you've seen over the last few quarters keeping the coverage ratio flat.\nI will note though, even in a period where projected losses in future quarters are lower than today and might indicate a release otherwise, you could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat or only modestly declines as we incorporate the uncertainty of that future projection into the allowance.\nAnd so eventually the projected losses will, when they're lower, will flow through the allowance and bring the coverage ratio down as those uncertainties become more certain. And under that scenario, you would see a decline. But at this point, like I'm not going to be in the forecasting business of when that actually is going to take into account because, like I said, we really need to take the factor of the uncertainty as we look ahead every quarter that we go through the reserving process.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions.\nOur next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. You may proceed.\n\nMihir Bhatia\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi. Thank you, Rich. If I could switch for a second to the Discover acquisition. There's been a lot of talk around deal approval, particularly focusing around potential antitrust issues within the Card business. And I was wondering if you could share your thoughts and perspective on that issue, if you've heard anything from regulators, but also just to hear how you're thinking about that issue. Thank you.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nOkay. Thank you, Mihir.\nSo we have filed our merger applications with both the Fed and the OCC, and we are engaged with the. Sorry. With the DOJ, as they of course play a key role in advising the Fed and the OCC on competition questions. We believe our applications make a very compelling case for approval. We believe strongly that this merger will increase competition among banks, credit card issuers, and payment networks and provide significant benefits for consumers, merchants, and the communities that we serve. While some have raised concerns about competition, we believe that the facts in favor of the deal will be compelling.\nOn the network side, let's remember that we're not currently in that business.\nIf the deal is approved, we will still have four networks, just like we do today, but we will be adding new customers and scale to the smallest by far of the four networks and be able to leverage our technology, talent, and marketing capabilities to greatly enhance Discover's competitive viability. Their market share was 6% a decade ago and sits at just 4% today. The significant investments that we are planning will provide substantial benefits for consumers and merchants, as we've outlined in our regulatory applications. On the Credit Card side, the regulators have found every time they've studied it that the credit card market is highly competitive and not at all concentrated.\nIn fact, it's less concentrated today than it was 10 years ago. Consumers can choose from over 4,000 issuers, all able to offer products with similar capabilities.\nImagine this. A card issued by a small credit union can be used every place that a card issued by a bank like Capital One can be used anywhere in the world. That kind of level playing field doesn't exist in any other industry, and certainly not in airlines, or grocery stores, or many of the others. There's a reason that we ask folks, what's in your wallet? We compete not only with these 4,000 other issuers to gain your business in the first place, but also with every other card you likely already own. Put another way, we have to compete every day for every single transaction because our customers can simply choose at any moment to use another card.\nIf they don't like the card they have, they can stop using it entirely, or close the account, or switch to another card with another bank, large or small, in minutes.\nWe also believe that the facts will show that there are no barriers to entry in the credit card business, as thousands of current issuers and the new ones are forming all the time demonstrate. New and incumbent fintechs backed by significant VC funding are able to leverage the infrastructure of sort of credit card as a service players like Marqeta to achieve instant scale and high growth. Also, any existing bank can choose where in the credit spectrum they play simply by changing their credit policy.\nLet's also remember that consumers can choose to use another form of payment entirely. Cash, debit, or buy now, pay later, which has exploded onto the marketplace. New fintechs are entering the payments and small dollar credit space every day, all looking to take market share from traditional credit card players like Capital One. We faced this competition for years and will continue to face it in the future. It's powerful evidence of a healthy and fiercely competitive marketplace. But we have been successful by focusing on the needs of our customers and offering credit card and retail banking products with the most straightforward terms and fewest fees in the industry.\nWe're the only major bank where all of our deposit products come with no fees, no minimums, and no overdraft fees.\nSo, pulling way up, we believe the facts will show that this transaction is both pro-competitive and pro-consumer, and bringing our best-in-class products and services to a broader set of consumers and small businesses, and greatly enhancing opportunities and benefits for merchants. In the end, that is what we believe the regulators will use their very vigorous process to evaluate.\n\nMihir Bhatia\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nAll right, thank you. That is helpful. Just turning back to the health of the consumer for a second for my follow up, if you could just talk a little bit about the environment for card acquisitions. You did mention, I think, that you see good growth opportunities in the card business. So wondering if you can expand on that. Maybe talk about just some of the puts and takes as you consider where to make those investments. Are there parts of the market where you're being more cautious given the environment? Thank you.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nMihir. We are leaning in pretty much across the board in the card business. You know, powered by a healthy consumer and the traction that we're getting in our business.\nWe are, you know, really all parts of the card business are, you know, seeing very nice account originations.\nSeeing good traction on the purchase volume side.\nSo it's very much a positive time for leaning in. As you see reflected in our marketing, as you see reflected in some of the growth numbers.\nAs I see in numbers behind the numbers that you see, just a lot of traction, and just, just savor for a second some of the things that are powering that. Two things that I would flag is one, the continued investment that we are making to win at the top of the market. And I think that not only affects our success at the top of the market, but I really believe there's a lifting of all boats from those investments and that traction there also.\nWe continue to just have a lot of success powered by our technology transformation, including not only the customer experience, and some of the product capabilities that we're able to offer, but really impacts on the whole way that we run the business. And very notably on the credit and marketing side of the business, the ability to create mass customized.\nOfferings and real-time solutions just enable us to have more traction on the growth side.\nAlso, I just want to say that we also are pleased to see things picking up in the Auto business and also.\nWe continue to have a lot of traction on our national bank.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\n\nRick Shane\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking my questions this afternoon. Hey Rich, I want to make sure I fully understand what you're describing. In terms of credit, the framework is that charge-off rates will be about 15% higher than 2018, 2019 levels in the near term. But now, with tax refunds, it might be a little bit higher than that. That over time, it will converge back towards slightly above 2018, 2019 levels. When I look at the delinquencies, and one of the things we've observed is that the roll from delinquency to charge-off is actually higher than it has been pretty much at any time in recent history.\nDoes that suggest that delinquencies actually need to get back below 2018, 2019 levels to achieve that level of charge-off performance?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nWell, Rick, there's a lot. First of all, let me clarify some of the things that you were saying weren't exactly, I think, as we intended to state them. So we talked about. So yes, we talked about credit, saying credit settling out. We said in the very near term where charge-offs tend to be higher in the first half of the year.\nIn the near term.\nBased on extrapolation from delinquency buckets and roll rates, we would expect them to settle out at 15% higher than pre-pandemic.\nThat was a near term forecast, that was not an annual forecast. And then, just clarify your comments that, and over time, it will converge back to slightly above 2018 and 2019. I just want to say those are your words, not ours. We have not given guidance on.\nFull-year charge-offs. We tend not generally to give guidance on full-year charge-offs, but we very much like to give you the feel of how things are going. So we are very much seeing credit settling out. You can see the trends that continue on the second derivative.\nOf delinquencies and that's a very positive thing. There's another factor that affects.\nCharge-offs, which is recoveries.\nAnd, you know, the recoveries have been. We've been saying for quite some time recoveries are lower than usual because of the very low charge-offs we saw over the past three years. So that.\nAll else equal pushes up net losses relative to pre-pandemic levels. And that impact's probably larger and more prolonged for us than some of our competitors because we tend to have higher recovery rates than the industry, probably as a result of our business mix and our strategy. And we tend to work most of our recoveries in house rather than selling debt. So we see a longer tail of recoveries from past charge-offs than most do. So by the way, the recoveries.\nYou know, we had talked about, you know, recoveries are probably.\nSort of been at their bottom in terms of that brownout and you know, over time probably heading in a more positive direction. But that also impacts the relationship between charge-offs pre-pandemic and where they are today. So, pulling way up, we don't have guidance for credit for the year. We continue to be.\nVery happy about charge-offs. After a long period of normalization, charge-offs are settling out. We just wanted to flag the seasonality. Let's just comment. Let's pause for a second on the seasonality. It still remains to be seen whether the tax refunds are just lower, end of story, or whether they're later. The key thing right now is they are lower cumulatively than they were pre-pandemic for this period of time. What we'll take a look at is how it plays out from here to see how much was just later and how much was lower. But what we're saying is to the extent that it's, you know, lower, that impacts in the very near term the charge-off numbers that we had talked about before.\nBut it doesn't change our view about credit settling out. Doesn't change our view about very positively about the consumer, about credit, credit performance. But it's just something we wanted to flag across both the credit card and auto business.\n\nRick Shane\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Very helpful.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGood afternoon. I guess back to the Discover combination. Any updates, your thoughts around the timing of the deal close? I know the Fed and the OCC just extended the comment period, and I know you put out there you expect late 2024, early 2025. So any change in terms of your expectations around the timing of the close or any of the key financial metrics that you set out?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nOkay, thanks, John. So let me comment on the Federal Reserve and the OCC extending the comment period. It's standard practice for the Federal Reserve to extend the comment period on bank mergers. We expected the extension, and we don't take any signaling on our deal from the Fed's decision here.\nWith respect to, you know, the overall timing, the Fed and the OCC typically take several months to work through bank merger applications in consultation with the DOJ on competition questions. They engage frequently with our team along the way. Of course that process is underway and we continue.\nTo have the same views about the timing of all of this that we did at the time of the announcement.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Okay, great, thanks. And then separately, just regarding your expectation on the CET1 front for a pro forma CET1 ratio of about just shy of 14%, any change to that expectation, and any change to your thoughts around buyback activity in the near term? Could you remain active on that front? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nYeah. John, with respect to the deal, I'll just say, as we talked about when we announced it, you know, we at the time used a blend of consensus estimates of where we would have the CET1 at the time of close. There's a number of variables that are going to move between now and legal day one, not just the standalone performance of each of our companies, but balance sheet marks, some of which are driven by credit and stock price. And so I'm not going to be in the business of recasting every time a little number moves. But I will say our evaluation of the deal, you know, considered a wide range of outcomes.\nAnd so we remain just as excited today about the financial and strategic benefits of the transaction as we did when, when we announced the deal.\nWith respect to, you know, our standalone repurchases, Capital One's, I'll note that, you know, the agreement with Discover does not prohibit us from buying shares. I noted in my prepared remarks, we were blacked out for a period leading up to the deal and afterwards, the SEC has safe harbor rules that limit the daily average amount of purchases we can do for a period of time after the announcement. So as a result of those limitations, Q1 had a pace that was less than what we've done in recent quarters. I will also just note that there's also blackout restrictions on repurchases during the proxy vote period.\nBut again, outside of those blackouts, we're not prohibited and we're able to continue repurchasing shares.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat, thanks. You know, Rich, putting aside the, you know, the tax refund thing, I mean, we're sitting here looking, you know, you've still got what has been a somewhat persistently high inflation environment and the potential for increases in unemployment. You know, given the nature of your portfolio, you've got, you know, kind of lower end consumer and higher end consumer. How do you think about that?\nThose factors and you know, in terms of thinking about, you know, what, what type of charge off level you're going to reach over some, you know, some period of time, not, not a particular point in time, but you know, over some point in the next year or two, like, you know, where, where you think about that, you know, is are they driving a higher level of charge off expectations or, you know, how should we think about that.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nMoshe, so our, you know, I think what you're partly.\nGetting at is because we have, you know, part of our portfolio is subprime consumers, you know, how do we feel about how they're performing, and sort of in the context of an environment of higher inflation.\nAnd so on. Let me just comment a little bit about the subprime consumer. You know, in the global financial crisis, we observed that credit metrics in subprime moved earlier in both directions. Subprime.\nYou know, we saw that, but then we saw sort of everything move proportionally. In fact, subprime moved frankly somewhat less proportionally than prime as a multiple. But obviously all portfolios, you know, worsened quite a bit during the global financial crisis. In the pandemic, subprime credit improved more and more quickly than prime, but it also began to normalize more quickly too. And of course that's in the context of lower income consumers seeing disproportionate benefits of government aid and then unwinding that over time.\nSubprime is of course not synonymous with lower income, although they are somewhat correlated.\nSo on the other hand, so if we look at how they have been doing.\nThe income growth from for, let's take lower income consumers has been consistently higher over the past several years.\nWe have seen, really quite other than the tax refund effect, which does show up more in our lower end part of our customer base than the higher credit end, really we have seen the subprime performance be very strong. It just worsened faster, and then on a proportional basis everything caught up with it. But it frankly always seems to be a first mover. And it settled out frankly a little bit earlier than started settling out a little bit earlier than the rest of our portfolio. So based on current performance, we feel very good across the credit spectrum. We also, it certainly catches our attention when we see the inflation.\nhas sort of become greater lately. So we have a real eye on that. As you know, we continue to look at the marketplace and trim around the edges and so on. But the net impression that I would leave you is we continue to feel very good about.\nReally, the full spectrum of our customers. We continue to lean into the growth opportunities. We have for some time just been doing some trimming around the edges and just being a little tighter on the credit lines and things like that. Credit line increases. But the impression that I want to leave with you is that we are still feeling pretty good about this marketplace and the growth opportunities there.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGot it. Maybe just as a follow-up question, you alluded to, you know, or Andrew alluded to the fact that you expect that late fee. You know, you can still kind of achieve your objectives from an efficiency ratio even with the late fee coming into effect. But could you talk a little bit about your thoughts about any mitigating efforts that you're planning or in the process of doing? Or is it something that you're going to try and use from a competitive standpoint to take share? How do you think about it?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nOkay, thanks, Moshe.\nSo, let's just pull up and reflect on the fact that the CFPB's rule on late fees is scheduled to take effect on 14 May. We are prepared to implement the rule on this timeline if necessary, but ongoing litigation efforts continue to create uncertainty on the ultimate outcome and the timing of the rule. As we've said before, when the rule is implemented, there will be significant impact to our P&L. We expect that this impact will gradually resolve itself within a couple of years from the implementation of our mitigating actions.\nThese mitigating actions include changes to our policies, products, and investment choices. Some of these mitigating actions have already been implemented and are underway. We are planning on additional actions once we learn more about where the litigation settles out.\nUltimately, these mitigating actions will play through different line items in the P and L and will mitigate the impact of the late fee rule on our P&L within a couple of years of their implementation.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\n\nDon Fandetti\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nYes, Rich, can you provide your latest thoughts on auto lending?\nI know a lot of focus has been around cards, but, you know, and.\nUsed car prices have been a little.\nbit lighter recently, as well as the tax issue. Maybe talk a bit about, you know, a potential pivot there.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nYeah. So, you know, we're feeling very good about the Auto business, so let's just pull way up. Auto industry margins have recovered somewhat over the past few quarters. Our origination volumes in Q1 were up 20% on a year-over-year basis and quarter-over-quarter basis. We're pleased with that growth. Now, there are still headwinds to the auto business. Affordability remains a concern due to the combined effects of high interest rates and still high car prices. Even as car prices have normalized significantly from their peaks, they haven't yet reached a new equilibrium.\nSo we anticipated the risks in this business tightening up credit back in 2022, I think several quarters before some of our competitors. As a result, the performance of recent originations from 2022 and 2023 has been really strong and frankly, even better than our pre-pandemic originations and vintage over vintage, that risk remains stable.\nAs margins have recovered a bit, we're seeing an opportunity to lean back in. Our years of investments in industry leading technology and credit infrastructure have allowed us to remain nimble and enabled us to make targeted adjustments to our origination strategies where we see opportunities for growth or emerging risks.\nSo looking ahead, we remain confident in the business that we're booking and bullish about the opportunities for growth. We continue to set pricing in terms that we're comfortable with and feel good about the opportunities that we see in the market. You know, after talking for really a couple of years about sort of dialing back, I think this is sort of a period where.\nIt's moving more into leaning into it.\nSituation for Capital One. We're, I think, very benefited by the choices that we made over the last couple of years and seeing very strong performance in our vintages.\n\nDon Fandetti\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. You may proceed.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nThank you. Rich, I think your point on tax refunds clearly very valid one. Interestingly though, to your point on the second derivative, that's improved quite nicely even into March. And I think when I look at the tax refund stats now from the IRS, it seems like, you know, you've seen a catch up in refunds, and it seems like the average refund numbers have kind of come in line with last year, if not slightly higher. So I think those are improving too. Is there a lag effect there? So, like, should we see that more pronounced if that's the case in April and May.\nHow has it been in the past?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nYeah, so I can see that you're a student of tax refunds. Just think of all the areas of expertise that you've developed over the years trying to really get your head around this credit card business. Things that neither you nor I thought we would.\nYou know, we would really have to learn. Let me make a couple comments. So a key question is what are we benchmarking things to? Relative to last year, if we talked about relative to last year, the things were even lagging relative to last year, and they've actually crossed over very, very recently crossed over the curve from last year, which I think you're referring to. But then last year really was somewhat of an outlier relative to pre-pandemic. Now, you know, one might ask, well, why didn't we just do, you know, use last year as the seasonality benchmark?\nLast year itself was an odd year. From a credit point of view, with all the normalization, it was hard to read things through the noise.\nAs we watch the patterns this year, we're going to really end up comparing, by the time it's done, how this year compares to last year and whether collectively this year and last year represent sort of a new seasonality that we have to modify relative to the past. I think it's premature on that. Relative to reading seasonality, it's really hard to look at last year's credit metrics just because there was so much normalization. We've had an eye on this.\nWe have tended to stick with our seasonality benchmarks, which are developed over a number of years. I think when we're done with this period.\nWe'll sit back and look at it and say, did we learn something about.\nThe business that where seasonality might be less magnified in a business like ours than it was before? I think it is too early to tell. But to your other point, even relative to last year, it has very recently crossed over in terms of tax refunds. And yes, to your point, these are things that themselves then have lag effects because people have to get the refunds and they have to make payments. So this is why very much we are flagging a phenomenon that is sort of in the middle of happening. And, you know, the key thing will be by the time it's done, what's the cumulative.\nWhat's the cumulative tax refund effect? We're just, you know, kind of sharing with you as we go along. The reason I'm particularly leaning into this particular one is because last time we made a very near term sort of extrapolation just from our windows of delinquency buckets. Given that in a year, the high part of the year is in the first half of the year, we were just kind of saying in that high part of the year where things were sort of settling out. I wanted to give that little bit. We're not revising the number, but just to say if.\nThe, you know, the seasonality patterns are, you know, probably driven by the tax refund effect, if it doesn't catch up to, you know, historical patterns, then in the very near term, the numbers will be higher than that. This window, we're talking about higher than the 15% number that I said.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nUnderstood. Understood. The second derivative looked good nonetheless, for March.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One",
    "content2": "Yeah. So, look, can I just. I want to just seize that point. The second derivative continues to be strong. In fact, when you look at, you know, sort of all the card players that you can see the strength of Capital One's, you know, second derivative. There's another topic that you didn't know when you were studying all that calculus, that this would be at the heart of what you do. But so, you know, there's lots of good to pull from this. I just wanted to just, you know, clarify the tax refund effect, which I think has a little bit more impact on Capital One than certain other players, and to point out that we actually think we see that effect in both of our consumer businesses.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nGreat. Just one follow up for Andrew. Just on the capital return question earlier.\nCan we step up the run rate relative to some of the last quarters as we look ahead? I know there's been a lot of volatility on some of the regulatory proposals on capital, but as we look ahead, I know there's no limitations, but can we see a step up in the level of capital return relative to the past few quarters as we look ahead, given your capital levels today?\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nWell, there's two parts to that, Sanjay. The first is, given the transaction, we are in the process of submitting a new capital plan. So that's just a procedural piece. So once that new capital plan is approved, then we have unlimited capacity relative to the SCB in this intervening period. The amount that we repurchase is constrained to what we've requested.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\n\nBill Carcache\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good evening, Rich and Andrew, following up on your comments in Auto, how much of an advantage is your excess capital position? Are you seeing competitors who are capital?\nConstrained and perhaps can't take advantage of the attractive market conditions to the same degree. And then I'll just ask my follow up now, as Capital One continues to grow, could you speak to your Category II preparedness?\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nYeah, I'll start, Bill, with the.\nRich, do you want to do the competitive dynamics in auto?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nWell, in auto.\nHere, my observation about the auto business is that.\nIt's still a very competitive marketplace, but when we see our opportunities to grow, we tend to zig a little bit while others zag. And so we sort of pulled back for a little while and others leaned in. And my point is really now I think we're leaning in and others are pulling back a little bit more. I hadn't really sort of analyzed it in terms of really capital choices really as much as just the very natural rhythms of the marketplace and some of the advantages that Capital One has by virtue of our choices that we made over the last couple of years.\nBut, you know, we'll have to think about that. But I just think this is just very much sort of, as you've seen numerous times in the past, where there's a little bit of an inflection point for Capital One at a time that's a little different and occasionally in a different direction than the inflection points of others.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nAnd then Bill, with respect to Category II, well, first let me just note we're going to be below the $700 billion threshold at closing, and the trigger is really a four-quarter average beyond that. So I just wanted to mention the specifics of what is going to trigger it. But within Category II to Category III, there's really three big distinctions. The first one is losing the tailoring benefit for LCR and NSFR. And you can see based on the ratios that we hold there in our conservatism around liquidity, we feel very well prepared.\nThe other two, which are the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital and the DTA threshold going from 25 to 10, those are both already included, at least in what was proposed for the Basel III Endgame rules.\nWe all know that those proposals are being debated and refined, but ultimately we were looking at those two implications as part of the proposal anyway. And so we don't really see a big difference in the long term implications, at least as we sit today. Again, the proposal may take a different form, but from a planning perspective, those were two things that we already had our eye on. And so we ultimately feel well prepared, you know, all of the implications of either Category II or the Basel III Endgame proposals if they were to go in as currently constructed.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur final question comes from Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\n\nJeff Adelson\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good evening. Thanks for fitting me in, Rich. I just wanted to circle back on your comment about how you continue to kind of trim around the edges. I think last quarter you were suggesting that the trimming was sort of abating after a number of years of trimming. But given your comments today about how you're continuing to lean in, how the US consumer remains a source of strength, how are you thinking about potentially opening up the credit box a little bit more from here? And relatedly, does the pending deal with Discover factor into how you're thinking about allocating capital at all into more growth at this point?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nThanks, Jeff.\nWe, you know, the trimming around the edges is, of course, what we do all the time.\nReactively to not only what we observe in the marketplace, but what we think may be coming in the marketplace.\nWe are very much sort of in the same place we were three months ago when we've been talking about this. In other words, the trimming around the edges and the dialing back was a little bit more pronounced.\nIn the quarters during the big credit normalization than it has been as we see things settling out, and the drivers of that continue to be probably, in addition to what I said about the consumer, very much also the observing our credit performance, not only just the overall portfolio performance, but very much the performance of our originations. And strikingly our originations continue to come out generally on top of each other quarter after quarter. Obviously that's lagged data that we're viewing, but we're, you know, we've been struck by how long it's been and how consistently it's been that our originations have been generally on top of each other.\nAnd a lot of that comes from the trimming around the edges that we have been doing, even as there's been some underlying, a little bit sort of worsening of overall consumer credit metrics.\nSo we're in a very similar place to where we were. We feel good about our credit performance and origination performance. We are leaning in across the credit spectrum with respect to the Discover deal. It's not really altering our origination strategy. That's very much continuing as it was before. Obviously we're very excited about the Discover deal, but I think that with respect to our own strategy.\nIt's really pretty much the same as it was before.\n\nJeff Adelson\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nI also wanted to just ask really quickly about the small business card strategy. I know you recently just launched that new Venture X business card. Seems like a really unique value proposition with the charge card component. Can you just talk a little bit more about the opportunity to drive growth there? Maybe how that's going so far? Any early read on the type of customers you're getting?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nOkay. Yes, Jeff. So we launched the Venture X business card broadly in Q3 of last year, and we're pleased with the market response and the customer engagement so far.\nVenture X Business, much like our Spark Cash Plus card, was developed to help business owners run and invest in their business with no preset spending limit.\nGreat travel benefits and elevated earn everywhere.\nIt's a great example of our businesses leveraging each other's innovations because we've taken many of the industry leading travel features of our consumer Venture X product and combined them with the business grade capabilities of our small business offerings, including the flexible spending capacity that is designed for larger businesses. So, you know, we have been investing in our small business card program and more broadly to win at the top of the market for years.\nAnd this launch stands on the shoulders of all of that investment. It stands on the shoulders of our technology transformation and is another example in the continuing drive of Capital One to win at the top of the market across consumers and small business. So I appreciate the question, and we certainly are excited by our continuing progress.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Finance, Capital One\n\nThanks, Rich and Andrew. Thanks, everybody, for joining us this evening and for your continuing interest in Capital One.\nHave a great evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call.

Now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everybody. I'll start on slide three of today's presentation. In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $706 million, or 1.67 per diluted common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $4.9 billion, or 11.95 per share. Included in the results for the fourth quarter was a $289 million accrual for our current estimate of the FDIC special assessment. Net of this adjusting item, fourth quarter earnings per share were $2.24, and full year earnings per share were $12.52. On a linked quarter basis, growth in our domestic card business drove period-end loans up 2% and average loans up 1%. Period-end deposits increased 1% in the quarter, and average deposits were flat. Our percentage of FDIC insured deposits grew to 82% of total deposits in the fourth quarter. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 1%, driven by both higher net interest and non-interest income.\nNon-interest expense was up 18% in the quarter. Operating expense increased 15%, with roughly half of that increase driven by the FDIC special assessment. The full year operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments, improved 99 basis points to 43.54%. Provision expense was $2.9 billion, comprised of $2.5 billion of net charge-offs and an allowance build of $326 million. Turning to slide four, I will cover the allowance balance in greater detail. The $326 million increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to approximately $15.3 billion as of 31 December 2023. The total company coverage ratio is now 4.77%, up two basis points from the prior quarter, largely driven by a higher mix of card assets. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on slide five.\nOutside of interest rates, most of our economic assumptions are largely unchanged from the third quarter, and we continue to assume several key economic variables modestly worsen from today's levels. In our domestic card business, the coverage ratio decreased by 16 basis points to 7.63%. The allowance balance increased by $336 million. The predominant driver of the increased allowance was the loan growth in the quarter. In our consumer banking segment, the allowance was essentially flat at roughly $2 billion. Coverage increased by four basis points to 2.71%, driven by a decline in auto loans in the quarter. And finally, in our commercial banking business, the coverage ratio declined by three basis points to 1.71%. The allowance decreased by $37 million, primarily driven by the charge-offs of office real estate loans in the quarter. We have included additional details on the office portfolio on slide 17 of tonight's presentation.\nTurning to page 6, I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased by $2.3 billion to about 121 billion. The increase was driven by a higher market value of our investment securities portfolio, partially offset by modestly lower cash balances. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $43.3 billion, down $1.6 billion from the prior quarter. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was 167%, up from 155% in the third quarter. The increase in the LCR was driven by holding more of our cash balances at the parent company versus our banking subsidiary. Turning to page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our fourth quarter net interest margin was 6.73%, four basis points higher than last quarter, and 11 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter.\nThe quarter-over-quarter increase in NIM was largely driven by a continued mix shift towards card loans and higher asset yields, partially offset by higher rate paid on deposits. Turning to slide eight, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 12.9%, approximately 10 basis points lower than the prior quarter. Asset growth, common and preferred dividends, and the share repurchases more than offset net income in the quarter. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nThanks, Andrew. Good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows fourth quarter results in our credit card business. Credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on slide 11. Top-line growth trends in the domestic card business remain strong, even with growth moderating somewhat in the fourth quarter. Purchase volume for the fourth quarter was up 4% from the fourth quarter of last year. Ending loan balances increased $16 billion, or about 12% year-over-year. Average loans increased 14%. Fourth quarter revenue was also up 14% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume, and loans. The charge-off rate for the quarter was up 213 basis points year-over-year to 5.35%. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 118 basis points from the prior year to 4.61%.\nOn a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 95 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 30 basis points. For the month of December, the charge-off rate was 5.78%, including a one-time impact of 15 basis points described in a footnote in the monthly credit 8-K. Adjusted for this impact, the monthly charge-off rate for December would have been 5.63%. Pulling up on domestic card credit, we believe that normalization has run its course and credit results have stabilized. The 30-plus delinquency rate has been stable on a seasonally adjusted basis for a number of months now. Since August, our monthly delinquency rate has been moving in line with normal seasonality and at stable ratios relative to the same month in 2018 and 2019.\nAt this point, we have a pretty good window into January as delinquency entries in December indicate continuing delinquency rate stability in January. We've always said that delinquencies are the leading indicator of where charge-offs are going. Charge-off rate tends to follow delinquency rate by about three to six months. Based on the stability we've seen in our delinquencies since August and extrapolating from our current delinquency inventories and flow rates, we believe the charge-off rate is stabilizing now and settling out to about 15% above 2019 levels. I give this window because investors have been asking for quite some time, when will charge-offs level off? So this is the point where we see that happening, meaning charge-offs should move more or less with seasonality in the coming months.\nThis window comes from modeling the flows in our delinquency buckets, which have stabilized, and our recoveries, which have also stabilized and started to rebuild. This isn't designed to be longer-run guidance, but rather to indicate that charge-offs are finally moving more or less with seasonality over the near term. In the longer run, there could be additional forces such as potential pressure from economic worsening and potential benefits from the depletion of deferred charge-offs from the pandemic and recoveries picking up over time from increased inventories. Non-interest expense was up 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, with increases in both operating expense and marketing expense. Total company marketing expense of about $1.25 billion for the quarter was up 12% year-over-year. Our choices in our card business are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our domestic card business.\nOur opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business. In the fourth quarter, marketing also included higher media spend and increased marketing for franchise enhancements like our travel portal, airport lounges, and Capital One Shopping. We continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our domestic card franchise. As always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. Slide 12 shows fourth quarter results for our consumer banking business. In the fourth quarter, auto originations declined 7% year-over-year. Driven by the decline in auto originations, consumer banking ending loans decreased about $4.5 billion, or 6% year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, ending loans were down 2%. We posted another strong quarter of year-over-year growth in federally insured consumer deposits.\nFourth quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up about $26 billion, or 9% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending deposits were up about 2%. Average deposits were up 11% year-over-year and up 1% from the sequential quarter. Powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong consumer deposit growth and gradually increase the percentage of total company deposits that are FDIC insured. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter was down about 17% year-over-year, largely driven by lower auto loan balances and higher deposit costs. Non-interest expense was down about 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Lower operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing to support our national digital bank. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.19%, up 53 basis points year-over-year.\nThe 30-plus delinquency rate was 6.34%, up 72 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was up 42 basis points, while the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 70 basis points. Both of these linked quarter increases were in line with typical seasonal expectations. Monthly auto credit began to stabilize even earlier than domestic card credit results. On a monthly basis, auto delinquency rate and charge-off rate have been tracking normal seasonal patterns since H1 2023 and continued to do so through December. Slide 13 shows Q4 results for our commercial banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances decreased about 1%. Average loans were also down about 1%. The modest declines are largely the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit. Ending deposits were down about 9% from the linked quarter.\nAverage deposits were down about 7%. The declines are largely driven by our continuing choices to manage down selected, less attractive commercial deposit balances. Reducing these less attractive deposits also drove the 14 basis point linked quarter improvement in our average rate paid on commercial deposits. Fourth quarter revenue was down 5% from the linked quarter. Noninterest expense was also down about 5%. The commercial banking annualized charge-off rate for the fourth quarter increased 28 basis points from the third quarter to 0.53%. The commercial banking criticized performing loan rate was 8.81%, up 73 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate was down 6 basis points to 0.84%. Commercial banking credit trends were largely driven by continuing pressure in our commercial office portfolio.\nSlide 17 of the fourth quarter 2023 results presentation shows additional information about the remaining commercial office portfolio, which is less than 1% of our total loans. In closing, we continued to deliver solid results in the fourth quarter. We posted another strong quarter of top-line growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume, and loans. Domestic Card and Auto delinquency trends were in line with normal seasonal patterns, a continuing indicator of stabilizing consumer credit results. We grew consumer deposits and total deposits, and we added liquidity and maintained capital to further strengthen our already strong and resilient balance sheet. Our annual operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments for the full year 2023, was 43.54%. In 2023, we saw incremental opportunities and made choices to grow revenue and tightly manage costs to achieve a 99 basis points improvement in our annual operating efficiency ratio.\nThe actual improvement was better than the \"modest improvement\" we had been expecting. Over the last decade, we've driven significant operating efficiency improvement, even as we've invested to transform our technology. We continue to drive for efficiency improvement over time. For the full year 2024, we expect annual Operating Efficiency Ratio, net of adjustments, will be flat to modestly down compared to 2023. Our expectation includes the partial year impact of the proposed CFPB late fee rule, assuming that rule takes effect in October 2024. Pulling way up, our modern technology capabilities are generating an expanding set of opportunities across our businesses. We continue to drive improvements in underwriting, modeling, and marketing as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale. Our tech engine drives growth, efficiency improvement, and enduring value creation over the long term.\nWe remain well-positioned to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and to thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nThank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. And if you have any questions after the Q&A session, the investor relations team will be available after the call. Amy, please start the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, to ask a question, please press star 1-1 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star 1-1 again. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. And our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nThank you. And Rich, thank you for the color on the charge-offs. I know you cited the pluses and minuses from here, from stabilizing charge-offs, but I'm curious if you feel like the consumer positioning leans towards improvement here as inflation declines, real income growth is resumed, and should interest rates come down. This, coupled with the recoveries, could benefit the charge-off rate, correct? And I'm just thinking sort of how to think about the reserve rate going forward.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nYeah. So, Sanjay, yeah. So first of all, my comments, I just want—I wanted, with my credit comments and my sort of extrapolated look at our delinquency buckets, I really wanted to share where our charge-offs are settling out, which is about 15% above 2019 levels. And we should also note, by the way, that in any year, first-half losses are seasonally higher than second-half losses.\nSo within any normal year, the first half is the peak. Now, as I said, we're not really giving longer-run guidance, but let's think about the dynamics about how things could go from here. From an economy point of view, we're certainly in a strong economy. Unemployment's at a pretty remarkable place. So I think, if anything, unemployment could have more downside than it has upside. Perhaps inflation has more upside than it does downside, but I don't have any more insight to those than anybody else does. I think I also would want to kind of reinforce your point there. There are two good guys that should play out over time. And we've been talking for a long time about the delayed charge-off effect from the pandemic.\nWhen you think about that, the pandemic had such a just, absolutely unusual experience for consumers with all of the stimulus, the forbearance, and so on, that we certainly have believed that charge-offs that were otherwise going to happen at that time, some got averted permanently, but I think some got delayed. And so this phenomenon that we call delayed charge-offs, I think, it's not a really quantifiable effect, but I think it's very much been a part of what's happening in the normalization and something that intuitively will run its course. And the other thing is recoveries. So our recoveries, while the rate per charge-off dollar remained strong, the number of charge-off dollars in inventory, thanks to the pandemic, were at a really depressed level.\nAnd so we have bottomed out there and are starting to now, inventories are starting to increase, of course, as credit has normalized. And that should also gradually be a good guy. Also, when I look at our origination strategy and the underwriting choices we make, these are consistent with longer-term losses that are lower than where we are now. So we consciously sort of focused our credit commentary to really focus on where things settle out. And then there's a list of forces that could work in either direction, but I think you certainly point out some of the good guys.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nOkay. Just a follow-up, maybe, Andrew, could you just talk about the reserve rate, on a go-forward basis, and how we should think about it? Should it stabilize? Can it come down?\nAnd maybe just also on the NIM, with rates coming down, how we should think about the movement over the course of the year? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nSure. Sanjay, let me compartmentalize those two things. The NIM will be a whole separate answer. But with respect to allowance, well, let me first start with just a tactical housekeeping item, which is a reminder that in Q4, we have some seasonal balances that quickly pay off in the first quarter and therefore have negligible coverage. So the coverage ratio in Q4 is modestly lower as a result of that dynamic, and it reverses itself in Q1, but again, a real modest effect there. Longer-term, though, projected losses are really going to be the biggest driver of coverage. And as we've said before, delinquencies are the best leading indicator of that.\nRich just provided a fulsome description of all of the forces at play there. So from a reserve perspective, every quarter, we're just going to be looking at the next 12 months of projected losses with the first six more consequential in the calculation, but also far more predictable, given the visibility that we have through delinquencies. Then the remainder of that window really informed by economic assumptions and then the reversion to the long-term average. So over the last few quarters, things have played out consistent with or slightly better than what we've expected. You've seen the coverage ratio in card roughly stay flat.\nSo I think it's important to note that even in a period where projected losses in future quarters are lower than today and might otherwise indicate a release, we could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat or only modestly declines as we incorporate some of that uncertainty into the allowance. But eventually, in a scenario like that, after a period of coverage stability like we've seen, you would see coverage coming down in the release of non-growth-related reserves.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nNIM?\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nNIM? Sure. There's a lot of factors at play with NIM, and maybe I'll do the same housekeeping with NIM just to remind everyone that in Q1, with one fewer day, we're going to see roughly a seven basis points headwind there. But let me then also enumerate here the puts and takes to NIM.\nOn the tailwind side, growth in card balances as a percentage of the balance sheet, and even within those balances, possibly higher revolve rate. Certainly a tailwind, and that's something we've seen over the last couple of quarters. Then also a lower cash balance. We've talked about this before, but cash balances today, in total of $43 billion, I think the number is, with about $37 billion at the Fed, is quite a bit higher than pre-pandemic. I don't think we'll get back to where we were pre-pandemic, but I would expect over time that we'll come down from today's level. So that would also be a tailwind to NIM. On the headwind side, even though the Fed has stopped moving up in July, we continue to see some deposit product rotation, and it creates a bit of upward pressure to the deposit betas.\nAnd then even if the Fed starts decreasing rates, we're going to see the assets repriced more quickly than the deposits. And the competitive environment and the backdrop of QT will potentially have an impact on betas on a downward cycle. So that would create a bit of margin pressure. And then the couple of other things that I would just highlight as potential headwinds, the uncertainty around potential regulatory changes that could impact interest income, as well as just the path of credit. You've seen provision go up over the last few quarters as losses have gone up. So that also creates some pressure to NIM.\nSo I know that that was a list of puts and takes, but I partially go into that level of detail to say it's kind of hard to say where NIM is going to go in the near term, especially because the path of interest rates remains fairly wide at this point, but kind of gives you a sense of all of the forces at play. But over the much longer term, I would say there's nothing really structurally different about our balance sheet from where it was pre-pandemic that leads me to believe that NIM will be materially different than where it was based on at least what we know today.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good evening, everyone.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nHey, Ryan.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nHey, Ryan.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nRich, when I look, you put about $4 billion of marketing expense for the second straight year, and you're continuing to drive strong growth. We're hearing about some others with a little bit of a more cautious tone on growth. So maybe just talk about, are you leaning in, and do you expect marketing to increase? And really, where are you seeing the best opportunities in the market, and how are you thinking about growth looking ahead? Thanks. And I have a follow-up.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nOkay. Thanks, Ryan. We feel very good about the opportunities in the marketplace. So we are leaning in. We're definitely leaning in. You can see, obviously, there was quite a lot of marketing in Q4, but we continue to see opportunities across the board, especially in the card business.\nJust pulling up there, a few key factors driving our marketing that we want to continue to emphasize. First of all, we're just really excited about the growth opportunities across our business. We're making—we have, over the last number of years, made some what we call sort of adjustments around the edges and trimming around the edges. Lately, there's really even not a lot of trimming around the edges. We're in a very sort of stable place with respect to the business we're going after, the results we're getting, and the zeal that we have to capitalize on that. I think our technology transformation, of course, has really been beneficial, but it allows us to leverage more data and more machine learning models to identify basically more attractive opportunities for investment, and to create better and more customized solutions for customers along the way.\nJust the overall opportunities continue to be very strong. The second part of our marketing investment, of course, relates to our quest to win at the top of the market. We've been going after heavy spenders now for almost 15 years, and that needs sustained high levels of investment. You can see those out in the marketplace in flagship products, in groundbreaking experiences like things like best-in-class digital customer experiences, really high-level elite customer servicing, online travel portal, and in the intersection of risk management and the quest to go to the top of the market, the incredible importance of advanced fraud defenses to ensure that the card always works. Increasingly, we're also just rolling out exclusive services and experiences that aren't available in the general marketplace, such as airport lounges and access to select properties. We continue to lean into growth here.\nObviously, that quest toward the top of the market involves quite a bit of marketing investment and a lot of upfront investment for annuities that are just wonderful, long-lasting, fabulous annuities. The third vector of real marketing investment is our continuing efforts to build our national bank. Just as a reminder, we\nhave a smaller branch footprint, so we lean more heavily on our technology investments, our digital experiences, our Capital One Cafés [Foreign language], and our brand and marketing investments to continue to organically build this national bank. We are really pleased with the traction there. It's been a lot of years in the making, but we are definitely leaning in there and love the results. Ryan, those are kind of the window into how we're thinking about it and the compelling opportunities behind across the board that we see.\nWe are continuing to capitalize on the opportunity as we see it.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Rich, if you put late fees aside for the first part of my question, you talked about stable to modest improvement, which, excluding late fees, would imply continued improvement on the operating efficiency. Do you think we're back, excluding late fees, on a sustained journey of improving efficiency like you were talking about before the pandemic? Second, just how are you thinking about the timing of offsetting late fees? Thank you.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nYeah, thank you. Our story about efficiency, I think, has been a very consistent story for a bunch of years. I think a lot of companies drive efficiency by just continuing to cut costs on their way to greatness, and we have certainly put a lot of energy into the cost side of our business.\nReally, it's been about building a business model powered by our technology and the customer experiences we're building to drive revenue growth and efficiency, both at the same time. We've talked about how so much of this is powered by technology, and we continue to see the benefits of that. We, on the one hand, keep leaning into technology and keep investing there, and on the other hand, see a growing opportunity to drive efficiency as a beneficiary of the technology investment. Pulling way up, while any particular year can be different from overall trends, we continue to believe that an important part of the value proposition with investors and the benefit of the years of investment we're making is to continue to drive greater operating efficiency. Did you have a CFPB question? Yes. Let me turn Ryan to talk about that.\nThe CFPB's late fee proposal, as currently contemplated, would reduce late fees by approximately 75%. While the CFPB's proposal has not been finalized, we expect the CFPB to publish a proposal soon. Once the CFPB publishes its final rule, we expect there to be industry litigation that could delay or block the implementation of the rule. This litigation will likely delay the implementation of the rule until at least the second half of this year, and maybe longer. You saw we talked about an estimate of October. If the proposed rule is implemented, there will be a significant impact to our P&L in the near term relative to what our path would have been. However, we have a set of mitigating actions that we're working through that we believe will gradually resolve this impact a couple of years after the rule goes into effect.\nThese choices include changes to our policies, our products, and investment choices. Some of these actions will take place before the rule change takes effect, and a few are already underway. Many will come after the rule change takes effect.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nArren Cyganovich\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThanks. I was hoping you'd talk a little bit about the auto business. You continue to kind of pull back a little bit from that side, thinking about how you're feeling about potentially increasing some originations. Still a healthy amount of originations at $27 billion this year, but just wondering when you might make a pivot there.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nThanks, Arren. We've been cautious in auto for a couple of years now. We've noted over this period of time a number of headwinds in the business.\nLet's tally them up: margin pressure from the interest rate cycle, normalizing credit, vehicle values normalizing from their all-time highs, and affordability pressures stemming from the combined effects of elevated interest rates and still high car prices. Now, as you know, we don't work backwards from growth targets. We remained disciplined in our originations, setting pricing and terms that we're comfortable with, and then take what the market gives us. Back in 2022, we raised price, tightened our credit box at the low end of the market, and took other steps to manage the resilience of our lending. As a result, our run rate of originations has been lower than two years ago. As a result of our actions, we've been just very pleased with the performance of our auto originations. The credit performance has been really striking, which, of course, you can see.\nEven as vehicle values continue to normalize, risk on our most recent originations from 2023 remains below what we saw in our pre-pandemic originations, probably as the result of our actions. Vintage over vintage, that risk remains stable. The margins on new originations have improved as well, particularly over the last couple of months as interest rates have come down from their recent peaks. We feel quite good about the performance of our auto originations. We continue to adjust our strategies where we see opportunities for growth or emerging risk. Of course, that's what we always do. When we think about some of the headwinds, I think some of those headwinds are easing, and the results that we're seeing on our own book are really pretty striking and gratifying. That gives us a more bullish outlook, still with a note of caution.\n\nArren Cyganovich\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThank you.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nRick Shane\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co\n\nThanks for taking my questions this afternoon. Hey, Rich, you've given a framework for charge-offs into 2024. One of the observations we would make is that delinquencies, even through December, on a year-over-year basis, are up on a year-over-year basis, even though that increase has slowed substantially. That suggests, and very consistent with your description, that charge-offs will continue to rise through the first half of the year. What I'm curious about is, given that delinquencies are still up 100 basis points, 115 basis points year-over-year in December, when we look into the second half of the year, I understand seasonally that they will be down. Would you expect that charge-offs in the second half of the year will still be up versus 2023?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nI think the best way to think about this is to focus on the most stable benchmarks, since our focus here is about stability. We're really looking at what are the most stable benchmarks that we can anchor to. That really leads us back to 2019, 2018. Let me just sort of speak in that, sort of double-click a little bit into my comments on that. Our delinquencies are above pre-pandemic levels, but they've been tracking with normal seasonality for quite some time. Now, compared to 2019, since August, we're running around 17% above the level for the same month of 2019. Compared to 2018, since May, we're running at around 13% above the level for the same month of 2018. At this point, we have a pretty good window into January 2024 as well, based on delinquency entries in December.\nThat looks like it's going to be another month of stability. We feel confident declaring that our delinquencies have stabilized. Of course, delinquencies are our best leading indicator of credit performance. Our charge-offs have been catching up to the stabilizing trend in our delinquencies over the second half of 2023. At this point, what we're declaring here is that our charge-offs are leveling off as well. Now, there's more month-to-month volatility in charge-offs than in delinquencies by quite a bit because every data point of delinquencies includes five months of delinquency inventories. Of course, charge-offs is looking at the relatively small number that falls off at the end of the last bucket. There was also some noise in the fourth quarter of 2019 that makes it less reliable as a charge-off benchmark.\nWe actually think 2018 is an even better benchmark for our charge-offs for comparing our charge-offs in this fourth quarter that just happened to a past stable year. In the fourth quarter, our net charge-offs were about 15% above 2018 levels. Of course, 2018 rolled into 2019, so that's an appropriate benchmark to look at as we head into 2024 and compare to 2019. Now, when we look ahead, extrapolating from our current delinquency inventories and recent flow rates, we conclude that our net charge-offs are stabilizing at about 15% above 2019, with, of course, some typical month-to-month volatility and normal seasonality. Of course, the seeds of this stabilization have been planted for quite a long time now and partly driven by the choices that we made back in 2020 and 2021. Coming out of the pandemic, we were concerned about two trends.\nFintech's were flooding the market, especially the subprime market, with credit offers, creating the potential for credit worsening and adverse selection in our originations. We also anticipated that pandemic-era stimulus and forbearance would temporarily inflate consumer credit scores and that these would revert over time. We tightened our underwriting in anticipation of these effects, and we have continued to make adjustments at the margin since then. The result has been striking, that with all the kind of changes, the normalization, all the noise over the last number of years, there has been strikingly stable performance on our origination vintages. Basically, in our post-pandemic originations, each quarterly vintage for a given segment has been more or less on top of each other, and also relatively consistent with pre-pandemic vintages.\nOver time, this just created a lot of stability that increasingly moved into our portfolio, and it contributed to the stabilization of our portfolio credit trends. As we've looked at this, we said these are very good shoulders to stand on, to have that much stabilization for so long. We, of course, all still waited to see exactly the manifestations ultimately of the portfolio stabilizing. Another factor contributing to stabilization is our recovery rate. Unusually low recoveries have been the largest driver of our overall charge-off rate running above pre-pandemic levels. This is, of course, because of the very low level of charge-offs over the past three years. Therefore, we had a low level of raw material for future recoveries.\nBy the way, just to Capital One point here, this is a larger effect for us than for most competitors because we tend to have meaningfully higher recovery rates than the industry average, and because we tend to work our own recoveries. They come in over time, not all at once, like in a debt sale. We've recently observed that our recovery rate has stabilized and started to tick back up. Now that our recoveries inventory has started to rebuild, that's, of course, a good guy, although it's coming from a pretty low level. This also contributes to our confidence that our overall loss trends have stabilized. To your question, were you at compared to 2023, what we have really done is really kind of anchor our benchmarking to the most stable years in sort of recent experience, 2018 and 2019.\nSince we've seen delinquencies and charge-offs stabilize relative to like quarters in those benchmarks, we felt the best language with which to describe where things are settling out is to do it as a multiple of those two generally stable years. We are entering 2024 now with a real sense of stability, and we've benchmarked where we are as a multiple of those two stable year benchmarks.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks. Maybe, Rich, just following up on that. I think that a lot of the marketing dollars in the card space have been spent with the transactor business.\nGiven that stability that you're talking about, and I assume the bulk of the dollars of loss, delinquency, and loss are coming from kind of the lower end of the card spectrum. Does that mean that that's an area for expansion in 2024? How should we think about that? I do have a follow-up.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nSorry, Moshe. Are you saying is the lower end an area for expansion?\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nYes.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nYes. We feel good about all of our segments across the credit spectrum in card, and also the relative health of the consumer. You've known us for a long time, Moshe, and as long as we have for the decades we've been talking together, you know that we have a long history of delivering sustained resilience and profitability at the lower end of the marketplace. Let's just reflect on this for a second.\nIf you're talking about subprime credit card, this is a complex business that requires deep investment in information-based underwriting. Of course, we've spent decades developing and testing tailored product structures and sort of honing the analytical, the operating, the underwriting, and marketing capabilities to attract and serve this franchise. Also, the number one, two, and three most important things to us has been resilience as we do this. What's really been pretty striking is how consistent our strategy has been over the years through the Great Recession and following that. We've talked about how the lower end of the marketplace, whether you're talking, by the way, there's a whole, when I talk about the lower end of the marketplace, obviously, there's a whole part of the marketplace that Capital One doesn't serve.\nIn terms of the lower end of the marketplace that we serve, if you look at either income or FICO and look at the normalization that's going on, we've seen very solid curing in that part of the market. It, in fact, even started, it cured a little bit earlier than some of the other parts of the market. The curing story, the leveling off story we're talking about today is absolutely across the board. I do want to say, though, also, Moshe, relative to your point, you've had Fintech's who we were very concerned about flooding that end of the market some years ago. They certainly have massively dialed back.\nI think that the continued, when we see the success of our vintages, the stabilization, now the sort of stabilization overall of Capital One's whole portfolio and the dynamics in the marketplace, I think that we like the opportunities we see there, Moshe, and we will be leaning into that.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Just as a follow-up, I mean, you've talked in the past about not just the financial impact of the late fee, but also its deterrent impact. How do you think about that in terms of the resilience of that segment as we go forward post any changes to late fees? Maybe just as a side point, you did mention that you thought you could improve the efficiency ratio even with the late fee. I mean, that just seems like you'd have to take a couple of hundred million dollars out of expenses to do that.\nIf there's a way to talk about how that would happen and tack that onto the answer, that would help too. Thanks.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nMoshe, Capital One has pursued a strategy for many years of trying to create and deliver to the marketplace strikingly simple products, because from sort of a mission and strategy point of view, we believe so much in this. We built a brand over having very simple products. Things like, for example, on the banking side, no minimum balance requirements, no membership fees, and even no overdraft fees. Here we are, a company that has really, really reduced the fees. If we had one fee left, I think the fee we would most hang on to is the late fee because, to your point, it plays a very important role in the deterrent value to a consumer.\nAn analogy that we sometimes use is a speeding ticket. I think that if a speeding ticket were, let's say we had an $8 speeding ticket, I'm not sure that our highways would be quite as safe as they are now because if we're really trying to deter behavior that we think is really consequential for people, that really is the role of the fee. We've been very active in giving alerts to all of our customers when late payment due alerts, with a goal of not trying to maximize late fees, but actually trying to maximize the on-payment performance of our customers. Moshe, this is a question that we've been worried about, your question about what could be the impact on credit performance of individuals.\nIt's something that we're just going to have to, if this CFPB rule goes into effect, we're all going to experience together, sort of this not controlled experiment. We certainly mark us down for having concern about that. From a financial point of view, obviously, the late fees are an important thing on the P&L. As I've talked about, we have created a set of many actions across different types of things, from policies, products, pricing structures, and investment choices, to claw back the very significant economic impact. Some of those things are underway. Some of them, just to mention it, by the way, by the time we get there, when the rule is announced, some of the offsets are going to by then be into the run rate of the company, and a majority will still be waiting to happen.\nWith respect to the fourth quarter, the '25 is the big full-year effect. Obviously, something coming in late in the fourth, something coming in, in our estimate, in the fourth quarter doesn't have as much impact on the annual efficiency ratio, but it still does have an impact. Essentially, what's implied underneath it is quite a bit of progress on the efficiency ratio behind the flat to modestly down guidance that includes that fourth quarter effect.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks for taking my call. In the interest of time, given it's late in the call, I'll ask my two-parter all upfront here. First, on the marketing side, I know you indicated you expect to continue to lean in on marketing this year. What does that imply on how you're thinking about full-year marketing expense?\nI mean, could that mean that you'll see marketing come in above the $4 billion level that you saw this year, or could it be stable or a modest decline? My second question is on the credit side on commercial real estate office CRE. I know you had some lumpy losses this quarter and some pressure still in criticized and non-accruals. If you could just give us a little bit more color there in terms of what you're charged off and your outlook on that front. Thank you.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nOkay, John, thanks for your good questions here. We don't typically give full-year marketing guidance. The reason is because marketing depends, of course, a lot on the opportunities that we see when we get there.\nWhat I wanted to just share in response to Ryan Nash's question is a continuation in the positivity that we feel both about the real-time numbers we're seeing of response and performance of our vintages and all of that, and also the sort of more structural investments that we're making in the business, particularly with respect to going after the heavy spenders. We don't have full-year guidance, but we certainly continue to like the opportunities that we see.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nJohn, on the office side, it's virtually impossible to generalize office. It is incredibly property specific. We've talked in the past about us having a fair amount in Gateway Cities and having a mix of both A and BC properties. Frankly, the decomposition matters a whole lot less than the individual properties.\nWhat we saw in the quarter was a little more than $80 million of losses tied to office loans. We continue to not originate there. Balances have come down to about $2.3 billion, I think down about $150 million in the quarter. It's less than 1% of our total loans. As we charged off in the quarter, we had essentially reserved entirely for that amount. We built back up a little bit for the remaining portfolio to maintain the coverage at around 13%.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nDonald Fandetti\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nRich, you've made a lot of progress on heavy spenders. As you sort of look out, where are we, I guess, on that expense cycle?\nAre we sort of still looking at many years of acceleration, or do you hit some type of level where there's some scale kicking in? Just trying to get a sense on where we are on that investment cycle.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nWell, Don, it certainly, I think the quest to the heavy spender, to win in the heavy spender of the marketplace, it will be a quest as far out as we can see, in the same way it is for the players, the small number of players who are really going after that business. The key part of it is we're getting more and more scale along the way. You've seen over the years the growth in purchase volume. What you don't see is the purchase volume growth rates by level of spender. In any segmentation we've been looking at, the growth rate's monotonically faster.\nThe more you go up toward the heavy spenders, it's just indicating we're getting a lot of traction there. I wouldn't want to say that we just have to do a blitz and then we're kind of done with the investment. The way that scale is achieved is by getting more and more customers in a business where all the players in the business, even including the largest, continue to invest in that business. We're really pleased with the traction, and that's why we continue to invest.\n\nDonald Fandetti\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThat's all I have. Thanks.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nBill Carcache\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research",
    "content2": "Thank you. Good evening, Rich and Andrew. I appreciate all of the very clear commentary on what you're seeing in credit.\nThere's a view that if we'd had a mild recession and experienced the purging of weaker credits, that would have provided a clear runway for growth coming out of that. Instead, the environment we're in is arguably a little bit muddier, and some would say still late cycle. Could you speak to that dynamic, Rich, and whether that weighs on how you're thinking about growth from here in any way? As a follow-up, I'll just ask it now for you, Andrew. Can you update us on how you're thinking about capital return from here?\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nSure. Why don't I start? Bill, look, at this point, there still remains a number of uncertainty around capital, not the least of which is the endgame proposal.\nWe're all aware there's been quite a bit of advocacy there, and there remains a fair amount of uncertainty of where the rule will land, including things like the impact of AOCI, phase-in, ops risk, and other forces at play. You know as much as we do, and we're waiting to see what the final rule holds there. In addition to that, we're coming up on CCAR. We don't yet have the scenarios for this year. You look back at how impactful the scenario, as well as the starting balance sheet, is to those outcomes. You've seen our SCB fluctuate over the last four years from, I think, 10.1 down to 7, and now we're sitting here at 9.3. Waiting to get a little bit more clarity of what CCAR will hold.\nIn addition, we continue to see a range of outcomes in our own growth projections. Finally, I'll just point to the economy. The consensus view is growing of a soft landing, but there's still quite a wide range of outcomes there. Given all of those factors, we've chosen to operate for the last few quarters around 13%. We recognize that when we feel like we're in an excess capital position, that returning it is one way to create value. Under the SCB framework, we have that flexibility to manage repurchases dynamically, and we'll use that flexibility when we think it's prudent to do so.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nBill, a comment on our continuing to lean in, given that some people might argue that the economic environment is late cycle. Certainly a great question.\nFirst of all, the bottom line is we are continuing to lean in. Obviously, we keep a wary eye out for things that could change. I sort of start with the health of the consumer. I think the US consumer remains a source of strength in the overall economy. The labor market has proven strikingly resilient over the past year, really defying the expectations of many economists in the face of rising interest rates. Consumer debt servicing burdens remain relatively low by historical standards, again, despite rising interest rates. Home prices are back and doing a bit better, and are generally near all-time highs. In aggregate, consumers across all income levels still have excess savings also from the pandemic, although those numbers are declining. Inflation has moderated to the point that real wages are growing again after shrinking for almost two years.\nStudent loan repayments resumed in October, but there's the 12-month on-ramp period and a new income-driven repayment plan, which will significantly reduce payments for lower-income borrowers. On the whole, I'd say consumers are in really quite good shape relative to most historical benchmarks. If we look inside our own portfolio, we still see higher average payments compared to 2019 by segment by a really pretty sizable delta. We then look at the marketplace. You've seen in the auto business how at times we get alarmed by some of the practices or the pricing in the industry, and we pull back in ways that we haven't pulled back in the card business. I think we see a rational and stable competitive marketplace. It's very competitive, but it's rational and it's stable. Most importantly, the results themselves.\nOur vintages just continue to come in on top of prior vintages. The trimming around the edges that we've done over the last few years have really, I think, allowed our results to have a stability to them that even has diverged from the sort of underlying not-as-good performance in the marketplace of things recently compared to the past. We have that real stability. We see the leveling off of our portfolio. We talk about our charge-offs leveling off at a level that's like 15% above 2019. It's interesting, actually, that's net charge-offs, but gross charge-offs are leveling off very close to the gross charge-off levels of 2018 and 2019. Actually, the thing that creates the differential is the lower recoveries that we've had in the wake of the inventory of recoveries being so much lower, inventory of charge-off debt.\nPulling way up and seeing the traction in our business, the success with our brand, the things that for competitive reasons we don't share in the marketplace, the traction on the tech side in terms of enabling us to create better, really unique, customized customer experiences, totally customized underwriting, the reaching to marketing channels that we hadn't even tapped before, all of this is putting us in a position to continue to pulling way up. Obviously, in the credit business, we always worry a lot. If I calibrate this relative to a lot of other times, I feel really quite good about this. I actually said I felt a lot less good a couple of years ago because I felt that the pandemic, well, from a credit point of view, who couldn't like those credit results?\nI said it actually is so abnormally good, the marketplace won't be able to help itself but create unusual practices, unresilient underwriting, etc. What we've had, if I can borrow the soft landing term from the economy conversations, is kind of a soft landing relative to the credit business. Landing's really quite the right word relative to Capital One, which I think really, as I've kind of declared today, has sort of landed here. I know some competitors still haven't fully landed, but pulling way up on this, I actually feel this is really quite a good time if I calibrate to all the times over the years in this exciting journey.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nDominick Gabriele\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nHey, great. Thanks so much for all the color on the call today.\nI just have two questions. Rich, what are you seeing, do you think, that's making the net charge-off stabilize 15% above 2019 levels? Is there something in the consumer payment behavior that's changed? Is there something you think that shifted the consumer in general where the credit card industry may be seeing a higher through-the-cycle net charge-off rate going forward or for Capital One in particular? I just have a follow-up. Thanks so much.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nI actually believe that what we're really seeing here is a credit situation that's very similar to pre-pandemic. It is showing up right now. I'm going to speak through the Capital One lens. I think I'm not going to universalize for the industry.\nAs I mentioned to the prior answer there, if you look at gross charge-offs where they're settling out for Capital One—now this is Capital One that has done a lot of trimming around the edges over the last, a fair amount of trimming around the edges—I think we also did a very important choice that I'm not sure was universal. It might have been an unusual choice. When we saw the incredibly strong credit performance of consumers, much of it driven by stimulus and forbearance, we sort of became alarmed about credit score grade inflation, if you will, and essentially intervened in our models to normalize so that we didn't get fooled by that. As a result of that, we have stabilized. We're probably one of the first players to stabilize.\nWe've stabilized at this moment at 15% above 2019 levels. Already, we said that number from a gross charge-off number is really sort of very close to 2019 levels. The recovery's effect, which is a temporary effect that our recoveries are so much lower because they just don't have as much inventory of charge-offs to collect on, that's a good guy that should help over time. I think also, as we have talked about, and we've talked about ever since the pandemic, sort of we started coming out of the other side of the pandemic, we said there's another effect. Let's call it the delayed charge-off effect that if you think about all those charge-offs that would have happened, many of that would have happened in the pandemic but didn't.\nSome of them may have gotten reprieved for the long run, but a bunch of others we certainly have felt are going to charge off over time. That is a temporary effect that we think has been playing out over this normalization thing. We have ways that we try to measure it, but nobody can precisely measure this. This is also something that leads to an elevation of charge-offs relative to probably what's an equilibrium. If I speak from Capital One's point of view, our guidance was to guide you to the leveling off because of the lower recoveries effect right now. That's leveling off at 15% above 2019. The underlying credit dynamics seem very similar to me to what was there in the past.\nI think even as we keep a wary eye on the economy, there's some just sort of actuarial good guys making their way through the business, and all other things being equal, that can help the credit metrics more and more show that they are strikingly similar to what was there before the pandemic. Pulling way up, I don't think—I don't think things have shifted. I think we're seeing some trends playing out. For Capital One, we feel great about where we've stabilized, and we see a good assessment of our future.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nWell, thank you very much, everyone, for joining us on the conference call tonight.

Now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everybody. I'll start on slide three of today's presentation. In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $706 million, or 1.67 per diluted common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $4.9 billion, or 11.95 per share.\nIncluded in the results for the fourth quarter was a $289 million accrual for our current estimate of the FDIC special assessment. Net of this adjusting item, fourth quarter earnings per share were $2.24, and full year earnings per share were $12.52. On a linked quarter basis, growth in our domestic card business drove period-end loans up 2%, and average loans up 1%. Period-end deposits increased 1% in the quarter, and average deposits were flat. Our percentage of FDIC insured deposits grew to 82% of total deposits in the fourth quarter. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 1%, driven by both higher net interest and non-interest income. Non-interest expense was up 18% in the quarter. Operating expense increased 15%, with roughly half of that increase driven by the FDIC special assessment. The full year operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments, improved 99 basis points to 43.54%.\nProvision expense was $2.9 billion, comprised of $2.5 billion of net charge-offs and an allowance build of $326 million. Turning to slide four, I will cover the allowance balance in greater detail. The $326 million increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to approximately $15.3 billion as of 31 December 2023. The total company coverage ratio is now 4.77%, up two basis points from the prior quarter, largely driven by a higher mix of card assets. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on slide five. Outside of interest rates, most of our economic assumptions are largely unchanged from the third quarter, and we continue to assume several key economic variables modestly worsen from today's levels. In our domestic card business, the coverage ratio decreased by 16 basis points to 7.63%. The allowance balance increased by $336 million.\nThe predominant driver of the increased allowance was the loan growth in the quarter. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance was essentially flat at roughly $2 billion. Coverage increased by four basis points to 2.71%, driven by a decline in auto loans in the quarter. Finally, in our Commercial Banking business, the coverage ratio declined by three basis points to 1.71%. The allowance decreased by $37 million, primarily driven by the charge-offs of office real estate loans in the quarter. We have included additional details on the office portfolio on slide 17 of tonight's presentation. Turning to page six, I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased by $2.3 billion to about $121 billion. The increase was driven by a higher market value of our investment securities portfolio, partially offset by modestly lower cash balances.\nOur cash position ended the quarter at approximately $43.3 billion, down $1.6 billion from the prior quarter. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was 167%, up from 155% in the third quarter. The increase in the LCR was driven by holding more of our cash balances at the parent company versus our banking subsidiary. Turning to page seven, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our fourth quarter net interest margin was 6.73%, four basis points higher than last quarter, and 11 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in NIM was largely driven by a continued mix shift towards card loans and higher asset yields, partially offset by higher rate paid on deposits. Turning to slide eight, I will end by discussing our capital position.\nOur common equity tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 12.9%, approximately 10 basis points lower than the prior quarter. Asset growth, common and preferred dividends, and share repurchases more than offset net income in the quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nThanks, Andrew. Good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows fourth quarter results in our credit card business. Credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on slide 11. Top-line growth trends in the domestic card business remain strong, even with growth moderating somewhat in the fourth quarter. Purchase volume for the fourth quarter was up 4% from the fourth quarter of last year. Ending loan balances increased $16 billion, or about 12% year-over-year. Average loans increased 14%.\nFourth quarter revenue was also up 14% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. The charge-off rate for the quarter was up 213 basis points year-over-year to 5.35%. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 118 basis points from the prior year to 4.61%. On a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 95 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 30 basis points. For the month of December, the charge-off rate was 5.78%, including a one-time impact of 15 basis points described in a footnote in the monthly credit 8K. Adjusted for this impact, the monthly charge-off rate for December would have been 5.63%. Pulling up on domestic card credit, we believe that normalization has run its course, and credit results have stabilized. The 30-plus delinquency rate has been stable on a seasonally adjusted basis for a number of months now.\nSince August, our monthly delinquency rate has been moving in line with normal seasonality and at stable ratios relative to the same month in 2018 and 2019. At this point, we have a pretty good window into January as delinquency entries in December indicate continuing delinquency rate stability in January. We've always said that delinquencies are the leading indicator of where charge-offs are going. Charge-off rate tends to follow delinquency rate by about three to six months. Based on the stability we've seen in our delinquencies since August and extrapolating from our current delinquency inventories and flow rates, we believe the charge-off rate is stabilizing now and settling out to about 15% above 2019 levels. I give this window because investors have been asking for quite some time, when will charge-offs level off?\nThis is the point where we see that happening, meaning charge-offs should move more or less with seasonality in the coming months. This window comes from modeling the flows in our delinquency buckets, which have stabilized, and our recoveries, which have also stabilized and started to rebuild. This isn't designed to be longer-run guidance, but rather to indicate that charge-offs are finally moving more or less with seasonality over the near term. In the longer run, there could be additional forces such as potential pressure from economic worsening, and potential benefits from the depletion of deferred charge-offs from the pandemic, and recoveries picking up over time from increased inventories. Non-interest expense was up 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, with increases in both operating expense and marketing expense. Total company marketing expense of about $1.25 billion for the quarter was up 12% year-over-year.\nOur choices in our card business are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our domestic card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business. In the fourth quarter, marketing also included higher media spend, and increased marketing for franchise enhancements like our travel portal, airport lounges, and Capital One Shopping. We continued to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our domestic card franchise. As always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. Slide 12 shows fourth quarter results for our consumer banking business. In the fourth quarter, auto originations declined 7% year-over-year. Driven by the decline in auto originations, consumer banking ending loans decreased about $4.5 billion, or 6% year-over-year.\nOn a linked quarter basis, ending loans were down 2%. We posted another strong quarter of year-over-year growth in federally insured consumer deposits. Fourth quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up about $26 billion, or 9% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending deposits were up about 2%. Average deposits were up 11% year-over-year, and up 1% from the sequential quarter. Powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our Digital First National Direct Banking Strategy continues to deliver strong consumer deposit growth and gradually increase the percentage of total company deposits that are FDIC insured. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter was down about 17% year-over-year, largely driven by lower auto loan balances and higher deposit costs. Non-interest expense was down about 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.\nLower operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing to support our national digital bank. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.19%, up 53 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 6.34%, up 72 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was up 42 basis points, while the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 70 basis points. Both of these linked quarter increases were in line with typical seasonal expectations. Monthly auto credit began to stabilize even earlier than domestic card credit results. On a monthly basis, auto delinquency rate and charge-off rate have been tracking normal seasonal patterns since the first half of 2023, and continued to do so through December. Slide 13 shows fourth quarter results for our commercial banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances decreased about 1%. Average loans were also down about 1%.\nThe modest declines are largely the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit. Ending deposits were down about 9% from the linked quarter. Average deposits were down about 7%. The declines are largely driven by our continuing choices to manage down selected, less attractive commercial deposit balances. Reducing these less attractive deposits also drove the 14 basis point linked quarter improvement in our average rate paid on commercial deposits. Fourth quarter revenue was down 5% from the linked quarter. Non-interest expense was also down about 5%. The commercial banking annualized charge-off rate for the fourth quarter increased 28 basis points from the third quarter to 0.53%. The commercial banking criticized performing loan rate was 8.81%, up 73 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate was down 6 basis points to 0.84%.\nCommercial banking credit trends were largely driven by continuing pressure in our commercial office portfolio. Slide 17 of the fourth quarter 2023 results presentation shows additional information about the remaining commercial office portfolio, which is less than 1% of our total loans. In closing, we continued to deliver solid results in the fourth quarter. We posted another strong quarter of top-line growth in domestic card revenue, purchase volume, and loans. Domestic card and auto delinquency trends were in line with normal seasonal patterns, a continuing indicator of stabilizing consumer credit results. We grew consumer deposits and total deposits, and we added liquidity and maintained capital to further strengthen our already strong and resilient balance sheet. Our annual operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments for the full year 2023, was 43.54%.\nIn 2023, we saw incremental opportunities and made choices to grow revenue and tightly manage costs to achieve a 99 basis point improvement in our annual operating efficiency ratio. The actual improvement was better than the modest improvement we had been expecting. Over the last decade, we've driven significant operating efficiency improvement, even as we've invested to transform our technology. We continue to drive for efficiency improvement over time. For the full year 2024, we expect annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be flat to modestly down compared to 2023. Our expectation includes the partial year impact of the proposed CFPB late fee rule, assuming that rule takes effect in October 2024. Pulling way up, our modern technology capabilities are generating an expanding set of opportunities across our businesses. We continue to drive improvements in underwriting, modeling, and marketing as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale.\nOur tech engine drives growth, efficiency improvement, and enduring value creation over the long term. We remain well positioned to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and to thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. We'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nThank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any questions after the Q&A session, the investor relations team will be available after the call. Amy, please start the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, to ask a question, please press star 11 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star 11 again. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster.\nOur first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nThank you. And Rich, thank you for the color on the charge-offs. I know you cited the pluses and minuses from here from stabilizing charge-offs, but I'm curious if you feel like the consumer positioning leans towards improvement here as inflation declines, real income growth is resumed, and should interest rates come down. This, coupled with the recoveries, could benefit the charge-off rate, correct? I'm just thinking sort of how to think about the reserve rate going forward.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nYeah. Sanjay, yeah. First of all, my comments, I just wanted, with my credit comments and my sort of extrapolated look at our delinquency buckets, I really wanted to share where our charge-offs are settling out, which is about 15% above 2019 levels.\nWe should also note, by the way, that in any year, first-half losses are seasonally higher than second-half losses. Within any normal year, the first half is the peak. Now, as I said, we're not really giving longer-run guidance, but let's think about the dynamics about how things could go from here. From an economy point of view, we're certainly in a strong economy. Unemployment's at a pretty remarkable place. I think, if anything, unemployment could have more downside than it has upside. Perhaps inflation has more upside than it does downside, but I don't have any more insight to those than anybody else does. I think I also would want to kind of reinforce your point there. There are two good guys that should play out over time. We've been talking for a long time about the delayed charge-off effect from the pandemic.\nWhen you think about that, the pandemic had such a just absolutely unusual experience for consumers with all of the stimulus, the forbearance, and so on that we certainly have believed that charge-offs that were otherwise going to happen at that time, some got averted permanently, but I think some got delayed. This phenomenon that we call delayed charge-offs, I think, is not a really quantifiable effect, but I think it's very much been a part of what's happening in the normalization and something that intuitively will run its course. The other thing is recoveries. Recoveries, our recoveries, while the rate per charge-off dollar remained strong, the number of charge-off dollars in inventory, thanks to the pandemic, were at a really depressed level.\nWe have bottomed out there and are starting to now, inventories are starting to increase, of course, as credit has normalized. That should also gradually be a good guy. Also, when I look at our origination strategy and the underwriting choices we make, these are consistent with longer-term losses that are lower than where we are now. We consciously sort of focused our credit commentary to really focus on where things settle out. There is a list of forces that could work in either direction, but I think you certainly point out some of the good guys.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nOkay. Just a follow-up, maybe, Andrew, could you just talk about the reserve rate on a go-forward basis and how we should think about it? Should it stabilize? Can it come down?\nMaybe just also on the NIM with rates coming down, how we should think about the movement over the course of the year? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nSure. Sanjay, let me compartmentalize those two things. The NIM will be a whole separate answer. With respect to allowance, let me first start with just a tactical housekeeping item, which is a reminder that in Q4, we have some seasonal balances that quickly pay off in the first quarter and therefore have negligible coverage. The coverage ratio in Q4 is modestly lower as a result of that dynamic, and it reverses itself in Q1, but again, a real modest effect there. Longer-term, though, projected losses are really going to be the biggest driver of coverage, and as we've said before, delinquencies are the best leading indicator of that.\nRich just provided a fulsome description of all of the forces at play there. From a reserve perspective, every quarter, we're just going to be looking at the next 12 months of projected losses, with the first six more consequential in the calculation, but also far more predictable given the visibility that we have through delinquencies. The remainder of that window is really informed by economic assumptions and then the reversion to the long-term average. Over the last few quarters, things have played out consistent with or slightly better than what we've expected, and you've seen the coverage ratio in card roughly stay flat.\nI think it's important to note that even in a period where projected losses in future quarters are lower than today and might otherwise indicate a release, we could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat or only modestly declines as we incorporate some of that uncertainty into the allowance. Eventually, in a scenario like that, after a period of coverage stability like we've seen, you would see coverage coming down in the release of non-growth-related reserves.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nNIM?\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nNIM? Sure. There's a lot of factors at play with NIM, and maybe I'll do the same housekeeping with NIM just to remind everyone that in the first quarter, with one fewer day, we're going to see roughly a seven basis point headwind there. Let me then also enumerate here the puts and takes to NIM.\nOn the tailwind side, growth in card balances as a percentage of the balance sheet, and even within those balances, possibly higher revolve rate. Certainly a tailwind, and that's something we've seen over the last couple of quarters. Also, a lower cash balance. We've talked about this before, but cash balances today, in total of $43 billion, I think the number is, with about $37 billion at the Fed, is quite a bit higher than pre-pandemic. I don't think we'll get back to where we were pre-pandemic, but I would expect over time that we'll come down from today's level. That would also be a tailwind to NIM. On the headwind side, even though the Fed has stopped moving up in July, we continue to see some deposit product rotation, and it creates a bit of upward pressure to the deposit betas.\nEven if the Fed starts decreasing rates, we're going to see the assets repriced more quickly than the deposits. The competitive environment and the backdrop of QT will potentially have an impact on betas on a downward cycle. That would create a bit of margin pressure. A couple of other things that I would just highlight as potential headwinds are the uncertainty around potential regulatory changes that could impact interest income, as well as just the path of credit. You've seen suppression go up over the last few quarters as losses have gone up. That also creates some pressure to NIM.\nI know that that was a list of puts and takes, but I partially go into that level of detail to say it's kind of hard to say where NIM is going to go in the near term, especially because the path of interest rates remains fairly wide at this point, but kind of gives you a sense of all of the forces at play. Over the much longer term, I would say there's nothing really structurally different about our balance sheet from where it was pre-pandemic that leads me to believe that NIM will be materially different than where it was based on at least what we know today.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good evening, everyone.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nHey, Ryan.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nHey, Ryan.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nRich, when I looked, you put about $4 billion of marketing expense for the second straight year, and you're continuing to drive strong growth. We're hearing about some others with a little bit of a more cautious tone on growth. Maybe just talk about, are you leaning in, and do you expect marketing to increase? Really, where are you seeing the best opportunities in the market, and how are you thinking about growth looking ahead? Thanks. I have a follow-up.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nOkay. Thanks, Ryan. We feel very good about the opportunities in the marketplace. We are leaning in. We're definitely leaning in. You can see, obviously, there was quite a lot of marketing in the fourth quarter, but we continue to see opportunities across the board, especially in the card business.\nJust pulling up there a few key factors driving our marketing that we want to continue to emphasize. First of all, we're just really excited about the growth opportunities across our business. We're making, we have, over the last number of years, made some what we call sort of adjustments around the edges and trimming around the edges. Lately, there's really even not a lot of trimming around the edges. We're in a very sort of stable place with respect to the business we're going after, the results we're getting, and the zeal that we have to capitalize on that. I think our technology transformation, of course, has really been beneficial, but it allows us to leverage more data and more machine learning models to identify basically more attractive opportunities for investment, and to create better and more customized solutions for customers along the way.\nJust the overall opportunities continue to be very strong. The second part of our marketing investment, of course, relates to our quest to win at the top of the market. We've been going after heavy spenders now for almost 15 years. That needs sustained high levels of investment. You can see those out in the marketplace in flagship products, in groundbreaking experiences like things like best-in-class digital customer experiences, really high-level elite customer servicing, online travel portal, and in the intersection of risk management and the quest to go to the top of the market, the incredible importance of advanced fraud defenses to ensure that the card always works. Increasingly, we're also just rolling out exclusive services and experiences that aren't available in the general marketplace, such as airport lounges and access to select properties. We continue to lean into growth here.\nObviously, that quest toward the top of the market involves quite a bit of marketing investment and a lot of upfront investment for annuities that are just wonderful, long-lasting, fabulous annuities. The third vector of real marketing investment is our continuing efforts to build our national bank. Just as a reminder, we have a smaller branch footprint, so we lean more heavily on our technology investments, our digital experiences, our café network, and our brand and marketing investments to continue to organically build this national bank. We are really pleased with the traction there. It's been a lot of years in the making, but we are definitely leaning in there and love the results. Ryan, those are kind of the window into how we're thinking about it and the compelling opportunities behind across the board that we see.\nWe are continuing to capitalize on the opportunity as we see it.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Rich, if you put late fees aside for the first part of my question, you talked about stable to modest improvement, which, excluding late fees, would imply continued improvement on the operating efficiency. Do you think we're back, excluding late fees, on a sustained journey of improving efficiency like you were talking about before the pandemic? Second, just how are you thinking about the timing of offsetting late fees? Thank you.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nYeah, thank you. Our story about efficiency, I think, has been a very consistent story for a bunch of years. I think a lot of companies drive efficiency by just continuing to cut costs on their way to greatness. We have certainly put a lot of energy into the cost side of our business.\nReally, it's been about building a business model powered by our technology and the customer experiences we're building to drive revenue growth and efficiency, both at the same time. We've talked about how so much of this is powered by technology, and we continue to see the benefits of that. We, on the one hand, keep leaning into technology and keep investing there. On the other hand, we see growing opportunities to drive efficiency as a beneficiary of the technology investment. Pulling way up, while any particular year can be different from overall trends, we continue to believe that an important part of the value proposition with investors and the benefit of the years of investment we're making is to continue to drive greater operating efficiency. Did you have a CFPB question? Yes. Let me turn Ryan to talk about that.\nThe CFPB's late fee proposal, as currently contemplated, would reduce late fees by approximately 75%. While the CFPB's proposal has not been finalized, we expect the CFPB to publish a proposal soon. Once the CFPB publishes its final rule, we expect there to be industry litigation that could delay or block the implementation of the rule. This litigation will likely delay the implementation of the rule until at least the second half of this year, and maybe longer. You saw we talked about an estimate of October. If the proposed rule is implemented, there will be a significant impact to our P&L in the near term relative to what our path would have been. However, we have a set of mitigating actions that we're working through that we believe will gradually resolve this impact a couple of years after the rule goes into effect.\nThese choices include changes to our policies, our products, and investment choices. Some of these actions will take place before the rule change takes effect, and a few are already underway. Many will come after the rule change takes effect.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nArren Cyganovich\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThanks. I was hoping you'd talk a little bit about the auto business. You continue to kind of pull back a little bit from that side, thinking about how you're feeling about potentially increasing some originations. Still a healthy amount of originations at $27 billion this year, but just wondering when you might make a pivot there.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nThanks, Arren. We have been cautious in auto for a couple of years now. We've noted over this period of time a number of headwinds in the business.\nLet's tally them up. Margin pressure from the interest rate cycle, normalizing credit, vehicle values normalizing from their all-time highs, and affordability pressures stemming from the combined effects of elevated interest rate and still high car prices. Now, as you know, we don't work backwards from growth targets. We remained disciplined in our originations, setting pricing and terms that we're comfortable with, and then take what the market gives us. Back in 2022, we raised price, tightened our credit box at the low end of the market, and took other steps to manage the resilience of our lending. As a result, our run rate of originations has been lower than like two years ago. As a result of our actions, we've been just very pleased with the performance of our auto originations. The credit performance has been really striking, which, of course, you can see.\nEven as vehicle values continue to normalize, risk on our most recent originations from 2023 remains below what we saw in our pre-pandemic originations, probably as the result of our actions. Vintage over vintage, that risk remains stable. The margins on new originations have improved as well, particularly over the last couple of months as interest rates have come down from their recent peaks. We feel quite good about the performance of our auto originations. We continue to adjust our strategies where we see opportunities for growth or emerging risk. Of course, that's what we always do. When we think about some of the headwinds, I think some of those headwinds are easing, and the results that we're seeing on our own book are really pretty striking and gratifying. That gives us a more bullish outlook, still with a note of caution.\n\nArren Cyganovich\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThank you.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nRick Shane\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co\n\nThanks for taking my questions this afternoon. Hey, Rich, you've given a framework for charge-offs into 2024. One of the observations we would make is that delinquencies, even through December, on a year-over-year basis, are up on a year-over-year basis, even though that increase has slowed substantially. That suggests, and very consistent with your description, that charge-offs will continue to rise through the first half of the year. What I'm curious about is, given that delinquencies are still up 100 basis points, 115 basis points year-over-year in December, when we look into the second half of the year, I understand seasonally that they will be down. Would you expect that charge-offs in the second half of the year will still be up versus 2023?\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nI think the best way to think about this is to focus on the most stable benchmarks, as our focus here is about stability. We're really looking at what are the most stable benchmarks that we can anchor to. That really leads us back to 2019, 2018. Let me just sort of speak in that, sort of double-click a little bit into my comments on that. Our delinquencies are above pre-pandemic levels, but they've been tracking with normal seasonality for quite some time. Now, compared to 2019, since August, we're running around 17% above the level for the same month of 2019. Compared to 2018, since May, we're running at around 13% above the level for the same month of 2018. At this point, we have a pretty good window into January 2024 as well, based on delinquency entries in December.\nThat looks like it's going to be another month of stability. We feel confident declaring that our delinquencies have stabilized. Of course, delinquencies are our best leading indicator of credit performance. Our charge-offs have been catching up to the stabilizing trend in our delinquencies over the second half of 2023. At this point, what we're declaring here is that our charge-offs are leveling off as well. Now, there's more month-to-month volatility in charge-offs than in delinquencies by quite a bit because every data point of delinquencies includes five months of delinquency inventories. Of course, charge-offs is looking at the relatively small number that falls off at the end of the last bucket. There was also some noise in the fourth quarter of 2019 that makes it less reliable as a charge-off benchmark.\nWe actually think 2018 is an even better benchmark for our charge-offs, for comparing our charge-offs in this fourth quarter that just happened to a past stable year. In the fourth quarter, our net charge-offs were about 15% above 2018 levels. Of course, 2018 rolled into 2019, so that's an appropriate benchmark to look at as we head into 2024 and compare to 2019. Now, when we look ahead, extrapolating from our current delinquency inventories and recent flow rates, we conclude that our net charge-offs are stabilizing at about 15% above 2019, with, of course, some typical month-to-month volatility and normal seasonality. Of course, the seeds of this stabilization have been planted for quite a long time now and partly driven by the choices that we made back in 2020 and 2021. Coming out of the pandemic, we were concerned about two trends.\nFintech's were flooding the market, especially the subprime market, with credit offers, creating the potential for credit worsening and adverse selection in our originations. We also anticipated that pandemic-era stimulus and forbearance would temporarily inflate consumer credit scores and that these would revert over time. We tightened our underwriting in anticipation of these effects, and we have continued to make adjustments at the margin since then. The result has been striking, that with all the kind of changes, the normalization, all the noise over the last number of years, there has been strikingly stable performance on our origination vintages. Basically, in our post-pandemic originations, each quarterly vintage for a given segment has been more or less on top of each other, and also relatively consistent with pre-pandemic vintages.\nOver time, this just created a lot of stability that increasingly moved into our portfolio, and it contributed to the stabilization of our portfolio credit trends. As we've looked at this, we said these are very good shoulders to stand on to have that much stabilization for so long. We, of course, all still waited to see exactly the manifestations ultimately of the portfolio stabilizing. Another factor contributing to stabilization is our recovery rate. Unusually low recoveries have been the largest driver of our overall charge-off rate running above pre-pandemic levels. This is, of course, because of the very low level of charge-offs over the past three years. Therefore, we had a low level of raw material for future recoveries.\nBy the way, just to Capital One point here, this is a larger effect for us than for most competitors because we tend to have meaningfully higher recovery rates than the industry average, and because we tend to work our own recoveries. They come in over time, not all at once like in a debt sale. We've recently observed that our recovery rate has stabilized and started to tick back up. Now that our recoveries inventory has started to rebuild, that's, of course, a good guy, although it's coming from a pretty low level. This also contributes to our confidence that our overall loss trends have stabilized. To your question, where you compare to 2023, what we have really done is really kind of anchor our benchmarking to the most stable years in sort of recent experience, 2018 and 2019.\nSince we've seen delinquencies and charge-offs stabilize relative to like quarters in those benchmarks, we felt the best language with which to describe where things are settling out is to do it as a multiple of those two generally stable years. We are entering 2024 now with a real sense of stability, and we've benchmarked where we are as a multiple of those two stable year benchmarks.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks. Maybe, Rich, just following up on that. I think that a lot of the marketing dollars in the card space have been spent at the transactor business.\nGiven that stability that you're talking about, and I assume the bulk of the dollars of loss, delinquency, and loss are coming from kind of the lower end of the card spectrum. Does that mean that that's an area for expansion in 2024? How should we think about that? I do have a follow-up.",
    "content3": "Richard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nSorry, Moshe. Are you saying is the lower end an area for expansion?\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nYes.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nYes. We feel good about all of our segments across the credit spectrum in card, and also the relative health of the consumer. You've known us for a long time, Moshe, and as long as we have for the decades we've been talking together, you know that we have a long history of delivering sustained resilience and profitability at the lower end of the marketplace. Let's just reflect on this for a second.\nIf you're talking about subprime credit card, this is a complex business that requires deep investment in information-based underwriting. We've spent decades developing and testing tailored product structures, and sort of honing the analytical, the operating, the underwriting, and marketing capabilities to attract and serve this franchise. Also, the number one, two, and three most important things to us has been resilience as we do this. What's really been pretty striking is how consistent our strategy has been over the years through the Great Recession and following that. We've talked about how the lower end of the marketplace, whether you're talking, by the way, there's a whole, when I talk about the lower end of the marketplace, obviously, there's a whole part of the marketplace that Capital One doesn't serve.\nIn terms of the lower end of the marketplace that we serve, if you look at either income or FICO and look at the normalization that's going on, we've seen very solid curing in that part of the market. In fact, it cured a little bit earlier than some of the other parts of the market. The curing story, the leveling off story we're talking about today is absolutely across the board. I do want to say, though, also, Moshe, relative to your point, you've had Fintech's who we were very concerned about flooding that end of the market some years ago. They certainly have massively dialed back.\nI think that the continued, when we see the success of our vintages, the stabilization, now the sort of stabilization overall of Capital One's whole portfolio and the dynamics in the marketplace, I think that we like the opportunities we see there, Moshe, and we will be leaning into that.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Just as a follow-up, I mean, you've talked in the past about not just the financial impact of the late fee, but also its deterrent impact. How do you think about that in terms of the resilience of that segment as we go forward post any changes to late fees? Maybe just as a side point, you did mention that you thought you could improve the efficiency ratio even with the late fee. I mean, that just seems like you'd have to take a couple of hundred million dollars out of expenses to do that.\nIf there's a way to talk about how that would happen and tack that onto the answer, that would help too. Thanks.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nMoshe, Capital One has pursued a strategy for many years of trying to create and deliver to the marketplace strikingly simple products. From sort of a mission and strategy point of view, we believe so much in this, and we built a brand over having very simple products. Things like, for example, on the banking side, no minimum balance requirements, no membership fees, and even no overdraft fees. Here we are, a company that has really, really reduced the fees. If we had one fee left, I think the fee we would most hang on to is the late fee because, to your point, it plays a very important role in the deterrent value to a consumer.\nAn analogy that we sometimes use is a speeding ticket. I think that if a speeding ticket were, let's say we had an $8 speeding ticket, I'm not sure that our highways would be quite as safe as they are now because if we're really trying to deter behavior that we think is really consequential for people, that really is the role of the fee. We've been very active in giving alerts to all of our customers when late payment due alerts, with a goal of not trying to maximize late fees, but actually trying to maximize the on-payment performance of our customers. Moshe, this is a question that we've been worried about, your question about what could be the impact on credit performance of individuals.\nIt's something that we're just going to have to, if this CFPB rule goes into effect, we're all going to experience together, sort of this not controlled experiment. We certainly mark us down for having concern about that. From a financial point of view, obviously, the late fees are an important thing on the P&L. As I've talked about, we have created a set of many actions across different types of things, from policies, products, pricing structures, and investment choices, to claw back the very significant economic impact. Some of those things are underway. Some of them, just to mention it, by the way, by the time we get there, when the rule is announced, some of the offsets are going to by then be into the run rate of the company, and a majority will still be waiting to happen.\nWith respect to the fourth quarter, the '25 is the big full-year effect. Obviously, something coming in late in the fourth, something coming in, in our estimate, in the fourth quarter doesn't have as much impact on the annual efficiency ratio, but it still does have an impact. Essentially, what's implied underneath it is quite a bit of progress on the efficiency ratio behind the flat to modestly down guidance that includes that fourth quarter effect.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks for taking my call. In the interest of time, given it's late in the call, I'll ask my two-parter all upfront here. First, on the marketing side, I know you indicated you expect to continue to lean in on marketing this year. What does that imply on how you're thinking about full-year marketing expense?\nI mean, could that mean that you'll see marketing come in above the $4 billion level that you saw this year? Could it be stable or a modest decline? My second question is on the credit side on commercial real estate office CRE. I know you had some lumpy losses this quarter and some pressure still in criticized and non-accruals. If you could just give us a little bit more color there in terms of what you charged off and your outlook on that front. Thank you.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nOkay, John, thanks for your good questions here. We don't typically give full-year marketing guidance. The reason is because marketing depends, of course, a lot on the opportunities that we see when we get there.\nWhat I wanted to just share in response to Ryan Nash's question is a continuation in the positivity that we feel both about the real-time numbers we're seeing of response and performance of our vintages and all of that, and also the sort of more structural investments that we're making in the business, particularly with respect to going after the heavy spenders. We don't have full-year guidance, but we certainly continue to like the opportunities that we see.\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nJohn, on the office side, it's virtually impossible to generalize office. It is incredibly property specific. We've talked in the past about us having a fair amount in Gateway Cities and having a mix of both A and BC properties. Frankly, the decomposition matters a whole lot less than the individual properties.\nWhat we saw in the quarter was a little more than $80 million of losses tied to office loans. We continue to not originate there. Balances have come down to about $2.3 billion, down about $150 million in the quarter. It's less than 1% of our total loans. As we charged off in the quarter, we had essentially reserved entirely for that amount, and then we built back up a little bit for the remaining portfolio to maintain the coverage at around 13%.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nDonald Fandetti\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nRich, you've made a lot of progress on heavy spenders. As you sort of look out, where are we, I guess, on that expense cycle?\nAre we sort of still looking at many years of acceleration, or do you hit some type of level where there's some scale kicking in? Just trying to get a sense on where we are on that investment cycle.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nWell, Don, it's certainly I think the quest to the heavy spender, to win in the heavy spender of the marketplace, it will be a quest as far out as we can see in the same way it is for the players, the small number of players who are really going after that business. The key part of it is we're getting more and more scale along the way. You've seen over the years the growth in purchase volume. What you don't see is the purchase volume growth rates by level of spender. In any segmentation we've been looking at, the growth rate's monotonically faster.\nThe more you go up toward the heavy spenders, it's just indicating we're getting a lot of traction there. I wouldn't want to say that we just have to do a blitz and then we're kind of done with the investment. The way that scale is achieved is by getting more and more customers in a business where all the players in the business, even including the largest, continue to invest in that business. We're really pleased with the traction, and that's why we continue to invest.\n\nDonald Fandetti\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThat's all I have. Thanks.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nBill Carcache\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you. Good evening, Rich and Andrew. I appreciate all of the very clear commentary on what you're seeing in credit.\nThere's a view that if we'd had a mild recession and experienced a purging of weaker credits, that would have provided a clear runway for growth coming out of that. Instead, the environment we're in is arguably a little bit muddier, and some would say still late cycle. Could you speak to that dynamic, Rich, and whether that weighs on how you're thinking about growth from here in any way? As a follow-up, I'll just ask it now for you, Andrew. Can you update us on how you're thinking about capital return from here?\n\nAndrew Young\n\nCFO, Capital One\n\nSure. Why don't I start? Bill, look, at this point, there still remains a number of uncertainty around capital, not the least of which is the endgame proposal.\nWe're all aware there's been quite a bit of advocacy there, and there remains a fair amount of uncertainty of where the rule will land, including things like the impact of AOCI, phase-in, ops risk, and other forces at play. You know as much as we do, and we're waiting to see what the final rule holds there. In addition to that, we're coming up on CCAR. We don't yet have the scenarios for this year. You look back at how impactful the scenario, as well as the starting balance sheet, is to those outcomes. You've seen our SCB fluctuate over the last four years from, I think, 10.1 down to 7, and now we're sitting here at 9.3. Waiting to get a little bit more clarity of what CCAR will hold.\nIn addition, we continue to see a range of outcomes in our own growth projections. Finally, I'll just point to the economy. The consensus view is growing of a soft landing, but there's still quite a wide range of outcomes there. Given all of those factors, we've chosen to operate for the last few quarters around 13%. We recognize that when we feel like we're in an excess capital position, that returning it is one way to create value. Under the SCB framework, we have that flexibility to manage repurchases dynamically. We'll use that flexibility when we think it's prudent to do so.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nBill, a comment on our continuing to lean in, given that some people might argue that the economic environment is late cycle. Certainly a great question.\nFirst of all, the bottom line is we are continuing to lean in. Obviously, we keep a wary eye out for things that could change. I sort of start with the health of the consumer. I think the US consumer remains a source of strength in the overall economy. The labor market has proven strikingly resilient over the past year, really defying the expectations of many economists in the face of rising interest rates. Consumer debt servicing burdens remain relatively low by historical standards, again, despite rising interest rates. Home prices are back, doing a bit better, and are generally near all-time highs. In aggregate, consumers across all income levels still have excess savings from the pandemic, although those numbers are declining. Inflation has moderated to the point that real wages are growing again after shrinking for almost two years.\nStudent loan repayments now, they resumed in October, but there's the 12-month on-ramp period and a new income-driven repayment plan, which will significantly reduce payments for lower-income borrowers. On the whole, I'd say consumers are in really quite good shape relative to most historical benchmarks. If we look inside our own portfolio, we still see higher average payments compared to 2019 by segment, by a really pretty sizable delta. We then look at the marketplace. You've seen in the auto business how at times we get alarmed by some of the practices or the pricing in the industry, and we pull back in ways that we haven't pulled back in the card business. I think we see a rational and stable competitive marketplace. It's very competitive, but it's rational, and it's stable. Most importantly, the results themselves.\nOur vintages just continue to come in on top of prior vintages. The trimming around the edges that we've done over the last few years have really, I think, allowed our results to have a stability to them that even has diverged from the sort of underlying not-as-good performance in the marketplace of things recently compared to the past. We have that real stability. We see the leveling off of our portfolio. We talk about our charge-offs leveling off at a level that's like 15% above 2019. It's interesting, actually, that's net charge-offs, but gross charge-offs are leveling off very close to the gross charge-off levels of 2018 and 2019. Actually, the thing that creates the differential is the lower recoveries that we've had in the wake of the inventory of recoveries being so much lower, inventory of charge-off debt.\nPulling way up and seeing the traction in our business, the success with our brand, the things that for competitive reasons we don't share in the marketplace, the traction on the tech side in terms of enabling us to create better, really unique, customized customer experiences, totally customized underwriting, the reaching to marketing channels that we hadn't even tapped before, all of this is putting us in a position to continue to pulling way up. Obviously, in the credit business, we always worry a lot. If I calibrate this relative to a lot of other times, I feel really quite good about this. I actually said I felt a lot less good a couple of years ago because I felt that the pandemic, well, from a credit point of view, who couldn't like those credit results?\nI said it actually is so abnormally good, the marketplace won't be able to help itself but create unusual practices, unresilient underwriting, etc. What we've had, if I can borrow the soft landing term from the economy conversations, is kind of a soft landing relative to the credit business. Landing is really quite the right word relative to Capital One, which I think really, as I've kind of declared today, has sort of landed here. I know some competitors still haven't fully landed. Pulling way up on this, I actually feel this is really quite a good time if I calibrate to all the times over the years in this exciting journey.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nDominick Gabriele\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nHey, great. Thanks so much for all the color on the call today.\nI just have two questions. Rich, what are you seeing, do you think, that's making the net charge-off stabilize 15% above 2019 levels? Is there something in the consumer payment behavior that's changed? Is there something you think that shifted the consumer in general where the credit card industry may be seeing a higher through-the-cycle net charge-off rate going forward or for Capital One in particular? And I just have a follow-up. Thanks so much.\n\nRichard Fairbank\n\nChairman and CEO, Capital One\n\nSo I actually believe that what we're really seeing here is a credit situation that's very similar to pre-pandemic. It is showing up right now. And I'm going to speak through the Capital One lens. I think I'm not going to universalize for the industry.\nBut as I mentioned to the prior answer there, that if you look at gross charge-offs where they're settling out for Capital One, now this is Capital One that has done a lot of trimming around the edges over the last a fair amount of trimming around the edges. I think we also did a very important choice that I'm not sure was universal. It might have been an unusual choice. But when we saw the incredibly strong credit performance of consumers, much of it driven by stimulus and forbearance, we sort of became alarmed about credit score grade inflation, if you will, and essentially intervened in our models to normalize so that we didn't get fooled by that. But this is the, and so as a result of that, we have stabilized. We're probably one of the first players to stabilize.\nWe've stabilized at this moment at 15% above 20%, say, benchmark to 2019 levels. Already, we said that number from a gross charge-off number is really sort of very close to 2019 levels. So the recovery's effect, which is a temporary effect, that our recoveries are so much lower because they just don't have as much inventory of charge-offs to collect on, that's a good guy that should help over time. So I think also, as we have talked about and we've talked about ever since the pandemic sort of we started coming out of the other side of the pandemic, we said there's another effect. Let's call it the delayed charge-off effect that if you think about all those charge-offs that would have happened, many of that would have happened in the pandemic but didn't.\nSome of them may have gotten reprieved for the long run, but a bunch of others we certainly have felt are going to charge-off over time. And that is a temporary effect that we think has been playing out over this normalization thing. We have ways that we try to measure it, but nobody can precisely measure this. But this is also something that leads to an elevation of charge-offs relative to probably what's an equilibrium. So if I speak from Capital One's point of view, our guidance was to guide you to the leveling off because of the lower recoveries effect right now. That's leveling off at a 15% above 2019. The underlying credit dynamics seem very similar to me to what was there in the past.\nI think even as we keep a wary eye on the economy, there's some just sort of actuarial good guys making their way through the business, and all other things being equal, that can help the credit metrics more and more show that they are strikingly similar to what was there before the pandemic. So, pulling way up, I don't think, and again, I'll speak. I don't think things have shifted. I think we're seeing some trends playing out. But for Capital One, we feel great about where we've stabilized, and we see a good assessment of our future.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP of Global Finance, Capital One\n\nWell, thank you very much, everyone, for joining us on the conference call tonight.

Andrew?\n\nAndrew M. Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the third quarter, Capital One earned $1.8 billion, or $4.45 per diluted common share. Pre-provision earnings of $4.5 billion were up 7% compared to the second quarter and 17% compared to the year ago quarter. Both period end and average loans held for investment increased 1% relative to the prior quarter. Driven by growth in our Domestic Card business. Period-end deposits increased 1% in the quarter, while average deposits were flat. Our percentage of FDIC insured deposits ended the quarter at 80% of total deposits.\nWe have provided additional details on deposit trends on Slide 18 in the appendix. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 4%, driven by both higher net interest and noninterest income. Noninterest expense increased 1% in the quarter, as higher marketing expense was partially offset by lower operating expense. Provision expense was $2.3 billion with $2 billion of net charge-offs and an allowance build of $322 million.\nTurning to Slide 4. I'll cover the allowance balance in greater detail. The $322 million increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to $15 billion as of September 30. The total company coverage ratio is now 4.75%, up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. Relative to last quarter's assumptions underlying the allowance, the baseline forecast in this quarter for most key economic variables improved.\nHowever, we continue to assume several key economic variables worsened from today's levels. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased by $349 million. The coverage ratio was largely flat at 7.79%. The predominant driver of the increased allowance was the growth in loans. The positive impact from the modestly improved economic outlook was largely offset by the impact of replacing the lost content of the third quarter of 2023 with a 12-month reasonable and supportable period, that now includes the third quarter of 2024.\nIn our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance declined by $136 million. The improved economic outlook and a decline in loan balances drove the release. And in our Commercial Banking business, the allowance increased by $97 million. The build reflected the impact of rising interest rates and other factors on certain commercial real estate and corporate borrowers, including our commercial office portfolio.\nOn Slide 17 in the appendix, we have included additional details on the office portfolio. I'll also note that in the third quarter, we completed the sale of approximately $900 million of loans from our commercial office portfolio that were previously marked as held for sale. The commercial -- the coverage ratio in the Commercial business increased by 12 basis points and now stands at 1.74%. Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was 155%. Up from 150% last quarter and 139% a year ago.\nTotal liquidity reserves in the quarter were largely flat at $118 billion. Higher cash balances were offset by a decline in the market value of our investment securities portfolio. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $45 billion, up about $3 billion from the prior quarter.\nTurning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Our third quarter net interest margin was 6.69%. 21 basis points higher than last quarter and 11 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in NIM was largely driven by higher card yields a continued mix shift towards card loans and 1 additional day in the quarter, partially offset by higher rate paid on deposits.\nTurning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 13%. Approximately 30 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was partially offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets, common and preferred dividends and the share repurchases we completed in the quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?\n\nRichard D. Fairbank\n\nFounder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows third quarter results in our credit card business. Credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. The domestic card business posted another strong quarter. Of year-over-year top line growth. Purchase volume for the third quarter was up 6% from the third quarter of last year. Ending loan balances increased $19 billion or about 16% year-over-year.\nAnd third quarter revenue was up 15% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin declined 31 basis points from the prior year quarter and remained strong at 18.24%. The decline was driven by 2 factors: First, loans grew faster than purchase volume and net interchange revenue in the quarter. This dynamic is a tailwind to revenue dollars, but a headwind to revenue margin. And second, charge-offs increased, so we reversed more finance charge and fee revenue. These factors were partially offset by an increase in revolve rate. On a linked quarter basis, the revenue margin increased seasonally by 48 basis points.\nDomestic Card credit results continue to normalize from the historically strong results we saw during the pandemic, consistent with our expectations. The charge-off rate for the quarter was up 220 basis points year-over-year to 4.4%. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 134 basis points from the prior year to 4.31%. On a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate was essentially flat and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 57 basis points. Both the monthly delinquency rate and the monthly charge-off rate are now modestly above 2019 levels.\nOur delinquencies are the best leading indicator of domestic card credit performance and the pace of delinquency rate normalization is slowing. Noninterest expense was essentially flat compared to the third quarter of '22 of 2022. Total company marketing expense of $972 million for the quarter was also relatively flat year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, marketing increased 10%. Our choices in domestic card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation.\nAnd our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business. As a result, we are leaning into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our domestic card franchise. As always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We expect fourth quarter marketing will be seasonally higher.\nSlide 12 shows third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the third quarter, auto originations declined 10% year-over-year, driven by the decline in auto originations, consumer banking ending loans decreased about $4.4 billion or 5.4% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were essentially flat. We posted another strong quarter in year-over-year retail deposit growth. Third quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up about $34 billion or 13% year-over-year.\nCompared to the sequential quarter, ending deposits were up about 2%. Average deposits were up 12% year-over-year and up 1% from the sequential quarter. Powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong results. Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter was down about 7% year-over-year driven by the higher rate paid on deposits and lower auto loan balances and margins. Noninterest expense was down about 6% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Lower operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing to support our national digital bank. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.77% up 72 basis points year-over-year.\nThe 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.64%, up 79 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was up 37 basis points, while the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 26 basis points, both of these linked quarter increases were better than typical seasonal expectations.\nSlide 13 shows third quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, Ending loan balances were essentially flat. Average loans were down about 2%. The decline is largely the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit. Both ending deposits and average deposits were down about 2% from the linked quarter, consistent with the general trend we've seen for several quarters as we continue to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances.\nThird quarter revenue was up 2% from the linked quarter. Noninterest expense was up about 6%. The commercial banking annualized charge-off rate for the third quarter declined 137 basis points from the second quarter to 0.25%. The second quarter charge-off rate was elevated by charge-offs we recognized when we moved the portfolio of commercial office loans to held for sale. We completed the sale of that portfolio in the third quarter.\nSlide 17 of the third quarter 2023 results presentation shows additional information about the remaining commercial office portfolio. Which is less than 1% of our total loans. The Commercial Banking criticized performing loan rate was 8.08%, up 135 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized nonperforming loan rate was essentially flat at 0.9%.\nIn closing, we continued to deliver solid results in the third quarter. We posted another quarter of strong top line growth in domestic card revenue, purchase volume and loans. The pace of domestic card delinquency normalization slowed. We grew consumer and total deposits. And we added liquidity and capital to further strengthen our already strong and resilient balance sheet. Turning now to operating efficiency. The third quarter operating efficiency ratio was particularly strong. Operating efficiency ratio can vary from quarter-to-quarter, driven by the timing of revenue and operating expense.\nWe expect 2023 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments, will be modestly down compared to 2022. Pulling way up, our modern technology capabilities are generating an expanding set of opportunities across our businesses. We are driving improvements in underwriting, modeling and marketing as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale. At our tech engine drives growth, efficiency improvement and enduring value creation over the long term. We remain well positioned to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and to thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?",

[Operator Instructions].Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP, Global Finance\n\nThanks very much, Amy, and welcome, everybody, to Capital One's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

Andrew?\n\nAndrew M. Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the second quarter, Capital One earned $1.4 billion or $3.52 per diluted common share. Pre-provision earnings of $4.2 billion were up 7% compared to the first quarter and 16% compared to the year ago quarter. Both period end and average loans held for investment increased 1% relative to the prior quarter, driven by growth in our Domestic Card business. Period-end deposits declined 2% in the quarter, largely driven by tax-related outflows. Our percentage of FDIC insured deposits grew 1% and to end the quarter at 79% of total deposits. We have provided additional details on deposit trends on Slide 18 in the appendix.\nRevenue in the linked quarter increased 1% driven by noninterest income. Noninterest expense decreased 3% in the quarter driven by declines in both operating and marketing expenses. Provision expense was $2.5 billion, with $2.2 billion of net charge-offs and an allowance build of $318 million.\nTurning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The $318 million increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to $14.6 billion as of June 30. The total company coverage ratio is now 4.7%, up 6 basis points from the prior quarter. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5.\nIn our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased by $544 million, increasing our coverage ratio by 12 basis points to 7.78%. 3 factors impacted the allowance in the quarter. The predominant factor was growth as ending domestic card loans grew about $5 billion in the quarter. The second factor was the impact of removing the relatively lower loss content from the second quarter of 2023 and replacing it with higher forecasted loss content for the second quarter of 2024, and as part of our 12-month reasonable and supportable period. These 2 factors were partially offset by an improvement in our economic outlook, which still assumes worsening from today's level. but less so than our outlook a quarter ago.\nIn our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance declined by $20 million, mostly driven by the decline in loans. The coverage ratio was essentially flat at 2.83%. And finally, in our Commercial Banking business, the allowance decreased by $218 million. In the quarter, we moved approximately $900 million of loans from our commercial office portfolio to held for sale as we pursue the potential sale of a portion of the portfolio to reduce future risk. With that move, we recognized charge-offs that were already largely reflected in our allowance, which was the primary factor driving this quarter's decrease. The decrease in allowance from moving these loans to HFS was partially offset by a build for our remaining commercial office portfolio. We have provided additional details on our commercial office portfolio in the appendix of tonight's presentation. The coverage ratio in the Commercial business decreased by 20 basis points and now stands at 1.62%.\nTurning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the second quarter was 150%, up from 148% last quarter and 144% a year ago. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter decreased by about $9 billion to $118 billion, driven by modest declines in both cash and the investment portfolio. Our cash position ended the quarter at $42 billion, down about $5 billion from the prior quarter. We are also disclosing our net stable funding ratio for the first time this quarter. The preliminary average quarterly [ NFFR ] for both the first and second quarters was 134%, well above the 100% regulatory minimum.\nTurning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Our second quarter net interest margin was 6.48%, 12 basis points lower than last quarter, and 6 basis points lower than a year ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decline in NIM was driven by deposit and wholesale funding costs increasing more than asset yields. That impact was partially offset by a continued mix shift towards card loans and 1 additional day in the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 12.7%, approximately 20 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was partially offset by changes in risk-weighted assets, common and preferred dividends and the $150 million of share repurchases we completed in the quarter.\nAt the end of the second quarter, the unrealized losses in AOCI from our AFS investment portfolio were $7.6 billion. If we were to include the full impact of these unrealized losses in our regulatory capital, our CET1 ratio would have ended the quarter at 10.4%.\nDuring the quarter, the Federal Reserve released the results of their stress test. Our preliminary stressed capital buffer requirement, which will be effective on October 1 of this year, is 4.8%, and resulting in a total Fed capital requirement of 9.3%. We continue to estimate that our longer-term CET1 capital need is around 11%. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?\n\nRichard D. Fairbank\n\nFounder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. The Domestic Card business posted another quarter of strong year-over-year top line growth. Purchase volume for the second quarter was up 7% from the second quarter of last year. Ending loan balances increased $21 billion or about 18% year-over-year. And second quarter revenue was also up 18% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin declined 40 basis points from the prior year quarter and remained strong at 17.76%.\nThe decline was driven by 2 factors: first, loans grew faster than purchase volume and net interchange revenue in the quarter. This dynamic is a tailwind to revenue dollars, but a headwind to revenue margin. And second, charge-offs increased, so we reversed more finance charge and fee revenue. These factors were partially offset by an increase in the revolve rate.\nThe domestic card charge-off rate for the quarter was up 212 basis points year-over-year to 4.38%. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 139 basis points from the prior year to 3.74% and is now above its June 2019 level. The charge-off rate hasn't quite caught up yet. But based on what we see in our delinquencies, we expect the monthly charge-off rate will reach 2019 levels in the third quarter.\nNoninterest expense was up 8% from the second quarter of 2022, driven by higher operating expense, partially offset by a modest year-over-year decline in marketing. Total company marketing expense was down about 12% year-over-year in the second quarter to $886 million. In most years, marketing is lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half. In 2022, that pattern was less pronounced. In 2023, our marketing is following a more typical historical pattern.\nOur choices in domestic card are the biggest driver of total company marketing, and we continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. We continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our domestic card franchise. And as always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks.\nWe're seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in domestic card new accounts, purchase volume and loans across our card business. And strong momentum in our decade-long focus on building a franchise with heavy spenders at the top of the marketplace continues.\nSlide 12 shows second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the second quarter, auto originations declined 31% year-over-year. driven by the decline in auto originations, Consumer Banking ending loans decreased about $4.3 billion or 5% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were down 1%. We posted another quarter of strong year-over-year retail deposit growth. Second quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up about $30 billion or 12% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending deposits were down about 2%, largely as a result of typical seasonal tax outflows. Average deposits were up 12% year-over-year and up 2% from the sequential quarter. Powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong results.\nConsumer Banking revenue was up 8% year-over-year driven by deposit growth. Noninterest expense was down about 4% compared to the second quarter of 2022 driven by the timing of marketing to support our national digital bank. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.40%, up 79 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.38%, up 91 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was down 13 basis points while the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 38 basis points.\nSlide 13 shows second quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances were down 2%. Average loans were down 1%. The decline is largely the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit as well as the movement of loans to held for sale that Andrew discussed.\nEnding deposits were down 4% from the linked quarter. Average deposits declined 5%. We saw normal outflows throughout the second quarter as clients use their cash for payroll, tax payments and other business as usual disbursements. And consistent with the general trend we've seen for several quarters, we also continued to manage down selective, less attractive commercial deposit balances. Second quarter revenue was up 3% from the linked quarter while noninterest expense was down about 9% from the linked quarter. Second quarter commercial credit trends were largely driven by the commercial office portfolio, inclusive of the movement of loans to held for sale. The commercial banking annualized charge-off rate increased to 1.62% in the second quarter. The criticized performing loan rate was 6.73%, down 58 basis points compared to the linked quarter and the criticized nonperforming loan rate increased 10 basis points to 0.89%.\nIn closing, we continued to deliver top line growth in domestic card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the second quarter. We continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient domestic card growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities and build our franchise and to drive growth in our national digital bank. And we continue to expect that the full year 2023 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be roughly flat to modestly down compared to 2022.\nPulling way up, Capital One is at the vanguard of a very small number of players who are investing to build and leverage a modern technology infrastructure from the bottom of the tech stack up to put themselves in an advantaged position to win as banking goes digital. Our modern technology capabilities are generating an expanding set of opportunities across our business. We are driving improvements in underwriting, modeling and marketing as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale and our tech engine drives growth, efficiency improvement and enduring value creation over the long term.\nOur investments to transform our technology and to drive resilient growth, put us in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?",

Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone.\nI'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the first quarter, Capital One earned [ $960 million ]or $2.31 per diluted common share. Pre-provision earnings of $4 billion were flat to the fourth quarter and up 3% relative to the fourth quarter net of adjustments. Period-end loans held for investment declined 1% and average loans were flat. Total deposits grew throughout the quarter, increasing 4% on average and 5% on an ending basis. The increase in deposits was driven by strong retail deposit inflows, which was slightly offset by a decline in our commercial deposits. Our strong retail deposit growth drove our percentage of FDIC insured deposits, up 2% to end the quarter at 78% of total deposits.\nWe have provided additional details on deposit trends on Slide 18 in the appendix. Revenue in the linked quarter decreased 2%, primarily driven by lower noninterest income while net interest income was largely flat. Noninterest expense decreased 3% in the quarter, driven by a decline in marketing from the seasonally higher fourth quarter. Operating expenses were up about 2% on a GAAP basis and roughly flat net of the fourth quarter adjusting items. Provision expense was $2.8 billion, driven by net charge-offs of $1.7 billion and an allowance build of $1.1 billion.\nTurning to Slide 4, I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The $1.1 billion increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to $14.3 billion as of March 31. The total company coverage ratio is now 4.64%, up 40 basis points from the prior quarter. In our allowance, our assumptions for key economic variables remain similar to those of last quarter. We continue to assume economic worsening from today's levels on most measures. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased by $867 million, increasing our coverage ratio by 69 basis points to 7.66%. Our build in the quarter was primarily driven by 3 factors: the first factor is the impact of underlying growth in the quarter, which replaced seasonal balances from the fourth quarter for which we held minimal allowance.\nThe second factor is the impact of removing the relatively lower loss content from the first quarter of 2023 and replacing it with higher forecasted loss content for the first quarter of 2024. Recall that our allowance methodology uses a 12-month reasonable and supportable forecast period, before it begins to revert to our historical loss average with additional consideration of qualitative factors.\nAnd finally, the third factor in our allowance build was the impact of acquiring the BJ's portfolio in the quarter. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance declined by $32 million, mostly driven by the decline in loans. The coverage ratio increased by 2 basis points and now stands at 2.82%. And finally, in our Commercial Banking business, the allowance increased by $245 million.\nThe coverage ratio increased by 28 basis points and now stands at 1.82%. The allowance increase was driven by a $262 million reserve build related to our $3.6 billion commercial office portfolio. The coverage on the commercial office portfolio increased about 770 basis points and now stands at 13.9%. We have provided additional details on this portfolio on Slide 17 of the presentation.\nTurning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter was 148%, up from 143% last quarter and 140% a year ago. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased by $20 billion to $127 billion, primarily driven by increased levels of cash. Our cash position ended the quarter at $47 billion, up $16 million from the prior quarter. This increase in our cash position was primarily driven by the strong consumer deposit growth I referenced earlier.\nWe expect average cash balances in the near term to be elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. In addition to the higher cash, the market value of our AFS securities portfolio grew $5 billion to $82 billion at the end of the quarter.\nTurning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Our first quarter net interest margin was 6.6%, 24 basis points lower than last quarter and 11 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The 24 basis point quarter-over-quarter decline in NIM was driven by 2 factors: first, 15 basis points of the decline was a result of having 2 fewer days in the quarter; and second, the mix impact of the elevated cash balances that I previously described pressured NIM by approximately 11 basis points. Outside of these 2 effects, higher asset yields roughly offset higher funding costs.\nTurning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 12.5%, flat to the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter and lower risk-weighted assets were offset by common and preferred dividends, the $150 million of share repurchase we completed in the quarter and a 17 basis point impact from the phase-in of the CECL transition. At the end of the first quarter, the unrealized losses in AOCI from our AFS investment portfolio were $6.7 billion.\nIf we were to include the impact of these unrealized losses in our regulatory capital, our CET1 ratio would have ended the quarter at 10.5%, and we continue to estimate that our longer-term CET1 capital need is around 11%. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?\n\nRichard D. Fairbank\n\nFounder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone.\nI'll begin on Slide 10 with first quarter results in our credit card business. Year-over-year growth in loans and purchase volume drove an increase in revenue compared to the prior year quarter. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. In the first quarter, strong year-over-year growth in every top line metric continued in our Domestic Card business. Purchase volume for the first quarter was up 10% from the first quarter of 2022, ending loan balances increased $23 billion or about 21% year-over-year and revenue was up 17% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin declined 58 basis points from the prior year quarter and remains strong at 17.7%.\nRevenue margin continues to benefit from growth in the high-margin segments of our card business. In the first quarter, that benefit was more than offset by 2 factors: first, loans are currently growing at a faster rate than purchase volume and net interchange revenue. That dynamic is a tailwind to revenue dollars, but a headwind to revenue margin.\nAnd second, as charge-offs increase, we're reversing more finance charge and fee revenue. Both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate continued to normalize. The domestic card charge-off rate for the quarter was up 192 basis points year-over-year to 4.04%. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 134 basis points from the prior year to 3.66% and is now essentially at its March 2019 level. The charge-off rate hasn't caught up yet. But based on what we see in our delinquencies, we think the monthly charge-off rate we'll get back to 2019 levels around the middle of this year. Noninterest expense was up 11% from the first quarter of 2022, driven by higher operating expense, partially offset by a modest year-over-year decline in marketing. Total company marketing expense was $897 million in the first quarter.\nOur choices in domestic card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing. First quarter marketing was down about 2% from the year ago quarter and down about 20% from the fourth quarter of 2022 as the first quarter is typically the seasonal low point for domestic card marketing. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation, and we're leaning into marketing to drive resilient growth. As always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We are seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in domestic card new accounts, purchase volume and loans across our card business and strong momentum and our decade-long focus on heavy spenders at the top of the marketplace continues.\nSlide 12 shows first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the first quarter, auto originations declined 47% year-over-year and 6% from the linked quarter. Driven by the decline in auto originations, Consumer Banking ending loans decreased $2.2 billion or 3% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were down 2%. We posted another quarter of strong retail deposit growth. First quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up almost $33 billion or 13% year-over-year and up 8% compared to the sequential quarter. Average deposits were up 9% year-over-year and up 6% from the sequential quarter. Powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to get good traction.\nConsumer Banking revenue was up 12% year-over-year driven by deposit growth. Noninterest expense was up 4% compared to the first quarter of 2022. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.53%, up 87 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.0%, up 115 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was down 13 basis points and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 62 basis points. The linked quarter trends were consistent with expected seasonal patterns.\nSlide 13 shows first quarter results for our commercial banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, first quarter ending loan balances were down 1% and average loans were down 2%. The decline is the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit as well as higher customer paydowns in the quarter. Ending deposits were down 6% from the linked quarter. Average deposits declined 7% decline. We saw normal outflows throughout the first quarter as clients use their cash for payroll, tax payments and other business as usual disbursements. And consistent with the general trend we've seen for several quarters, we also continued to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances.\nFirst quarter revenue was up 10% from the linked quarter. Recall that revenue in the prior quarter was unusually low, driven by a company neutral move in internal funds transfer pricing. Excluding this prior quarter impact, first quarter commercial revenue would have been down 10%, driven by a decline in noninterest income from our capital markets and agency businesses. Noninterest expense was down 5% from the linked quarter. The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 9 basis points. criticized loan balances increased primarily in our commercial real estate business.\nThe criticized performing loan rate increased 60 basis points from the linked quarter to 7.31% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was up 5 basis points from the linked quarter to 0.79%.\nIn closing, once again, we delivered strong growth in domestic card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the first quarter. We continue to see opportunities for resilient domestic card growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities, and we continue to lean into marketing.\nAnd as always, we're closely monitoring and assessing competitive dynamics and economic uncertainty. In our Consumer Banking business, loans declined modestly and consumer deposits grew in the quarter. Our national digital-first consumer banking strategy continued to grow and gain traction, and we're leaning into marketing to grow our consumer deposit franchise. In our commercial bank, ending loans and deposits were down compared to linked quarter, reflecting our cautious stance in the commercial banking marketplace. Our commercial bank continues to focus on winning through deep industry specialization. And across our businesses, credit trends continued to normalize in the quarter, and we reached or we're approaching pre-pandemic levels at quarter end.\nWe continue to expect that the full year 2023 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be roughly flat to modestly down compared to 2022. And our balance sheet demonstrated its strength through the recent period of turmoil in the banking industry. In the first quarter, we built additional balance sheet strength as we increased allowance for credit losses, grew retail deposits and maintained or increased strong levels of capital and liquidity.\nPulling way up, the future of everything in banking is digital. And with each passing quarter, banking is accelerating toward its inevitable destination. Capital One is at the vanguard of a very small number of players who are investing to build and leverage a modern technology infrastructure from the bottom of the tech stack up to truly transform technology and put themselves in an advantaged position to win as banking goes digital. Our modern technology capabilities are generating an expanding set of opportunities across our businesses. We are driving improvements in underwriting, modeling and marketing as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale. We are transforming the customer experience in banking. And our tech engine drives growth efficiency improvement and enduring value creation over the long term.\nOur investments to transform our technology and to drive resilient growth, put us in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?\n\nUnknown Executive\n\n[Operator Instructions]\nIf you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call.

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2022 Capital One Financial Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP, Global Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThanks very much, Victor, and welcome, everybody, to Capital One's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there.\nIn addition to the press release and financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our fourth quarter 2022 results. With me this evening are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Andrew Young, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Andrew will walk you through the presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and the press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors, then click on quarterly earnings release.\nPlease note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials. Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNumerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements. For more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-Looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our annual and quarterly reports, which are accessible at Capital One's website and filed with the SEC.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew?\n\nAndrew M. Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $1.2 billion or $3.03 per diluted common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $7.4 billion or $17.91 per share. Included in the results for the fourth quarter were 2 adjusting items, which collectively benefited pretax earnings by $105 million. Net of these adjustments, fourth quarter earnings per share were $2.82 and full year earnings per share or $17.71.\nOn a linked quarter basis, period-end loans grew 3% and average loans grew 2%, driven by growth in our Domestic Card business. This loan growth, coupled with net interest margin expansion, drove revenue up 3% on a linked-quarter basis.\nNoninterest expense grew 3% in the linked quarter, driven by an increase in marketing expenses while operating expenses were largely flat. Net of the adjustments I mentioned earlier, operating expenses were up 2.4%. Provision in the quarter -- provision expense in the quarter was $2.4 billion, driven by net charge-offs of $1.4 billion and an allowance build of about $1 billion.\nTurning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The $1 billion increase in allowance in the fourth quarter brings our total company year-end allowance balance up to $13.2 billion, increasing the total company coverage ratio by 22 basis points to 4.24%.\nI'll cover the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased by $795 million, bringing our coverage ratio to 6.97%. Three things put upward pressure on our card allowance. The first factor was the continued credit normalization in our portfolio. The second factor was a modestly worse economic outlook than our assumption a quarter ago. And finally, we built allowance for the loan growth in the quarter.\nThe impact of the fourth quarter loan growth on the allowance is more muted than typical loan growth given the seasonal nature of these balances. These 3 factors were modestly offset by a release in our qualitative factors.\nIn our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance increased by $129 million, driving a 20 basis point increase in coverage to 2.8%. The build was primarily driven by continued credit normalization in our auto business, including lower recovery rates. The second factor also putting upward pressure on our allowance is the impact of a modestly worse economic outlook. These 2 factors were modestly offset by a release in our qualitative factors.\nAnd finally, in our commercial business, the allowance increased $73 million, resulting in a 9 basis point increase in coverage to 1.54%. This was largely driven by reserve builds for our office portfolio.\nTurning to Page 6. I'll discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was 143%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Total liquidity reserves increased by $14 billion to $107 billion. Strong consumer deposit growth throughout the quarter drove cash balances higher and allowed us to pay down prior FHLB borrowings.\nTurning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Our net interest margin was 6.84% in the fourth quarter, 24 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and 4 basis points higher than the prior quarter. The 4 basis point linked quarter increase in NIM was driven by higher asset yields and a balance sheet mix shift towards card loans. This impact was mostly offset by higher deposit and wholesale funding costs.\nTurning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.5% at the end of the fourth quarter, up about 30 basis points relative to last quarter. The $1.2 billion of net income in the quarter was partially offset by growth in risk-weighted assets, dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased approximately $150 million of common stock in the quarter, bringing the repurchases for the full year to $4.8 billion. We continue to estimate that our longer-term CET1 capital need is around 11%.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?\n\nRichard D. Fairbank\n\nFounder, Chairman, CEO & President, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Andrew, and welcome, everybody. I'll begin on Slide 10 with fourth quarter results in our Credit Card business. Year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans, coupled with strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.\nCredit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. In the fourth quarter, strong year-over-year growth in every top line metric continued in our Domestic Card business. Purchase volume for the fourth quarter was up 9% from the fourth quarter of 2021.\nEnding loan balances increased $22.9 billion or about 21% year-over-year. Ending loans grew 8% from the sequential quarter. And revenue was up 19% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans as well as strong revenue margin. Both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate continued to normalize and were below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 3.2%, up 173 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 3.43%, 121 basis points above the prior year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 102 basis points and the delinquency rate was up 46 basis points.\nNoninterest expense was up 12% from the fourth quarter of 2021, which includes an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was about $1.1 billion in the quarter.\nOur choice in domestic card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing. In our Domestic Card business, we continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth. We're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We're seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in domestic card new accounts, purchase volume and loans across our card business and strong momentum in our decade-long focus on heavy spenders at the top of the marketplace continues.\nSlide 12 shows fourth quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see the effects of our choice to pull back on auto growth in response to competitive pricing dynamics that have pressured industry margins. Auto originations declined 32% year-over-year and 20% from the linked quarter.\nDriven by the decline in auto originations, Consumer Banking loan growth continued to be slower than previous quarters. Fourth quarter ending loans grew 3% compared to the year ago quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were down 2%. Fourth quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up 6% year-over-year, and up 5% over the sequential quarter. Average deposits were up 4% year-over-year and up 3% from the sequential quarter. Our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to get good traction.\nConsumer Banking revenue was up 10% year-over-year as growth in auto loans and deposits was partially offset by the year-over-year decline in auto margins. Noninterest expense was up 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by investments in the digital capabilities of our auto and retail banking businesses and marketing for our national digital bank.\nThe auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate continued to normalize in the fourth quarter. The charge-off rate for the fourth quarter was 1.66%, up 108 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.62%, up 130 basis points year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 61 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 77 basis points.\nSlide 13 shows fourth quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, fourth quarter ending loan balances were down 1% and average loans were flat. Ending deposits were down 1% from the linked quarter. Average deposits grew 7%.\nFourth quarter revenue was down 23% from the linked quarter. The decline was primarily driven by an internal funds transfer pricing impact that was offset by an equivalent increase in the other category and was, therefore, neutral to the company. Excluding this impact, fourth quarter commercial revenue would have been down about 6% quarter-over-quarter and up 2% year-over-year.\nNoninterest expense was up 2% from the linked quarter. The commercial banking annualized charge-off rate was 6 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate increased 74 basis points from the linked quarter to 6.71% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was up 17 basis points from the linked quarter to 0.74%.\nIn closing, we continue to drive strong growth in card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the fourth quarter. Loan growth in our Consumer Banking business was slower compared to previous quarters as we continued to pull back on auto originations. Consumer deposits grew. And in our Commercial Banking business, ending loans and deposits were roughly flat compared to the linked quarter.\nCharge-off rates and delinquency rates continue to normalize across our business and were below pre-pandemic levels. Total company operating expense net of adjustments was up 2.4% from the linked quarter. Our annual operating efficiency ratio for full year 2022 was 44.5% net of adjustments, a 15 basis points improvement from full year 2021. And we expect that the full year 2023 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be roughly flat to modestly down compared to 2022.\nPulling way up, we continue to see opportunities for resilient asset growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities. We continue to closely monitor and assess competitive dynamics and economic uncertainty. Powered by our modern digital technology, we're continuously improving our proprietary underwriting, marketing and product capabilities.\nWe're focusing on efficiency improvement and we're managing capital prudently. As a result of our investments to transform our technology and to drive resilient growth, we're in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios.\nAnd now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP, Global Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) Please start the Q&A.",

Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNumerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements. For more information on these factors, please see the section titled, Forward-Looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our annual and quarterly reports accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew M. Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the second quarter, Capital One earned $1.7 billion or $4.20 per diluted common share. On a linked quarter basis, period-end loans grew 3% and average loans grew 5%, largely driven by growth across our Domestic Card and Commercial businesses. In the linked quarter, revenue increased 7%, largely driven by growth in net interest income. The loan growth I just described and NIM expansion, both contributed to the increase in net interest income. I will touch on the NIM more in a moment.\nNoninterest expense grew 8% in the quarter, driven by an increase in operating expenses. Higher headcount and the associated compensation costs were the single biggest driver of the linked quarter increase. In addition to compensation expenses, the collective impact of a number of smaller items also drove up Q3 expenses. Provision expense in the quarter was $1.7 billion, driven by net charge-offs of $931 million and a $734 million allowance build.\nTurning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The total company's $734 million allowance build in the quarter brings our allowance balance up to $12.2 billion as of September 30. Our total company coverage ratio increased 14 basis points to 4.02%.\nTurning to Slide 5. I'll discuss the allowance and coverage across each of our business segments. As you can see in the graph, our allowance coverage ratio increased modestly in each of our segments. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased $530 million, bringing our coverage ratio to 6.9%. The $6 billion of loan growth in the quarter drove the majority of the allowance build. The impact of continued normalization and a modestly worse corporate economic outlook were partially offset by the release of a portion of our qualitative factors linked to uncertainty in the economy.\nIn our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance increased by $61 million, driving a 9 basis point increase in coverage to 2.6%. The modestly worse corporate economic outlook I just mentioned and expectations of credit normalization drove the allowance builds. And finally, the allowance increased by $107 million in our Commercial business, resulting in a 9 basis point increase in coverage to 1.45%. A combination of the modestly worsening corporate economic outlook, an uptick in criticized loans and loan growth drove the allowance build.\nTurning to Page 6, I'll discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was 139%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Total liquidity reserves were roughly flat at about $93 billion as our liquidity reserves have largely normalized to pre-pandemic levels. Our securities portfolio declined by about $8 billion, driven by a combination of the decline in market value from rising rates and the continued planned runoff of the outsized portfolio we built during the pandemic. The decrease in our securities portfolio was primarily offset by higher cash and cash equivalents.\nTurning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Net interest income in the quarter was $7 billion, up 14% from the year ago quarter and up 7% from last quarter. Our net interest margin was 6.8% in the third quarter, 45 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and 26 basis points higher than last quarter. The 26 basis point linked quarter increase in NIM was driven roughly equally by 3 factors: first, an extra day to recognize income in the quarter; second, a continued balance sheet shift towards card away from lower-yielding assets; and third, the net benefit of the higher yield of assets relative to higher funding costs.\nTurning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our preliminary common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.2% at the end of the third quarter, up about 10 basis points relative to last quarter. The $1.7 billion of net income in the quarter was mostly offset by growth in risk-weighted assets, dividends and a little over $300 million in share repurchases. We continue to estimate that our longer-term CET1 capital need is around 11%.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?\n\nRichard D. Fairbank\n\nFounder, Chairman, CEO & President, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10 with third quarter results in our Credit Card business. Year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans, coupled with strong revenue margin, drove an increase in revenue compared to the third quarter of 2021. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11.\nIn the third quarter, strong year-over-year growth in every top line metric continued in our Domestic Card business. Purchase volume for the third quarter was up 16% year-over-year and up 47% compared to the third quarter of 2019. Ending loan balances increased $22 billion or about 22% year-over-year. Ending loans grew 5% from the sequential quarter, and revenue was up 21% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans as well as strong revenue margin.\nStrong credit results continued in the quarter. Both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate are well below pre-pandemic levels and continue to normalize. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.2%, up 84 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.97%, 104 basis points above the prior year.\nOn a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was down 6 basis points. The delinquency rate was up 62 basis points from the linked quarter. Noninterest expense was up 28% from the third quarter of 2021, including an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was $978 million in the quarter. Our choices in Domestic Card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends. In our Domestic Card business, we continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth. We're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We're seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in purchase volume, new accounts and loans across our Domestic Card business. And strong momentum in our decade-long focus on heavy spenders continued in the third quarter.\nHeavy spender marketing includes early spend bonuses driven by continued strong account growth and spending as well as investments in franchise enhancements like our travel portal and airport lounges. In the third quarter, our marketing continued to drive strong growth in heavy spender accounts and strong engagement and spend behaviors with both new and existing customers. Our decade-long quest to build our heavy spender franchise has brought with it significantly increased levels of marketing, but the sustained revenue, credit, resilience, and capital benefits of this enduring franchise are compelling, and they're growing.\nSlide 12 shows third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the third quarter, we continued to pull back on growth in auto in response to competitive pricing dynamics. Many auto lenders appear to have reflected rising interest rates in their marginal pricing decisions, but others have not, and they have gained market share and pressured industry margins. We chose to pull back on auto originations, which declined 28% year-over-year and 20% from the linked quarter.\nDriven by the decline in originations, Consumer Banking loan growth is slower than previous quarters. Third quarter ending loans grew 5% to the year ago quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were essentially flat. Third quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up 2% year-over-year. Consumer Banking deposits were flat compared to the sequential quarter.\nConsumer Banking revenue was up 7% year-over-year as growth in auto loans was partially offset by the year-over-year decline in auto margins and the effects of our decision to completely eliminate overdraft fees. Noninterest expense was up 13% compared to the third quarter of 2021, driven by continuing investments in the digital capabilities of our auto and retail banking businesses and the increased marketing for our digital national bank.\nThe auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate continued to normalize in the third quarter. The charge-off rate for the third quarter was 1.05%, up 87 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.85%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 44 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 38 basis points.\nSlide 13 shows third quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances were up 2% from the sequential quarter, driven by growth in selected industry specialties. Average loans were up 7% in the quarter. Ending deposits were up 6% from the second quarter. Average deposits were down 2% in the quarter.\nThird quarter revenue was up 12% from the linked quarter. Noninterest expense was also up 12%. Commercial Banking credit remained strong in the third quarter. The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 5 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 5.97%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.57%.\nIn closing, we continued to drive strong growth in card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the third quarter. Loan growth in our Consumer Banking business was slower compared to previous quarters as we pulled back on auto originations, and our Commercial Banking business posted another growth -- another quarter of strong revenue growth. Credit results remain strong across our businesses. Charge-off rates and delinquency rates are below pre-pandemic levels and credit continues to normalize.\nWe typically see an increase in operating expense over the second half of the year -- of any year. This year, the timing of some of our investment opportunities drove a larger than usual third quarter increase in operating expense, which was up 11% from the second quarter. We expect that this year's linked quarter increase in fourth quarter operating expense will be smaller than the approximately 7% linked quarter increase we've seen on average over the last 5 years.\nTurning to operating efficiency ratio. Relative to full year 2021, we expect annual operating efficiency ratio to be roughly flat in 2022 and modestly down in 2023. As usual, our operating expense and efficiency expectations exclude any potential adjusting items. Pulling way up, we're in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value as modern digital technology continues to transform banking. We continue to see opportunities to lean into marketing and resilient asset growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities.\nOur growth opportunities are enhanced by our digital transformation. We continue to closely monitor and assess competitive dynamics and economic uncertainty. Powered by our modern digital technology, we're continuously improving our proprietary underwriting, marketing and product capabilities. And we're managing capital prudently to put ourselves in a position to thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios.\nAnd now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP, Global Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) Liz, please start the Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Danielle Dietz, Managing Vice President of Global Finance. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nDanielle Dietz\n\nThank you very much, Melinda, and welcome, everyone, to Capital One's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, we are webcasting live tonight over the Internet. To access the call, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our second quarter 2022 results.\nWith me today are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Andrew Young, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Andrew will walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors, then click on Quarterly Earnings Release.\nPlease note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials. Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements. For more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-Looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our annual and quarterly reports, both accessible at the Capital One website and filed with the SEC.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew M. Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Danielle, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation.\nIn the second quarter, Capital One earned $2 billion or $4.96 per diluted common share. On a linked quarter basis, period-end loans held for investment grew 6% and average loans grew 4% driven by growth across all of our segments. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 1% or 3% after accounting for the $192 million gain on sale recognized in the prior quarter. Noninterest expense grew 1% in the quarter driven by an increase in marketing, which was partially offset by lower operating expenses. Provision expense in the quarter was $1.1 billion driven mostly by net charge-offs of $845 million and a $200 million allowance build.\nTurning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The total company's $200 million allowance build in the quarter brings our allowance balance up 2% to $11.5 billion as of June 30. Our total company coverage ratio decreased 15 basis points to 3.88%. The changes in allowance and coverage ratio vary by segment, which I'll cover on Slide 5.\nAcross all our businesses, loan growth and a worsening economic outlook drove upward pressure on allowance. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance increased by $145 million. The coverage in Consumer Banking increased 14 basis points to 2.51%.\nIn our Commercial Banking business, the allowance increased by $152 million. The coverage in Commercial Banking increased 5 basis points and now stands at 1.36%. In addition to the allowance build, there was also $39 million of provision related to unfunded lending commitments.\nIn our Domestic Card business, we released $128 million of allowance despite the effects of the growth and worsening economic outlook I previously mentioned. We have seen some signs of gradual normalization in our card credit metrics, but so far, the pace of that normalization has been slower than what we assumed when we set last quarter's allowance. The impact of this slower-than-assumed normalization more than offset the growth and worsening economic outlook, leading to the allowance release. We continue to carry elevated levels of qualitative reserves for downside risks related to economic uncertainty. The coverage ratio for Domestic Card now stands at 6.82%.\nTurning to Page 6. I'll discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the second quarter was 144%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Total liquidity reserves declined $17 billion in the quarter as our liquidity normalizes towards prepandemic levels. Cash and cash equivalents declined about $5 billion and now stands at $22 billion. We also had a $6 billion decline in our securities portfolio driven by the combination of the mark from rising interest rates and the continued runoff of the outsized portfolio built during the pandemic.\nTurning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Net interest income in the quarter was $6.5 billion, up 13% from the year ago quarter and up 2% from the sequential quarter. Our second quarter net interest margin was 6.54%, 65 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and 5 basis points higher than the prior quarter.\nRelative to a year ago, the increase in NIM is largely driven by a balance sheet shift as we continue to deploy excess cash and securities into loan growth. The linked quarter increase in NIM was driven by an additional day to recognize revenue. Higher yields on assets in the quarter were offset by higher wholesale funding and deposit costs. Outside of quarterly day count, our NIM from here will largely be a function of the changes in our balance sheet mix, the impacts of interest rates beyond forwards, wholesale funding costs and the impacts of competition on loan yields and deposit betas.\nTurning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.1% at the end of the second quarter, down about 60 basis points from the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more than offset by share repurchases and growth in risk-weighted assets. We continue to estimate that our long-term CET1 capital need is around 11%.\nIn the quarter, the pace of our repurchases slowed to about $2 billion. The pace of any future repurchases will be driven by a number of factors, including our actual and forecasted capital, earnings, growth, economic conditions and market dynamics.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?\n\nRichard D. Fairbank\n\nFounder, Chairman, CEO & President, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10 with second quarter results in our Credit Card business.\nYear-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans, coupled with strong revenue margin, drove an increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of 2021. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results, which are shown on Slide 11.\nOur Domestic Card business posted another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in every top line metrics. Purchase volume for the second quarter was up 18% year-over-year and up 48% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Ending loan balances increased $19.7 billion or about 21% year-over-year. Ending loans grew 6% from the sequential quarter, and revenue was up 21% year-over-year driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans as well as strong revenue margin.\nStrong credit results continued in the quarter. Both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate continued to gradually normalize but remain well below prepandemic levels. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.26%, a 2 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.35%, 67 basis points above the prior year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 14 basis points, roughly in line with normal seasonal patterns. The delinquency rate was up 3 basis points from the linked quarter, which we -- when we typically see modest seasonal improvement.\nNoninterest expense was up 28% from the second quarter of 2021 driven by an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was about $1 billion in the quarter. Our choices in Domestic Card marketing are the biggest but not the only driver of total company marketing trends.\nThe primary noncard driver of increased marketing is in our Consumer Banking business where we're marketing to drive deposit growth and build customer franchise in our digital-first national banking strategy.\nIn our Domestic Card business, we continue to see opportunities to book accounts and loans that can generate resilient and attractive returns. And we continue to lean into marketing to drive growth and build a franchise across our Domestic Card businesses. We're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risk. And as always, we underwrite to a worsening scenario even as we lean into marketing. We're seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in purchase volumes, new accounts and loans across our Domestic Card business. And we continue to gain traction in our decade-long focus on heavy spenders.\nIn the second quarter, heavy spender marketing includes increased early spend bonuses driven by strong first quarter account growth and spending as well as investments in franchise enhancements like our travel portal and airport lounges. As a result of our marketing, we posted strong growth in heavy spender accounts and strong engagement and spend behaviors with new and existing customers. We're gaining share and building a long-term franchise with heavy spenders at the top of the market.\nPulling up, our heavy spender franchise has a different economic mix than some of our other card businesses. It has significantly higher upfront costs of brand building, marketing and promotions and investments in high-end experiences. However, the long-term economics are compelling. And as our heavy spender franchise has grown significantly in recent years, its impact has quietly and gradually changed several Domestic Card metrics and financial results.\nHeavy spender credit losses are low, which lowers overall domestic card loss rates, all other things being equal. Naturally high heavy spender payment behaviors are a key driver of our long-term trend of increasing domestic card payment rates, and high payment rates go hand-in-hand with strong credit performance. Heavy spender attrition is very low, and that's been a factor in our strong domestic card loan growth.\nHeavy spenders have a particularly large impact on increasing purchase volume and have been a major driver of strong domestic card purchase volume growth that has generally exceeded loan growth over time. This spend velocity has driven increases in net interchange revenue in absolute terms and as a percentage of total revenue. And these interchange fee revenues -- revenue annuities are strong and sustained over very long-term customer relationships.\nOur heavy spender franchise generates financial results that are attractive, less volatile and very resilient. As a result, the heavy spender business requires less capital and delivers strong long-term returns on capital. Pulling way up, our 10-year quest to build our heavy spender franchise has brought with it significantly increased levels of marketing, but the sustained revenue, credit resilience and capital benefits of this enduring franchise are compelling and they're growing.\nSlide 12 shows second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the second quarter, choices we made in our auto business impacted several consumer banking trends. We pulled back on growth in auto in response to competitive pricing dynamics. As you'd expect, many auto lenders have raised pricing as rising interest rates drove higher marginal funding costs, but some others have kept pricing relatively flat.\nThese competitors have gained market share and pressured industry margins. We chose to pull back on auto originations, which declined 20% year-over-year and 12% from the linked quarter. As we pulled back on originations, the year-over-year growth of ending loans in the Consumer Banking business decelerated to 9% in the second quarter. On a linked quarter basis, ending loans were up 1%.\nSecond quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up 2% year-over-year, aided in part by the transfer of a small portfolio of deposits from our commercial bank. Consumer banking deposits declined 1% from the sequential quarter. Consumer banking revenue was essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter as growth in auto loans was offset by the effects of our decision to completely eliminate overdraft fees and the year-over-year decline in auto margins.\nAuto margin compression was primarily driven by the increase in our marginal funding costs resulting from rapid interest rate increases and the aggressive competitor pricing that I just discussed.\nNoninterest expense was up 15% compared to the second quarter of 2021 driven by the increased marketing for our digital national bank and continuing investments in the digital capabilities of our auto and retail banking businesses.\nSecond quarter provision for credit losses swung from a net benefit of $306 million in the second quarter of 2021 to a net expense of $281 million. We added to the allowance for credit losses in our auto business in the quarter compared to an allowance release in the year ago quarter.\nThe auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate continue to gradually normalize, but we remain well below prepandemic levels. The charge-off rate for the second quarter was 0.61%, up 73 basis points from the unsustainably low, in fact, negative quarterly charge-off rate a year ago.\nThe 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.47%, up 121 basis points year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was down 5 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 62 basis points.\nSlide 13 shows second quarter results for our Commercial Banking business, which delivered strong growth in loans and revenue in the quarter. Second quarter ending loan balances were up 9% from the sequential quarter. Average loans increased 5%. Growth in selected industry specialties drove our growth.\nEnding deposits were down 14% from the first quarter and down 10% year-over-year driven in part by the transfer of a small portfolio of deposits to our retail bank that I mentioned a few moments ago as well as rate-driven runoff as some customers withdrew deposits in search of higher returns.\nIn the second quarter, deposit balances were also impacted by seasonal outflows. Second quarter revenue was up 3% from the linked quarter and 26% from the prior year quarter. Noninterest expense was down modestly from the linked quarter and up 16% year-over-year.\nProvision for credit losses increased $214 million from the first quarter largely driven by a build in the allowance for credit losses. Commercial banking credit remained strong in the second quarter. The commercial banking annualized charge-off rate was 14 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 5.3%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.7%.\nIn closing, we continued to drive good growth in card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the second quarter. Consumer banking loan growth continued, albeit at a slower pace. And our Commercial Banking business posted strong growth in loans and revenue. Credit results remained strong across our businesses, with charge-off rates and delinquency rates well below prepandemic levels even as credit continues to gradually normalize. And we continued to return capital to our shareholders.\nFor more than 3 decades, we have hardwired resilience into every underwriting and growth choice we make in good times and bad. And we've steadfastly focused on building an enduring franchise. Sticking to these core tenets, we've demonstrated resilience through several cycles. We've been in a strong position to seize opportunities as markets evolve and as cycles played out. And we've delivered significant value over the long term.\nAnd we're living by these same core tenets today. We continue to see opportunities to lean into marketing and resilient asset growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities long after the normalization trends and cyclical credit pressures play out.\nWe're confident in the choices we're making. As we continue to closely monitor and assess competitive dynamics and increasing economic uncertainty, our credit results remain strong. We're staying focused on the most resilient businesses and subsegments. And we're continuing to hone the proprietary underwriting and product structures that have driven our resilience through prior cycles. All of these growth in credit risk management choices are enhanced by our technology transformation.\nWe're managing costs tightly even as we continue to invest in transforming our technology and digital capabilities that are the engine of future growth and efficiency. While the imperatives and marketplace opportunities and risks impact the timing, we remain focused on delivering operating leverage over the long term powered by growth and digital productivity gains. And we're managing capital prudently to put ourselves in a strong position to weather a broad range of possible economic scenarios and to emerge in a strong position to capitalize on opportunities that are often generated as cycles play out.\nPulling way up, we believe that our long-standing core tenets and the choices they drive today are putting us in a strong position to continue to deliver resilience and compelling long-term shareholder value as the sweeping digital transformation of banking continues.\nAnd now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Danielle?\n\nDanielle Dietz\n\nThanks, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) Melinda, please start the Q&A session.",

Andrew?\n\nAndrew M. Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the first quarter, Capital One earned $2.4 billion or $5.62 per diluted common share. The results include one notable item, a $192 million gain from the sale of 2 card partnership loan portfolios in the quarter. Period-end loans held for investment grew 1% on a linked quarter basis, and average loans grew 3%. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 1%. Noninterest expense decreased 3% in the quarter, driven by declines in both marketing and operating expenses. Provision expense in the quarter was $677 million, as net charge-offs of $767 million were partially offset by an allowance release.\nTurning to Slide 4, I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. For the total company, we released $119 million of allowance in the first quarter, and the total allowance balance now stands at $11.3 billion. We continue to hold an elevated amount of qualitative factors to account for a number of uncertainties. Our total company coverage ratio is now 4%.\nTurning to Slide 5, I'll discuss the allowance and coverage of each of our segments. As you can see in the graph, our allowance coverage ratio was largely flat across each of our business segments. In our total card segment, the allowance balance declined $65 million, driven by our International Card businesses. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance remained flat at $8 billion. With the slight decline in ending loans, the flat allowance balance in Domestic Card resulted in a slight increase in the coverage ratio to 7.38%.\nIn our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance declined by $16 million, which, when coupled with loan growth, resulted in a 10 basis point decline in coverage to 2.37%. And in Commercial, the $41 million decline in allowance balance was driven by portfolio credit improvement. The decline in coverage ratio was driven by both the allowance release as well as growth.\nTurning to Page 6, I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter was 140%. The LCR remained stable and continues to be well above the 100% regulatory requirement. The investment portfolio ended the quarter at $89 billion, declining by about $6 billion on a linked quarter basis. Rising rates drove a market value decline of $4.3 billion with the remaining decline due to our continued efforts to reduce our investment portfolio from the elevated levels during the pandemic.\nTurning to Page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our first quarter net interest margin was 6.49%, 50 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and 11 basis points lower than Q4. Relative to a year ago, the increase in NIM is largely driven by a balance sheet shift as we deployed excess cash to loans. The linked quarter decrease in NIM was driven by having 2 fewer days in the first quarter. Normalizing for day count effect, higher yields in both our card business and in our investment portfolio were roughly offset by the impact of hedges on the balance sheet and lower auto yields. Outside of quarterly day count, the NIM from here will largely be a function of the changes in our balance sheet mix, interest rates and the impacts of competition on loan yields and deposit betas.\nTurning to Slide 8, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.7% at the end of the first quarter, down 40 basis points from the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more than offset by share repurchases, the impact of the CECL transition and higher risk-weighted assets. Recall that the phase-in of CECL transition relief began on January 1.\nWe recognized 25% of our $2.4 billion total after-tax phase-in amount in the first quarter. Also in the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion of common stock as part of the $5 billion share authorization that our Board approved in January. Earlier this month, in addition to approving our CCAR 2022 submission and our capital plan, our Board of Directors also approved the authorization of up to an additional $5 billion of common stock repurchases that will be available beginning in the third quarter of this year. We continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?\n\nRichard D. Fairbank\n\nFounder, Chairman, CEO & President, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans, coupled with strong revenue margin, drove an increase in revenue compared to the first quarter of 2021. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11.\nOur Domestic Card business posted strong year-over-year growth in every top line metric in the first quarter as we continued our long-standing strategic focus on winning with heavy spenders and building a franchise across the business. Purchase volume for the first quarter was up 26% year-over-year and up 47% compared to the first quarter of 2019. The rebound in loan growth accelerated with ending loan balances up $16.9 billion or about 19% year-over-year. Ending loans were down just 1% from the sequential quarter, better than the typical seasonal decline of around 7%. And revenue was up 20% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans as well as strong revenue margin.\nDomestic Card revenue margin for the first quarter was 18.3%. Revenue margin continued to benefit from spend velocity, which is the purchase volume and net interchange growth, outpacing loan growth. Spend velocity is driven by the traction we're getting with heavy spenders. The margin also includes a gain from a card partnership portfolio sale in the quarter. Credit results remain strikingly strong. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.12%, a 42 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.32%, 8 basis points above the prior year. Gradual credit normalization continued in the first quarter. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 63 basis points, and the delinquency rate was up 10 basis points.\nNoninterest expense was up 33% from the first quarter of 2021, driven by an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was $918 million in the quarter. Our choices in domestic card marketing are the biggest, but of course, not the only driver of total company marketing trends. We continue to see opportunities to book domestic card accounts and loans that can generate resilient and attractive returns, and we continue to lean into marketing to drive growth and build our Domestic Card franchise.\nConsumer balance sheets and labor markets are strong. And in our own portfolio, credit results continue to be well below pre-pandemic levels and are normalizing gradually. We're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. And as always, we're underwriting to worsening scenarios even as we lean into marketing. Our Domestic Card marketing is evolving and increasing as our decade-long focus on heavy spenders continues to gain traction. We increased marketing to grow the heavy spender franchise and drive the successful launch of Venture X. Growth in new accounts and robust customer spending drove an increase in early spend bonuses, which show up in our marketing expense. And part of our marketing is focused on strengthening our heavy spender franchise with investments in our new Travel portal and airport lounges.\nAnd looking across the whole company, our digital transformation is generating new business opportunities like Capital One Shopping in our card business and Auto Navigator in our auto business. And modern technology infrastructure and capabilities are driving our digital-first national direct banking strategy in Consumer Banking. We're marketing to continue to propel these growing digital businesses. Our marketing is paying off across these opportunities. We posted very strong growth in Domestic Card purchase volume, new accounts and loans. We're gaining share and building a long-term franchise with heavy spenders. And away from the card business, we're growing auto originations and deepening dealer relationships with Auto Navigator, and our national direct banking business is winning with customers and driving growth.\nSpeaking of our auto and retail banking businesses, let's move to Slide 12, which shows that strong loan growth in our Consumer Banking business continued in the first quarter. Driven by auto, first quarter ending loans increased 14% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business. Average loans also grew 14%. First quarter auto originations were up 33% year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, auto originations were up 20%. Our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continued to drive year-over-year growth in our auto business. We continue to closely monitor competitive and credit dynamics in the auto marketplace. First quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up $4.4 billion or 2% year-over-year. Average deposits were also up 2% year-over-year.\nConsumer Banking revenue grew 2% from the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans, partially offset by declining auto loan yields and the early effects of our decision to completely eliminate overdraft fees. The year-over-year decrease in auto loan yields was driven by a mix shift toward prime loans and our focus on booking higher-quality loans within credit segments. Across the auto lending industry, the pace of price increases has not kept up with the pace of rising interest rates. The decline in loan yields, coupled with the pace of pricing changes, has compressed margins in our auto business.\nFirst quarter provision for credit losses swung from a net benefit of $126 million in the first quarter of 2021 to a net expense of $130 million. The allowance for credit losses in our auto business was flat in the quarter compared to an allowance release in the year ago quarter. The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate are gradually normalizing and remain strong and well below pre-pandemic levels. The charge-off rate for the first quarter was 0.66%, up 19 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.85%, up 73 basis points year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 8 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 47 basis points.\nSlide 13 shows first quarter results for our Commercial Banking business, which delivered strong growth in loans, deposits and revenue in the quarter. First quarter ending loan balances were up 17% year-over-year, driven by growth in selected industry specialties and increasing utilization. Average loans were up 15%. Ending deposits grew 9% from the first year -- excuse me, from the first quarter of 2021 as middle market and government customers continued to hold elevated levels of liquidity. Quarterly average deposits increased 12% year-over-year.\nFirst quarter revenue was up 16% from the prior year quarter. Noninterest expense was also up 16%. Commercial credit performance remained strong. In the first quarter, the Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 6 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 5.7%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.8%.\nIn closing, we continued to drive strong growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the first quarter. We also posted strong auto and commercial growth. Credit is gradually normalizing and remains strikingly strong across our businesses, and we continued to return capital to our shareholders. Pulling way up, we are well positioned to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking. Our modern technology stack is powering our performance and our growth opportunity and is the engine of enduring value creation over the long term.\nAnd now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?\n\nJeff Norris\n\nSVP, Global Finance, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Rich. Let's start the Q&A session.

Andrew?\n\nAndrew M. Young\n\nCFO, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation.\nIn the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $2.4 billion or $5.41 per diluted common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $12.4 billion or $26.94 per share. On an adjusted basis, full year earnings per share were $27.11. Full year ROTCE was 28.4%.\nIncluded in the results for the fourth quarter was an upgrade to a legacy rewards program, which increased our rewards liability and decreased noninterest income by $92 million. Both period end and average loans held for investment grew 6% on a linked-quarter basis. Ending loans grew 10% in Domestic Cards, 7% in Commercial and 1% in Consumer Banking. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 4% driven by the loan growth I just described, while total noninterest expense increased 12% in the quarter, driven by increases in both operating and marketing expenses. Provision expense in the quarter was $381 million as net charge-offs of $527 million were partially offset by a modest allowance release.\nTurning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. For the total company, we released $145 million of allowance in the fourth quarter bringing the total allowance balance to $11.4 billion. The total company coverage ratio now stands at 4.12%.\nTurning to Slide 5. I'll discuss the allowance of each of our segments in greater detail. As you can see in the graph, our allowance coverage ratio declined in each of our segments. In Domestic Card, the allowance balance remained flat at $8 billion. The decline in card coverage was driven by the impact of balance growth that I highlighted earlier.\nIn our Consumer Banking segment, continued strength in auto auction values drove a decline in both the allowance balance and the coverage ratio. And in Commercial, the decline in allowance balance was driven by modest credit improvement in the existing portfolio. In addition to the allowance decline, the coverage ratio was also aided by growth in lower loss segments.\nTurning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was 139%. The LCR remained stable and continues to be well above the 100% regulatory requirement. We continue to gradually run off excess liquidity built during the pandemic. Relative to the prior quarter, ending cash and equivalents were down about $5 billion and investment securities were down about $3 billion as we used our liquidity to fund loan growth and share buybacks.\nTurning to Page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. You can see that our fourth quarter net interest margin was 6.6%, 25 basis points higher than Q3 and 55 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The linked quarter increase in NIM was largely driven by balance sheet mix as we had a reduction in cash and securities as well as a higher amount of card loans. Outside of quarterly day count effects, the NIM from here will largely be a function of the change in card balances, cash and securities levels and interest rates.\nTurning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.1% at the end of the fourth quarter, down 70 basis points from the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more than offset by share repurchases and growth in risk-weighted assets. We continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $2.6 billion of common stock, which completed our $7.5 billion Board authorization. Our Board of Directors has approved an additional repurchase authorization of up to $5 billion of the company's common stock.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?\n\nRichard D. Fairbank\n\nFounder, Chairman, CEO & President, Capital One Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Accelerating year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans coupled with strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11.\nAs you can see on Slide 11, our Domestic Card business posted strong growth in every top line metric in the fourth quarter. Purchase volume for the fourth quarter was up 29% year-over-year and up 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The rebound in loan growth accelerated with ending loan balances up $10.2 billion or about 10% year-over-year. Ending loans also grew 10% from the sequential quarter, ahead of typical seasonal growth of around 4%. Ending loan growth was the result of the strong growth in purchase volume as well as the traction we're getting with new account origination and line increases partially offset by continued high payment rates and revenue was up 15% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans.\nDomestic Card revenue margin increased 123 basis points year-over-year to 18.1%. Two factors drove most of the increase. Revenue margin benefited from spend velocity, which is purchase volume and net interchange growth outpacing loan growth, and favorable year-over-year credit performance enabled us to recognize a higher proportion of finance charges and fees in fourth quarter revenue. Credit results remain strikingly strong.\nThe Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.49%, a 120 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.22%, 20 basis points better than the prior year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 13 basis points and the delinquency rate was up 29 basis points.\nNoninterest expense was up 24% from the fourth quarter of 2020. The biggest driver of noninterest expense was an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was $999 million in the quarter. Our choices in Domestic Card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends. We continue to see attractive opportunities to grow our Domestic Card business and our growth opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. We continue to lean into marketing to drive growth and build our Domestic Card franchise. At the same time, we're keeping a watchful eye on the competitive environment, which is intensifying. Pulling up, our domestic card business continues to deliver significant value as we invest to grow and build our franchise.\nMoving to Slide 12. Strong loan growth in our Consumer Banking business continued in the fourth quarter. Driven by auto, fourth quarter ending loans increased 13% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business. Average loans also grew 13%. Fourth quarter auto originations were up 32% year-over-year. Our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continued to drive year-over-year growth in our auto business. In the fourth quarter, we saw a pickup in competitive intensity in the marketplace. On a linked quarter basis, auto originations were down 16%.\nFourth quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up $6.6 billion or 3% year-over-year. Average deposits were up 2% year-over-year. Consumer Banking revenue grew 7% from the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans, partially offset by declining auto loan yields. Noninterest expense increased 15% year-over-year.\nFourth quarter provision for credit losses improved by $58 million year-over-year, driven by an allowance release in our auto business. The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate remains strong and well below prepandemic levels. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate for the fourth quarter was 0.58%, up 40 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.32%, up 67 basis points.\nSlide 13 shows fourth quarter results for our Commercial Banking business, which delivered strong growth in loans, deposits and revenue in the quarter. Fourth quarter ending loan balances were up 12% year-over-year, driven by growth in selected industry specialties. Average loans were up 8%. Ending deposits grew 13% from the fourth quarter of 2020 as middle market and government customers continue to hold elevated levels of liquidity. Quarterly average deposits also increased 14% year-over-year. Fourth quarter revenue was up 19% from the prior year quarter with 29% growth in noninterest income. Noninterest expense was up 17%.\nCommercial credit performance remains strong. In the fourth quarter, the Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was a negative 2 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 6.1%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.8%. Our Commercial Banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to build our Commercial capability.\nI'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning. Growth momentum is evident throughout our fourth quarter results. In the quarter, we drove strong growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and loans. We also posted strong auto and Commercial growth. Credit remains strikingly strong across our business and we continue to return capital to our shareholders.\nAs we enter 2022, we continue to see attractive opportunities to grow our businesses and build our franchise. We will continue to lean into marketing to capitalize on these opportunities and drive growth.\nFor years, we've talked about how sweeping digital change and modern technology are changing the game in banking. Last quarter, I noted that the stakes are rising faster than ever before. The investment flowing into fintech is breathtaking and it's growing. Also, many legacy companies are embracing the realization that technology capabilities may be an existential issue for them and our increasing technology investments. The war for tech talent continues to escalate, which is driving up tech labor costs even before any headcount increase.\nAll these developments underscore the significant opportunity for players who have modern technology and who are in a position to drive growth. Capital One is very well positioned to do that. We've spent years driving our technology transformation from the bottom of the tech stack up. We were an original fintech, and we have built modern technology infrastructure and capabilities at scale. And we're investing to leverage these capabilities to grow and to realize the many benefits of our digital transformation.\nWe have been on a long journey to drive our operating efficiency ratio down. We expect that the striking rise in the cost of modern tech talent on top of our growth investment will pressure annual operating efficiency in the near term. But these pressures do not change our belief in the longer-term opportunity to drive operating efficiency improvement, powered by revenue growth and digital productivity gains.\nPulling way up, we're living through an extraordinary time of digital change. Our modern technology stack is powering our performance and our growth opportunity. It's setting us up to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking. And it's the engine that drives enduring value creation over the long term.\nAnd now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?",

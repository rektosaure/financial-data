This conference is being recorded. Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\n\nQuentin John McMillan\n\nVP, MD & Head of IR, American International Group, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and certainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.\nToday's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com. Following the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial on June 9, 2024, the historical results of Corebridge for all periods presented are reflected in AIG's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nFinally, today's remarks related to net premiums written are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis and adjusted for the sale of the global personal travel and assistance business as applicable. We believe this presentation provides the most useful view of our results and the go-forward business in light of the substantial changes to the portfolio since 2023. Please refer to Pages 27 of the earnings presentation for reconciliations of such metrics reported on a comparable basis.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Salvatore Zaffino\n\nGlobal COO & CEO of General Insurance, American International Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter 2025 financial results. Following my remarks, Keith will provide more detail, and then Jon Hancock and Don Bailey will join us for the Q&A portion of our call. This has been an exceptional third quarter for AIG and an incredibly busy one. We achieved tremendous EPS and ROE results as we continue to execute on our strategy to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. Last week, we had several announcements involving Convex Group, Onex Corporation and Everest Group. The key takeaway is that they are all expected to be earnings, EPS and ROE accretive in the first year post closing.\nWe believe each will accelerate AIG's progress and create long-term clue for our company and our stakeholders. And this was made possible due to our strong balance sheet, prudent capital management and financial flexibility. It's simply been an outstanding quarter, and I'm very proud of our colleagues for all they've accomplished together. For our call this morning, I will share a high-level overview of our third quarter results. provide a perspective on our strategic investments and renewal rights acquisition, give a brief update on our Gen AI initiatives and conclude with an overview of our capital management strategy and the progress against our Investor Day financial objectives.\nIn the third quarter, we delivered adjusted after-tax income per diluted share of $2.20, which is an increase of 77% year-over-year. Adjusted after-tax income for the quarter was $1.2 billion, an increase of 52% year-over-year, driven by our general insurance business. Underwriting income was $793 million, an increase of 81% year-over-year. Net investment income on an adjusted pretax basis was $1 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 88.3%, in line with the prior year quarter and a 16th consecutive quarter with a sub-90% result. The calendar year combined ratio was 86.8%, an improvement of 580 basis points from the prior year quarter.\nNow let me provide some detail on our performance across the 3 business segments. Let's start with North America Commercial Insurance. Net premiums written were flat year-over-year. It's worth noting, which we mentioned on our third quarter 2024 earnings call, that we had a closeout transaction in our casualty portfolio that benefited overall growth in the prior year quarter. Adjusting for this, net premiums written would have increased 3%. This growth was driven in targeted areas, notably programs, which increased 27%, Western World, which increased 11% and excess casualty, which increased 8%. This was partially offset by retail property, which declined 10% and Lexington property, which declined 8%, where rate pressure has been most prevalent.\nWe spoke about property quite a bit last quarter. Keith will go into more detail in his prepared remarks, and we can discuss further in Q&A. Despite pressure on rates, the accident year and calendar year combined ratios remain exceptional for the property portfolio. North America new business was very strong. While Lexington's new business was flat year-over-year, it was the biggest nominal contributor to new business in North America. Its submission count was up 18% year-over-year. following significant increases over the last 2 years of 34% in the third quarter of 2024 and 47% in the third quarter of 2023. Financial Lines new business was up 16%, led by M&A.\nTurning now to International Commercial Insurance. Net premiums written increased 1% year-over-year, driven by Marine, which increased 11% and property, which increased 6%. This was partially offset by financial lines which declined 6%. International Commercial had an outstanding quarter for new business led by specialty, which increased 17% year-over-year, driven by Marine, which increased 35% and and energy, which increased 30%. Property increased 24% and financial lines increased 12%, driven by higher M&A activity in the quarter.\nIn Global Personal, net premiums written decreased 4% driven by the high net worth quota share reinsurance treaty that we entered into at 1/1/'25. While this continues to improve profitability in the portfolio for 2025 and negatively impacted global personal net premiums written. We expect to see this premium trend reverse in 2026. Overall, it was a great quarter of performance for AIG, and it positions us for a strong finish to 2025. Last week was a momentous one for AIG. We announced strategic investments with Convex Group Onex Corporation and a transaction with Everest Group. These will strengthen AIG's long-term value and strategic positioning, and we expect they will be earnings, EPS and ROE accretive 1 year after closing, aligned with the objectives we outlined at Investor Day.\nThis is in line with my previous comments that we would look for compelling opportunities to deploy capital in ways that would be accretive to our financial metrics and to further build our business. As a point of reference, over the last 3 years, we've returned a total of $19 billion of capital to shareholders through approximately $16 billion of share repurchases and $3 billion of common stock dividends. In addition, we reduced debt by $4.5 billion. We now believe we have a capital structure that's optimal for our current business.\nWhen you look at the global insurance industry, there's a scarcity of high-quality insurance assets. We've been fortunate to secure a long-term investment in 1 of the very best global specialty and reinsurance companies, Convex Group. I know Convex group extremely well and have known and traded with its Chairman, Stephen Catlin and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Brand, for over 20 years. I have deep respect for their expertise, leadership and the culture they have built. With Convex we will gain access to a world-class underwriting platform for complex specialty risks with a strong underwriting culture, a growing premium base and a proven track record of outstanding performance and profitability. Stephen and Paul have earned a reputation for building exceptional underwriting teams, and this is reflected in the company's impressive performance.\nConvex was founded in 2019 and has consistently delivered very strong underwriting and financial results. With the combined ratio in the high 80s, no historical reserve issues, no legacy technology debt, a highly scalable platform and significant potential for continued growth. Over the last 3 years, Convex delivered a 25% compound annual growth in gross premiums written and an 18% average return on equity, demonstrating the strength of their business model and ability to produce sustainable long-term value. Last week, AIG agreed to acquire 35% equity interest in Convex while Onex Corporation took a 63% ownership position to be held directly on their balance sheet rather than through 1 of their investment funds.\nIn addition to benefiting from the ongoing success of Convex through an equity investment, AIG will also participate in Convex's portfolio through a whole account quota share, which enables us to share directly in Convex's underwriting growth and expected profitability over the short, medium and long term. The agreement gives AIG the opportunity to participate in 7.5% of Convex's portfolio on January 1, 2026, and and that will progressively increase to 10% by 2027 and 12.5% by 2028. The Convex transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026.\nAs part of our discussions with Convex management, we were presented with an opportunity to acquire a minority ownership stake in Onex Corporation. With headquarters in Toronto, Onex is a leading private equity and credit investor with $56 billion of assets under management and 120 investment professionals based across Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. Our strategic relationship with Onex presents a unique opportunity for AIG to partner through an equity investment with a global asset manager with a strong record of investing in the insurance sector. Onex has made a number of notable and highly successful strategic investments in specialized insurance platforms, including Convex, Ryan Specialty, OneDigital and USI.\nLet me unpack the details of our investment in Onex. We've agreed to acquire a 9.9% equity interest. Additionally, in line with our investment guidelines, we've committed to invest $2 billion over 3 years across Onex's broad asset management platform, which will provide us with a broader view of opportunities and deepen our market position within the global insurance industry. Keith will provide more detail in his remarks, but just to give you a brief overview, these investments have the potential to deliver a higher yield for AIG, supporting earnings growth and enhancing return on equity. We've evaluated investment opportunities in several fund managers in the alternative asset space over time and believe this is the right opportunity for us.\nPost transaction, over 40% of Onex's’ total balance sheet net asset value is expected to relate to its majority ownership of Onex’. The Onex’ transaction is also expected to close in the first half of 2026. Finally, last week, we also announced our acquisition of the renewal rights for the majority of Everest's core retail commercial property and casualty portfolios representing approximately $2 billion of gross premiums written across multiple geographies. We greatly appreciate Everest's willingness to engage in a bilateral discussion to structure a transaction that further strengthens both companies and our mutual business relationship. We purchased the renewal rights for approximately $300 million with a potential downward adjustment of up to $70 million depending on how much of the portfolio is renewed with AIG.\nUnder the terms of the transaction, AIG did not take any of the endorse portfolio or unearned premium for policies with effective dates prior to December 31, 2025. And and we will not assume any liabilities for any of the policies previously underwritten by Everest. Everest employees will remain with Everest Group, though in certain geographies and businesses, we will work with Everest to offer opportunities to select staff members. We've also entered into a transition service agreement with the fine service levels to ensure continuity for clients and brokers as the portfolio is transferred to AIG.\nIn terms of the portfolio, it's well diversified across geographies and and classes of business. The largest portion of the in-force eligible gross premiums written is in the United States at $1.3 billion, followed by Europe at $400 million, the U.K. at $150 million Australia at $80 million and Singapore at $70 million. Approximately 60% of this portfolio will renew in the first half of 2026.\nCanada, Latin America and certain lines of business, including aviation, surety and wholesale are specifically excluded. From a business mix perspective, the portfolio is approximately 40% casualty, 30% property, 25% financial lines with the balance being specialty classes. Everest's view, as stated on the earnings call is that there was no further reunderwriting of the casualty portfolio required and 80% of the adverse development in their casualty portfolio in the back years are from policies that have not been renewed. We will complete our own assessment, but believe they've done a very good job of remediating the portfolio.\nWe have extensive experience repositioning portfolios, particularly in casualty. It's my view that we have the best casualty underwriters in the business. And when combined with stricter underwriting standards, that Everest implemented over the last 12 months, we are confident that the portfolio will be positioned for success. AIG can absorb the business in our current infrastructure with no additional capital, and we will deliver an improved offering to clients and our distribution partners. The reaction from our broker partners of the transaction has been incredibly positive. They're very excited to work with us and committed to converting the book to AIG providing welcome continuity to their clients. We anticipate being able to add this portfolio into our 1/1 reinsurance treaty renewals with no change in terms and conditions.\nThis transaction adds further scale to AIG's upper middle and large account retail insurance book, providing an opportunity to drive premium growth without adding meaningful costs. The actions we have taken over the past several years have positioned us with the balance sheet and liquidity to pursue compelling opportunities when they materialize. Convex, Onex and Everest are unique opportunities that came to AIG first because of our strong brand, strong performance and the personal relationships that we've developed over time. As a result of these transactions, we are enhancing our earnings potential driving incremental ROE and putting our capital to work to drive long-term sustainable profitable growth.\nNow I want to provide a brief update on Gen AI and how we are strategically embedding it into our core underwriting and claims processes. Each quarter and especially since Investor Day, we have meaningfully advanced progress and now we're deploying Gen AI solutions on a more accelerated basis. In my career, I've never seen anything progress at the pace and scale like I've witnessed in the last 6 months with Gen AI and compute. We at AIG want to be in a position to be able to adapt to these changes as effectively as possible. As a reminder, our objective has always been to provide more insight on the data that we receive from distribution partners through the submission process to enhance our underwriting. Supplement that data with reliable and verifiable additional sources and significantly reduced cycle time for our underwriters to make informed decisions in a fraction of the time. That is our future.\nWe started late last year with the rollout of underwriting by AIG Assist in our North America Financial Lines business, and we continue to see strong results. For our private and not-for-profit business today, we're processing 100% of the applicable submissions using underwriting by AIG Assist, which has increased our submit to bind ratio. This quarter, we deployed underwriting by AIG Assist in our Lexington Middle Market property and casualty business. In the E&S market and for Lexington, in particular, speed drives growth. As I outlined earlier and in prior calls, the middle market submission counts are growing dramatically. We have nearly 200,000 submissions year-to-date. We simply cannot get to all the submission activity -- and this is a problem that's not going to be solved by simply adding underwriters.\nWe are accelerating the rollout of underwriting by AIG Assist and will deploy across the rest of our Lexington business by the end of 2025. We've also moved up the rollout to the rest of North America, U.K. and EMEA commercial lines by 6 months. As a reminder, we've also been piloting claims by AIG Assist since last quarter, and we're seeing terrific results. We're reducing the time is taking our claims teams to receive first notice of loss reports and to issue coverage letters. One of the main challenges in implementing Gen AI solutions is the time and effort needed to build an accurate source of data from a heterogeneous population of documents. To make it easier, we developed a patent-pending approach called Auto Extract. Auto Extract is a capability that uses large language models to pull specific structured information from unstructured text such as documents in multiple formats, websites and conversations. It works by developing a content-specific large language model that generates prompts containing instructions on what to extract and then analyze the text and returns the requested data in a structured format.\nThis solution makes it easier to process, analyze and use large amounts of data that would otherwise require extensive manual effort. Another use case we've developed is a capability to ingest the Schedule P information for over 225 U.S. insurance companies. We leverage this information for a variety of insights to determine correlations among loss ratios over certain development periods, specific reserve development and other insights across specific lines of business such as other liability occurrence. We gathered over 4 million data points, augmented the data with publicly available information, created an ontology and trained an agent in the ontology to identify trends. We use this in our portfolio management efforts to support our business and provide unique insights.\nI'll now shift to capital management. In the third quarter, we continued to execute against our disciplined and balanced strategy while maintaining our financial strength. Keith will take you through the specifics. As we look to the future, subject to market conditions, we intend to continue our share repurchases in 2026 and albeit at a normalized level. And over time, we will also look for more compelling opportunities to deploy capital to drive long-term strategic value.\nBefore I close, -- let me give you a little more specificity on how we're tracking to our Investor Day metrics. We set very aspirational objectives at Investor Day. And through the first 9 months of the year, we are ahead of what we outlined at the beginning of the year, which is an enormous achievement. As I noted earlier, EPS has been very strong in 2025. We achieved a core operating ROE of 13.6% in the third quarter, up 430 basis points year-over-year. Year-to-date, our core operating ROE is 10.9%, and which is well within the 10% to 13% range we stated at Investor Day and believe we can maintain and grow this metric through 2027.\nWe are continuing to make progress towards an expense ratio below 30% for General Insurance, and believe we have further opportunities to streamline our expense structure going forward. Finally, we grew our dividend per share by over 10% in 2025 and subject to board approval, we expect to be in a position to do the same in 2026.\nIn summary, we had an outstanding third quarter, made significant advancements in our strategic deployment of capital with 3 unique opportunities and we're very committed to delivering on our 3-year guidance.\nI'll now turn the call over to Keith.\n\nKeith Francis Walsh\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning. I'm going to expand on the financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted pretax income, or APTI, was $1.6 billion, an increase of 51% from the prior year quarter. This was driven by strong results from the business, and execution of our investment portfolio strategy. General Insurance gross premiums written were $8.7 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 1% from the prior year. Net premiums written were $6.2 billion, a decrease of 1%. As Peter discussed, we had strong new business and retention in the quarter. I will comment on the rate environment later in my remarks.\nFor the third quarter, General Insurance accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 88.3%, which is the same as the prior year quarter. Accident year loss ratio was 57.4% and a 100 basis point increase year-over-year. This was primarily driven by the reapportionment of unallocated loss adjustment expenses and we had more favorable actual versus expected recognized in specialty in the prior year quarter. This is partially offset by underlying improvement in global personnel. Our general insurance expense ratio was 30.9%, a 100 basis point improvement year-over-year. For the first 9 months of 2025, -- the general insurance expense ratio was 30.8% compared to 31.7% for the prior year period.\nThis demonstrates our operational excellence and discipline in driving efficiencies and as we have shifted expenses from other operations into general insurance, while investing in underwriting capabilities, technology and infrastructure. For context, since 2023, the business has absorbed an additional $400 million of parent costs that used to be in other operations. We expect to be at $350 million of other operations expense for full year 2025. Our teams have done a fantastic job of managing expenses, and we expect to achieve our target of below 30% by 2027. Total catastrophe losses for the quarter totaled $100 million or 1.6 loss ratio points, an excellent result. Prior year development, net of reinsurance was $205 million favorable which included $174 million of favorable loss reserve development and $31 million of ADC amortization. North America Commercial was favorable $139 million across our property, casualty and financial lines.\nInternational Commercial was also favorable by $47 million, primarily driven by shorter tail lines in Global Specialty partially offset by movements on select longer tail lines, largely driven by auto trends and adverse development on pre-2018 general liability reserves. Global Personal was $19 million favorable. These results include a reapportionment of the remainder of our uncertainty provision across all 3 segments, predominantly into longer tail lines. Similar to last quarter, -- this was not related to any observable deterioration in our book. We continue to build on our strong balance sheet and have a high level of confidence in our reserve position, supported by the favorable actual versus expected trends we continue to observe.\nOverall, General Insurance calendar year combined ratio was outstanding at 86.8% and a 580 basis point improvement compared to prior year quarter.\nNow moving to the segments. North America Commercial accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 85.4% and an increase of 30 basis points over the prior year quarter. The accident year loss ratio of 62.1% was up 30 basis points, owing to changes in business mix as we continue to earn in casualty business and reduce certain property lines and a partial onetime offset due to last year's casualty closeout transaction. The expense ratio was flat to last year at 23.3% and including a 60 basis point improvement in the acquisition ratio, offset by a higher GOE ratio due to the movement of expenses into the business from other operations.\nThe quarter included 310 basis points of catastrophe losses and 590 basis points of favorable prior year development. North America commercial calendar year combined ratio was 82.6%, an improvement of almost 13 percentage points.\nTurning to international commercial. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 86.0% and an increase of 260 basis points. The accident year loss ratio was 54.4%, a 170 basis point increase year-over-year largely from reapportionment of unallocated loss adjustment expenses and less favorability in specialty, as we mentioned earlier. The expense ratio rose 90 basis points to 31.6% and driven by movement of expenses from other operations. This quarter included 80 basis points of catastrophe losses and 190 basis points of favorable prior year development.\nThe international commercial calendar year combined ratio was 84.9%. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of a sub-90% combined ratio for the International Commercial segment which speaks to the quality of our portfolio. Turning to Global Personal. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 95.5%, a 330 basis point improvement year-over-year adjusting for the divested travel business. The accident year loss ratio improved 90 basis points to 55.3% and driven by underwriting actions leading to stronger underlying profitability and lower reinsurance costs. The expense ratio improved 240 basis points to 40.2% and driven by the acquisition ratio, which is benefiting from a combination of improved commission terms in the U.S. high net worth business, operational efficiencies and changes in business mix.\nThis quarter included 80 basis points of catastrophe losses and 110 basis points of favorable prior year development. The global personal calendar year combined ratio was 95.2% and an improvement of 520 basis points year-over-year. We continue to make steady progress increasing the profitability of global personal as outlined at Investor Day.\nMoving to rates. In North America, market conditions for pricing have remained largely stable. Excluding the property business, our North America commercial renewal pricing increase was 5%. In North America Casualty, the overall pricing environment remains favorable with retail excess casualty up 13% and Lexington Casualty up 14%. In North America Financial Lines, pricing was down 2%, in line with the second quarter. The pricing reductions have moderated, and we continue to focus on our differentiated offering and leadership position. North America property continued to see pricing pressure with the overall portfolio showing improvement from last quarter, largely as a result of mix. The property market rate environment remains challenging, and we continue to have strong profitability across our retail and wholesale business while prioritizing underwriting discipline.\nInternational commercial overall pricing was down 2%. Across our international property portfolios, pricing was up 4%, driven by 16% rate increases in Japan. Global Specialty pricing was down 4%. Since 2018, the cumulative rate increases in our global specialty book have been very strong, with over 100% increase in energy where rates are currently challenged. Overall, pricing remains above our technical view. Talbot and Financial lines pricing was also down 4%. AIG's well-diversified global portfolio allows us to manage across geography and products, prioritizing lines of business that offer the best risk-adjusted returns.\nMoving to other operations. Third quarter adjusted pretax loss was $116 million versus the prior year quarter of $135 million. This reflects a significant reduction in general operating expense and lower interest expense, partially offset by lower net investment income as we reduced our Corebridge financial stake. Total GOE across both General Insurance and other operations, was $866 million in the third quarter, up 1% from the prior year, adjusting for travel. For the 9 months of 2025, total GOE was $2.5 billion down 2% year-over-year, while net premiums earned grew by 5%. This is an impressive outcome, reflecting positive operating leverage, allowing us to create bandwidth for future investments.\nThe third quarter net investment income on an APTI basis reached $1 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year. General Insurance net investment income was $945 million growing 22% year-over-year. The increase was driven by fixed maturity securities, owing to the optimization of our lower-yielding portfolios, asset growth and higher reinvestment yields in addition to improved alternative returns. During the third quarter, the average new money yield on the fixed maturity and loan portfolio was roughly 95 basis points higher than sales and maturities -- the annualized yield was 4.58%, a 69 basis point improvement over the prior year. Alternative investment income was also very strong this quarter at $137 million yielding 13.6% compared to $43 million and 4.3% in the prior year quarter.\nOur well-diversified private equity portfolio contributed to this excellent performance. At Investor Day, we talked about opportunities to optimize our core portfolio, particularly in some lower-yielding geographies as well as prudently increasing the allocation to private credit when we see attractive premiums over public credit. As part of the reshaping of our portfolio, we have reduced hedge funds and global real estate by $1.5 billion collectively since 2021. We largely have completed the rebalancing of public credit across multiple geographies. Yields are now more consistent with where we believe we should operate, and we expect net investment income growth going forward to be more in line with asset growth given the current and projected level of global interest rates.\nOver the next few years, we will opportunistically allocate funds to private credit which currently stands at $6.4 billion at the end of the third quarter or 8% of the GI portfolio. Overall allocations to private credit have not materially changed since Investor Day. As stated at Investor Day, we intend to take that up to 12% to 15% over time, subject to market conditions. Private credit is a large and diverse asset class, we expect to participate in the highest quality assets where we will get paid for the risk. We have private credit mandates with a small group of strategic partners who follow strict investment guidelines. We do a detailed review of every transaction we enter into and are very thoughtful about deployment and aggregation. We are pleased Onex will be 1 of those strategic partners.\nWe have committed to invest $2 billion over 3 years across Onex's’ broad asset management platform, including insurance co-investments outside of Onex funds which will provide us with a broader view of opportunities in the industry. We are in the process of divesting some noncore legacy private assets, mostly in real estate, and we will look to deploy some of those proceeds in Onex managed strategies over time, such as CLOs and broadly syndicated loan portfolios where Onex has a strong track record. Our expectation is that our investment opportunities with Onex will be accretive to our investment yield.\nTurning to other operations. Net investment income of $77 million declined $43 million over the prior year quarter and largely reflect income from our parent liquidity portfolio of roughly $50 million and Corebridge financial dividend income of $20 million. This quarter, we updated the investment portfolio disclosure in our financial supplement to more clearly show the split between our general insurance portfolio and the assets sitting within other operations.\nTurning to capital management. In the third quarter, we continued to execute in our strong, disciplined and balanced strategy while maintaining our strong ratings and financial flexibility. We completed the sale of another 31 million shares of Corebridge Financial for proceeds of approximately $1 billion. This brings our ownership in Corebridge to roughly 15.5%. We returned $1.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the third quarter through approximately $1.25 billion of share repurchases and approximately $250 million of common stock dividends. Through the first 9 months of the year, we have repurchased $5.3 billion, reducing shares outstanding to roughly $544 million. We continue to actively repurchase shares at what we view as attractive levels.\nSubject to market conditions, we intend to continue our share repurchase in 2026, albeit at more normalized levels. As we stated at Investor Day, -- we generate roughly $3 billion of ordinary dividends from our insurance subsidiaries annually. We expect share repurchases up to $1 billion for 2026. We maintained our outstanding financial position in the third quarter. with strong parent liquidity and a debt to total capital ratio of 18%. Over time, we will also look for ways through additional investments and acquisitions to drive long-term strategic value for the company and our shareholders.\nBook value per share at September 30 was $75.45, up 6% from September 30, 2024, reflecting strong growth in net income as well as the favorable impact of lower interest rates on investment AOCI. Adjusted tangible book value per share was $70.07, up 3% from September 30, 2024.\nIn summary, we delivered an excellent third quarter with annualized core operating ROE of 13.6% and 10.9% through the first 9 months of 2025. While the macro and insurance market remain dynamic, we are well positioned with multiple levers to drive continued strong performance.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Peter.\n\nPeter Salvatore Zaffino\n\nGlobal COO & CEO of General Insurance, American International Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Keith. Michelle, we're ready for questions.",

The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com.\nFollowing the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial on June 9, 2024, the historical results of Corebridge for all periods presented are reflected in AIG's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Finally, today's remarks related to net premiums written are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis and adjusted for the sale of the global personal travel and assistance business as applicable. We believe this presentation provides the most useful view of our results and the go-forward business in light of the substantial changes to the portfolio since 2023. Please refer to Page 25 of the earnings presentation for reconciliations of such metrics reported on a comparable basis.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Salvatore Zaffino\n\nGlobal COO & CEO of General Insurance, American International Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Quentin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review our second quarter 2025 financial results. Following my remarks, Keith will provide more detail on the quarter, and then we will take questions. Jon Hancock and Don Bailey will join us for the Q&A portion of our call. AIG had an outstanding second quarter. We continue to make meaningful progress on our strategic, operational and financial objectives that we outlined at Investor Day. Our momentum continues to build with strong performance across the board.\nWe delivered adjusted after-tax income per diluted share of $1.81, an increase of 56% year-over-year. Adjusted after-tax income for the quarter was $1 billion an increase of 35% from the prior year quarter, driven by our general insurance business, which had underwriting income of $626 million, an increase of 46% year-over-year. Net investment income on an adjusted pretax basis was $955 million, an increase of 9% year-over-year. Accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 88.4%. Calendar year combined ratio was 89.3%, an improvement of 320 basis points from the prior year quarter.\nWe achieved a core operating ROE of 11.7%. We returned $2 billion of capital to shareholders, bringing the year-to-date total to $4.5 billion. We sold $430 million or 13.4 million shares of Corebridge Financial, reducing our stake to approximately 21%. And finally, both S&P Global and Moody's upgraded their financial strength ratings of AIG's insurance subsidiaries during the quarter, which was a major milestone. This is our first upgrade from S&P Global since 2013 and our first upgrade from Moody's since 1990.\nFor our call this morning, I will share a detailed review of our second quarter results, a few observations on the global property market and specifically our portfolio, highlights from our successful completion of AIG Next, which delivered $500 million in savings and significant operational improvements, an overview of Russia aviation-related claims, and an update on our Gen AI initiatives.\nBefore I review the quarter in more detail, I'd like to take a moment to welcome John Neal to AIG, who will be joining us as President on December 1. As many of you know, John is one of the most accomplished executives in our industry. He's very well known to our stakeholders, has significant global operating experience and an impressive track record leading underwriting organizations most recently as the CEO of Lloyd's London. John will oversee our General Insurance organization and will partner with me and the business leaders in driving the strategic direction of the business. John's background, experience and global expertise adds depth to our excellent management team, and we look forward to working closely with them in his new role.\nNow let me provide a more detailed view of our second quarter financial results. Net premiums written were $6.9 billion, an increase of 1% year-over-year. This included 3% growth in Global Commercial. North America Commercial Insurance net premiums written increased 4% year-over-year. Excluding Property, which I will discuss in more detail, North America Commercial Insurance net premiums written increased 11%. We had growth in businesses that we believe have strong risk-adjusted margins, and we tempered growth in those businesses that had rate pressure. Retail Casualty and Lexington Casualty each increased 19%. Western World increased 15% and our alternative businesses, which consist of Glatfelter and programs, also increased 19%.\nThese results were offset by Retail Property and Lexington Property, where net premiums written declined by 8%. International Commercial Insurance net premiums written increased 1% year-over-year, driven by modest growth in Casualty and Global Specialty, which was offset by declines in Property and Financial Lines. In the second quarter, Global Commercial continued to produce strong new business of nearly $1.4 billion, a 7% increase from the prior year quarter. In 2024, North America Commercial experienced tremendous new business growth. In 2025, we continue to see incremental growth led by Lexington Middle Market, Western World and our alternative businesses. It's worth noting that the submission count in our Lexington business continues to be very strong, increasing 28% year-over-year.\nInternational Commercial produced very strong new business in Specialty with a 35% increase from the prior year quarter, led by Marine and Energy. In addition, Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention across North America Commercial and International Commercial of 88%. Global Personal net premiums written decreased 3%. As I discussed on previous earnings call, we entered into a high net worth quota share reinsurance treaty with strategic partners that is driving profitability improvement of the portfolio; however, it had a 6-point negative impact to Global Personal net premiums written growth in the quarter.\nTurning to expenses. Keith will go into more detail in his remarks, but I wanted to make a few points. Our General Insurance expense ratio was 31%, a 50 basis point improvement year-over-year. For the first half of 2025, the General Insurance expense ratio was 30.8% compared to 31.6% for the prior year period. The General Insurance business has continued to absorb expenses that used to reside in other operations. In addition, we've made meaningful investments in cybersecurity and Gen AI and the costs for both are being absorbed in the businesses. For other operations, general operating expenses were $90 million in the quarter and $175 million for the first half of 2025. This is in line with a $350 million annual run rate for parent expenses for 2025, which is simply an outstanding result.\nNow I'd like to take a moment to cover the Property Insurance market and the competitive nature of the rate environment, particularly in large account property as we enter wind season in the United States. This has been one of the most widely discussed topics in the industry, and I thought it was worth spending a few minutes outlining a technical view of AIG's underwriting approach to our U.S. property portfolio in this environment. My comments will focus on U.S. property because our International Property portfolio is experiencing very different market dynamics. It has terrific results and a rate environment that is currently positive.\nOur U.S. property business has been one of the best stories for AIG during the repositioning of our underwriting portfolio. What used to be a highly unprofitable portfolio with massive limits, combined ratios of 120 or greater and significant volatility accompanied with outside catastrophe losses has now become one of the most profitable lines of business for AIG. Even in the current environment, our portfolio has been performing exceptionally well across Retail Property and Lexington wholesale large account, where on average, pricing decreases have been 11% and Lexington Middle Market property was largely flat. Since 2018, Retail Property and Lexington wholesale large account, cumulative rate increases have been 135% and 120%, respectively, and Lexington Middle Market has had cumulative rate increases of 90%.\nAdditionally, over the last several years, accident year combined ratios, as adjusted have been below 60% on average for both Retail and Wholesale Property. Further, and an important distinction, approximately 90% of our large account property, Retail and Wholesale, is placed on a shared and layered basis, which means nonconcurrent pricing and nonconcurrent terms on that placement. This allows us to establish differentiated pricing and policy wording coverages and exclusions for the limits we deploy for each risk. And when we report out our rate increases or decreases it is against the pricing that we established for our layer, not the index of the average pricing of the market for that placement.\nAlso, with shared and layer placements, most of the business is net of commission. This means it has a very low acquisition expenses. In AIG's case, Retail Property has an acquisition ratio of approximately 1%. Inherently, it therefore has a higher loss ratio as the total premium includes very little expenses to gross up. In contrast, a Middle Market portfolio, which for AIG is 35% of our total property book has different characteristics. Middle Market accounts, have higher acquisition expense ratio and total expense ratio that translates to lower loss ratios because the total premium has grossed up through a higher total expense load.\nWhen reviewing the quality and profitability of our property portfolio at a high level, in addition to excellent individual risk underwriting, you should also have a technical view of the following components. Let's start with catastrophe. You need a proper analysis of potential CAT layers using extensive modeling, along with an accurate view of exposure and appropriate funding for CAT risks including comprehensive reinsurance at all appropriate return periods and tail risk. Then you should review average annual losses or AAL, which are CAT losses that are within your net retention below your Property CAT Reinsurance program that typically for lower return periods, net retained catastrophe requires an appropriate risk load.\nAlso important are vertical single losses that are typically protected with property per risk reinsurance. And finally, you should consider attritional loss selections with an appropriate risk margin. When you analyze each of these components, I believe our approach has been conservative with respect to each variable. Why do I feel this way? The reason is we have a clear and detailed understanding of our fully loaded reinsurance CAT costs. We've been able to purchase reinsurance at low attachment points and have high exhaust limits. And importantly, these costs are fully embedded into our insurance pricing. This year, our risk-adjusted pricing decreases for reinsurance are at or greater than the pricing decreases on our primary business, limiting the impact of the rate environment on our net loss ratios. This would not be the case if you chose to take these layers net.\nEven with a significant increase in frequency of CATs, our AALs have been roughly equal to or greater than our actual experience over the past 3 years. On single large losses, we have significant protection on property per risk with reinsurance attaching at $25 million and exhausting in excess of $600 million. This is another strategic choice to reduce volatility, and we have fully embedded this cost into our pricing. We've also benefited from risk-adjusted pricing decreases on our property per risk treaties. The outcome of all of these variables is that our attritional loss ratios over the past 3 years have performed better than our expected accident year loss ratio picks.\nAs I noted, another critical component of the loss projection is how much risk margin you have embedded as part of the ultimate accident year loss ratio. In our case, that market has continued to expand as a result of our exceptional underwriting and cumulative rate increases. When developing our loss picks, we include a risk margin that ranges from 10% to 20% depending on the segment of business. We've structured our portfolio to manage through various cycles. Going forward, we're looking to maintain our U.S. property portfolio, which is evidenced through our strong retention, growing where it makes sense for us based on risk-adjusted returns. And when market conditions warrant, we have the ability to pivot quickly.\nWhen you take into consideration all of these components of our Property portfolio, we expect in the current environment to deliver strong profitability in both Retail and Wholesale property.\nNow I'd like to provide an update on our operational accomplishments. At the end of 2023, we launched AIG Next to create a leaner, more simplified and more effective organization supported by the right infrastructure and capabilities while achieving at least $500 million in run rate savings. We embarked on this journey by pursuing a number of key initiatives. First, we created a lean parent company with costs aligned to being a public company, representing 1% to 1.5% of net premiums earned. In 2023, other operations expenses were approximately $1 billion. In order to achieve our future state parent expenses, we transferred $300 million as part of the Corebridge Financial divestiture. We either eliminated or reapportioned the remaining $350 million into our General Insurance businesses.\nSecond, we drove global consistency and local relevancy across our end-to-end processes including centralizing our treasury and capital activities to create global enterprise standards. Third, we reduced organizational complexity through the creation of 3 distinct business segments: North America Commercial, International Commercial and Global Personal, which has led to better and differentiated experiences for our clients and partners. Fourth, we restructured and simplified our underwriting and claims organizations to accelerate and scale our data, digital and Gen AI strategy. And finally, we advanced our technology transformation and modernized our infrastructure, which included, among other initiatives, the elimination of 1,200 legacy applications.\nAs we did with AIG 200 and our underwriting turnaround, I'm very pleased to share that we've achieved our objectives ahead of schedule. We actioned over $530 million of annual run rate expense savings with over $500 million realized through the second quarter. I often say that one of the most impressive differentiators of AIG is our colleagues' ability to execute multiple complex strategic initiatives at the highest quality. The accelerated results that we've achieved through AIG Next are a testament to our culture of teamwork and willingness to execute at pace across the company.\nWe thought it would be helpful to provide perspective on the Russia aviation-related claims, a complex industry topic in the headlines. These aviation insurance exposures are related to aircraft leased to Russian airlines that were kept in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. As you may recall, airline lessors are seeking compensation under contingent and possessed as well as operator policies covering both all risks and war apparels. On June 11, a judgment was issued in a legal proceeding in the U.K. in which a number of lessors led by AerCap brought claims against insurers that issued contingent and possess policies to them.\nIn that judgment, the U.K. High Court ruled that the lessors suffered a covered war loss as a result of actions that the Russian government took in March of 2022. This decision aligns broadly with several prior rulings in the U.S. As we said at the outset, this was an unusual event for the industry with complicated issues, including whether covered loss occurred and when? Which peril triggered coverage? Did the lessors take appropriate steps to mitigate losses? Should sanctions apply? And which policy should respond? Contingent and possessed or operator? The situation was further complicated by the fact that many policyholders were quick to file coverage litigation, which significantly delayed the loss adjustment process.\nDespite these complexities, AIG, along with other insurers, made a concerted effort early to engage with policyholders in a unified manner to resolve the claims consensually reflecting the intent of the policies, which were written on a subscription basis in the London market. Unfortunately, the market participants were not able to agree on a solution, which is often the case in our industry and litigation proceeded in multiple jurisdictions, most notably in the U.K. In the U.K. proceeding, AIG was the lead all-risk representative defendant and as such, advance the position that any losses by AerCap should fall to the war cover, which was eventually adopted by the court.\nIt's worth noting that AIG sought to and successfully settled all other claims under contingent and possessed policies in the U.K. proceeding prior to the AerCap ruling and, in many instances, obtained releases of our exposure under any applicable operator policies. With regard to the operator policies, there is a separate U.K. proceeding concerning claims that lessors have brought against AIG and several other insurers. We believe these operator claims face significant hurdles given among other factors that the relevant aircraft continue to be used by the Russian operators. Like many in the market, AIG wrote both all-risk and war policies.\nEarly on, we conducted a thorough evaluation of the potential net financial impact of these claims on AIG, factoring in the complex coverage issues and all applicable reinsurance and barrier scenarios. As a result of this analysis, as I have stated previously, we prudently reserved for our expected net loss exposure and the outcome in the AerCap case, along with the settlements in other cases have been in line with our expected net loss estimates.\nNow let me take a few minutes to provide an update on our Gen AI work, which continues to accelerate while generating significant interest among our stakeholders. At our Investor Day, we provided an overview of our Gen AI approach and how we're deploying Gen AI end-to-end across the core business to power our underwriting business. Specifically, we talked about how we're leveraging large language models, our Agentic ecosystem of capabilities and our partnerships with AWS, Palantir and Entropic, among others. We laid out our framework, which is built around data ingestion, augmentation and prioritization powered by our Agentic AI ecosystem. We first deployed AIG underwriter assistance to our product non-for-profit business and Financial Lines at the end of the first quarter, and the early results are very promising.\nSubmission ingestion has increased by 4x and the submit-to-find ratio has increased by 20% from the baseline. Looking forward, we remain on track to introduce AIG underwriter assistance for our Lexington Middle Market, Property & Casualty businesses in the third quarter of this year and across all of North America Commercial, U.K., and EMEA Commercial lines in 2026, and we continue to explore opportunities to accelerate our rollout. As we scale Gen AI across underwriting, we've also been building AIG claims assistance. We have successfully configured the core Gen AI capabilities of ingestion, augmentation and prioritization that we built for AIG underwriter assistance to support claims.\nWith this framework, we can ingest unstructured data to expedite of loss, prioritize claims assignments and augment claims adjusters investigations with relevant, external multimodal data from approved sources. For claims, we've been training large language models to extract and organize key insights automatically to enable claims adjusters to make more informed decisions faster than ever in order to fulfill our promise of helping our clients when they need us most. We've conducted preliminary testing on the first notice of loss process, which is the first report made to an insurer about a potential claim. In our sample, the processing time has decreased from days to hours.\nWe've also seen cycle time for coverage and endorsement reviews, a key part of a coverage assessment, decreased from hours to minutes. Our objective with these advanced tools is to enable more technical reviews, provide our underwriting and claims experts with more insight and capabilities, reduce cycle time, significantly enhanced decision-making and meaningfully improved service to our clients and partners. Foundational to this work is oncology. You will hear a lot more on this topic in the coming quarters, especially as we make more progress with our rollout. We've been building our AIG Ontology since we began our work in AI. It reflects an intent to create a digital twin of our business, representing all key data, processes, business logic and a map of relationships across businesses and functions.\nOntology is critical for deploying large language models. It brings together the relevant data sets that define the components of our insurance business, integrates and sequences them and then models how they relate to one another. Our ontology will create a clear record of any actions taken, which will inform business logic and provide the ability to audit agents activities. We've seen an acceleration since Investor Day as large tech companies have made significant capital expenditure commitments to further advance Gen AI capabilities. I'm very encouraged with the progress that AIG is making.\nWith that overview, I will now turn the call over to Keith.\n\nKeith Francis Walsh\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning. I'm going to expand on the financial highlights for the quarter. Overall, total adjusted pretax income, or APTI, was $1.4 billion, an increase of 37% from the prior year quarter. This was driven by excellent results from the business and focused execution of our investment portfolio strategy. General Insurance gross premiums written were $10.1 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 4% from the prior year. Net premiums written were $6.9 billion, an increase of 1%. For the second quarter, General Insurance accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 88.4%, an increase of 80 basis points over the prior year quarter. I'll unpack the loss ratio when I cover the segments.\nLooking at expenses. In the second quarter, General Insurance expense ratio was 31.0%, a 50 basis point increase year-over-year. General Insurance absorbed $83 million of additional expenses that were booked in other operations in the second quarter of 2024. We remain on track to reduce our expense ratio below 30% by 2027.\nMoving to catastrophes. Charges for the quarter totaled $170 million or 2.9 loss ratio points. Prior year development for the quarter net of reinsurance was $128 million favorable, which included $97 million of favorable loss reserve development and $31 million of ADC amortization. The favorable development primarily stemmed from workers' compensation, largely driven by favorable trends on excess of loss sensitive business. U.S. property and special risks also developed favorably. We strengthened U.S. Casualty by $106 million, which is driven by mass tort and older accident years, of which the vast majority is in accident years 2015 and prior, which are covered by the ADC.\nWe also reapportioned some of the uncertainty provision in casualty lines into the more recent accident years as we outlined in the fourth quarter. This is a prudent measure given broader litigation and inflationary trends in the industry. This was not related to any observable deterioration in our book. The General Insurance calendar year combined ratio was outstanding at 89.3%, a 320 basis point improvement compared to the prior year quarter.\nNow moving to the segments. North America Commercial accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 86.2%, an increase of 150 basis points over the prior year quarter. The accident year loss ratio of 63.1% was up 120 basis points, owing to changes in business mix as our casualty business grew, and we pulled back on property. Increased prudence in our 2025 loss picks predominantly in casualty lines given mass tort and general litigation trends and reapportionment of unallocated loss adjustment expenses into the loss ratio, largely related to lean parent implementation. The expense ratio was up 30 basis points to 23.1%, also driven by lean parent implementation.\nThe quarter included 470 basis points of catastrophe losses and 500 basis points of favorable prior year development. North America Commercial calendar year combined ratio was 85.9%, an improvement of 430 basis points from the prior year. Turning to International Commercial. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 85.0%, an increase of 290 basis points. The accident year loss ratio was 54.2%, a 160 basis point increase year-over-year, reflecting lean parent implementation, additional conservatism in lines facing macro uncertainties and changes in business mix. The expense ratio rose 130 basis points to 30.8%, driven by lean parent.\nThis quarter included 140 basis points of catastrophe losses and 50 basis points of favorable prior year development. The International Commercial calendar year combined ratio was 85.9%, a 270 basis point improvement year-over-year. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of a sub-90% combined ratio and speaks to the high quality of our portfolio.\nTurning to Global Personal. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 96.1%, a 120 basis point improvement adjusting for the divested travel business. The accident year loss ratio was down 160 basis points to 54.2% driven by lower reinsurance costs, increased earned premiums as well as stronger underlying profitability. The expense ratio was up 40 basis points to 41.9%, also driven by lean parent implementation. This quarter included 240 basis points of catastrophe losses and no prior year development. The Global Personal calendar year combined ratio was 98.5% and an improvement of 170 basis points year-over-year. We continue to make progress increasing the profitability of our Global Personal business, as outlined at Investor Day.\nMoving to rates. Peter has already provided a detailed perspective on the property market, so my comments will focus on other lines. Market conditions for pricing have remained largely stable and consistent outside of property. Excluding the property business, our North America commercial pricing increased in the quarter by 6%, which is in line with loss cost trends. In North America Casualty, we continue to see price firming, especially in the excess casualty space with pricing up 17%. Primary Casualty saw 12% pricing increases, which were above loss cost trends. In North America Financial Lines, pricing reductions moderated to down 2%, which is the lowest level of decrease since rates moved negative in the second quarter of 2022 and was 3 points better than the first quarter.\nMoving to International Commercial. Overall pricing was down 3%. Global Specialty pricing was down 6%, Talbot down 3%, and Financial Lines down 4%. The AIG's well-diversified global portfolio allows us to manage across geography and products, prioritizing lines of business that offer the most compelling risk-adjusted returns while navigating a complex and dynamic global insurance market. Moving to other operations. Second quarter adjusted pretax loss was $106 million versus the prior year quarter of $163 million. This reflects a significant reduction in general operating expense and lower interest expense, partially offset by lower net investment income.\nAdjusted for travel, the total general operating expenses across both General Insurance and other operations were $867 million in the second quarter, up 1% from the prior year. This small increase in GOE compares to 6% growth in net premiums earned. For the first half of 2025 total GOE was $1.7 billion, down 3% year-over-year, while net premiums earned grew by 4%. This is an excellent outcome, especially considering our continual investments in data, digital and Gen AI capabilities and reflects positive operating leverage from our expense discipline.\nThe second quarter net investment income on an APTI basis was $955 million, an increase of $76 million year-over-year. General Insurance net investment income was $871 million, growing 17% year-over-year. The increase was driven by fixed maturity securities owing to the optimization of our lower-yielding portfolios, asset growth, higher reinvestment yields and an adjustment of interest income primarily from the first quarter. For the first half of 2025, General Insurance net investment income was $1.6 billion and grew 7% year-over-year. This is a better indicator of our expected run rate for the full year, subject to market conditions.\nDuring the second quarter, the average new money yield on the fixed maturity and loan portfolio was roughly 110 basis points higher than sales and maturities. Other operations net investment income of $88 million declined $48 million over the prior year quarter and reflects income from our parent liquidity portfolio of $58 million and Corebridge Financial dividend income of $27 million. Yesterday, we announced the sale of another 30 million shares of Corebridge Financial with proceeds of approximately $1 billion. This brings our ownership to roughly 15%. Peter already provided some detail on capital management in his remarks. Based on our current liquidity and cash flow profile, we anticipate being at the high end of our 2025 share repurchase guidance range of $5 billion to $6 billion, subject to market conditions.\nTurning to dividends. We increased our quarterly dividend in the second quarter by 12.5% to $0.45 per share delivering a third straight year of double-digit growth.\nTurning to liability management. We have made significant progress over the last several years improving our financial strength and flexibility. In May, we issued $1.25 billion of debt, upsizing the offering as a result of significant demand. The proceeds were partially used to retire $830 million of debt effectively managing our maturity ladder. As a result, we have no material debt maturities in 2025 and 2026. We ended the quarter with approximately $9 billion of debt outstanding and a debt to total capital ratio of 17.9% amongst the lowest in our peer group.\nAs Peter already mentioned, but it bears stating again, during the second quarter, AIG's major insurance subsidiaries received financial strength upgrades from S&P to AA- from A+, and Moody's to A1 from A2. These actions speak to the strength and stability of AIG are a meaningful validation from our key stakeholders and represent the collective hard work of our colleagues over several years. We continue to have strong capital ratios across our major insurance subsidiaries, which supports consistent and growing statutory dividends over time.\nWe are on track to generate approximately $3 billion of subsidiary dividends in 2025. Book value per share at June 30 was $74.14 up 8% from June 30, 2024, reflecting strong growth in net income as well as the favorable impact of lower interest rates on investment AOCI. Adjusted tangible book value per share was $69.81 up 4% from June 30, 2024.\nIn summary, we delivered an excellent second quarter with annualized core operating ROE of 11.7%. While the macro and insurance market remains dynamic, we are well positioned with multiple levers to drive continued strong performance. We remain on track to achieve our 10% plus core operating ROE target in 2025 and continue to make steady progress on the long-term financial targets we outlined at our Investor Day.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Peter.\n\nPeter Salvatore Zaffino\n\nGlobal COO & CEO of General Insurance, American International Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Keith. Michelle, we're ready to take questions.",

This conference is being recorded. Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\n\nQuentin John McMillan\n\nVP, MD & Head of IR, American International Group, Inc.\n\nThanks very much and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change. .\nToday's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com. Following the deconsolidation of Core Bridge Financial on June 9, 2024, the historical results of [indiscernible] for all periods presented are reflected in AIG's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nFinally, today's remarks related to net premiums written and net premiums earned are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis and adjusted for the sale of the global personal travel and assistance business as applicable. We believe this presentation provides the most useful view of our results and the go-forward business in light of the substantial changes to the portfolio since 2023. Please refer to Pages 26 of the earnings presentation for reconciliations of such metrics on a comparable basis.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our first quarter 2025 financial results. AIG's overall performance in the quarter was exceptional, and we continue to make significant progress on our strategic, operational and financial objectives. We had a very busy start to the year. And while it's hard to believe just 30 days ago, we hosted our Investor Day.\nWe're incredibly grateful for the positive engagement and support from our colleagues and many stakeholders and appreciated the opportunity to share our journey with them. For my prepared remarks, I will start with an overview of our Investor Day, including what we intend to achieve, some observations from the meeting and what we've learned since Second, I will highlight our first quarter financial results. Third, I want to provide a spotlight on our business strategy and long-term view of India, a business that we briefly touched on at our Investor Day. Fourth, given the widespread interest, I will offer a few observations on the impact of tariffs. And last, I'll provide an update on our progress towards our financial targets that we outlined at our Investor Day.\nKeith will then provide more detail on our financial results, and Don Bailey and John Hancock will join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Beginning with Investor Day, our objective was to demonstrate the incredible progress the company has made over the last 7 years and why we believe we're so well positioned for the future. We shared how we establish an underwriting culture of excellence, substantially reduced underwriting exposure, controlled volatility, structure the company for the future, refreshed our purpose and values, developed a world-class end-to-end operating structure, digitize end-to-end processes, develop a robust data hierarchy and retired over 1,200 applications while migrating to the cloud.\nWe discussed how we created a lean parent company and strengthened our balance sheet while executing a disciplined capital management strategy, which will enable AIG to have maximum strategic and financial flexibility for the future. We provided detail on our strategy to deploy Gen AI end-to-end and to demonstrate how the advancement in adoption is making a difference across our business to drive future growth, and that was on full display. I'm very grateful to our world-class partners, Alex Karp of Palantir and Dario Amadeo [indiscernible] for joining Sara Eisen and me on stage to showcase and validate our strategy.\nAnd while they are very entertaining guests and have better things to do with their time and show up at AIG's Investor Day, they felt compelled to speak to our stakeholders about how they fully endorse AIG's strategy. It was a very important moment for our company. We demonstrated the breadth and depth of our global portfolio with $24 billion of net premiums written, which enables us to leverage both our diverse geographic footprint and strong product offerings to solve our clients' risk needs. We highlighted what a thoughtful and carefully planned reinsurance strategy can do for a company over time, showcasing key structures of our portfolio, and providing an introduction to our special purpose vehicle backed by Blackstone, which is an important part of our strategic evolution.\nOur stakeholders came away from the event with a much clearer understanding of our strategic direction. The deep expertise within our company, our differentiated approach to Gen AI and our ambitious yet achievable financial targets and global growth opportunities. Inside the company, there's a sense of confidence and pride. Our Investor Day gave our colleagues the opportunity to see their hard work recognized in an impactful way, which has generated energy and engagement across the organization and we're excited to take this momentum forward.\nIf I had to choose just one key takeaway from our Investor Day, it is that AIG is in every way, a different company. Turning to our financial results. Against the challenging geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, we made excellent progress towards our long-term strategic and financial goals while delivering exceptional underwriting results, effectively managed volatility while reducing expenses. In the first quarter, adjusted after-tax income was $702 million or $1.17 per diluted share. Building on our momentum, we had another quarter of strong premium growth. Net premiums written were $4.5 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year on a comparable basis, led by 10% growth in Global Commercial.\nNorth America Commercial Insurance net premiums written grew 14% year-over-year. Lexington grew 23%, led by Lexington Casualty, which grew 27%. It's worth noting that Lexington's submission growth continued in the first quarter, increasing 30% year-over-year, and that is following an increase of over 50% in the first quarter of 2024 when compared to 2023, simply an outstanding result. This increase in submission activity was primarily driven by middle-market casualty and property, which together represents 2/3 of the total submissions received. [indiscernible] filter contributed 16% growth and retail property grew over 40%, almost entirely driven by the significant enhancements to our reinsurance structures.\nInternational Commercial Insurance net premiums written grew 8% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis, driven by property at 35%, largely as a result of enhanced reinsurance structures, and Marine grew an impressive 17%. Turning to expenses. Our general insurance expense ratio decreased to 30.5% in the first quarter compared to 31.8% in the prior year quarter. The divestiture of our travel business was the largest contributor to this improvement, accounting for 110 basis points. The remaining 20 basis points of improvement came from AIG NEXT initiatives. This is very impressive when you consider that general insurance absorbs $78 million of additional expenses that were booked in other operations in 2024.\nOther operations, general operating expenses were $85 million in the quarter. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 87.8%, the best first quarter result for AIG since the financial crisis. The prior year quarter was 88.4%. The calendar year combined ratio was 95.8% for the quarter, which included $520 million in catastrophe losses driven by the California wildfires, which came in at $460 million. The combined ratio represented 9.1 loss ratio points and is a testament to our strategy for managing volatility.\nWhile industry losses from natural catastrophes are the second highest for the first quarter of the year on record, we expect our net retained catastrophe losses to be within expectations for 2025, largely based on our reinsurance structures. If you apply our current loss projections for the wildfire catastrophe to our aggregate cover, we will have approximately $35 million net of annual aggregate deductible remaining for all other apparels in North America, excluding wind and earthquake. And approximately $385 million net left for all [indiscernible], both subject to a $50 million each and every loss deductible for the rest of this calendar year. We also continue to have significant property catastrophe occurrence limit available. Overall, the market remained favorable in the first quarter, particularly in segments with very good underlying fundamentals.\nKeith is going to cover rate in more detail in his remarks, but I wanted to provide some perspective. For North America, the rate increases in the quarter were led by excess casualty at 16%. In the last 5 calendar years, Excess Casualty has had double-digit rate increases each year with cumulative rate above loss trend. Glatfelter had a 6% rate increase. These increases were offset by financial lines, which decreased 5%, retail property, which decreased 7% and Lexington property, which decreased 10%.\nIn financial lines, we have the benefit of a highly diversified business by product and segment. This enables us to position the portfolio for the best risk-adjusted returns even in a competitive market. To further outline, we have meaningfully reduced our excess capacity, where pricing is increasingly commoditized. We're focused on our primary business where we have a differentiated offering and a leadership position. Our financialized portfolio has gone from representing 30% of North America commercial net premiums written in 2021 to representing 19% of the portfolio today.\nNext, let me give some context on property rate. Over the past 5 years, we have had cumulative rate increases of 113% in retail property and 96% in wholesale property. Pricing continues to be above our technical view. Nonetheless, we continue to be very disciplined and we'll monitor market conditions throughout the year. In international, the environment was more balanced. Casualty had a 7% rate increase. Property had a 2% rate increase, offset by Global Specialty and [indiscernible], which decreased 1% and 4%, respectively, and financial lines, which decreased by 3%.\nAnd please recall that we report rate on gross premiums written. And because many of our lines are heavily impacted by reinsurance in the first quarter, there's not a direct correlation to net premiums written, which are lower in certain businesses such as our Global Specialty business.\nTurning to capital management. We returned $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the first quarter. This included $2.2 billion of share repurchases and $234 million of dividends. We ended the quarter with a debt to total capital ratio of 17.1% and parent liquidity of $4.9 billion. As I announced on Investor Day, as of April 1, the AIG Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization to $7.5 billion, inclusive of the outstanding authorization amount of which approximately $7.1 billion remains available.\nAdditionally, the Board approved a 12.5% increase in our quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share yesterday. We expect to repurchase a total of $5 billion to $6 billion of shares in 2025, subject to share price and market conditions, which should bring us to a range of 500 million to 550 million shares outstanding over time. Now I'd like to transition to discuss one of our strategic partnerships. While we covered a lot of content on Investor Day, one part of our business that we did not address in any detail is Tata AIG. With this in mind, I'd like to share some observations on the rapidly growing market in India and insights about our joint venture with the Tata Group.\nIndia as a country has made remarkable progress over the last decade. Over that time, the economy has grown from the tenth largest to the fifth largest economy in the world and is likely to become the third largest economy after the United States and China by 2030. Real GDP is estimated to grow approximately 7% over the next 2 years with nominal GDP growing nearly 2x higher. The changing demographics in India are well known, but worth highlighting. In a country of nearly 1.5 billion people, half of the population is below the age of 30. The middle class is projected to more than double by 2030, with some of the fastest growth happening in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities.\nPivoting to the insurance industry, the general insurance market in India is over $35 billion in gross premiums written as of 2023 and had a compound annual growth rate of around 11% over the last 5 years. We expect the market will sustain this type of growth through 2030. And there's a massive opportunity for growth given the changing dynamics. In India, nonlife insurance penetration is still relatively low at 1% of GDP. In contrast, the United States is at 9% of GDP.\nOur presence in India began 25 years ago when we partnered with Tata Group to establish a joint venture, Tata AIG. The India insurance market opened to private insurance companies and direct foreign investment in 2000. At the time, the maximum allowable foreign investment was 26%, which is what we currently hold today. Prior to 2000, India's insurance market was dominated by public sector insurance companies, which had 100% market share. Opening up the market to private insurance and foreign direct investment dramatically shifted India's insurance landscape.\nToday, private sector insurance companies represent 60% of the non-life market. While India offers tremendous opportunity, it's a complex and highly competitive market. For foreign companies, it's important to choose the right partner, a company with deep and broad knowledge of India and one with a strong reputation. For AIG, there is no better choice than Tata Group, one of the highest quality global companies. Tata Group operates 30 companies in over 100 countries across diverse industries. [indiscernible] 26 publicly listed enterprises have a combined market cap of $365 billion with over 1 million employees.\nOver the last decade, Tata Group has been consistently ranked as one of India's most valuable brands. Tata AIG is highly respected and is ranked as the #2 private insurer in the commercial insurance and motor insurance sectors. It serves 27 million customers with 8,500 employees and leverages 85,000 captive agents operating across the country. Tata AIG had $2.1 billion of gross premiums written in 2024 and its mix of business is approximately 75% personal insurance and 25% commercial insurance. Tata AIG is a high-growth business. From 2020 to 2025, we had a compound annual growth rate of 20%, outpacing the market. Through 2030, we expect to continue to grow at the same compound annual growth rate, fueled by India's accelerating economy, rising insurance adoption and Tata AIG's market-leading brand and reputation. The business has exceptional technology and data capabilities that enabled it to scale rapidly and support the continued ambition for accelerated growth.\nTata AIG's products and services are digital first with clients and agents enabled by technology at every stage of the value chain, providing a complete digital customer experience, which is what clients in India expect. Additionally, Tata AIG benefits from access to AIG's multinational network with AIG supporting the joint venture's domestic multinational corporate clients. In close partnership with Tata Group, we're prepared to significantly invest in growth organically and possibly inorganically should opportunities present themselves, and I expect this business to continue to scale faster than any other geography in our portfolio.\nThere's been a lot of discussion about tariffs and I'd like to share a perspective understand that there is still significant uncertainty around the topic of tariffs. To start, let me provide some relevant facts. First, there are only 7 countries worldwide that export more than $100 billion in the United States. And China, Canada and Mexico are the only countries that export over $250 billion. When looking at a country's level of exports to the United States as a percentage of their total exports, Mexico is 79%, Canada is 74% and China is less than 20%.\nAltogether, tariffs create uncertainty, which may lead to lower levels of transactional activity in the near term, impacting certain commercial businesses, but it's premature to predict any specific outcomes related to these emerging macro trends. The greatest challenge for companies is understanding the real impact of tariffs and how they are changing and their implications. There's complexity not only with tariff policies evolving, but also with the potential impact on supply chains. It's also important to consider the implications to loss costs and inflation. To help parse through this complexity, let me share a property example.\nTypically in a high net worth claim and of course, it's subject to the particular type of loss, approximately 60% of the loss would be for rebuilding costs, 30% for content and 10% or thereabout for allocated loss adjustment expense. When considering materials such as lumber, floor coverings, windows, steel, marvel or granite, you need to take into account increased inflation rates. Then you should consider which of these items are important. For example, Canada represents roughly 85% of all U.S. softwood lumber imports. This added dimension further complicates the calculation of future loss costs.\nAdditionally, if there's another major catastrophe in 2025 beyond the January wildfires, we could see demand surge, supply constraints and further inflation which may also lead to extended business interruption. Lastly, insurance companies need to monitor the effects of sales, payroll and other factors to calculate the potential impact on future premiums, if any. We will continue to monitor the implications for our business as more information becomes available.\nBefore I close, I want to touch on the financial targets that we announced on Investor Day. These are multiyear goals, so I'm not going to give updates every quarter, but I did want to provide some insight. Operating EPS is on track and the key drivers for earnings growth remains favorable. We produced strong top line growth and managed volatility in a very heavy catastrophe quarter. We are on our way to fully replacing [indiscernible] earnings by 2026 and we expect to achieve a 20% plus earnings per share compound annual growth rate over the next 3 years. We continue to make progress towards our goal of achieving 10% to 13% core operating ROE. Our first quarter core operating ROE was 7.7%, which was impacted by catastrophe losses.\nWe expect to meet our 2025 objective of a 10%-plus core operating ROE as we outlined on Investor Day. We made terrific progress towards our goal of achieving an expense ratio of below 30% for General Insurance, with the first quarter coming in at 30.5%. We will continue our significant focus to maintain an expense structure that aligns with the size of the company that we are, while investing in our data and digital strategies.\nAnd finally, turning to our dividend. We announced our intent at Investor Day to grow the dividend per share by 10% plus in 2025 and 2026. Yesterday, the AIG Board of Directors approved a 12.5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share starting in the second quarter of 2025.\nIn summary, we've entered an exciting new chapter for AIG, and we're executing on all aspects of our strategy. With that, I'll turn the call over to Keith.\n\nKeith Francis Walsh\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning. Starting with General Insurance. Overall results were strong and reflected excellent underwriting and disciplined expense management. Adjusted pretax income or APTI, was $979 million, a decrease of $379 million from the prior year quarter due to higher catastrophe losses primarily related to the California wildfires. Underwriting income was $243 million, down $353 million from the prior year quarter. Results reflect higher catastrophe losses partially offset by favorable prior year development and continued improvement in accident year underwriting. First quarter general insurance gross premiums written were $9 billion, an increase of 3% from the prior year and net premiums written were $4.5 billion, an 8% increase.\nGeneral Insurance combined ratio was 95.8% compared to 89.8% in the prior year quarter and included 9.1 points of [indiscernible] losses versus 1.9 points in the first quarter of 2024. Prior year development, net of reinsurance was $64 million favorable, up from $22 million favorable in the prior year. This quarter included $31 million of ADC amortization and $33 million of favorable development, largely related to favorable actual versus expected loss experience in the U.S. property and global specialty lines.\nLooking ahead to the rest of 2025, the ADC amortization is expected to be approximately $31 million each quarter compared to $34 million a quarter in 2024. Our global commercial business had a terrific start to the year. Net premiums written grew 10%. We produced a combined ratio of 91.2% despite elevated [ cat activity ], and our expense ratio improved 40 basis points from the prior year quarter, an excellent result. North America commercial calendar year combined ratio was 93.9%, which included 12 points of cats. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 84.3%, an improvement of 160 basis points from the first quarter of 2024.\nThe expense ratio declined a full 2 points, driven by a combination of AIG NEX benefits and increased operating leverage, partially offset by higher corporate expense allocations as the company implemented its lean parent structure. The accident year loss ratio was 62.2% for the quarter, a 40 basis point increase year-over-year due to changes in business mix. Turning to international commercial. The calendar year combined ratio was 88.2%. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of a sub-90 combined ratio, an outstanding result. The accident year combined ratio as adjusted was 85.4%, which increased 240 basis points year-over-year.\nThis was primarily driven by a 130 basis point increase in the expense ratio as a result of lean parent allocations. The accident year loss ratio was 54.6%, a 110 basis point increase year-over-year reflecting business mix and increased operating costs from lean parent implementation. Turning to Global Personal. The combined ratio was 107.9%, while the accident year combined ratio as adjusted improved 140 basis points year-over-year to 95.6%. Excluding the divested travel business, the accident year combined ratio improved 110 basis points, owing to a 190 basis point improvement in the accident year loss ratio.\nThis was driven by underlying improvement in our U.S. high net worth book benefiting from a combination of rate over trend, business mix and underwriting actions. This was partially offset by a 70 basis point increase in our acquisition ratio, which we expect to unwind and improve over the course of 2025 as reinsurance and improved commission terms with PCS earn through. As we outlined at Investor Day, we expect to drive financial performance in global personnel by improving the combined ratio by 500 basis points over the next 3 years towards our 94% target.\nMoving to rates, where Peter already provided some perspective. For the first quarter, excluding workers' compensation and financial lines, global commercial lines pricing, which includes rate and exposure, increased 4%. In North America Commercial, renewal rate increased 1% year-over-year. If you exclude workers' compensation and financial lines, renewal rate was up 2% with overall pricing up 4% year-over-year.\nIn International Commercial, overall pricing was up 2% or up 4% excluding financial lines. This is an improvement versus the fourth quarter where pricing was flat. While international commercial overall pricing is slightly below loss cost trends, excluding financial lines, pricing and loss cost trends are roughly in line. Moving to other operations. First quarter adjusted pretax loss was $70 million, a significant improvement versus the prior year quarter of $205 million, reflecting substantially lower general operating expense, higher net investment income and lower interest expense.\nAs Peter mentioned, we have achieved our other operations run rate GOE target at $85 million in the first quarter and are on track for $350 million of annual expenses in 2025. We are now a much simpler company with a lean parent corporate structure that supports our 3 operating segments. Turning now to investment income. Our investment portfolio is high quality and well diversified with durations that are closely matched to our liability profile. It's predominantly comprised of investment-grade fixed maturity securities, helping to minimize exposure to short-term market swings.\nFirst quarter net investment income on an APTI basis was $845 million, an increase of $4 million year-over-year. Net investment income is comprised of 2 categories: our core portfolio, which sits in general insurance and income from parent liquidity and core bridge dividends which sits in other operations. First, on General Insurance. Net investment income was $736 million, down $26 million or 3% year-over-year owing to lower income from other invested assets and alternative investments, partially offset by higher income from the fixed maturity portfolio as we benefit from improved reinvestment rates.\nOther invested assets had a loss of $18 million compared to income of $38 million in the first quarter 2024. One variable worth noting is how we account for our joint venture with Tata Group. We include 26% of Tata AIG's net income and other invested assets, which also includes mark-to-market changes in their investment portfolio which reflects capital market movements in India. It is reported under the equity accounting method with a 1-quarter lag.\nBased on our current view, we expect General Insurance total net investment income to be up modestly in the second quarter versus the $736 million in the first quarter. The gains in the fixed maturity and loan portfolio are likely to be offset by lower income from other invested assets and alternative investments. During the first quarter, the average new money yield on the fixed maturity and loan portfolio was 4.56%, roughly 135 basis points higher than sales and maturities in the quarter.\nThe annualized yield, excluding calls and prepayments was 4.11%, a 24 basis point increase year-over-year or 19 basis points sequentially. Turning to other operations. Net investment income was $108 million, consisting of income from our parent liquidity portfolio of $77 million and Core bridge dividend income of $31 million. Considering current interest rates and lower liquidity balances as we repurchase shares, we expect income from our parent liquidity portfolio to be around $50 million in the second quarter, subject to market conditions.\nTurning to tax. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 22.8%, which included a net benefit from discrete items. As we stated on our fourth quarter earnings call, we expect the adjusted tax rate for the full year 2025 to be in line with the full year 2024 level with slight variations quarter-to-quarter.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. We continue to have strong financial flexibility. We believe this positions us well to execute on our strategic priorities while navigating evolving market conditions. Book value per share was $71.38 at quarter end, up 10% from March 31, 2024, mainly due to the favorable impact of lower interest rates on investment AOCI.\nAdjusted tangible book value per share was $67.96, down 8% from March 31, 2024, primarily due to the impact of the core bridge deconsolidation. At the end of the first quarter, we had a debt to total capital ratio of 17.1%. In conclusion, we had a strong first quarter. We expect to deliver on our target of 10% plus core operating ROE in 2025, while making steady progress on the financial targets we outlined at our Investor Day.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Peter.\n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO\n\nThank you, Keith. Michelle, we're ready for questions. Thank you.",

This conference is being recorded. Now, at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\n\nQuentin McMillan\n\nVP, Managing Director, and Head of Investor Relations, AIG\n\nThanks very much, Michelle, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially.\nExcept as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change. Today's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement, and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com.\nFollowing the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial on 9 June 2024, the historical results of Corebridge for all periods presented are reflected in AIG's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations in accordance with US GAAP. Additionally, in the Q4, AIG realigned its organizational structure and the composition of its reportable segments to reflect changes in how AIG manages its operations, which our Chief Financial Officer, Keith Walsh, will discuss in detail during his remarks.\nFinally, today's remarks related to AIG's adjusted after-tax income per diluted share, as well as General Insurance results, including key metrics such as underwriting income, margin, and net investment income, are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison adjusted for the sale of crop risk services and the sale of Validus Re as applicable.\nNet premiums written and net premiums earned are also presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis and adjusted for the sales of crop risk services, Validus Re, and the Global Personal Travel and Assistance business as applicable. We believe this presentation provides the most useful view of our results and the go-forward business in light of the substantial changes to the portfolio since 2023.\nPlease refer to pages 37 through 39 of the earnings presentation for reconciliation of such metrics reportable on a comparable basis. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our Q4 and full year 2024 financial results. Following my remarks, Keith will provide additional perspectives on our financial results, and then we'll take your questions. Don Bailey and Jon Hancock will join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Before I begin, on behalf of all of us at AIG, I want to acknowledge the devastating impact of the recent wildfires in California on families, communities, and the businesses affected.\nOur local teams remain on the ground in California, providing critical expertise and support to our customers and partners. This tragic event serves as a stark reminder of the escalating risks, elevated catastrophe landscape, and the complicated evolving environment that we operate in. It also underscores AIG's purpose to help our customers and clients navigate these challenges with resilience in rebuilding communities and restoring businesses.\nLet me take a moment to cover what I will walk you through during my remarks this morning. First, I will briefly share highlights from our strong Q4 performance. Second, I will discuss our 2024 strategic and operational accomplishments. Third, I will provide an overview of the full year financial results for AIG and our general insurance business. Fourth, I will comment on the reinsurance market, including the 1 January renewals, and provide some observations on the impact of the recent California wildfires.\nAnd lastly, I'll provide an update on the progress we have made on our capital management strategy, our path to achieving a 10% plus core ROE, and how we are positioning the company for 2025. Let's begin with the Q4 results. We recently announced a realignment of our General Insurance business into three segments: North America Commercial, International Commercial, and Global Personal.\nAll of our comments will be aligned to these segments. During the quarter, we continued to deliver exceptional underwriting results, and we maintained rigorous expense discipline. General Insurance reported strong net premiums written of $6.1 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year, led by 8% growth in Global Commercial lines. Global Commercial generated new business of $1.1 billion, a 16% increase year-over-year, along with continued strong retention of 86% across the portfolio. Net premiums earned of $6 billion grew 6% year-over-year. Adjusted after-tax income per share grew 5% year-over-year to $1.30 per share.\nThe calendar year combined ratio was 92.5%. The accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.6%, which was an outstanding result. 2024 was a terrific year of accomplishments for AIG, during which we not only delivered strong financial performance, but also successfully executed significant strategic and operational initiatives.\nWe delivered disciplined growth in our businesses with a primary focus on risk-adjusted returns supported by our underwriting expertise. We reshaped the portfolio, including divesting a number of non-core businesses. Following the sale of Validus Re in November of 2023, we closed on the sale of the global individual personal travel insurance business in December of 2024 to further position us for the future. While these divestitures helped to further simplify AIG, the biggest accomplishment of the year was the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial.\nThe separation was a four-year journey during which we strategically positioned Corebridge for its future while creating a new capital structure for AIG. Some of the major milestones of the Corebridge journey included establishing a very important partnership with Blackstone through an initial 9.9% sale in 2021, executing the largest U.S.\nIPO in 2022, setting up a strategic asset management partnership with BlackRock, divesting non-core foreign businesses, completing five successful secondary offerings, two of which were in 2024, and culminating in the Q4 with AIG's sale of a 22% stake in Corebridge for $3.8 billion to Nippon Life, securing another strategic partner for the company. With the accounting deconsolidation of Corebridge, AIG is now a less complex and more streamlined global business.\nAIG Next was another operational accomplishment in the year, which further supported our journey to make the company leaner, weave the organization together, and reduce expenses. We exited 2024, achieving $450 million in run rate savings as part of the program, and we expect the remaining benefits to be realized in the first half 2025.\nWe also continued to successfully execute on our capital management strategy in a very disciplined manner, with nearly $10 billion of actions in 2024. AIG reduced shares outstanding by 12% and increased the quarterly dividend per share by 11%, resulting in the return of $8.1 billion of capital to shareholders. We received over $4 billion in dividends from our subsidiaries due to the improved profitability of our operations. We further reduced our debt to total capital ratio to 17%, and we ended the year with $7.7 billion of parent liquidity.\nOur capital management actions to date have provided us with tremendous financial flexibility. Another strategic accomplishment in 2024 was the delivery of AIG's first generative artificial intelligence large language model-powered solution to support business growth.\nSpecifically, we implemented AIG Underwriter Assist, which automates qualitative unstructured data extraction from underlying submissions, internal AIG data sources, and external research in minutes to support underwriter review of submissions. To support and advance our GenAI aspirations, we've cultivated an ecosystem of top-tier technology partners, including Palantir, Anthropic, and AWS, in support of an agentic architecture operating model that allows for maximum flexibility.\nWe also launched the Reinsurance Syndicate 2478 at Lloyd's through a multi-year strategic relationship with Blackstone as part of AIG's outwards reinsurance program. The syndicate began underwriting on 1 January 2025, and now serves as a key component of AIG's reinsurance strategy, which I will go over in more detail later. Turning to the financial results for the full year 2024, adjusted after-tax income was $3.3 billion, or $4.95 per diluted share, an increase of 28% year-over-year.\nThe improvement was primarily driven by stronger underlying underwriting results, expense reduction benefits from AIG Next, an increase in net investment income, and the execution of our balanced capital management strategy. General insurance delivered terrific financial performance for 2024. For the full year, net premiums written were $23.9 billion, a 6% increase year-over-year. Net premiums earned were $23.5 billion, a 7% increase year-over-year. The Accident Year combined ratio as adjusted was 88.2%, which marked the sixth consecutive year of improvement, largely driven by the GOE ratio.\nThe full year General Insurance combined ratio was 91.8%. This was the third consecutive year of a sub-92 combined ratio. Prior year reserve development, net of reinsurance and prior year premium was $289 million, a benefit of 1.4 points to the loss ratio. General Insurance full year underwriting income was $1.9 billion, roughly in line with the prior year despite higher catastrophe losses.\nIn Global Commercial, net premiums written of $16.8 billion increased 7% year-over-year. North America Commercial grew net premiums written by 9% year-over-year. Lexington grew net premiums written by 14%, fueled by robust new business of $1.1 billion and a 42% increase in submissions year-over-year, and that was balanced across all lines. Retail Casualty grew net premiums written by 11%, excluding the closeout transaction we mentioned in the Q3. Our portfolio continues to benefit from a strong rate environment, high retention of our existing portfolio at 93%, and we have select opportunities in new business.\nInternational Commercial grew net premiums written by 4% year-over-year, driven by energy at 13%, retail property at 11%, and Talbot at 7%. Global Personal grew net premiums written by 3% year-over-year, driven by international personal auto at 8%, and our High Net Worth business at 6%.\nI would now like to turn to reinsurance and provide some observations on the market and an update on AIG's reinsurance renewals at 1 January of this year. Overall, AIG had a very strong 1-1 renewal season. Since the reinsurance market's major reset on 1 January 2023, our consistency in strategy, placement, and execution has positioned us very favorably. Benefiting from an environment of higher retentions and commensurate pricing increases, property reinsurers sought to deploy more capital but were predominantly focused on upper layers with more remote return periods.\nDepending on loss activity, limited additional demand led to risk-adjusted rate reductions that were consistent with expectations, with the bottom catastrophe layers renewing flat to down 5% and upper catastrophe layers receiving reductions of 10% to 15.\nI want to provide some context and observations on the changes in the market as a result of the increase in reinsurance retentions, which I've mentioned on previous calls. It's creating an interesting dynamic for the market in 2025. One insightful statistic from an Aon study of over 150 companies over the past 10 years is that retentions have risen significantly around the world, with US attachment points on average increasing by 280%.\nAs a reminder, in 2024, insured loss from natural catastrophes was approximately $145 billion, the sixth costliest on record, and this compares to the average for the last five years of $140 billion. With the increased retentions and increased catastrophe activity, much more of the risk is now being retained by insurance companies.\nIn 2023 and 2024, primary insurance carriers are estimated to retain approximately 90% of the insured loss from natural catastrophes, with the reinsurance industry absorbing 10%. Contrast this with the period prior to 2023. Reinsurers would often share a significantly higher proportion of the insured loss, with the distribution of losses between insurers and reinsurers at approximately 50/50 on average.\nMeanwhile, AIG is focused on maintaining lower excess loss attachment points, including meaningful aggregate coverage to manage frequency of loss tailored to our geographic exposure and to the type of perils that we are exposed. Taking a closer look at wildfires and how the markets changed, the average annual insured loss from 2000 to 2024 was approximately $4 billion globally, of which the US is the majority at $3.5 billion.\nNarrow that period to the last 10 years, and average annual losses from wildfires have roughly doubled to around $8 billion, of which $7.4 billion has occurred in the United States. Insured loss estimates for the California wildfires are currently coalescing around $40 billion, with some estimates from credible catastrophe experts reaching as high as $50 billion. The economic loss is estimated to be in excess of $250 billion, producing a protection gap of as much as 80%.\nContrast that to the top 10 largest insured cat events on record, where insurance has typically covered 40% to 50% of the economic loss. As a point of reference, insurance covered approximately 50% of the economic loss from Hurricane Katrina, the largest natural catastrophe event this century. The California wildfires demonstrate the increased loss from secondary perils and the magnitude of tail events that are not captured well in modeling.\nIn a month with one of the lowest model probabilities of loss, the California wildfires alone would make the Q1 of 2025 the second most costlyQ1 for natural catastrophes on record. Fifteen years ago, adjusting for inflation, $100 billion was considered the benchmark for an outsized cat year.\nBut with the last eight years averaging more than $140 billion, this thinking is clearly outdated. If you assume the upper end of the range for the California wildfires, taking a $50 billion loss pick, adding the average annual insured loss for the past eight years, and assuming we have an active but not abnormal wind season, which is realistic given the 2024 hurricane season experience, and ocean temperatures are the warmest on record, 2025 could be a year of more than $200 billion of insured catastrophe losses. This could recalibrate the entire industry.\nAIG reduced our overall California exposure beginning in 2022. This decision, coupled with our 2025 reinsurance structure, has effectively reduced our exposure such that the expected loss to AIG from the recent wildfires is approximately $500 million before reinstatement premiums and barring any unforeseen additional developments. Turning specifically to AIG's reinsurance outcomes at 1/1, we successfully maintained our prior objectives, our reinsurance purchasing strategy to preserve and optimize capital, and enhance the quality of earnings through active management of the volatility of our underwriting results.\nStarting with our property catastrophe placements, our core commercial North America retention of $500 million remains unchanged in nominal terms for the third consecutive year despite growth in the underlying portfolio. We also expanded coverage, maintained our core international occurrence attachments, and renewed our dedicated occurrence tower for our high net worth business, which attaches at $200 million.\nWe improved our $500 million of aggregate protection by reducing the annual aggregate deductible for North America, creating a specific non-peak section, and expanding the coverage for the high net worth portfolio. Overall, for North America, depending on loss distribution, AIG's modeled net first loss exposure, including the impact of reinstatement premiums, is comparable to 2024, and our second and third event exposure is materially lower following this renewal cycle.\nFor all of our major proportional treaties, we were able to improve or maintain our ceding commission levels, a strong recognition of our underwriting expertise, and our position as a market leader across multiple classes. We were also able to establish two new proportional treaties to support the high net worth portfolio.\nOur strategy to establish Private Client Select as a standalone MGU and introduce capacity to support growth in the platform beyond AIG's balance sheet has been validated with the addition of five of the leading underwriting companies in the world to the platform, taking 30% of our homeowners and auto portfolios through quarter-share reinsurance. Casualty remains an area of caution for many reinsurers, with appetite generally diminished.\nThey are highly selective of the insurance companies they support, and overall, the casualty renewals were more orderly for the companies that had strong underwriting portfolios. We were pleased with the successful renewal of our core casualty treaties at favorable terms. This renewal cycle again signals the strong external industry recognition that AIG continues to be a leader in the casualty market.\nWe remain optimistic on the outlook for our Casualty portfolio and see considerable opportunities ahead, while being cautious and very focused on maintaining our high underwriting standards. Also of significance for AIG in Q1 was our launch of a new dedicated reinsurance syndicate at Lloyd's, supported by funds managed by Blackstone. This pioneering structure, announced in December 2024, is an example of how insurance risk can be directly connected to sophisticated investors to generate attractive returns for both parties.\nThe syndicate provides AIG with a long-term, meaningful reinsurance partner and an additional source of fee income. Blackstone has access to a high-quality, well-diversified underwriting portfolio with the ability to generate attractive returns by taking a sizable participation in the majority of AIG's outward reinsurance treaties at market terms. We're pleased to partner with a leading global asset manager on this innovative structure.\nOur reinsurance strategy has played a pivotal role in our journey to establish AIG as an industry-leading global P&C underwriter. We're grateful for the long-term support and partnership of the industry's leading reinsurers, which has helped position us where we are today. Turning to capital management, we continue to execute very well on our balance and discipline strategy. We made major progress in 2024 and in many ways exceeded expectations.\nAs we outlined last year, our guidance was to repurchase $10 billion of shares in 2024 and in 2025. The current guidance is expected to bring us within our target share count range of 550 to 600 million shares. We have $3.4 billion of the $10 billion guidance that I provided remaining for 2025. We will likely exceed this guidance, and we have over $5.6 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.\nWe expect to return to more normalized levels of share repurchases as we enter 2026, assuming we have no further sell-downs of Corebridge or other additional sources of liquidity. We ended the year with a very strong parent liquidity of $7.7 billion. Additionally, we do not anticipate taking any actions that would significantly affect leverage in 2025.\nWe are committed to reviewing our dividend annually and anticipate that we will increase our dividend in 2025 in line with the decrease in our share count over the past year, subject to AIG board approval. Going forward, our key focus is on profitable growth and allocating capital to the best opportunities for the most attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nOur very early forecast indicates we're off to a strong start for 2025, and barring any unforeseen developments, we expect to achieve meaningful organic growth driven by our global commercial business and the benefits of our restructured reinsurance program. As a result of our disciplined capital management, combined with our sustained underwriting excellence and continued focus on expense management, we're well on track to deliver a 10% plus core operating ROE for the full year 2025. We have several ways in which we can deliver on this commitment.\nThese are maintaining our strong underwriting results with a focus on improving Global Personal, improving our investment income yields, executing on a simpler, leaner business model across AIG, and continued balanced capital management. In summary, I'm very pleased with our outstanding Q4 and full year 2024 performance. 2025 is a new chapter for AIG, and we're moving forward with strong momentum.\nWe continue to differentiate ourselves with deep industry expertise and discipline focused on underwriting excellence and outstanding operations and claims capabilities, which drive exceptional value for our clients, partners, and stakeholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Keith.\n\nKeith Walsh\n\nCFO, AIG\n\nThank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide details on Q4 results for General Insurance, net investment income, and other operations, as well as key balance sheet items. I would like to begin by addressing a few changes in our financial reporting. As Peter mentioned, we have realigned our General Insurance business into three reporting segments: North America Commercial, International Commercial, and Global Personal. Global Personal lines have been consolidated into a single reporting segment. This brings together our Global Accident and Health, Personal Home and Auto, Global Warranty and Services, and High Net Worth businesses.\nAlong with our new reporting segments, we have updated the product line net premiums written disclosure on page eight of our financial supplement to give more transparency into the underlying trends in our businesses. The three segments and updated product line disclosure are reflected retrospectively in AIG's 2024 Q4 and full year financial results. Additionally, we have streamlined other operations to include activities only related to having a global regulated parent company and now exclude the results of runoff businesses from adjusted pre-tax income.\nWe believe these changes enhance the clarity of our financial disclosures and provide a better representation and alignment of our core business. Historical results have been recast to reflect these changes with de minimis impact to operating EPS. Other operations now largely consist of net investment income from our parent liquidity portfolio, Corebridge dividend income, corporate general operating expenses, and interest expense.\nTurning to our Q4 General Insurance results, Adjusted Pre-Tax Income, or APTI, was $1.2 billion. In North America Commercial, net premiums written increased 9% year-over-year, driven by strong new business, which grew 17% with retention of 85%. International Commercial net premiums written increased 7% year over year, with new business growth of 15% and excellent retention of 88%. In Global Personal, net premiums written increased 1% on a constant currency basis.\nThe sale of the Global Personal Travel and Assistance business, which closed in early December, was about a four-point headwind to the year-over-year comparison. Adjusting for that, growth was 5% in the quarter on a comparable basis, driven by 16% growth in our Global High Net Worth business. The sale of the Global Personal Travel business will have an impact on the Global Personal segment in 2025.\nFor full year 2024, this segment had $7.1 billion of net premiums written. When modeling 2025, the sale of the Global Travel business will remove approximately $720 million of net premiums written. This is a roughly 10 percentage point growth impact for the segment. General Insurance underwriting income for the quarter was $454 million, a $156 million decrease from the prior year quarter, driven entirely by higher catastrophe losses.\nGeneral Insurance calendar year combined ratio was 92.5%. The accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, was 88.6%, a 30 basis points increase from the prior year quarter. This was driven by a slight increase in the accident year loss ratio, while the expense ratio remained flat despite absorbing more AIG parent expenses. Catastrophe losses were $325 million, or 5.5 points on the loss ratio.\nThis includes $224 million of losses from Hurricane Milton and an adjustment for prior quarter's events, largely from Hurricane Helene, which occurred on the final day of the Q3. Turning to reserves and our detailed valuation reviews, or DVRs. This quarter, General Insurance had $102 million of favorable prior year development, including $34 million from the ADC amortization, $16 million from our Q4 DVRs, and $52 million from non-DVR adjustments, predominantly recognition of AVE on US short tail lines.\nThe Q4's DVRs covered the remaining 10%, or approximately $4 billion, of our total loss reserves, focusing on the remaining portion of US Financial Lines, Global Personal Lines, Canada, and Glatfelter. The favorable prior year development was primarily driven by Canada Casualty and US E&O. We conduct a comprehensive DVR annually for each product line across our $40 billion of reserves.\nWhile DVRs are spread across quarters, we have a robust year-round process on our entire book, in addition to our quarterly DVRs. Going forward, our comments will focus less on reporting the DVR outcomes and more on our overall reserve analysis, which reflects AVE, claims diagnostics, and rate monitoring across all lines and geographies.\nOne additional item I would like to discuss is a provisional reserve we created in 2022 in response to the potential uncertainty with inflation and other variables in the post-pandemic macro environment. This provision, which is included in IBNR, has been carried in the lines that we viewed as most susceptible to rising inflation, with a large portion booked in our workers' compensation reserves.\nThis year, we undertook a thorough review of the uncertainty provision, which was set above the loss picks from our actuarial reviews, and refined our analysis, including its allocation among our lines of business. The uncertainty provision did not reflect any emergence, and we have maintained the overall estimate. However, we have decided to reduce the provision in excess workers' comp and reapportion approximately $150 million of the provision within Excess Casualty.\nWe elected to move this portion of the reserve to Excess Casualty, as the development factors and the length of the tail can drive a wider range of outcomes on our reserves. To be clear, our traditional reserve methods are not indicating any emergence in Excess Casualty, but we felt, given the nature of the provision, it was more appropriate to be situated within this line.\nAs a reminder, our reserving philosophy is to react to bad news quickly and wait to recognize good news over time as we monitor developments. Moving on to rates and pricing, Q4 Global Commercial Lines pricing, which includes rate and exposure, increased 5% year-over-year, excluding Workers' Compensation and Financial Lines. In North America commercial, renewal rate increased 3% year-over-year, or 7% if you exclude Workers' Compensation and Financial Lines.\nExposures increased 2% year-over-year, with an all-in pricing change above loss cost trend. Property market conditions were under pressure in the Q4 due to increased competition across both the admitted and E&S markets, while the underwriting margin remained healthy, supported by the cumulative rate increases over the past several years and our disciplined approach.\nIn North America Casualty Lines, rate continued to outpace loss cost trend, with increases in the mid-teens in wholesale and Excess Casualty. In North America Financial Lines, we continue to experience headwinds but see indications that rate reductions are moderating. In International Commercial, overall pricing was flat, or up 2% excluding Financial Lines. While rate is below trend, we feel good about our book, given we've had over 60% cumulative risk-adjusted rate since 2018.\nOur well-diversified portfolio allows us to navigate different market conditions effectively, prioritizing lines of business that offer the most compelling risk-adjusted returns while upholding our underwriting standards. For the full year 2024, excluding Workers' Compensation and Financial Lines, Global Commercial Lines pricing, which includes rate and exposure, increased 6%, with 8% in North America and 4% in international. Turning to other operations, Q4 adjusted pre-tax loss was $150 million, which improved 34% year-over-year.\nThis was primarily driven by lower GOE, reflecting AIG Next benefits, as well as incremental movement of GOE into General Insurance. We continue to realize the benefits of AIG Next and push non-public company-related expenses into the business. We expect corporate GOE expenses to migrate towards approximately $90 million per quarter run rate over the course of 2025. Interest expense improved $10 million year-over-year as a result of our liability management, which reduced total debt by $1.6 billion in 2024.\nOne other item I want to discuss is a runoff business, Blackboard. In the Q4, we increased the prior accident year reserves for Blackboard by $112 million to reflect loss activity that has been well above what was expected. Turning now to investment income.\nFor the full year 2024, net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.5 billion, up 13% from 2023, primarily driven by Corebridge dividends, an increase in short-term investment income, and higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturities. Q4 net investment income on an APTI basis was $872 million, largely unchanged year over year. General Insurance net investment income was $779 million, including income on fixed maturities, loans, and short-term investments of $720 million, and alternative investment income of $72 million.\nOther operations net investment income was $93 million, consisting of income from our parent liquidity portfolio of $64 million and Corebridge dividend income of $29 million. During Q4, we continued to benefit from higher reinvestment rates on the fixed maturity and loan portfolio. The average new money yield of 5.38% was roughly 175 basis points higher than the sales and maturities in the quarter.\nThe annualized yield on the fixed maturity and loan portfolio, excluding calls and prepayments, was 3.92%, up 4 basis points year over year, or 3 basis points sequentially. Q4 alternative investment income was $67 million, an increase of $26 million year-over-year, driven by improved private equity performance, partially offset by lower hedge fund income, owing to our strategy to reduce exposure.\nPrivate equity yielded 6.42% for the quarter, below our long-term expected return of 7.5%. The makeup of our private equity portfolio is a little over 25% real estate, and with the current macro environment, we expect pressure from this portion of the portfolio to continue through 2025. Turning to tax, the adjusted effective tax rate for the Q4 and full year was 24.6%.\nFor 2025, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be in line with 2024, but may vary based on the geographic mix of income. We finished 2024 with a very strong balance sheet. Book value per share was $70.16 at year-end, up 8% from 31 December 2023, mainly due to the favorable impact of lower interest rates on AOCI and reduced shares outstanding. Adjusted book value per share was $73.79, down 6% from year-end 2023, primarily due to the impact of Corebridge deconsolidation. Core operating ROE was 9.1% in the quarter and for the full year. As Peter laid out, we are committed to achieving our target of a 10% plus core operating ROE for the full year 2025.\nAs Peter mentioned, we had a substantial $6.6 billion return to shareholders in 2024 through share repurchases, and are well on our way to completing our guidance of $10 billion of repurchases in 2024 and 2025. Through 7 February 2025, we have repurchased $952 million of shares year-to-date in 2025. We are proud of the significant progress we've made in 2024 and the ability to deliver outstanding core operating results while successfully executing significant transformation initiatives. With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThank you, Keith, and Michelle, we're ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one one. If your question hasn't answered and you'd like to remove yourself from the queue, please press star one one again. Our first question comes from Alex Scott with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nAlex Scott\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning. First one I had for you, excuse me, is on the core ROE that you gave. You know, I just wanted to confirm that that's including the wildfire impact, and you know, it looks like it's running a bit better than you know I would have expected based on the combined ratios that you've talked about in the past and corporate expenses and so forth. So I was just interested if you'd opine at all on maybe some of the things that you're running ahead on or that are improving relative to some of those comments you've made in the past. Thanks.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nYes, certainly, Alex. And yes, we are confirming the 10%+ ROE, including the $500 million wildfire that we had in January. If I could spend a second, you know, I think we've done an exceptional job over the past few years of structuring our sort of global portfolio, structuring the reinsurance to supplement that, and having net retentions well within our expectations, and what we budget.\nYou know, if I look at what we do budget for AL over the last couple of years relative to our overall experience, it's been exactly where we anticipated, even with elevated activity. So this is no different. I mentioned on the call that we're going to take first event losses around the same with reinsurance that we did in 2024, but second and third events will be less.\nAnd so that's how we structured it, and we are confirming guidance on the 10%, including what happened in January. I think Keith noted that we have a lot of different ways in which we can sort of drive improvement in terms of earnings. I did as well in my prepared remarks. We're really pleased with the commercial portfolio and how it's performed on a combined ratio basis. We just continue to, I think, elevate our overall performance. I have singled out personal because I think that combined ratio is not where any of us want to be. We consolidated that under one leader, Jon Hancock.\nHe's shown exceptional leadership in what he's done with the commercial portfolio and international, and I think it's going to give us a much better line of sight on the overall portfolio in terms of how we can improve it, which we fully expect to do. I think there's opportunities in NII, further capital management, and I think we reconfirmed what we're doing on return of capital to shareholders. So I think we have a lot of very positive momentum and want to confirm guidance. Do you have a follow-up, Alex?\n\nAlex Scott\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nYeah. So as a follow-up, I'd just be interested in some of the areas you're targeting for organic growth and maybe, in particular, your updated view on price adequacy, just given some of the declines in property price and in E&S, and then maybe also on Casualty.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nOkay. I'm going to have Jon Hancock and Don Bailey talk a little about the growth because they've done an exceptional job in terms of outlining where our portfolio can grow, focusing on risk-adjusted returns. You know, what I would say, and this is complementing their efforts, is that we've just done a tremendous job in terms of client retention, focusing on an underwriting culture of maintaining and improving profitability. And so we deploy capital where we think we have the best opportunities for improved risk-adjusted returns.\nAnd they've done an exceptional job on new business and targeting parts of our business where we think we can have those outsized returns over time. And I think that's how you've seen the portfolio shape. So Jon, why don't I start with you in terms of international and maybe give us a little bit of insight in terms of the growth?\n\nJon Hancock\n\nExecutive VP and CEO of International Commercial Insurance and Global Personal Insurance, AIG\n\nYeah. Okay. Thanks, Peter and Alex. Growth through retention and new business was strong in the quarter. Peter and Keith called out a lot of that in their opener remarks, so I won't repeat it now. But what I will say is we're working from such a strong base in this commercial portfolio in international. When we look at where we've been growing, if you look at the quarter, there's a lot of seasonality across international.\nFor example, in Q4, more than 50% of our net premiums come from just two lines. We like them, Global Specialty and Financial Lines, but that's not the full year mix. So I think looking at growth, looking at new business quarter-on-quarter isn't always the most insightful way. Q4 is obviously the end of the year as well.\nSo I think it's a good time to reflect on what we've been doing the whole of 2024 and talk about that momentum that we have been building. If I look at the full year, Keith called it out, 4% growth in the year across International Commercial. Renewal retention in the full year, 89%. I'm really, really pleased with that on such a good book of business. And new business for the year, more than $2 billion of new business during the year in International Commercial.\nAgain, a great outcome, really reflective of the fact that we're still seeing great new business opportunities all around the world, actually. And I also do want to make clear that new business is a big driver of our growth. We manage the quality, the price adequacy of our new business just as closely as we do our renewal book.\nWe trade on the value we offer. Our recognition as market leader, first-class claims, risk management, strong balance sheet, not just price. That matters to a lot of customers. If I could, I know you asked about property specifically. If I could just call out two places where we've been working really hard with our distribution partners on being clear on risk appetite, building propositions that customers want, building strong opportunity pipelines.\nThat's where we've been getting the growth momentum from, and that's what we will see all through this year. There's too many areas to call out across international, but Global Specialty, number of new business submissions up 24% year-on-year. Marine, absolutely outstanding at 46% increase. Our strike rate on the business, we quote more than 25%. And again, marine energy, which Peter talked about earlier, 40% strike rates.\nSo that's more than $700 million of new business in Global Specialty. And just a final one to show that momentum, our commercial property book, another standout. We spend a lot of time fixing and repositioning that portfolio, and we've now seen over the last couple of years really strong growth and profit. Growth of 11% in the year. We're still seeing strong mid-digit rate rises as well as exposure growth and some real high-quality new business. And the rating environment today, as Peter said earlier, is different to what it was in Q4. So we see lots of great opportunity all over, and we'll build on that momentum.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThat's great, Jon. Thank you. Don, maybe I just want to have a little bit of a highlight of achievements in North America in terms of growth.\n\nDon Bailey\n\nCEO of North America Insurance, AIG\n\nGreat. Thank you, Peter. I'll break down the North American commercial numbers. For 2024, and you mentioned this, we grew net premiums by 9% driven by retention and our new business. We had strong retention of 91% in retail and 76% in wholesale. We also delivered impressive new business growth, like Jon, in North America, 15% up on a year-over-year basis. And that's on top of 14% new business growth in 2023. This growth is intentional. It's strategic. It's diversified.\nWith the great work of the past few years on the portfolio, we came into 2024 with distribution engagement as a top priority for us in all the channels in which we operate. And it's paid off. Our new business was strong through all three channels: retail, wholesale, and alternative. With Lexington, we had another strong year. They represented 48% of our new business.\nLex Property and Casualty, Western World all delivered. As Peter referenced, Lex saw another big increase in submissions, 42% increase on a year-over-year basis. There's a clear opportunity to harness the strong submission activity there to drive growth as we go forward. The rest of the new business was balanced across the portfolio. Finally, Peter, I'll just say this at the end, that our growth, given our unique assets at AIG, we really are able to underwrite with great discipline within our risk appetites and target opportunities with attractive risk-adjusted returns. Thanks, Peter.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThat's great, Don. Jon, thank you. I know that answer was they were very thorough, but they're doing the work, and so I thought it'd be really helpful to hear from them. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.\n\nMeyer Shields\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nGreat. Thanks. Peter, I was hoping you could walk us through how we should think about the impact of the artificial intelligence deployed in underwriting. I know it's simplistic to say how many loss ratio points would it move, but how should we think about it more broadly?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThanks, Meyer, and good morning. For us, I could spend a meaningful amount of time talking about GenAI, and we fully intend to do that at Investor Day. Our focus has always been on driving growth. Certainly, there's opportunities in contact centers, call centers, and operational capabilities that, through large language models, robotics, that we will gain efficiencies. But for us, it's all about ingestion of data, getting more qualified data to the underwriters in a fraction of the time. And in order to do that, you need to be very disciplined sort of end-to-end.\nSo how we ingest data from brokers and agents, how we define what data we want in the underwriting criteria when it gets to the underwriter, how do we load that into models, and how do we get more data from credible sources that may supplement the underwriter's decision-making in order to continue to improve the portfolio. If I use Lexington as an example, in 2017 and 2018, we received 40,000 submissions.\nThis year, it's over 400,000. So it's more complex today than just building out algorithms to get to different industry groups or different classes of business. We want to get more to the underwriters real-time. And so we've been doing this for the better part of 18 months.\nI said we built out a really strong agentic ecosystem with, again, Data Ingestion with Palantir, building out large language models with Anthropic, and using other reliable third parties to help us accelerate the modeling. And so I think it's going to help us propel top-line growth by getting more data, getting richer data sets, giving the underwriters more capabilities to underwrite, and having it done in a fraction of the time and doing it at scale.\n\nMeyer Shields\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nOkay. Thank you. That's very helpful. The second question is on the timeline for getting the high-net-worth personalized business to growth underwriting profitability. I don't know if there's anything you can share on that.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nYeah, absolutely, Meyer. And look, I think we've been on that journey for a couple of years, and everybody's been patient with the story. We continue to improve the combined ratio. We continue to improve the loss ratio. And if you look at Global Personal, the biggest contributor in terms of that improvement, it was primarily all the Private Client Service or high-net-worth business. There was a significant improvement in the loss ratio, and we expect that to continue.\nWe have a balanced growth strategy with non-admitted as well as admitted and believe that as we see more submission activity, which we are, and non-admitted, that we're able to deploy our capital with more flexibility to be responsive to client needs. So I'm thinking about structure, pricing, the amount of limit that we can put out. And it's not only in peak zones. It's in non-peak zones.\nAnd so we expect to see that continue to accelerate. We got to scale this year, and so we've renegotiated ceding commissions with PCS. And so you'll see a meaningful improvement there, which should translate into overall expense ratio improvement and combined ratio improvement. And last I mentioned is that we have tremendous partners that have joined us based on how we've repositioned the portfolio and are encouraging growth.\nAnd so we have a 30% quota share with six participants, all have very strong expertise in the high-net-worth space that are backing us for more growth. So I think we have it all moving in the right direction. Attritional loss ratios, CAT, support from great partners, and improvement in expense ratio. And you'll see that contribute in 2025 to helping overall Global Personal improve.\n\nMeyer Shields\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nOkay. Fantastic. Thank you so much.\n\nQuentin McMillan\n\nVP, Managing Director, and Head of Investor Relations, AIG\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Jon Newsome with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nJon Newsome\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nGood morning. Results for the quarter.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThank you, Jon.\n\nJon Newsome\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nTwo sort of big picture questions. One is, are we at a point where there are aspirational areas of business that AIG is not in that you would be looking for, either on an organic or an organic basis? And I guess sort of relatedly, on the other side of that question is, where are we from a divesting of non-core businesses perspective? Are we pretty much done at this point?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nSure. Thanks for the question. I'll start with the second one first. I think we are largely done. I mean, I don't ever say never or always, but I think we now have the portfolio in a place where we like it, certainly on the commercial side. And now having one segment for Global Personal, we know we have work to do, but really like the mix of the portfolio. It's global balance and think that we can grow it. In terms of M&A, look, we're going to remain very disciplined.\nI always use the word when I get the question on the calls or I'm in front of you. It's around being it has to be compelling, which just means that it's either going to be a geography that's complementary, that actually adds value to AIG and our clients, products that we may not be in, that we like and think that it's going to be accretive to ROE and how we grow our business. There are businesses that we have that have scale, but additional scale could be quite compelling.\nSo we are looking at businesses that may do that and accelerate. Of course, then there's complementary businesses that we may not be in that we think could be very additive to the platform. We have a very disciplined approach. We always are looking around the world to see if there's things that are additive.\nBut I do want to say I think we're at the size and scale where we don't need to add anything. We are showing, and I think Jon and Don provided tremendous insight as to why we think we can grow the business organically. We have a really strong capital base, which we can grow into, and believe that there's a path there. So I don't think it's an either/or. I think we have now set the company up with enormous strategic and financial flexibility. We'll remain very disciplined as we look at inorganic, but we're very excited about the organic opportunities that are in front of us.\n\nJon Newsome\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nGreat. Maybe as a second question, do you have any thoughts on the regulatory environment? Clearly, lots of, as my grandmother would say, interesting things happening in California from a regulatory perspective. But broader, do you think there's some changes here that are coming, or do you think it's pretty status quo?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG",
    "content2": "Insurance is complicated because we're regulated state by state, and that makes every state a little bit different, right? And I think the ones that get the attention are going to be ones that have peak zone exposure like we're seeing within California. And California is particularly complicated because I relate it almost to Japan. It's a geography that has two major perils that drive catastrophe results. And so I was in Japan's typhoon and quake. California's quake and now wildfire. But there's regulators.\nWe work very closely with them to try and be helpful and constructive on the changes that have happened in the catastrophe climate, which is looking at modeling, looking at loss costs, looking at cost of goods sold, and looking at ways in which we can be more responsive to client needs. And I think that in California, we just saw that the modeling is flawed.\nIt doesn't necessarily always take into account tail events. There's not a lot of model losses north of 40 billion. And so therefore, it becomes very complicated. And I don't mean this in California, but we're now seeing it, which is some of these state set up sort of vehicles that become a market of last resort, sometimes become a market of only resort, and then they end up taking on a lot of aggregate. So I think we just need a reset in certain spots. And I think like insurance companies that have technical capabilities working very closely with regulators, I hope that we're going to position the businesses where we will have more flexibility in the future.\n\nJon Newsome\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you very much.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nYes, thank you.\n\nQuentin McMillan\n\nVP, Managing Director, and Head of Investor Relations, AIG\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Michael Zaremsky with BMO. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Zaremski\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, BMO\n\nHey, great. Follow-up morning on the expense ratio. I heard the comments about ceding commissions improving, so that should be a positive going forward. The expense ratio has been running a bit higher than expected for a while now. I mean, obviously, the loss ratio has been excellent. So that's the main focus. But just curious if you're willing to give any specific, more specific guidance on kind of what type of expense ratio level or acquisition expense ratio level we should be thinking about on a go-forward basis.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nMichael, are we talking about PCS and high-net-worth or just General Insurance?\n\nMichael Zaremski\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, BMO\n\nSorry, I was talking about the whole company, General Insurance.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nYeah. So let me unpack. I mean, again, I know with AIG, it's like with the divestitures and a lot of the moving pieces from other operations into General Insurance, it's complicated. But I'm actually really pleased with what we've done on the expenses. I think we've remained incredibly disciplined. We focused on a lean parent, which just meant that there's simplicity. There's not a lot of expenses sitting in other operations, and they're going to be more on the business.\nSo if I actually take you through what happened, if you look at our financial supplement, you'll see $2.9 billion or thereabouts, 2,952, as sort of the expenses. But if you get underneath that, look, AIG Next, the business was very proactive in getting expenses out. And so we would have gotten around $125 to 140 million out through AIG Next.\nBut we've added in from other operations and other technology that would have sat in other operations almost $200 million. And so the business has absorbed a lot of expenses as we reposition the company to have this lean parent, very transparent, not with a lot of expenses, and the business is absorbing it as we go. And so not only am I proud that they've been able to do that and we haven't had a blip; we also believe that there's opportunities to get more expenses out and the ratios to improve as we get through the rest of 2025.\n\nMichael Zaremski\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, BMO\n\nOkay.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nDo you have a follow-up?\n\nMichael Zaremski\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, BMO\n\nYeah, quick follow-up. Just, I know you made some comments on the Casualty marketplace. I'm not fast enough to update all the pricing data you gave us, which is always helpful. But I'm curious, are you experiencing any acceleration in Casualty pricing, either excess or retail? And do you still feel that? I feel like a couple of quarters ago, you mentioned this might be an area you're willing to play a bit of offense in?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nYeah. So it's a great question. And again, when we look at rate across North America International, it's an index. And so you don't always get line of sight. But we do see real opportunities in Casualty. We're very cautious, but the rate environment is actually quite strong. I mean, in Lexington Casualty, I'll start there. We had 14% rate in 2024. In retail Excess Casualty, we had 15%.\nThat's the fifth year in a row of double-digit rate increases in retail Excess Casualty. It's above loss cost trend. So we feel like we're building margin, really strong retention. We've been able to reposition the portfolio as we've liked. We have an exceptional, particularly in the US, leadership with Barbara Luck. I mean, we have the best underwriting team in the industry.\nThat's being demonstrated because clients are asking us to be on their business, help structure it, help with the terms and conditions so others will be active participants in the market. And so we're leading. We're underwriting really well. We've repositioned the portfolio. We got great reinsurance support for severity. And we're getting rate above loss cost. So I want to be very cautious and careful, but I also don't want to miss the opportunity to be an industry leader.\n\nMichael Zaremski\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, BMO\n\nThank you.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nOkay. I want to thank everybody for questions and your active participation today. In closing, I want to thank our AIG colleagues around the world for their continued commitment, teamwork, and the significant contributions. I mean, we accomplish a lot every year, and we try to capture it for you today. And we really appreciate you joining us today. And we look forward to sharing a lot more detail on 31 March during AIG's Investor Day. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for your participation. This does include the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "Q2 2024 American International Group Inc Earnings Call\n\nQ2 2024 American International Group Inc Earnings Call\n\nAIGNYSEAUG 1, 8:30 AM\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nAs Quentin mentioned at the beginning of the call, all figures I will reference today will be on a comparable basis excluding the impact of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services unless otherwise noted, in order to provide a clear view of our underlying performance.\nAdjusted after-tax income with $775 million or $1.16 per diluted share representing a 38% increase in earnings per share year-over-year driven by strong organic growth, a continuation of our very strong underwriting performance, ongoing expense discipline, volatility containment, and a decrease in shares outstanding. General Insurance net premiums written grew 7%, led by Global Commercial which grew over 8%. Underwriting income was $430 million. The underlying underwriting income excluding catastrophes and prior year development improved $110 million or 17% year-over-year. The calendar year combined ratio is 92.5%, a slight increase of 10 basis points from the prior year. The accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 87.6%, a 170 basis point improvement from the prior year. The CAT loss ratio was 5.7% or $325 million of total catastrophe related losses.\nConsolidated net investment income on an adjusted pre-tax income basis was $884 million, a 14% increase year-over-year. During the quarter we returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through $1.7 billion of stock repurchases and $261 million of dividends. We ended the second quarter with a total debt to total capital ratio of 18% including AOCI, and we have strong parent liquidity of $5.3 billion overall. I'm very pleased with our ability to continue to deliver outstanding financial performance and I'm equally pleased with the progress we're making on multiple strategic initiatives.\nThere are several things I want to cover on this call to give you a sense of where we are now, how we got here, and what the future holds. In addition to walking through our financial results on today's call, I plan to outline the recently announced transactions for our personal travel business and Private Client Select, provide a quick update on Q1 reinsurance renewals and a market update, discuss our disciplined execution of our capital management strategy, and provide an update on AIG Next. I should note that our strong financial results in the quarter were complicated by the complex accounting treatment of deconsolidation. In Sabra's prepared remarks, she will explain the impact to our capital structure, including shareholders' equity, as well as details on the GAAP accounting implications to our financial statements.\nBefore I go further, I want to take a moment to comment on the deconsolidation of Corebridge, which marked a major milestone for both AIG and Corebridge. It's important to reflect on the four-year journey, the significant accomplishments along the way, and the rationale behind this pivotal decision for AIG. At the height of the pandemic in 2020, we undertook a detailed analysis to explore strategic options to maximize value for AIG shareholders, including evaluating whether to separate our life and retirement business, which would eventually become Corebridge, from AIG. In October of 2020 we announced our intention to separate. There were many noteworthy accomplishments along the way and I'd like to highlight a few. In July of 2021, AIG announced that Blackstone would become an anchor investor in the new standalone company with its acquisition of 9.9% of Corebridge.\nCorebridge also entered into a long-term strategic asset management relationship with Blackstone to manage up to $92.5 billion of assets under management over the subsequent six years. At the end of March 2022, AIG announced a strategic partnership with BlackRock where they would manage $150 billion of certain fixed income and privately placed assets, of which $90 billion would come from the Corebridge portfolio. In mid-September 2022, AIG floated 12.4% of Corebridge and the largest US IPO of the year, a particularly noteworthy achievement during a time of significant market volatility. During 2023, we executed three marketed deals reducing our overall ownership to 52% by year-end. In 2023, Corebridge divested, with considerable strategic and transactional support from AIG, Laya Healthcare, and UK Life. These sales generated over $1.2 billion of proceeds for Corebridge investors.\nIn May of 2024, AIG announced it would sell 122 million shares of Corebridge, representing an approximately 20% stake in the company, to Nippon Life Insurance Company, one of the most respected life insurance companies in the world, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Lastly, in mid-June of this year, AIG announced it had met the requirements for the deconsolidation of Corebridge for accounting purposes. We remain committed to fully selling down a remaining ownership stake in Corebridge over time, subject to market conditions and other considerations. It's been quite a journey and we have accomplished a tremendous amount. Now let's turn to the travel business. During the quarter we also announced the sale of our global individual personal travel insurance and assistance business, which is another important strategic step in positioning AIG for the future.\nTo further simplify our portfolio, the transaction includes the global Travel Guard insurance business as well as its service companies and infrastructure and excludes our travel insurance businesses in Japan and our AIG joint venture arrangement in India with the Tata Group. AIG will continue to provide corporate group travel coverage through our accident and health business. The annual net premiums written for Travel are approximately $750 million, most of which are reported under North America Personal Insurance. The sale is expected to close by the end of 2024, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Last week we announced another significant transaction involving our high net worth business.\nAs we've discussed in prior quarters, over the course of several years we've been deliberately transforming our high net worth business to be better positioned for the future. We've done this through a series of strategic actions including the most recent announcement about entering into a strategic relationship with Ryan Specialty to become our excess and surplus lines distribution partner for high and ultra high net worth markets through our managing general underwriter Private Client Select Insurance Services. We like the business and we're committed to it. We've invested over $100 million in infrastructure and digital capabilities for our high net worth business over the past several years and we believe the business is well positioned for the future. We're also committed to delivering solutions and growing our embedded capabilities.\nAs we previously communicated, our plan for the portfolio has been to establish an MGU with appropriate infrastructure and core foundational capabilities, enable multiple points of distribution, and eventually attract more capital resources for the MGU. All while continuing to drive exceptional value for our high net worth clients. As we grow the business.\nAIG will provide exclusive ENS paper in all 50 states through Marble Shore Specialty Insurance Company, subject to regulatory approvals. This progress reflects the momentum we've created with expanded capabilities and broader partnerships. Now turning to general insurance results, gross premiums written for the quarter were $9.9 billion, an increase of 7% from the prior year. Net premiums written for the quarter were $6.9 billion, a 7% increase from the prior year, with 8% growth from Global Commercial and 5% growth from Global Personal.\nGlobal Commercial had an excellent quarter with strong net premiums written growth of 8% driven by significant new business, impressive retention, and continued accident year combined ratio improvement in North America. Commercial net premiums written grew 10%. Lexington grew 16% led by wholesale casualty, which grew 35%, Western World, which grew 20%. Wholesale property, which grew 12%. Retail casualty grew 11% with 21% growth in our risk management business, and we had 16% growth in excess casualty, and captive solutions grew 30% driven by new business. In International Commercial, net premiums written grew 6%, global specialty grew 8%, led by 18% growth in energy, Talbot grew 12%, and retail property grew 11%.\nIn the second quarter, Global Commercial produced record new business of nearly $1.3 billion, which is an 18% increase from the prior year quarter. North America Commercial produced new business of $753 million in the quarter, an increase of 26% year-over-year and an increase of over 60% from the prior quarter. The growth was led by Lexington, which had 31% new business growth year-over-year and 75% new business growth from the first quarter, the highest new business volume of any quarter in my tenure. Lexington also achieved a significant milestone with over $1 billion of gross premiums written this quarter, a 16% increase from the prior year quarter.\nThis is the highest gross premiums written quarter for Lexington since we repositioned the business in 2018. In other businesses, retail casualty new business grew over 40%, led by our risk management business and excess casualty.\nInternational Commercial produced new business of $522 million for the quarter, an increase of 9% year-over-year. This growth was led by Global Specialty, which had 17% new business growth, led by energy and marine. Casualty, which had over 30% growth, and Property, which had over 10% growth. In addition, Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention. International retention was 89%, and North America retention was 87%. Moving on to Global Personal Insurance, net premiums written grew 5% year-over-year. North America Personal net premiums written increased 8% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by the high net worth business.\nInternational personal net premiums written increased by 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in personal auto and accident and health. New business shifting to the combined ratio. As I noted earlier, the second quarter General Insurance accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 87.6%, a 170 basis points improvement year-over-year driven by 140 basis points improvement in the expense ratio.\nIn Global Commercial the Q2 accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 83.5%, a 180 basis point improvement. The North America Commercial accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 84.7%, a 250 basis point improvement, and the International Commercial accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 82.1% or a 130 basis point improvement.\nglobal personal accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 96.8%, a 130 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. North America Personal improved its accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes to 101.8%, a 530 basis point improvement. International Personal improved its accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes by 50 basis points and 94.8% driven by improvements in the expense ratio.\nNow I want to shift to provide some context around mid year reinsurance renewals and recent conditions in the reinsurance market. As we have previously discussed, we purchased the vast majority of our treaty reinsurance at 1 January. However, approximately 20% of our overall core reinsurance purchasing occurs in the second quarter. We were able to execute on all of our strategic reinsurance goals this quarter, achieving risk adjusted rate decreases and lowering or maintaining retentions across all of our major purchases.\nThe outlook for the second half of 2024, particularly with respect to natural catastrophes, is uncertain. The five leading forecasters are predicting above average hurricane activity for the 2024 season. While there was a lot of positive sentiment across the industry following modest natural CAT loss activity in the first quarter, I've learned over my career to wait until the wind and typhoon seasons are over before declaring how the year will be impacted by natural disasters. It's simply too unpredictable. When reviewing capacity in the market, it's important to analyze the available capacity from the rated market and the alternative capital market. We're all well aware of what happened with rated reinsurers in 2022. On average, they moved attachment points significantly higher to higher return periods and they restricted coverage mostly to named perils.\nIf you were to look at the complementary alternative capital market, it has approximately $110 billion of estimated capital deployed and in many ways more stated available capital in any individual year over the prior 10 years. However, you need to review what makes up that 110 billion to appreciate the true availability for reinsurance. The CAT bond market and ILW market make up approximately 50% of the alternative capital market, the highest nominal amount of any time in history, and those products are accompanied with basis risk and in some cases meaningful basis risk.\nAdditionally, the collateralized market is back to 2016 levels, which is somewhere between 45 to 50 billion of capital. The market is deploying 90% of the collateralized limit as occurrence reinsurance or occurrence retro, leaving less than 10% of the remaining collateralized reinsurance available for aggregate covers.\nWhy do I outline this level of detail? Because we've remained very disciplined and maintained our aggregate cover at the same attachment point, and AIG utilizes approximately 50% of the globally available ILS reinsurance aggregate CAT capacity. This purchase protects us from the potential frequency of CAT and allows us to prudently manage volatility, and again, based on my experience, once insurers give up lower layers or aggregate attachment points, you simply do not get them back. Further, analyzing industry data from over 150 companies published by Aon between 2013 and 2024, average attachment points went up on an inflation-adjusted nominal basis everywhere in the world, in some cases significantly during that period. For example, in Asia average attachment points increased over 270%, in EMEA in the UK over 250%, and in the US over 280%.\nAIG has structured its treaties to have lower attachment points with less volatility when examining occurrence attachment points across the world from 2022 to 2024, which is another very good measurement. AIG has maintained or reduced its attachment points, making it the lowest among our peer group.\nFor the balance of 2024, we have approximately $95 million remaining on our international aggregate cover excluding Japan and $270 million on our North America aggregate cover excluding wind and quake. This is well within our established risk appetite and believe we remain well protected against both the frequency and severity of CAT events. Reinsurance premiums are well embedded in our original pricing and our portfolio for properties performing exceptionally well.\nNow I will provide a high level summary of our capital management strategy and the milestones we've accomplished. We've made enormous progress executing against our capital management goals in a disciplined manner with a focus on positioning AIG for the future and driving value for our shareholders. We have deployed over $30 billion in cash towards that capital management strategy over the last three years, which has provided AIG with maximum flexibility to provide context on the magnitude of what we accomplish. There are some key highlights. In 2021 AIG had greater than 850 million shares outstanding and approximately $25 billion of outstanding debt and preferred stock. Using current liquidity and proceeds generated from divestitures and earnings, over the past three years we repurchased over $13.5 billion of shares, reducing our overall share count by over 200 million shares or approximately 25%.\nAs of 30 June 2024, we have less than 650 million shares outstanding. We expect to further reduce this in H2 2024 and in 2025. Depending on the timing of the closing of the Nippon Life transaction, subject to regulatory approvals, as well as additional future sell downs of our remaining Corebridge shares, subject to market conditions, by the end of 2025, we expect our share count to be in the 550 to 600 million target range, consistent with the guidance that I provided last quarter, representing a total of $10 billion of share repurchases over the course of 2024 and 2025, subject to market conditions.\nSince 2021, we paid approximately $3 billion of shareholder dividends. We increased the dividend by more than 10% in each of the last two consecutive years. Additionally, we reduced AIG's debt outstanding from $25 billion to $9.8 billion and have achieved our target debt to capital leverage ratio range of 15% to 20% with a Q2 leverage of 18% versus 27% three years ago.\nOur insurance company subsidiaries are in a very strong capital position with capital ratios above target ranges, which will enable us to continue to grow profitably without having to contribute additional capital. We ended Q2 with $5.3 billion apparent liquidity, and we continue to explore compelling and strategic inorganic opportunities that are complementary to our current business.\nAs part of positioning AIG for the future, over the past several years we've been on a journey to simplify AIG. We're weaving the company together to operate seamlessly as one cohesive organization across underwriting, claims, and all of our functional areas with the skills and capabilities to compete in the future as a company. We've completed multiple transformation programs. These efforts, including AIG 200, have resulted in a reduction of our expense base of approximately $1.5 billion since 2018 while investing for the future. For example, over the last two years we've invested approximately $300 million in data, digital workflow, AI, and talent to accelerate our progress. If you look over the past five years, it include technology, end-to-end process workflow, and foundational data investments that were part of AIG 200. Our investment has been over $1 billion.\nAlso, at the beginning of 2024, we formally launched AIG Next to further accelerate the realization of additional operational efficiencies. As part of the AIG Next program, we're redefining our existing retained parent costs to reflect only expenses related to being a global regulated public company, such as costs related to corporate governance, enterprise risk management, and audit. Our objective is to decrease retained parent cost to $325 to 350 million or 1% to 1.5% of net premiums earned going forward. Expenses not defined as parent company costs will be fully embedded within the General Insurance results or they'll be redundant.\nAll of the factors being equal, we would expect our full year 2025 calendar year combined ratio to be the same or lower than the full year 2023 metric on a comparable basis as a result of the actions we're taking as part of AIG Next. We originally provided guidance that we would reach the combined ratio as the exit run rate at the end of 2025, and we now believe we can achieve it in the 2025 calendar year. Additionally, while I've not spoken in detail about AI in the past, we've been making substantial progress, and I want to provide a high-level overview.\nAIG is advancing its data and digital strategy using artificial intelligence, large language models, and data ingestion applications with the objective of increasing underwriting efficiency and augmenting execution capabilities.\nWe've spent considerable time over the past 12 to 18 months creating a blueprint for the future that weaves each of these components together, where each one is integral and connected, and we redesign and refine the end-to-end underwriting workflow processes.\nOur primary objective is to construct an AI-powered underwriting portfolio optimization capability that provides faster, more thorough, deeper analysis, and improve customer service in quoting, binding, and policy issuance by enabling increased underwriting productivity through the automation of manual processes.\nThis will drive more accurate, informed decisions by leveraging better data through foundational sources such as broker and agent submissions and supplemented with validated sources of additional third-party data. We will then combine this enhanced capability with advanced modeling and amplified compute capabilities. Underpinning this work is a robust governance framework designed to keep pace with the rapidly evolving global AI regulatory landscape. I will discuss two areas of focus, underwriting efficiency and underwriting management. With underwriting efficiency, we're developing a mechanism using large language models by which submissions are automatically filtered through real-time underwriting guidelines, allowing underwriters more capacity and the ability to assess many more submissions that meet our defined underwriting criteria.\nObjectives risk appetite in underwriting management, we're dynamically managing the review of submission data with the disciplined application of underwriting guidelines and portfolio objectives, along allowing underwriting leadership to more deeply and accurately analyze market conditions and enabling dynamic adjustments to underwriting guidelines, pricing, and limit deployment.\nAs we build our agentic ecosystem, we're using a multi vendor technology strategy with multiple partners that is designed to evolve over time. Our platform has been built for flexibility, configurability, and adaptability to accommodate current and future technology.\nThis includes the ability to support the expansion of generative AI capabilities for scalability globally across our platform while keeping the underwriter at the center of decision making. This is just a glimpse into the significant work we've been doing to use generative AI and large language models as part of our overall data and digital strategy. We'll continue to advance these efforts over the remainder of this year and as we enter 2025. In summary, I'm very pleased with our performance in the second quarter and what we've accomplished not only during the quarter but over the past several years to prepare AIG for a bright future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra.\n\nSabra Purtill\n\nEVP and CFO, AIG\n\nThank you, Peter. This morning I will provide details on AIG's exceptional second quarter financial results with a particular focus on the accounting treatment of Corebridge deconsolidation, general insurance, quarterly financial results, written premium rate trends, other operations, book value per share, and ROE. I will begin with Corebridge related activity this quarter and the accounting treatment on AIG's financials. A few key dates to outline. On 16 May we announced the agreement with Nippon Life because that sale could close within 12 months of the announcement and reduce our ownership to well below 50%. Held for sale accounting and the classification of Corebridge as discontinued operations was triggered for accounting purposes. Next, we sold 30 million shares of Corebridge on 30 May, which brought our ownership to 48%. However, it did not trigger deconsolidation accounting because AIG still had a right to majority representation on the Corebridge board.\nOn 9 June, we raised our right to majority representation and one of our designees resigned from the Corebridge board, triggering deconsolidation accounting as well as the required filing of pro forma financials with the SEC four days later. Discontinued operations and deconsolidation accounting principles drove significant changes in AIG's financials this quarter. We added a few slides in the investor deck to explain these changes, which I will refer to in my remarks. Let me start with the impact of held for sale and discontinued operations on Slide 15. Held for sale accounting stipulates that when you reach an agreement to sell a business, its financials must be recast in the current period, with assets and liabilities each classified in one line for both sides of the balance sheet.\nHowever, since Corebridge was a core business that we fully intend to exit, it also met the accounting criteria for discontinued operations, which requires a recast not just for the current reporting period, but also for past periods. As a result, we reclassed Corebridge's assets, liabilities, and net income into assets and liabilities of discontinued operations and income or loss from discontinued operations net of income tax in the AIG financials for Q2 and prior periods. This treatment is reflected on Slide 15, while AIG total assets of $544 billion as of 31 March 2024 is the same as originally reported, and following discontinued operations presentation, there is a significant movement within the line items.\nFor example, total investments in cash of $324 billion as originally reported decreased to $88 billion with discontinued operations presentation, with $236 billion of Corebridge investments in cash now included in assets of discontinued operations.\nThe next change in the quarter was deconsolidation, which was triggered on 9 June. On the Q4 2023 earnings call, I described the accounting steps related to this process. Today I'll walk through those steps with the final numbers, turning to slide 16. The first step is the fair valuing of Corebridge's assets and liabilities. As of 9 June, the net fair value amount was $9.7 billion, comprised principally of the $8.6 billion market value of our Corebridge shares at that date and the net fair value of intercompany assets in previously consolidated investment entities. Next, we calculate the difference between the fair value of $9.7 billion and the book value on AIG's balance sheet, which was $6.7 billion. This results in a net gain on sale of Corebridge of $3.0 billion pre-tax or $2.5 billion after-tax after that.\nAccounting principles require the recognition of $7.2 billion of accumulated other comprehensive loss on AIG's, which is unrealized losses on Corebridge's investment portfolio due to higher interest rates. This recognition records a $7.2 billion loss from AOCI in AIG retained earnings by booking it through the loss and discontinued operations in the income statement and then reducing AIG's AOCI on the balance sheet. This does not change shareholders' equity shown on slide 17.\nTo determine the income statement accounting impact of deconsolidation, the $2.5 billion after tax gain and the $7.2 billion of accumulated other comprehensive loss are added together to calculate the net after tax loss on deconsolidation of $4.7 billion. Finally, the next step is to add Corebridge's net income for the quarter prior to 9 June, which was $325 million after tax, to the net loss on sale, resulting in a total net loss on discontinued operations of $4.4 billion recorded in AIG's income statement for the quarter.\nNow I'll cover the impact on AIG's shareholders' equity, turning to Slide 17, which has a walk of AIG's total equity from the end of March to the end of June. AIG shareholders' equity was $43.4 billion at 31 March, including Corebridge on a consolidated basis, excluding deconsolidation impacts. The second quarter change in AIG shareholders' equity was a decrease of $1.5 billion, reflecting income from continuing operations of $475 million, offset by $1.7 billion of share repurchases and $261 million of dividends paid. This results in a pro forma AIG shareholders' equity of $41.9 billion before deconsolidation.\nYou layer in the deconsolidation impacts by adding the $2.5 billion after-tax gain on sale, for total AIG shareholders' equity of $44.4 billion at 30 June 2024, for a $1.1 billion net increase in the quarter, resulting in book value per share of $68.40 at 30 June, a 6% increase from 31 March 2024.\nPlease note as well that $5.7 billion of non-controlling interest in total equity, which represents the portion of Corebridge equity owned by other shareholders, is also eliminated with deconsolidation through the recognition in the net book value calculation of the gain on sale. The last deconsolidation impact is on debt and leverage on slide 18. Total debt for AIG and Corebridge at 31 March 2024 was $19.2 billion, and total equity was $49.1 billion for debt to total capital ratio of 28.1%.\nWith deep consolidation, Corebridge's debt of $9.4 billion and non-controlling interest of $5.7 billion are eliminated on AIG's balance sheet. This results in 30 June 2024 balances of $9.8 billion for total debt and $54.3 billion for total capital for a debt to total capital ratio of 18.1%, well within our 15 to 20% target leverage range. We hope this explanation and the slides are helpful in understanding the accounting treatment of Corebridge deconsolidation this quarter. I will now cover Q2 general insurance and other operations results.\nTurning to General Insurance, adjusted pre-tax income or APTI was $1.2 billion, up 7% on a comparable basis due to strong underwriting results and higher net investment income. General Insurance net investment income was $746 million, up 10% on a comparable basis due to higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturities and loans. Considering current interest rates and $1.6 billion of general insurance dividends paid to parent at quarter end, we expect Q3 general insurance investment income from fixed maturities, loans, and short-term investments of about $700 million. Income on alternatives and other investment assets were $33 million and $52 million respectively in the quarter, up $32 million in total from $44 million and $9 million respectively in Q2 2023.\nQ2 2024 underwriting income on a comparable basis was $430 million versus $420 million in Q2 last year driven by lower expenses partially offset by higher catastrophe losses. Year to date underwriting results have been strong with an accident year loss ratio x catastrophes of 56.3% mainly driven by changes in business mix compared to the prior year based on earned premium roll forward, and barring unforeseen significant changes in loss trends, we expect the accident year loss ratio x catastrophes will remain strong in H2 2024 at approximately the same level as H1 2024. Turning to natural catastrophes, the industry globally had another quarter of elevated losses with approximately 100 events.\nFor AIG, Q2 catastrophe losses totaled $325 million or 5.7 points on the loss ratio, principally from secondary perils including severe convective storms in the United States, floods in the Middle East and Brazil, and hail in Japan. With a roughly 50-50 split between North America and international, our largest loss in the quarter totaled $90 million from exceptionally heavy rains in the UAE. Considering the forecast for hurricane season this year and secondary peril losses year to date, we believe that using AIG's last year's total catastrophe losses is a good proxy for full year 2024. While actual losses will depend on the size and strength of events, our underwriting standards, limits, and reinsurance programs, both occurrence and aggregate, will help reduce the net impact of catastrophe frequency and severity on AIG's balance sheet.\nNevertheless, on a global basis, Q3 is usually by far the highest catastrophe quarter with losses averaging 40% to 50% of the total for the year. Turning to reserves, prior year development net of reinsurance was a favorable $79 million, reflecting the net result from DVRs completed on more than $20 billion of reserves, about 45% of the total in the quarter. Overall, the DVRs which included US casualty resulted in net favorable development on workers compensation and modest net unfavorable development of $30 million on excess casualty, including $66 million for accident year 2021. The 2021 excess casualty reserve charges were for a few large known losses and commercial auto loss trends reflecting the rebound in auto frequency and severity after the pandemic lockdown in 2020 when frequency was very low.\nWe have not seen this increase in frequency and severity trends in the more recent accident years within the casualty and excess casualty books. Overall severity trends remain generally consistent with our assumptions. While we see some favorable trends in the 2016 to 2019 accident years, we will continue to allow time for these years to mature.\nPricing, which includes rate and exposure for Global Commercial lines this quarter, increased 5% excluding workers' compensation and financial lines, while our view on loss cost trends have remained stable. In North America, commercial renewal rates increased 2% in Q2, or 4% if you exclude workers' compensation and financial lines, and the exposure increase was 2%. In international commercial, overall rate was largely flat, or a 1% increase excluding financial lines, and the exposure increase was 3% excluding financial lines. We continue to monitor our portfolio very closely, and while rate in Q2 is below trends on certain lines of business such as property, it is above trend in others.\nTo give more insight on property, North America retail and wholesale property saw rate increases drop below trend in Q2, but that's on the back of rate increases in excess of 25% in 2023 and cumulatively in excess of 150% since 2018. International property is about 100% higher in 2023. Our property portfolio had an excellent combined ratio in North America casualty lines, in particular excess casualty. We continue to get rate in excess of loss trend. We continue to focus on writing business that has attractive returns, and while the price adequacy of our portfolio of course varies by line, it remains strong overall and within our expectations.\nTurning to other operations, deconsolidation vastly simplified the income statement. Adjusted pre-tax loss in the quarter was $158 million, a 43% improvement year-over-year, primarily attributable to $68 million in Corebridge dividends and higher short-term investment income. Finally, with deconsolidation we expect our 2024 adjusted tax rate to be about 24% before discrete items in line with our second quarter.\nWith the deconsolidation of Corebridge this quarter, AIG's income statement and balance sheet are simpler, and we no longer have the volatility of life insurance and annuity accounting. With all the changes, we took the opportunity to evaluate our non-GAAP equity metrics, which were established more than a decade ago when AIG was a vastly more complicated conglomerate. The principal change was revising our calculation of adjusted book value to only adjust for investment-related accumulated other comprehensive income, which is not within management's control and which will revert to par as bonds approach maturity. Adjusted book value per share was $72.78 per share at 30 June 2024. In addition, we added a core operating shareholders' equity metric, which reflects the equity invested in AIG's go-forward business.\nIt is calculated by subtracting from adjusted book value the market value of Corebridge stock, and GAAP deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and tax credits. Both of these assets have significant value to our shareholders but contribute little to AATI. We believe this metric is more useful for valuing AIG's global general insurance business and also for measuring our progress towards a 10%+ ROE target over time. As we reduce our ownership in Corebridge to 0 and monetize the DTA through earnings, core operating book value will become the same as adjusted book value. Core operating book value per share was $53.35 per share at 30 June 2024. To wrap up, AIG delivered another excellent quarter with significant financial and operational accomplishments in 2024.\nAchieving the deconsolidation of Corebridge was a major accomplishment this quarter, and we had continued strong profitability and growth in our general insurance business. With our portfolio reshaping now largely behind us, we are intently focused on achieving our 10%+ ROE target driven by strong underwriting and top line growth, expense reduction, and capital management. We continue to make progress on this goal with a core operating ROE of 8.9% for Q2 and 9.3% year to date. With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nGreat. Thank you. Sabra Operator, we're ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star 11. If your question has been answered and you'd like to remove yourself from the queue, please press star 11. Again, our first question comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Zaremski\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHey, great. Good morning.\nFirst question on the updated kind of combined ratio trajectory or guidance for 2025, so loud and clear that you'll be able to kind of hit it a bit sooner. I'm curious if you can kind of if we focus on the loss ratio, what the guidance implies on a like for like basis on the loss ratio. Some of the.\nQuestions we get continuously around. Most companies are seeing some slippage in their loss ratios given lower levels of reserve releases.\nCurious if that's something that's considered within your loss ratio guidance?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThanks, Mike, for the question. The guidance that we've given in terms of what we expect for the full year 2025 does not contemplate any improvement in loss ratio. It's all in the expense ratio. And so we're trying to guide everybody is that all the expenses that exist in other operations will transition into parent, they'll go into the business or they'll be eliminated. And that we're not going to be increasing our combined ratios based on the guidance that we gave at the end of 2023. So we're not anticipating.\nAny caveats on loss ratios to be able to meet that guidance?\nI guess just I'll stick on this for my follow up. So, you know, given pricing, you know, is below loss trend in certain lines like property, and understanding that the absolute.\nMaybe this is the answer, the absolute.\nPricing levels are still accretive to.\nROE or loss ratio, just you know, does it to the extent the current pricing environment held.\nYou know, why does it kind of make sense that the loss ratio should be able to kind of stay flattish and you know, not trying to be negative, just trying to nitpick on the margin?\nNo, it's a great question. Let's take North America for example because you pointed out property, you know, this quarter in terms of the overall index and rate increases. You know, property was the headwind in that index. In casualty we achieved mid single digit to high single digit rate with like 12% in excess casualty plus 2% in exposure. In Lexington it was 11% increase in casualty, 12% in healthcare. So again above loss cost cost trends, property was flat this quarter. But you have to look at what's happened with the property market over the past several years.\nIf you look at even last year in excess and surplus lines, it was a 34% increase.\nIn the retail, it was 30%. That's after four years of double-digit rate increase. So I think look at with the low activity in CAT maybe in the first quarter.\nThe cumulative rate increases over time, and the property combined ratio fully loaded with CAT, even with giving a little bit back in the second quarter, has an outstanding combined ratio. And if I could get that combined ratio for the rest of my career, I'll take it. I mean like I don't think there's any deterioration in terms of what our overall index will be. And again I can't really predict. That's why I kind of went into a little bit more detail about like sort of the CAT market is that we don't know. So property is highly driven by what happens in CAT and underlying inflation, and so, you know, I'm not going to predict what happens, you know, sort of six quarters from now, but I think we feel really comfortable the portfolio and its profitability.\n\nMichael Zaremski\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.\n\nMeyer Shields\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KBW\n\nPardon me. Thank you. First question. I was hoping we can get a general sense of the impact of the sale of the travel insurance on underwriting results in North America Personal.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nHey, Meyer. Good morning. In terms of. I outlined in my prepared remarks the premium impact, which is the $750 million on net premiums written. But on the overall combined ratio, it's gonna be de minimis in terms of what we would lose within general insurance once we pro forma it out.\n\nMeyer Shields\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KBW\n\nOkay, perfect. Second question, I guess on the excess casualty, if I understood Sabra's comments correctly, you had favorable development even on that line outside of 2021, which was a weird year.\nI was hoping you could sort of.\nBreak that down for us. I assume that that's older years rather than recent years, but I wanted to confirm that.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nYeah, I'll hand it over to Sabra, but as you know, and she gave a lot of detail in her prepared remarks, and we reviewed 45% of our total book in Q2 and in casualty, just based on what's going on in the global market, we really drilled down on every line of business and every year and went through it in tremendous detail. So Sabra, maybe you could just give a few highlights in terms of that analysis.\n\nSabra Purtill\n\nEVP and CFO, AIG\n\nYeah, sure. And just for everyone's benefit, I'll just start by framing a little bit what we did in the quarter for the DVRs. So this quarter we evaluated $20.2 billion of reserves for US casualty. That's comprised of 23 separate DVRs and more than 200 different lines of business. And then that aggregates to the five lines that you see on the 10Q. So the net changes in the quarter were only about $20 million after return premiums, and that was $80 million favorable in workers comp. After the ADC, which has about $8 billion of reserves, it was $22 million unfavorable in excess casualty, which also has about $5 billion of reserves. And then in casualty, it's also about $5 billion reserves for $17 million favorable in terms of the 2021 accident year.\nAs we've noted on previous calls, we've increased our loss cost trends for 2020 and subsequent years. The adjustments we made in 2021 are from just a combination of known early reported claims that, due to their facts and circumstances, we expect to penetrate the excess attachment level, including a rebound in the auto frequency and severity in 2022 and 2023 accident years.\nWe just have not had that same level of early claims experience and therefore we still have a high level of IBNR in the reserves. You know, with respect to the accident years.\nWith respect to the accident years within excess casualty, I would note that while we did have the $66 million of adverse development in accident year 2021, we had $33 million of favorable development in excess casualty from accident years prior to 2016. And that's where the delta comes and nets down to closer to the $22 million amount.\n\nMeyer Shields\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KBW\n\nGot it. That's exactly what I needed.\nThank you.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThank you, Meyer. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nElyse Greenspan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate all the color you guys are providing on the call. My first question, Peter, you said that the full year 2025 calendar year combined ratio would be the same or lower than the full year 2023. Since you said comparable basis, I'm assuming you mean Crop and Validus. Can you guys just disclose what that figure is just so we know? You know what? What you're setting the 2025 baseline at what was the 2023 adjusted figure?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\n91.6%.\n\nElyse Greenspan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay, thank you. And then my second question is, you also mentioned in your prepared remarks, you said something about exploring inorganic opportunities. Can you just expand on what that means? You guys have obviously taken action of divesting of certain businesses. So what would you look at on the expansion side and what criteria would any potential inorganic deals need to meet?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThanks, Elyse. I included that in my prepared remarks, just based on the amount of financial flexibility, strategic flexibility that we've created for ourselves.\nThe divestitures have been really about. The businesses that we divest were terrific and they fit very well with their new owners. But some of them needed scale like travel and crop, and we want it to be a little bit less in the volatility business and therefore Validus Re was divested. I would think as we look to the future, again, we're going to be very selective, very disciplined. But there are opportunities perhaps where we have existing businesses, where we feel as though we have competitive advantages, that having more scale would be helpful. There could be complementary geographies as we look to different parts internationally, but terrific international business. But there could be places where we want to expand further that give us not only better capabilities within that geography, but also could be very good for our multinational network.\nThere are opportunities to invest further in businesses that we have. Think about AIG. Tata in India is a fast growing large scale business that is an industry leader. There are opportunities there as well. So we will use the same criteria, which is to make sure it's disciplined, it's additive, it's strategic, and it actually furthers and accelerates the progress we can make on an organic basis. And so we will again keep giving updates as there's more relevant information to share.\n\nElyse Greenspan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThanks, Elyse.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nRob Cox\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, thanks. Just a question on the accident year loss ratio ex CAT guidance for approximately the same level in the back half. Can you help us think a little bit more about what goes into that and where that shakes out on a comparable basis versus the, I think, over 100 basis points of improvement AIG has reported here in the first half?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nSure. Thank you, Rob. It's really driven by mix of business. If you take a look at this year compared to last year on a net premium earned basis, the commercial and personal insurance businesses are literally identical in terms of its overall contribution to total premium. And then the commercial loss ratio largely stayed flat, like a 10 basis points improvement, but largely flat. What happened was the personal insurance loss ratio dramatically improved, driven by North America, which was well over 400 basis points.\nI think that that's really driving the first six months. If we look at the back half, I mean, should we see the same thing? I think so. But you've seen all the tremendous new business, the momentum we have. The mix of business could be changed a little bit year-over-year when we look at the back half of the year. But that's really what's driving the improved loss ratio in the first six months. So it's really a true mix of business and also the significant improvement that North America Personal is making, and we expect them to continue to make.\n\nRob Cox\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, got it. Thank you. And maybe as just a follow up.\nThe move to kind of put some more capital to work in high net worth, is that driven by a change in sort of the view and underwriting opportunities there or have they always been good for AIG and what kind of drove that decision to double down? Now?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG",
    "content2": "The high net worth business had the same issues that the commercial business did, which it had too much TIV. It gets more pronounced in the high net worth business because it's more dense. So we needed to shed aggregate for a lot of reasons. One is that we had too much exposure in certain geographies like the world changed with COVID, the pandemic, and all the macro factors that affected it and then also the evolution of.\nMore capabilities in the non-admitted market. And so what we decided, and we've been thinking about this for a couple of years, is that build out an admitted platform that is going to be very strong, the right infrastructure and have the ability to grow but also complement that with the non-admitted market and be able to do that where you have flexibility, informed rate and limits, and how you can actually respond to client needs. And there's a need. And so what we've been working on is what's the best way to do that partnering with Ryan Specialty. It's a highly fragmented wholesale market, so nobody has a real strong expertise in high net worth unless you start to build it.\nI think Ryan has been doing that, and so getting access to the 40,000 independent agents with a product that's going to be saleable, and we have done such a terrific job in terms of creating opportunity for more aggregate that we want to be able to have both options. We believe that we'll be able to grow the non-admitted property market just based on the partnership that we just announced recently. It's always been in the plan, but we didn't want to go out and just say we're going to do non-admitted and have it a fragmented, not strategic approach. We believe this is going to give us great opportunities to access the market in a different way.\n\nRob Cox\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Mike Ward with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Ward\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nThank you. Good morning. I just had one question, and it was somewhat related, but overall for the business and including commercial lines. Curious how you guys are shifting the culture back to sort of a growth mindset, thinking about all the change that you've executed and should, you know, I guess where are we in that part of the story, and should we think about the AIG as potentially being able to grow faster than the market all equal just by turning some of those spigots back on?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nYeah, it's a terrific question, and I happen to have Don Bailey and Jon Hancock here with me. So I'm going to ask them both to comment on North America and international. It's a great question. Don, why don't you start with how we have actually been very focused on not only retention but new business in North America.\n\nDon Bailey\n\nEVP and CEO, North America Commercial Insurance\n\nYeah, thanks Peter. We have definitely pivoted to that growth mindset. It's first important to mention that we were doing this off of transforming the business over the last few years. So we come into the growth with a position of strength regarding underwriting, discipline, and profitability. You've heard about all that. Regarding the growth, we've been very deliberate in creating more value for our distribution partners and clients than ever before. And we're applying much more rigor in pursuing like targeted risks.\nAll of that is what you start to see showing up in the numbers now.\nI can give you a little.\nbit more color, the retention that we're delivering, high levels of retention across all of our business. I would also add that we're executing on specific market opportunities, notably retail sasualty and Lexington. On the retail casualty side, we are on offense. The discipline in the excess market is a positive for us right now, and we're moving on that. Regarding Lex, the growth there comes from three places. We have strong, continued, strong retention there, new products, and new customers. So it's not from bigger limits. I would describe it as healthy horizontal growth. Regarding the sustainability of it, which I think is important. I can look at some of our Lex submission data and share that with you. Year to date, submissions at Lex are up 42%, and that's on top of 39% growth through last year through six months.\nWe view this as a clear flight to quality in that space. I should also add that we resourced all of that in advance, so we're well positioned to take advantage of what's coming. And Peter, I'd just say this in closing on my end. We're getting all that growth while achieving outstanding loss ratios in the core business.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nDon, thank you. That was great. Jon, maybe a little bit of context on International.\n\nJon Hancock\n\nEVP and CEO, International Commercial Insurance and Global Personal Insurance\n\nYeah, I mean, I won't repeat what you've already said, Peter, or Don, but I would say this is still a very good market for us to underwrite in. We've got a really large, diverse portfolio across International. Gives us access to a huge amount of opportunity. Different segments, different geographies at different points in time, so we can reshape and shift the book depending on what we see in each market. Similar themes to Don.\nThis has been very planful. This is not opportunistic growth here. We've been building to this for a long time off a very, very high quality book of business. We start with retaining 89% of what we work really hard to build. A really strong book. New business submissions are up as well. We're retaining that. Our own flight to quality as well as the market. I agree with Don. The market's flight to quality. A couple of highlights for me: we've got a world-class global specialty business. It's grown 8% in the year, and that's driven by some very, very good new business in all of the global specialty segments, especially in marine and energy where we are recognized world leaders in both. We've grown new business in marine 15% over Q1 last year, especially strong in cargo in the UK and across Europe. Peter, you already referenced energy.\n13% increase in new business year-over-year, and that's in all of our global hubs and all of our products actually. So really, really strong targeted growth with one of our best performing profitability businesses. I'll just finish on. I'll add in Talbot as well. Talbot at Lloyd's, another very, very good quarter of growth at Lloyd's, 12%. And again that's driven by targeted growth in specialty lines of marine liability that we grew at 13%, cargo and specie at 16%, and upstream energy at 19%, and both of those with the market we've got the pipeline that we've got. We expect to see continued good growth.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThat's great, Jon. Thanks to you and Don for that detail. Really helpful. I want to thank everybody for joining us today.\nI do want to thank our colleagues around the world for their continued dedication, commitment, teamwork, and all of their execution. I also want to extend my deep gratitude to Tom Bolt who's retiring at the end of the year for his many significant contributions to AIG during a very important time and congratulate him on his storied career. Tom was instrumental in establishing a global framework for AIG's underwriting standards, governance, and structures in alignment with our refined risk appetite and has just been a terrific executive at AIG. So, again, thank you for joining us today, everybody. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.\nGood day and welcome to AIG's Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. This conference is being recorded now. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\n\nQuentin McMillan\n\nVP, Managing Director and Head of Investor Relations, AIG\n\nThanks very much and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change. Today's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement, and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com. Additionally, note that following the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial on 9 June 2024, the historical results of Corebridge for all periods presented are reflected in AIG's condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations in accordance with US GAAP. Finally, today's remarks related to General Insurance results including key metrics such as net premiums written, underwriting income, and underwriting margin are presented on a comparable basis which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis as applicable, and adjusted for the sale of Crop Risk Services and the sale of Validus Re.\nWe believe this presentation provides the most useful view of General Insurance results and the go-forward business in light of the substantial changes to the portfolio since 2020. Please refer to pages 29 through 31 of the earnings presentation for reconciliations of such metrics reported on a comparable basis. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our Q2 2024 financial results. We have transformed AIG and have done the foundational work for the next chapter, and I'm excited to take you through it today. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on Q2. Then our North America and international leaders, Don Bailey, and Jon Hancock will join us for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOur prepared remarks have a lot of detail, particularly related to our deconsolidation of Corebridge. We intend to provide ample time for Q and A. I want to start with highlights of our outstanding second quarter performance. As Quentin mentioned at the beginning of the call, all figures I will reference today will be on a comparable basis excluding the impact of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services unless otherwise noted. In order to provide a clear view of our underlying performance.\nAdjusted after-tax income was $775 million or $1.16 per diluted share, representing a 38% increase in earnings per share year-over-year driven by strong organic growth, a continuation of our very strong underwriting performance, ongoing expense discipline, volatility containment, and a decrease in shares outstanding. General Insurance net premiums written grew 7% led by Global Commercial, which grew over 8%. Underwriting income was $430 million. The underlying underwriting income, excluding catastrophes and prior year development, improved $110 million or 17% year-over-year. The calendar year combined ratio is 92.5%, a slight increase of 10 basis points from the prior year. The accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 87.6%, a 170 basis point improvement from the prior year. The CAT loss ratio was 5.7% or $325 million of total catastrophe related losses.\nConsolidated net investment income on an adjusted pre-tax income basis was $884 million, a 14% increase year-over-year.\nDuring the quarter we returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through $1.7 billion of stock repurchases and $261 million of dividends. We ended the second quarter with a total debt to total capital ratio of 18% including AOCI, and we have strong parent liquidity of $5.3 billion. Overall, I'm very pleased with our ability to continue to deliver outstanding financial performance and I'm equally pleased with the progress we're making on multiple strategic initiatives.\nThere's several things I want to cover on this call to give you a sense of where we are now, how we got here, and what the future holds. In addition to walking through our financial results on today's call, I plan to outline the recently announced transactions for our personal travel business and Private Client Select, provide a quick update on Q1 reinsurance renewals and a market update, discuss our disciplined execution of our capital management strategy, and provide an update on AIG Next. Next, I should note that our strong financial results in the quarter were complicated by the complex accounting treatment of deconsolidation. In Sabra's prepared remarks, she will explain the impact to our capital structure, including shareholders' equity, as well as details on the GAAP accounting implications to our financial statements.\nBefore I go further, I want to take a moment to comment on the deconsolidation of Corebridge, which marked a major milestone for both AIG and Corebridge. It's important to reflect on the four-year journey, the significant accomplishments along the way, and the rationale behind this pivotal decision for AIG. At the height of the pandemic in 2020, we undertook a detailed analysis to explore strategic options to maximize value for AIG shareholders, including evaluating whether to separate our life and retirement business, which would eventually become Corebridge from AIG. In October 2020, we announced our intention to separate. There were many noteworthy accomplishments along the way, and I'd like to highlight a few. In July 2021, AIG announced that Blackstone Group would become an anchor investor in the new standalone company with its acquisition of 9.9% of Corebridge.\nCorebridge also entered into a long-term strategic asset management relationship with Blackstone to manage up to $92.5 billion of assets under management over the subsequent six years. At the end of March 2022, AIG announced a strategic partnership with BlackRock where they would manage $150 billion of certain fixed-income and privately placed assets, of which $90 billion would come from the Corebridge portfolio. In mid-September 2022, AIG floated 12.4% of Corebridge and the largest US IPO of the year, a particularly noteworthy achievement during a time of significant market volatility. During 2023 we executed three marketed deals reducing our overall ownership to 52% by year-end. In 2023, Corebridge divested with considerable strategic and transactional support from AIG, Laya Healthcare, and UK Life. These sales generated over $1.2 billion of proceeds for Corebridge investors.\nIn May of 2024, AIG announced that it would sell 122 million shares of Corebridge, representing an approximately 20% stake in the company to Nippon Life Insurance Company, one of the most respected life insurance companies in the world, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Lastly, in mid-June of this year, AIG announced it had met the requirements for the deconsolidation of Corebridge for accounting purposes. We remain committed to fully selling down a remaining ownership stake in Corebridge over time, subject to market conditions and other considerations. It's been quite a journey and we have accomplished a tremendous amount. Now let's turn to the travel business. During the quarter we also announced the sale of our global individual personal travel insurance and assistance business, which is another important strategic step in positioning AIG for the future.\nTo further simplify our portfolio, the transaction includes the global Travel Guard insurance business as well as its service companies and infrastructure, and excludes our travel insurance businesses in Japan, and our AIG joint venture arrangement in India with the Tata Group. AIG will continue to provide corporate group travel coverage through our accident and health business. The annual net premiums written for Travel are approximately $750 million, most of which are reported under North America Personal Insurance. The sale is expected to close by the end of 2024 subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Last week we announced another significant transaction involving our high-net-worth business.\nAs we've discussed in prior quarters, over the course of several years we've been deliberately transforming our high net worth business to be better positioned for the future. We've done this through a series of strategic actions including the most recent announcement about entering into a strategic relationship with Ryan Specialty to become our excess and surplus lines distribution partner for high and ultra high net worth markets through our managing general underwriter Private Client Select Insurance Services. We like the business and we're committed to it. We've invested over $100 million in infrastructure and digital capabilities for our high net worth business over the past several years and we believe the business is well positioned for the future. We're also committed to delivering solutions and growing our admitted capabilities.\nAs we previously communicated, our plan for the portfolio has been to establish an MGU with appropriate infrastructure and core foundational capabilities, enable multiple points of distribution, and eventually attract more capital resources for the MGU, all while continuing to drive exceptional value for our high net worth clients. As we grow the business.\nAIG will provide exclusive E&S paper in all 50 states through Marble Shore Specialty Insurance Company, subject to regulatory approvals. This progress reflects the momentum we've created with expanded capabilities and broader partnerships. Now turning to general insurance results. Gross premiums written for the quarter were $9.9 billion, an increase of 7% from the prior year. Net premiums written for the quarter were $6.9 billion, a 7% increase from the prior year with 8% growth from Global Commercial and 5% growth from Global Personal.\nGlobal Commercial had an excellent quarter with strong net premiums written growth of 8% driven by significant new business, impressive retention, and continued accident year combined ratio improvement in North America Commercial. Net premiums written grew 10%. Lexington grew 16% led by wholesale casualty, which grew 35%, Western World, which grew 20%, and wholesale property, which grew 12%. Retail casualty grew 11% with 21% growth in our risk management business, and we had 16% growth in excess casualty, and captive solutions grew 30% driven by new business.\nIn International Commercial, net premiums written grew 6%. Global Specialty grew 8%, led by 18% growth in energy. Talbot grew 12%, and retail property grew 11%.\nIn Q2, Global Commercial produced record new business of nearly $1.3 billion, which is an 18% increase from the prior-year Q2. North America Commercial produced new business of $753 million in the quarter, an increase of 26% year-over-year and an increase of over 60% from the prior quarter. The growth was led by Lexington, which had 31% new business growth year-over-year and 75% new business growth from Q1, the highest new business volume of any quarter in my tenure. Lexington also achieved a significant milestone with over $1 billion of gross premiums written this quarter, a 16% increase from the prior-year Q2.\nThis is the highest gross premiums written quarter for Lexington since we repositioned the business in 2018. In other businesses, retail casualty new business grew over 40% led by our risk management business and excess casualty.\nInternational Commercial produced new business of $522 million for the quarter, an increase of 9% year-over-year. This growth was led by Global Specialty, which had 17% new business growth, led by energy and marine. Casualty, which had over 30% growth, and property, which had over 10% growth. In addition, Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention; International retention was 89%, and North America retention was 87%. Moving on to Global Personal Insurance, net premiums written grew 5% year-over-year. North America personal net premiums written increased 8% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by the high net worth business.\nInternational Personal net premiums written increased by 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in personal auto and accident and health new business. Shifting to the combined ratio. As I noted earlier, the Q2 general insurance accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 87.6%, a 170 basis points improvement year-over-year driven by 140 basis points improvement in the expense ratio.\nIn Global Commercial, the Q2 accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 83.5%, a 180 basis point improvement. The North America Commercial accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 84.7%, a 250 basis point improvement, and the International Commercial accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 82.1%, or a 130 basis point improvement.\nglobal personal accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 96.8%, a 130 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. North America Personal improved its accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes to 101.8%, a 530 basis point improvement. International Personal improved its accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes by 50 basis points and 94.8% driven by improvements in the expense ratio.\nNow I want to shift to provide some context around mid-year reinsurance renewals and recent conditions in the reinsurance market. As we have previously discussed, we purchased the vast majority of our treaty reinsurance at 1 January. However, approximately 20% of our overall core reinsurance purchasing occurs in the second quarter. We were able to execute on all of our strategic reinsurance goals this quarter, achieving risk-adjusted rate decreases and lowering or maintaining retentions across all of our major purchases.\nThe outlook for the second half of 2024, particularly with respect to natural catastrophes, is uncertain. The five leading forecasters are predicting above average hurricane activity for the 2024 season. While there was a lot of positive sentiment across the industry following modest natural CAT loss activity in the first quarter, I've learned over my career to wait until the wind and typhoon seasons are over before declaring how the year will be impacted by natural disasters. It's simply too unpredictable.\nWhen reviewing capacity in the market, it's important to analyze the available capacity from the rated market and the alternative capital market. We're all well aware of what happened with rated reinsurers in 2022. On average, they moved attachment points significantly higher to higher return periods, and they restricted coverage mostly to named perils. If you were to look at the complementary alternative capital market, it has approximately $110 billion of estimated capital deployed and, in many ways, more stated available capital in any individual year over the prior 10 years. However, you need to review what makes up that 110 billion to appreciate the true availability for reinsurance. The CAT bond market and ILW market make up approximately 50% of the alternative capital market, the highest nominal amount of any time in history, and those products are accompanied with basis risk and, in some cases, meaningful basis risk.\nAdditionally, the collateralized market is back to 2016 levels, which is somewhere between $45 to 50 billion of capital. The market is deploying 90% of the collateralized limit as occurrence reinsurance or occurrence retro, leaving less than 10% of the remaining collateralized reinsurance available for aggregate covers.\nWhy do I outline this level of detail? Because we've remained very disciplined and maintained our aggregate cover at the same attachment point. AIG utilizes approximately 50% of the globally available ILS reinsurance aggregate CAT capacity. This purchase protects us from the potential frequency of CAT and allows us to prudently manage volatility. Again, based on my experience, once insurers give up lower layers or aggregate attachment points, you simply do not get them back. Further analyzing industry data from over 150 companies published by Aon between 2013 and 2024, average attachment points went up on an inflation-adjusted nominal basis everywhere in the world, in some cases significantly during that period. For example, in Asia average attachment points increased over 270%, in EMEA in the UK over 250%, and in the US over 280%.\nAIG has structured its treaties to have lower attachment points with less volatility when examining occurrence attachment points across the world from 2022 to 2024, which is another very good measurement. AIG has maintained or reduced its attachment points, making it the lowest among our peer group.\nFor the balance of 2024, we have approximately $95 million remaining on our international aggregate cover, excluding Japan, and $270 million on our North America aggregate cover, excluding wind and quake. This is well within our established risk appetite, and believe we remain well protected against both the frequency and severity of CAT events. Reinsurance premiums are well embedded in our original pricing. Our portfolio for properties performing exceptionally well.\nNow I will provide a high level summary of our capital management strategy and the milestones we've accomplished. We've made enormous progress executing against our capital management goals in a disciplined manner with a focus on positioning AIG for the future and driving value for our shareholders. We have deployed over $30 billion in cash towards that capital management strategy over the last three years, which has provided AIG with maximum flexibility to provide context on the magnitude of what we accomplished. There are some key highlights. In 2021, AIG had greater than 850 million shares outstanding and approximately $25 billion of outstanding debt and preferred stock. Using current liquidity and proceeds generated from divestitures and earnings over the past three years, we repurchased over $13.5 billion of shares, reducing our overall share count by over 200 million shares or approximately 25%.\nAs of 30 June 2024, we have less than 650 million shares outstanding. We expect to further reduce this in the second half of 2024 and in 2025 depending on the timing of the closing of the Nippon Life transaction, subject to regulatory approvals as well as additional future sell downs of our remaining Corebridge shares subject to market conditions. By the end of 2025, we expect our share count to be in the 550 to 600 million target range, consistent with the guidance that I provided last quarter, representing a total of $10 billion of share repurchases over the course of 2024 and 2025 subject to market conditions.\nSince 2021, we paid approximately $3 billion of shareholder dividends. We increased the dividend by more than 10% in each of the last two consecutive years. Additionally, we reduced AIG's debt outstanding from $25 billion to $9.8 billion and have achieved our target debt to capital leverage ratio range of 15 to 20% with a Q2 leverage of 18% versus 27% three years ago.\nOur insurance company subsidiaries are in a very strong capital position with capital ratios above target ranges, which will enable us to continue to grow profitably without having to contribute additional capital. We ended Q2 with $5.3 billion apparent liquidity, and we continue to explore compelling and strategic inorganic opportunities that are complementary to our current business.\nAs part of positioning AIG for the future, over the past several years, we've been on a journey to simplify AIG. We're weaving the company together to operate seamlessly as one cohesive organization across underwriting, claims, and all of our functional areas with the skills and capabilities to compete in the future. As a company, we've completed multiple transformation programs. These efforts, including AIG 200, have resulted in a reduction of our expense base of approximately $1.5 billion since 2018 while investing for the future. For example, over the last two years we've invested approximately $300 million in data, digital workflow, AI, and talent to accelerate our progress. If you look over the past five years that include technology, end-to-end process workflow, and foundational data investments that were part of AIG 200, our investment has been over a billion dollars.\nAlso, at the beginning of 2024, we formally launched AIG Next to further accelerate the realization of additional operational efficiencies. As part of the AIG Next program, we're redefining our existing retained parent costs to reflect only expenses related to being a global regulated public company, such as costs related to corporate governance, enterprise risk management, and audit. Our objective is to decrease retained parent cost to $325 to 350 million, or 1 to 1.5% of net premiums earned going forward. Expenses not defined as parent company costs will be fully embedded within the general insurance results or they'll be redundant.\nAll of the factors being equal, we would expect our full-year 2025 calendar year combined ratio to be the same or lower than the full-year 2023 metric on a comparable basis. As a result of the actions we're taking as part of AIG Next, we would expect that. We originally provided guidance that we would reach the combined ratio as the exit run rate at the end of 2025, and we now believe we can achieve it in the 2025 calendar year. Additionally, while I've not spoken in detail about AI in the past, we've been making substantial progress, and I want to provide a high-level overview.\nAIG is advancing its data and digital strategy using artificial intelligence, large language models, and data ingestion applications with the objective of increasing underwriting efficiency and augmenting execution capabilities.\nWe've spent considerable time over the past 12 to 18 months creating a blueprint for the future that weaves each of these components together, where each one is integral and connected, and we redesign and refine the end-to-end underwriting workflow processes.\nOur primary objective is to construct an AI-powered underwriting portfolio optimization capability that provides faster, more thorough, deeper analysis, and improve customer service in quoting, binding, and policy issuance by enabling increased underwriting productivity through the automation of manual processes.\nThis will drive more accurate, informed decisions by leveraging better data through foundational sources such as broker and agent submissions and supplemented with validated sources of additional third party data. We will then combine this enhanced capability with advanced modeling and amplified compute capabilities. Underpinning this work is a robust governance framework designed to keep pace with the rapidly evolving global AI regulatory landscape. I will discuss two areas of focus: underwriting efficiency and underwriting management. With underwriting efficiency, we're developing a mechanism using large language models by which submissions are automatically filtered through real-time underwriting guidelines, allowing underwriters more capacity and the ability to assess many more submissions that meet our defined underwriting criteria, objectives, and risk appetite.\nIn underwriting management, we're dynamically managing the review of submission data with a disciplined application of underwriting guidelines and portfolio objectives, allowing underwriting leadership to more deeply and accurately analyze market conditions and enabling dynamic adjustments to underwriting guidelines, pricing, and limit deployment.\nAs we build our agentic ecosystem, we're using a multi-vendor technology strategy with multiple partners that is designed to evolve over time. Our platform has been built for flexibility, configurability, and adaptability to accommodate current and future technology.\nThis includes the ability to support the expansion of generative AI capabilities for scalability globally across our platform while keeping the underwriter at the center of decision making. This is just a glimpse into the significant work we've been doing to use generative AI and large language models as part of our overall data and digital strategy. We'll continue to advance these efforts over the remainder of this year and as we enter 2025. In summary, I'm very pleased with our performance in the second quarter and what we've accomplished not only during the quarter but over the past several years to prepare AIG for a bright future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra.\n\nSabra Purtill\n\nEVP and CFO, AIG\n\nThank you, Peter. This morning I will provide details on AIG's exceptional second quarter financial results with a particular focus on the accounting treatment of Corebridge deconsolidation, General Insurance quarterly financial results, written premium rate trends, other operations, book value per share, and ROE. I will begin with Corebridge-related activity this quarter and the accounting treatment on AIG's financials. A few key dates to outline. On 16 May, we announced the agreement with Nippon Life because that sale could close within 12 months of the announcement and reduce our ownership to well below 50%. Held-for-sale accounting and the classification of Corebridge as discontinued operations was triggered for accounting purposes. Next, we sold 30 million shares of Corebridge on 30 May, which brought our ownership to 48%. However, it did not trigger deconsolidation accounting because AIG still had a right to majority representation on the Corebridge board.\nOn 9 June, we raised our right to majority representation and one of our designees resigned from the Corebridge Board, triggering deconsolidation accounting as well as the required filing of pro forma financials with the SEC. Four days later, discontinued operations and deconsolidation accounting principles drove significant changes in AIG's financials this quarter. We added a few slides in the investor deck to explain these changes, which I will refer to in my remarks. Let me start with the impact of held for sale and discontinued operations on Slide 15. Held for sale accounting stipulates that when you reach an agreement to sell a business, its financials must be recast in the current period, with assets and liabilities each classified in one line for both sides of the balance sheet.\nHowever, since Corebridge was a core business that we fully intend to exit, it also met the accounting criteria for discontinued operations, which requires a recast not just for the current reporting period but also for past periods. As a result, we reclassed Corebridge's assets, liabilities, and net income into assets and liabilities of discontinued operations and income or loss from discontinued operations net of income tax in the AIG financials for Q2 and prior periods. This treatment is reflected on Slide 15. While AIG total assets of $544 billion as of 31 March 2024 is the same as originally reported and following discontinued operations presentation, there is a significant movement within the line items.\nFor example, total investments in cash of $324 billion as originally reported decreased to $88 billion with discontinued operations presentation, with $236 billion of Corebridge investments in cash now included in assets of discontinued operations.\nThe next change in the quarter was deconsolidation, which was triggered on 9 June. On the Q4 2023 earnings call, I described the accounting steps related to this principle. Today I'll walk through those steps with the final numbers, turning to slide 16. The first step is the fair valuing of Corebridge's assets and liabilities as of 9 June; the net fair value amount was $9.7 billion, comprised principally of the $8.6 billion market value of our Corebridge shares at that date and the net fair value of intercompany assets and previously consolidated investment entities. Next, we calculate the difference between the fair value of $9.7 billion and the book value on AIG's balance sheet, which was $6.7 billion. This results in a net gain on sale of Corebridge of $3.0 billion pre-tax or $2.5 billion after-tax.\nAfter that. Accounting principles require the recognition of $7.2 billion of accumulated other comprehensive loss on AIG's balance sheet, which is unrealized losses on Corebridge's investment portfolio due to higher interest rates. This recognition records a $7.2 billion loss from AOCI in AIG retained earnings by booking it through the loss and discontinued operations in the income statement and then reducing AIG's AOCI on the balance sheet. This does not change shareholders' equity shown on slide 17.\nTo determine the income statement accounting impact of deconsolidation, the $2.5 billion after tax gain and the $7.2 billion of accumulated other comprehensive loss are added together to calculate the net after tax loss on deconsolidation of $4.7 billion. Finally, the next step is to add Corebridge's net income for the quarter prior to 9 June, which was $325 million after tax, to the net loss on sale, resulting in a total net loss on discontinued operations of $4.4 billion recorded in AIG's income statement for the quarter.\nNow I'll cover the impact on AIG shareholders' equity, turning to slide 17, which has a walk of AIG's total equity from the end of March to the end of June. AIG shareholders' equity was $43.4 billion at 31 March, including Corebridge. On a consolidated basis excluding deconsolidation impacts, the second quarter change in AIG shareholders' equity was a decrease of $1.5 billion, reflecting income from continuing operations of $475 million, offset by $1.7 billion of share repurchases and $261 million of dividends paid. This results in a pro forma AIG shareholders' equity of $41.9 billion before deconsolidation.\nThen you layer in the deconsolidation impacts by adding the $2.5 billion after-tax gain on sale for total AIG shareholders equity of $44.4 billion at 30 June 2024 for a $1.1 billion net increase in the quarter, resulting in book value per share of $68.40 at 30 June, a 6% increase from 31 March.\nPlease note as well that $5.7 billion of non-controlling interest in total equity, which represents the portion of Corebridge equity owned by other shareholders, is also eliminated with deconsolidation through the recognition in the net book value calculation of the gain on sale. The last deconsolidation impact is on debt and leverage on slide 18. Total debt for AIG and Corebridge at 31 March 2024 was $19.2 billion, and total equity was $49.1 billion, for debt to total capital ratio of 28.1%.\nWith deep consolidation, Corebridge's debt of $9.4 billion, and non-controlling interest of $5.7 billion are eliminated on AIG's balance sheet. This results in 30 June 2024 balances of $9.8 billion for total debt, and $54.3 billion for total capital for a debt to total capital ratio of 18.1%, well within our 15% to 20% target leverage range. We hope this explanation and the slides are helpful in understanding the accounting treatment of Corebridge deconsolidation this quarter. I will now cover second quarter general insurance and other operations results.\nTurning to general insurance, adjusted pre-tax income or APTI was $1.2 billion, up 7% on a comparable basis due to strong underwriting results and higher net investment income. General insurance net investment income was $746 million, up 10% on a comparable basis due to higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturities and loans. Considering current interest rates and $1.6 billion of general insurance dividends paid to parent at quarter end, we expect Q3 general insurance investment income from fixed maturities, loans, and short-term investments of about $700 million. Income on alternatives and other investment assets were $33 million and $52 million respectively in the quarter, up $32 million in total from $44 million, and $9 million respectively in Q2 2023.\nQ2 2024 underwriting income on a comparable basis was $430 million versus $420 million in Q2 last year driven by lower expenses, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses. Year to date underwriting results have been strong with an accident year loss ratio ex catastrophes of 56.3% mainly driven by changes in business mix compared to the prior year based on earned premium roll forward, and barring unforeseen significant changes in loss trends, we expect the accident year loss ratio ex catastrophes will remain strong in the second half of 2024 at approximately the same level as the first half. Turning to natural catastrophes, the industry globally had another quarter of elevated losses with approximately 100 events.\nFor AIG, Q2 catastrophe losses totaled $325 million or 5.7 points on the loss ratio, principally from secondary perils including severe convective storms in the United States, floods in the Middle East, Brazil, and hail in Japan. With a roughly 50-50 split between North America and International, our largest loss in the quarter totaled $90 million from exceptionally heavy rains in the UAE. Considering the forecast for hurricane season this year and secondary peril losses year to date, we believe that using AIG's last year total catastrophe losses is a good proxy for full year 2024. While actual losses will depend on the size and strength of events, our underwriting standards, limits, and reinsurance programs, both occurrence and aggregate, will help reduce the net impact of catastrophe frequency and severity on AIG's balance sheet.\nNevertheless, on a global basis, the third quarter is usually by far the highest catastrophe quarter with losses averaging 40% to 50% of the total for the year. Turning to reserves, prior year development net of reinsurance was a favorable $79 million, reflecting the net result from DVRs completed on more than $20 billion of reserves, about 45% of the total in the quarter. Overall, the DVRs which included US casualty resulted in net favorable development on workers compensation and modest net unfavorable development of $30 million on excess casualty, including $66 million for accident year 2021. The 2021 excess casualty reserve charges were for a few large known losses and commercial auto loss trends reflecting the rebound in auto frequency and severity after the pandemic lockdown in 2020 when frequency was very low.\nWe have not seen this increase in frequency and severity trends in the more recent accident years. Within the casualty and excess casualty books, overall severity trends remain generally consistent with our assumptions. While we see some favorable trends in the 2016 to 2019 accident years, we will continue to allow time for these years to mature.\nPricing, which includes rate and exposure for Global Commercial lines this quarter, increased 5% excluding workers compensation in financial lines, while our view on loss cost trends have remained stable. In North America, commercial renewal rates increased 2% in the second quarter, or 4% if you exclude workers compensation and financial lines, and the exposure increase was 2%. In international commercial, overall rate was largely flat, or a 1% increase excluding financial lines, and the exposure increase was 3% excluding financial lines. We continue to monitor our portfolio very closely, and while rate in the second quarter is below trends on certain lines of business such as property, it is above trend in others.\nTo give more insight on property, North America retail and wholesale property saw rate increases drop below trend in Q2, but that's on the back of rate increases in excess of 25% in 2023 and cumulatively in excess of 150% since 2018. International property is about 100% higher in 2023. Our property portfolio had an excellent combined ratio in North America casualty lines; in particular, excess casualty, we continue to get rate in excess of loss trend. We continue to focus on writing business that has attractive returns, and while the price adequacy of our portfolio, of course, varies by line, it remains strong overall and within our expectations.\nTurning to other operations, deconsolidation vastly simplified the income statement. Adjusted pretax loss in the quarter was $158 million, a 43% improvement year-over-year, primarily attributable to $68 million in corporate dividends and higher short term investment income. Finally, with deconsolidation, we expect our 2024 adjusted tax rate to be about 24% before discrete items in line with our second quarter.\nWith the deconsolidation of Corebridge this quarter, AIG's income statement and balance sheet are simpler, and we no longer have the volatility of life insurance and annuity accounting. With all the changes, we took the opportunity to evaluate our non-GAAP equity metrics, which were established more than a decade ago when AIG was a vastly more complicated conglomerate. The principal change was revising our calculation of adjusted book value to only adjust for investment-related accumulated other comprehensive income, which is not within management's control and which will revert to par as bonds approach maturity. Adjusted book value per share was $72.78 per share at 30 June 2024. In addition, we added a core operating shareholders equity metric, which reflects the equity invested in AIG's go-forward business.\nIt is calculated by subtracting from adjusted book value the market value of Corebridge stock and GAAP deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and tax credits. Both of these assets have significant value to our shareholders, but contribute little to AATI. We believe this metric is more useful for valuing AIG's global general insurance business and also for measuring our progress towards a 10%+ ROE target over time as we reduce our ownership in Corebridge to zero and monetize the DTA through earnings. Core operating book value will become the same as adjusted book value. Core operating book value per share was $53.35 per share at 30 June 2024. To wrap up, AIG delivered another excellent quarter with significant financial and operational accomplishments in 2024.\nAchieving the deconsolidation of Corebridge was a major accomplishment this quarter, and we had continued strong profitability and growth in our general insurance business. With our portfolio reshaping now largely behind us, we are intently focused on achieving our 10%+ ROE target driven by strong underwriting and top line growth, expense reduction, and capital management. We continue to make progress on this goal with a core operating ROE of 8.9% for Q2 and 9.3% year to date. With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nGreat. Thank you, Sabra. Operator, we're ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star 11. If your question has been answered and you'd like to remove yourself from the queue, please press star 11 again. Our first question comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Zaremski\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHey, great. Good morning. First question on the updated kind of combined ratio trajectory or guidance for 2025. So loud and clear that you'll be able to kind of hit it a bit sooner. I'm curious if you can kind of if we focus on the loss ratio, what the guidance implies on a like for like basis on the loss ratio. Some of the questions we get continuously around. Most companies are seeing some slippage in their loss ratios given lower levels of reserve releases. Curious if that's something that's considered within your loss ratio guidance?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThanks, Mike, for the question. The guidance that we've given in terms of what we expect for the full year 2025 does not contemplate any improvement in loss ratio. It's all in the expense ratio. So we're trying to guide everybody is that all the expenses that exist in other operations will transition into parent, they'll go into the business or they'll be eliminated, and that we're not going to be increasing our combined ratios based on the guidance that we gave at the end of 2023. We're not anticipating any caveats on loss ratios to be able to meet that guidance.\n\nMichael Zaremski\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nI guess just I'll stick on this for my follow up. You know, given pricing you know is below loss trend in certain lines like property, and understanding that the absolute. Maybe this is the answer. The absolute pricing levels are still accretive to ROE or loss ratio. Just, you know, does it, to the extent the current pricing environment held. You know, why does it kind of make sense that the loss ratio should be able to kind of stay flattish, and you know, not trying to be negative just trying to nitpick on the margin?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG",
    "content3": "No, it's a great question. Let's take North America for example, because you pointed out property this quarter in terms of the overall index and rate increases. Property was the headwind in that index. In casualty we achieved mid-single-digit to high-single-digit rate with 12% in excess casualty plus 2% in exposure. In Lexington it was 11% increase in casualty, 12% in health care. So again above loss cost trends, property was flat this quarter. But you have to look at what's happened with the property market over the past several years. And if you look at even last year in excess and surplus lines, it was a 34% increase.\nIn the retail it was 30%. That's after four years of double digit rate increase. So I think with the low activity in cat, maybe in Q1, the cumulative rate increases over time. The property combined ratio, fully loaded with cat, even with giving a little bit back in Q2 has an outstanding combined ratio. If I could get that combined ratio for the rest of my career, I'll take it. I mean, I don't think there's any deterioration in terms of what our overall index will be. And again, I can't really predict. That's why I kind of went into a little bit more detail about like sort of the CAT market is that we don't know. I mean, like, so property is highly driven by what happens in CAT and underlying inflation.\nAnd so, you know, I'm not going to predict what happens, you know, sort of six quarters from now, but I think we feel really comfortable with the portfolio and its profitability.\n\nMichael Zaremski\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.\n\nMeyer Shields\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KBW\n\nPardon me. Thank you. First question, I was hoping we can get a general sense of the impact of the sale of the travel insurance on underwriting results in North America Personal.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nHey Meyer. Good morning. In terms of, I outlined in my prepared remarks the premium impact, which is the $750 million on net premiums written. But on the overall combined ratio, it's going to be de minimis in terms of what we would lose within general insurance once we pro forma it out.\n\nMeyer Shields\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KBW\n\nOkay, perfect. Second question, I guess on the excess casualty, if I understood Sabra's comments correctly, you had favorable development even on that line outside of 2021, which was a weird year, and I was hoping you could sort of break that down for us. I assume that that's older years rather than recent years, but I wanted to confirm that.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nYeah, I'll hand it over to Sabra, but as you know, and she gave a lot of detail in her prepared remarks, and we reviewed 45% of our total book in Q2. In casualty, just based on what's going on in the global market, we really drilled down on every line of business and every year, and went through it in tremendous detail. So Sabra, maybe you could just give a few in terms of that analysis.\n\nSabra Purtill\n\nEVP and CFO, AIG\n\nYeah, sure. And just for everyone's benefit, I'll just start by framing a little bit what we did in the quarter for the DVRs. So this quarter we evaluated $20.2 billion of reserves for US casualty. That's comprised of 23 separate DVRs and more than 200 different lines of business. And then that aggregates to the five lines that you see on the 10Q. So the net changes in the quarter were only about $20 million after return premiums, and that was $80 million favorable in workers comp. After the ADC, which has about $8 billion of reserves, it was $22 million unfavorable in excess casualty, which also has about $5 billion of reserves. And then in casualty it's also about $5 billion reserves for $17 million favorable in terms of the 2021 accident year.\nAs we've noted on previous calls, we've increased our loss cost trends for 2020 and subsequent years. The adjustments we made in 2021 are from just a combination of known early reported claims that, due to their facts and circumstances, we expect to penetrate the excess attachment level, including a rebound in the auto frequency and severity in 2022 and 2023 accident years.\nWe just have not had that same level of early claims experience and therefore we still have a high level of IBNR in the reserves. You know, with respect to the accident years.\nWith respect to the accident years within excess casualty, I would note that while we did have the $66 million of adverse development in accident year 2021, we had $33 million of favorable development in excess casualty from accident years prior to 2016. And that's where the delta comes that nets down to closer to the $22 million amount.\n\nMeyer Shields\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KBW\n\nGot it. That's exactly what I needed. Thank you.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThank you, Meyer. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo, your line is open.\n\nElyse Greenspan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate all the color you guys are providing on the call. My first question, Peter, you said that the full year 2025 calendar year combined ratio would be the same or lower than the full year 2023. Since you said comparable basis, I'm assuming you mean Crop and Validus. Can you guys just disclose what that figure is just so we know. You know what, what you're setting the 2025 baseline at, what was the 2023 adjusted figure?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\n91.6%.\n\nElyse Greenspan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay, thank you. Then my second question is you also mentioned in your prepared remarks; you said something about exploring inorganic opportunities. Can you just expand on what that means? You guys have obviously taken action of divesting of certain businesses. So what would you look at on the expansion side, and what criteria would any potential inorganic deals need to meet?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThanks, Elyse. I included that in my prepared remarks just based on the amount of, you know, financial flexibility, strategic flexibility that you know, we've created for ourselves. You know, the divestitures have been really about not having like really the businesses that we divest were terrific and they fit very well with with their new owners. But you know, some of them needed scale like travel and crop and you know, we want it to be a little bit less in the volatility business and therefore, you know, Validus Re was divested. I would think as we look to the future, again we're going to be very selective, very disciplined. But there are opportunities perhaps where we have existing businesses, where we feel as though we have competitive advantages, that having more scale would be helpful.\nThere could be complementary geographies as we look to different parts of internationally, but terrific international business. But there could be places where we want to expand further that give us not only better capabilities within that geography, but also could be very good for our multinational network. There are opportunities to invest further in businesses that we have. Think about AIG. Tata in India is a fast growing large scale business that is an industry leader. There are opportunities there as well. So we will use the same criteria, which is to make sure it's disciplined, it's additive, it's strategic, and it actually furthers and accelerates the progress we can make on an organic basis. And so we will again we'll keep giving updates as there's more relevant information to share.\n\nElyse Greenspan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThanks Elyse.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nRob Cox\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, thanks. Just a question on the accident year loss ratio ex cat guidance for approximately the same level in the back half. Can you help us think a little bit more about what goes into that and where that shakes out on a comparable basis versus the, I think, over 100 basis points of improvement AIG has reported here in the first half?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nSure. Thank you, Rob. It's really driven by mix of business. If you take a look at this year compared to last year on a net premium earned basis, the commercial and personal insurance businesses are literally identical in terms of its overall contribution to total premium. And then the commercial loss ratio largely stayed flat, like a 10 basis point improvement, but largely flat. What happened was the personal insurance loss ratio dramatically improved driven by North America, which was well over 400 basis points.\nAnd so I think that that's really driving the first six months. And if we look at the back half, I mean, should we see the same thing? I think so. But you've seen all the tremendous new business, the momentum we have, the mix of business could be changed a little bit year-over-year when we look at the back half of the year. But that's really what's driving the improved loss ratio in the first six months. So it's really a true mix of business and also the significant improvement that North America Personal is making and we expect them to continue to make.\n\nRob Cox\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, got it, thank you. Maybe as just a follow up.\nThe move to kind of put some more capital to work in high net worth, is that driven by a change in sort of the view and underwriting opportunities there or have they always been good for AIG and what kind of drove that decision to double down now?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThe high net worth business had the same issues that the commercial business did, which it had too much TIV and it gets more pronounced in the high net worth business because it's more dense. And so we needed to shed aggregate for a lot of reasons. One is that we had too much exposure in certain geographies like the world changed with COVID, the pandemic, and all the macro factors that affected it. And then also the evolution of.\nMore capabilities in the non-admitted market. And so what we decided, and we've been thinking about this for a couple of years, is to build out an admitted platform that is going to be very strong, the right infrastructure, and have the ability to grow, but also complement that with the non-admitted market and be able to do that where you have flexibility in form, rate, and limits and how you can actually respond to client needs. And there's a need. And so what we've been working on is what's the best way to do that? Partnering with Ryan Specialty, it's a highly fragmented wholesale market. So nobody has a real strong expertise in high net worth unless you start to build it. And I think Ryan has been doing that.\nAnd so, getting access to the 40,000 independent agents with a product that's going to be saleable, and we have done such a terrific job in terms of creating opportunity for more aggregate, that we want to be able to have both options. And we believe that we'll be able to grow the non-admitted property market just based on the partnership that we just announced recently. So it's always been in the plan, but we didn't want to go out and just say we're going to do non-admitted and have it a fragmented, not strategic approach. And so we believe this is going to give us great opportunities to access the market in a different way.\n\nRob Cox\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Mike Ward with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Ward\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nThank you. Good morning. I just had one question, and it was somewhat related, but overall for the business and including commercial lines, curious how you guys are shifting the culture back to sort of a growth mindset, thinking about all the change that you've executed and should, you know, I guess where are we in that part of the story and should we think about AIG as potentially being able to grow faster than the market all equal, just by turning some of those spigots back on?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nYeah, it's a terrific question, and I happen to have Don Bailey and Jon Hancock here with me. So I'm going to ask them both to comment on North America and international. It's a great question. Don, why don't you start with how we have actually been very focused on not only retention but new business in North America.\n\nDon Bailey\n\nEVP and CEO, North America Commercial Insurance\n\nYeah, thanks, Peter.\nWe have definitely pivoted to that growth mindset. It's first important to mention that we were doing this off of transforming the business over the last few years. So we come into the growth with a position of strength regarding underwriting, discipline, and profitability. You've heard about all that. Regarding the growth, we've been very deliberate in creating more value for our distribution partners and clients than ever before. And we're applying much more rigor in pursuing like targeted risks. All of that is what you start to see showing up in the numbers now.\nI can give you a little bit more color on the retention that we're delivering, high levels of retention across all of our business. I would also add that we're executing on specific market opportunities, notably Retail Casualty and Lexington. On the retail casualty side, we are on offense. The discipline in the Excess market is a positive for us right now, and we're moving on that. Regarding Lex, the growth there comes from three places. We have strong, continued, strong retention there, new products, and new customers. So it's not from bigger limits. I would describe it as healthy horizontal growth. Regarding the sustainability of it, which I think is important, I can look at some of our Lex submission data and share that with you. Year to date submissions at Lex are up 42%, and that's on top of 39% growth through last year through six months.\nWe view this as a clear flight to quality in that space. I should also add that we resourced all of that in advance so we're well positioned to take advantage of what's coming. And Peter, I'd just say this in closing on my end. We're getting all that growth while achieving outstanding loss ratios in the core business.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nDon, thank you, that was great. Jon, maybe a little bit of context on international.\n\nJon Hancock\n\nEVP and CEO, International Commercial Insurance and Global Personal Insurance\n\nYeah, I mean I won't repeat what you've already said, Peter, or Don, but I would say this is still a very good market for us to underwrite in. We've got a really large diverse portfolio across international. Gives us access to a huge amount of opportunity. Different segments, different geographies at different points in time so we can reshape and shift the book depending on what we see in each market. Similar themes to Don.\nThis has been very planful. This is not opportunistic growth here. We've been building to this for a long time off a very, very high quality book of business. We start with retaining 89% of what we work really hard to build, a really strong book. New business submissions are up as well. We're retaining that our own flight to quality as well as the market. I agree with Don. The market's flight to quality. A couple of highlights for me. We've got a world class global specialty business. It's grown 8% in the quarter, and that's driven by some very, very good new business in all of the global specialty segments, especially in marine and energy where we are recognized world leaders in both. We've grown new business in marine 15% over Q1 last year. Especially strong in cargo in the UK and across Europe.\nPeter, you already referenced energy. 13% increase in new business year-over-year, and that's in all of our global hubs and all of our products, actually. So really, really strong targeted growth with one of our best performing profitability businesses. I'll add in Talbot as well. Talbot at Lloyd's. Another very, very good quarter of growth at 12%. And again, that's driven by targeted growth in specialty lines of marine liability that we grew at 13%, cargo and specie at 16%, and upstream energy at 19%. And both of those, with the market we've got, the pipeline that we've got, we expect to see continued good growth.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThat's great, Jon. Thanks to you and Don for that detail. Really helpful. I want to thank everybody for joining us today.\nI do want to thank our colleagues around the world for their continued dedication, commitment, teamwork, and all of their execution. I also want to extend my deep gratitude to Tom Bolt, who is retiring at the end of the year, for his many significant contributions to AIG during a very important time and congratulate him on his storied career. Tom was instrumental in establishing a global framework for AIG's underwriting standards, governance, and structures in alignment with our refined risk appetite and has just been a terrific executive at AIG. So again, thank you for joining us today. Everybody have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."

This conference is being recorded.\nNow at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\n\nQuentin John McMillan\n\nVP, MD & Head of IR, American International Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thanks very much. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.\nToday's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com.\nAdditionally, note that today's remarks will include results of AIG Life & Retirement segment and other operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial. AIG segments and U.S. GAAP financial results, as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto, differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its earnings call on Friday, May 3.\nFinally, today's remarks as they relate to net premiums written, adjusted pretax income, underwriting income and margin in General Insurance are presented both on a reported basis as well as a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis as applicable, adjusted for the sale of Crop Risk Services and the sale of Validus RE. Please refer to the footnote on Page 26 of the first quarter financial supplement for prior period results for the Crop business and Validus Re.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Salvatore Zaffino\n\nGlobal COO & CEO of General Insurance, American International Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our first quarter 2024 financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter and then we'll take questions. Kevin Hogan will join us for the Q&A portion of the call. .\nHere are some highlights from the quarter. Adjusted after-tax income was $1.2 billion or $1.77 per diluted common share, representing a 9% increase in earnings per share year-over-year. Consolidated net investment income on an adjusted pretax income basis was $3.5 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year. General Insurance underwriting income was $596 million, a 19% increase year-over-year, reflecting improved accident year results, including lower catastrophes and increased 67% year-over-year on a comparable basis, if you exclude divested businesses from the prior year quarter.\nThe accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.4%, a 30 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter and was the tenth consecutive quarter of a sub-90 combined ratio. The quarter also reflected the significant improvement we have made in controlling volatility in our property portfolio as total catastrophe-related losses in the quarter were $107 million or 1.9%, representing a 230 basis point improvement year-over-year.\nTurning to Life & Retirement. The business reported very good results with premiums and deposits of $10.7 billion in the first quarter, their highest quarterly result achieved in the last decade, and strong APTI growth of 12% over the prior year quarter.\nLast September, Corebridge entered into a definitive agreement to sell the U.K. life insurance business to Aviva PLC, which calls on April 8. Net proceeds were approximately $550 million and will be used for Corebridge share repurchases.\nDuring the quarter, we returned over $2.4 billion to shareholders through $1.7 billion of common stock repurchases, $250 million of dividends and the redemption of all our outstanding Series A preferred stock for $500 million. We repaid $459 million of debt upon maturity, lowering our total debt to $9.8 billion. In addition, we repurchased approximately $613 million of common stock in April. Based on our strong performance, the AIG Board of Directors approved an 11% increase in AIG's quarterly common stock dividend to $0.40 per share. The AIG Board of Directors also increased the share repurchase authorization to $10 billion effective May 1. The Lastly, we ended the first quarter with strong parent liquidity of $5.1 billion.\nOverall, I'm very pleased with our first quarter results and the continued strong execution of our strategy to deliver sustained underwriting excellence, profitability and disciplined capital management.\nDuring my remarks this morning, I will discuss 4 important topics. First, I will provide some financial highlights in the quarter focused on the general insurance business, including some insight into our net premiums written. Second, I will talk briefly about the results in Life & Retirement. Third, I will provide an update on our capital management strategy, specifically our plans for 2024 and 2025. And finally, I will discuss our path to a 10%-plus ROCE and provide more detail on AIG Next and our future state operating structure that will create value through a leaner and more unified company.\nLet me take a moment to update you on our sell-down of Corebridge. Our Corebridge Holdings currently stand at 324 million common shares outstanding, which represents a 53% ownership stake. We continue to explore all alternatives to reduce our ownership stake in Corebridge. Once Corebridge is deconsolidated from AIG, Life & Retirement's balance sheet and income statement will no longer be included in AIG's consolidated financial statements, and our remaining ownership stake will be reported in parent investments with dividends reported in net investment income.\nSabra went through this in detail on our last earnings call. We have been evaluating opportunities to maximize long-term value for Corebridge and have considered multiple strategic alternatives that we believe will best position Corebridge for future success. We remain committed to reducing AIG's ownership and to fully selling our remaining stake, and I will continue to provide updates to all of our stakeholders.\nIn terms of the use of coverage-related proceeds, AIG expects to continue to utilize excess capital and liquidity and with a focus on returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and liability management, which I will discuss later when I outline our capital management strategy.\nNow turning to General Insurance. Net premiums written were $4.5 billion and reflected the impact of the dispositions of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services as well as actions we've taken to restructure specific treaty reinsurance. Overall, Global Commercial had a very strong quarter. Excluding the impact of our divestitures, global commercial net premiums written growth was 1% year-over-year.\nFirst, I want to reconfirm the guidance for the year. We expect high single-digit growth in net premiums written for the full year in our Global Commercial Insurance business.\nNow the results. In North America Commercial, net premiums written grew 4%. Lexington grew 24%, which was led by casualty and Western World. Our excess casualty line grew 46% and our captive solutions grew 20%.\nThere's been meaningful commentary on the excess and surplus lines market, and we continue to experience terrific fundamentals and results in Lexington. Let me provide a few examples. Our submission volume was up over 50% year-over-year. Lexington delivered strong new business outperforming last year's record first quarter results balanced across all lines. And retention remains strong for Lexington at 78%.\nShifting to North America retail property, net premiums written were negative $120 million in the quarter, driven by first quarter reinsurance purchased and had over a 600 basis point impact on the first quarter net premiums written growth for North America commercial compared to prior year. North America financial lines declined 4% year-over-year.\nIn prior quarters, we provided meaningful commentary on the dynamics within Financial Lines, so I will not go through that again.\nIt's been a challenging market environment with continued headwinds on rate. Out of that, we continue to believe our portfolio is strong, and we remain disciplined. Sabra will give more detail in her prepared remarks.\nIn International Commercial, net premiums written were flat for the quarter. International Property grew 23% and Talbot grew 18%. This was offset by a decline in our Global Specialty business of slightly over 10% due to some top line weakness in energy and the effects of the reinsurance restructuring. Also, we had a 5% decline in international financial lines.\nNow turning to the combined ratio. Our Global Commercial business in the first quarter had an outstanding result with an 84.4% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, a 150 basis point improvement year-over-year. The accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe was 86.6%, a 500 basis point improvement year-over-year. This was led by International Commercial which, on a comparable basis, had an 82.8% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, which is a 140 basis point improvement year-over-year; and an 83.5% accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe, which is a 770 basis point improvement year-over-year.\nNorth America Commercial also had an outstanding result with an 85.9% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, which is a 180 basis point improvement year-over-year; and a 89.5% accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe which is a 260 basis point improvement year-over-year. These results were simply outstanding and are a testament to our commitment and culture of underwriting excellence.\nShifting now to Global Personal Insurance Net premiums written were flat to prior year. We had modest growth in personal auto and individual travel and reductions in high net worth driven largely by Reinsurance; and Accident & Health, largely driven by 2 nonrenewals in China, as part of our focus on portfolio improvements in our Accident & Health business.\nNorth America Personal had a 97.7% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe. This is a 990 basis point improvement year-over-year and a 101.6% accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe, which is an 870 basis point improvement year-over-year.\nAs we discussed last year, we expect a material financial improvement in 2024 that will be driven by higher earned premium and a lower loss ratio from the high net worth business. We saw this manifest in the first quarter and expect this improvement to continue throughout 2024.\nInternational Parcel Insurance had a 96.8% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, which increased 90 basis points year-over-year; and a 96.8% accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe, which is a 20 basis point improvement year-over-year.\nOverall, I'm very pleased with the financial performance of General Insurance, which delivered another excellent quarter.\nOur reinsurance decisions in the first quarter had an impact on net premiums written. As we've discussed over the past several years, our reinsurance partnerships and global treaty structures have been purposeful. Our objective has been to deliver improved underwriting profitability and evolve our business portfolio to be appropriately diversified to deliver consistent results throughout the market cycle.\nWe believe this strategy has provided sustained value to our clients while also delivering improved risk-adjusted returns. It has significantly repositioned AIG especially as we prepare to deconsolidate from Corebridge. Our goals with our reinsurance purchasing have been to preserve and optimize capital and enhance the quality of earnings through active management of the volatility of our underwriting results.\nThis deliberate approach to reinsurance has helped position AIG with a very strong balance sheet and has given us the flexibility to add exposure where risk-adjusted returns are very attractive while also moderating volatility in our underwriting results.\nAs a result of our divestiture of Validus Re, combined with the reduction in gross limits in property through our underwriting strategy, we have reduced our PMLs and created meaningful capacity to increase our property writings throughout our global platform should they meet our expected returns.\nWithout going through each return period by peril and region, our key zone PMLs on average, have decreased by over 40% compared to the first quarter of 2023, which provides considerable aggregate for future growth while appropriately managing the exposures we're assuming.\nOur reinsurance purchasing is deliberately concentrated at January 1. As a result, any changes in purchasing tend to be more pronounced in the first quarter reporting of net premiums written.\nIn January 2024, we also made some changes related to the allocation of catastrophe costs among the businesses so that catastrophe costs are more accurately reflected in pricing. Historically, some of these costs have been shared with Validus Re. We reallocated PMLs and the catastrophe costs to where we believe the most attractive opportunities for growth existed in our portfolio.\nIt's worth noting, when considering our property catastrophe placement, we believe we have the lowest attachment point of our peer group. Over time, we have the balance sheet and perhaps the risk appetite to take more net on our catastrophe program post deconsolidation and subject to market conditions.\nAs a point of reference, if we chose to raise our catastrophe attachment point to $500 million worldwide, our attachment point would likely remain the lowest among our peer group with a 111 attachment point in North America wind and a 119 attachment in North America earthquake based on today's exposure.\nImportantly, our net premiums written in commercial would have been 15% greater in the first quarter if we had elected to have a $500 million attachment point across our global portfolio.\nOur earnings potential is significant. And when combined with the strength of our balance sheet, it will provide us with the flexibility to continuously evaluate and refine our strategic reinsurance purchasing as we enter 2025.\nTurning to Life & Retirement. As I noted earlier, the business continued to produce strong results in the first quarter. In April, Corebridge completed their Corebridge forward restructuring. $400 million of savings has been actioned or contracted, and they expect to realize the vast majority of the savings by the end of 2024 at a cost to achieve of $300 million.\nCorebridge repurchased approximately $240 million of common shares during the first quarter. They have repurchased $370 million of common shares year-to-date. Corebridge ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet with parent liquidity of $1.7 billion. This week, the Corebridge Board of Directors approved a share buyback authorization of $2 billion, which reflects their stated commitment to delivering a 60% to 65% payout ratio to shareholders, subject to market conditions.\nTurning to other operations. We have made significant progress towards our future state operating model. Adjusted pretax loss from other operations in the quarter, including Life & Retirement, was $408 million, a 17% improvement year-over-year. The improvement was primarily attributable to lower general operating expense, higher short-term investment income and lower interest expense at AIG due to debt reduction actions.\nWe expect our future state parent expenses to be in the range of $325 million to $350 million by year-end 2024. After deconsolidation, we intend to use 1% to 1.5% of net premiums earned as a benchmark of total parent expenses in the future.\nTurning to capital management. In the first quarter, we continue to execute on our balanced capital management strategy. Over the past couple of years, we have significantly strengthened our balance sheet by making key decisions that have increased our financial flexibility while always planning for the long term, which has allowed us to accelerate the execution of our strategy and unlock meaningful value for AIG shareholders.\nAlong with establishing appropriate debt capital structures for AIG and Corebridge and diligently executing on AIG's capital management priorities, we have also completed over $40 billion of capital market transactions since 2022. We have been very disciplined in the execution of the components of our capital management strategy that we first outlined in 2022.\nAs a reminder, our objectives were: To maintain very strong insurance company capital levels to support organic growth and a steady source of operating subsidiary dividends to service parent company needs; to reduce our total debt outstanding and improve our leverage ratios, providing a well-structured and well-laddered debt portfolio with no outsized amounts due in any given year, particularly over the next 5 years; to return excess capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends; to increase our dividend as our earnings and financial flexibility improved; and to maintain a strong parent liquidity position.\nAll of our Tier 1 insurance company subsidiaries are at or above their target capital ranges and have the ability to support meaningful growth without additional capital contributions.\nAt current profitability levels, we had approximately $3 billion of run rate dividend capacity from our Global General Insurance subsidiaries with approximately $2 billion attributable to the U.S. General Insurance Company's dividend capacity. We have increased the U.S. General Insurance company dividend capacity by approximately 400% over the last 3 years. This reflects a significant increase from 2021, when it was $550 million; and in 2022, when it was $1.4 billion.\nLooking forward, we expect to continue positioning AIG with maximum capital flexibility for growth, including reviewing our reinsurance over time and considering compelling and strategic inorganic growth opportunities should they exist.\nIn addition to strong insurance company capitalization, we've continued to significantly reduce our overall debt. Outstanding debt is now approximately $9.8 billion a reduction of over $12 billion since the end of 2021, which has been a remarkable result for AIG. We have previously provided guidance that we're targeting a 20% to 25% total debt-to-capital ratio, and we expect to be in the 15% to 20% range upon deconsolidation.\nWhile we may do additional work on maturities, we would not expect that to take priority over share repurchases. Since 2022, we've increased our focus on share repurchase activities. We completed over $5 billion of repurchases in 2022 and approximately $3 billion in 2023. Looking ahead, we expect up to $6 billion in repurchases in 2024 and up to $4 billion in 2025, depending on the timing of future Corebridge sell-downs and market conditions.\nAll of the expected activity in 2024 and 2025 a will be covered by the $10 billion share authorization that we announced yesterday. For the balance of 2024, we expect to be able to repurchase about $1.5 billion of common stock a quarter depending on excess parent liquidity levels, including future Corebridge sale proceeds, General Insurance dividends and market conditions.\nAnd based on the current stock price, we would expect this to get us closer to the higher end of our target share count range of 600 million to 650 million common shares by the end of the second quarter and towards the lower end of the range by the end of 2024. Furthermore, based on this outlook and depending on the stock price and market conditions, we would expect to be between 550 million and 600 million shares outstanding by year-end 2025.\nTurning to our dividend. The AIG Board of Directors recently increased the cash dividend of $0.40 per share on AIG common stock up 11%, the second consecutive year with an increase of more than 10%.\nI could not be more pleased with our progress. We remain confident in our ability to deliver while continuing the positive momentum in our financial performance. We remain committed to delivering an adjusted 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge. For the first quarter, we achieved a 9.3% adjusted ROCE and a 13.3% adjusted ROCE in General Insurance.\nContributing to ROCE will be AIG Next, which will focus on achieving an expense base that will generate additional savings for AIG while reducing complexity throughout our organization and simplifying how we operate. AIG Next will create clarity in our operating structure, including aligning our underwriting and claims organizations, with our operations and functions while defining our parent company of the future.\nThis is the key objective as we weave AIG together: To be a less complex, more effective and leaner company with the appropriate infrastructure and capabilities for the business we will be post deconsolidation.\nAIG Next has clearly defined work streams governed by a very experienced, centralized team with significant experience in transformations and company design reporting directly to me. As I stated on previous calls, we expect AIG Next to generate approximately $500 million in annual run rate savings by the end of 2025. Of the $500 million in run rate savings we expect $350 million to be actioned in 2024, which is an increase of the guidance we have provided in the past, and the balance will be actioned within 2025 with a cost to achieve of $500 million.\nTo date, we've made meaningful progress on AIG Next across multiple work streams. In April, we announced a voluntary early retirement program available to colleagues in the United States who meet the eligibility criteria. Eligible participants will have the opportunity to accelerate their retirement from AIG with enhanced retirement benefits.\nThe population of eligible participants represents approximately 25% of our U.S. workforce. About half of the eligible participants are located in the high-cost New York metropolitan area. We are anticipating a 50% take-up rate, which would result in approximately $225 million of onetime cost and a net run rate benefit of approximately $150 million after reinvestment for the skills and capabilities we need for the future. The numbers I have provided for our early retirement program are included in the total numbers I provided for AIG Next.\nIn summary, I'm very pleased with our overall performance as we start 2024. As I said in my recent letter to shareholders, our ability to execute continues to be one of the company's best attributes. We have accomplished a significant amount in the past several years in order to position AIG for the future, and we have continued to deliver in the first quarter, which will enable us to achieve our objectives in 2024 and beyond.\nI am confident that we will continue to uphold our commitment to achieving underwriting excellence and high-quality earnings over the long term, benefiting all of our stakeholders as we continue to simplify and streamline our business and create the AIG of tomorrow.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra.\n\nSabra Rose Purtill\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations & Treasurer, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide details on AIG's first quarter results, including General Insurance, investment income and Life & Retirement and a balance sheet update.\nFirst quarter 2024 adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders, or AATI, was $1.2 billion, flat to last year due to the reduction in our ownership of Corebridge from 77.3% to 52.7% at the end of this quarter. General Insurance adjusted pretax income, or APTI, increased $110 million year-over-year, driven by higher underwriting and net investment income. The prior year quarter included APTI of approximately $175 million from Validus Re and Crop Risk Services. On a comparable basis, excluding the divested businesses, General insurance APTI was up about $285 million.\nAs Peter noted, first quarter general insurance underwriting income was $596 million, up $94 million from the prior year quarter. On a comparable basis, underwriting income rose $239 million year-over-year.\nInternational Commercial Lines was the primary contributor to higher underwriting profitability with $175 million increase in underwriting income. North America Commercial Lines underwriting income was down $95 million from the prior year quarter as reported but up $35 million on a comparable basis.\nUnderwriting income includes catastrophe losses of $107 million in the quarter or 190 basis points on the loss ratio, down from $265 million or 420 basis points last year. Prior year development this quarter was a favorable $34 million compared to a favorable $68 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's development was solely from the amortization of the deferred gain on the adverse development cover which is recalculated each year based on prior year experience. For 2024, the amortization gain will be $34 million each quarter compared to $41 million a quarter last year.\nTurning to underwriting ratios. The general insurance calendar year combined ratio was 89.8% this quarter, a 210 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter and a 380 basis point improvement on a comparable basis.\nWe provided additional data on Page 26 of the financial supplement on the impact of the divestitures on 2023 North American commercial combined ratios.\nThe accident year combined ratio ex catastrophes was 88.4%, a 30 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter and 160 basis point improvement on a comparable basis. The accident year loss ratio adjusted for catastrophes was 56.6% this quarter, 10 basis points better than the first quarter of 2023 as reported and 70 basis points better on a comparable basis. This improvement reflects continued earn-in of rate above loss cost trend and better underwriting and risk selection, particularly in Global Commercial lines.\nThe expense ratio for the quarter was 31.8%, down 20 basis points from the prior year quarter as reported with a $43 million reduction in general operating expenses. On a comparable basis, the expense ratio improved 90 basis points with 10 basis points from the acquisition ratio and 80 basis points from the general operating expense ratio, reflecting continued expense discipline as general operating expenses rose only $6 million.\nAs Peter Covered General insurance premium growth, I will focus on Commercial Lines new business, renewal rate, loss trends and retention as well as reserves.\nNew business production in Global Commercial remained strong. In North America, New business was almost $450 million and balanced across all lines with excellent performance from Lexington. International commercial new business levels were very good with over $500 million in the quarter, led by Talbot, Property and Casualty, offset by lower new business in energy and financial lines. In North America Commercial, overall rate, excluding workers' compensation, increased 5% in the quarter with exposure adding 2% for overall pricing of 7%, which is above loss cost trend. Excluding workers' comp and financial lines, North America commercial rate was up more than 8% in the quarter, with exposure up 2% for overall pricing over 10%, meaningfully above the loss cost trend.\nNorth America commercial rate increase reflect strengthening pricing trends in casualty, including Lexington Casualty, which was up 11%, Lexington Healthcare up 15% and excess casualty up 16%. In international commercial, overall rate increased 3% and exposure added 2% for an overall pricing increase of 5%, modestly ahead of the loss cost trend. Excluding financial lines, international rate was up 5% with overall pricing up 7%, well ahead of loss cost trend. The rate increase was driven by property, which was up 7%; energy up 8%; and marine up 7%.\nAs we've discussed, Financial Lines is a notable exception to pricing trends. This was particularly the case in excess. We are taking a long-term view in financial lines and remain disciplined on risk selection, terms and conditions, pricing and reserving. While rate trend has been negative the past few quarters, in aggregate, the cumulative rate level in North America financial lines is about 50% higher than 5 years ago.\nRenewal retention has improved over the past several years and remained strong. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention using expiring premiums, excluding the impact of renewal rate and exposure changes on the ratio. Global Commercial retention increased to 89%, stable at 88% in North America and rose to 89% in International.\nTurning to reserves. I wanted to provide some background on AIG's reserve review schedule for 2024 and quarterly processes. At AIG, we performed detailed valuation reviews, or DVRs, on each book once a year. In DVRs, we look at loss development and trends in prior and current accident years and consider changes in our reserving factors and approaches based on emerged experience. We do not perform DVRs in the first quarter.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, we will review the North America Casualty book, including excess and primary casualty, Lexington, workers' compensation and Mass Tort comprising about $20 billion of reserves or 44% of our total reserves.\nIn the third quarter, we will review international Commercial Lines, Global Financial Lines, Commercial Property and other lines, totaling about $22 billion or 47% of reserves with the balance of the DVRs completed in the fourth quarter.\nBetween DVRs, our actuarial team evaluates pricing, claims, loss trends and reserves across the portfolio. Each quarter, we complete an actual versus expected review, or AVE, for each book. The ADE review gives us a current look at trends and the opportunity to address issues prior to the scheduled DVR. Examples of such items include large new claims, notable changes in claims patterns or settlements, changes in attritional loss trends beyond normal ranges or significant major events.\nWe are aware that the industry has begun to address adverse casualty loss development trends in the 2016 to 2019 accident years. On our third quarter 2023 call, Peter provided significant detail on the reunderwriting and repricing of our casualty book that we began in 2018 with an entirely new framework and approach to underwriting. In addition, we changed our reserving assumptions on the book. And by 2021, we had increased reserves on North American Casualty, 2016 through 2019 accident years, by over $1 billion.\nWe also continued to refine our actuarial judgments, and in 2019, we raised the loss cost trend assumption for certain excess casualty segments to 10%. And by 2022, all excess casualty segments were at or above 10%.\nOur AVE reviews on North American Casualty since the second quarter 2023 DVR and continue to show loss experience within the range of our expectations on the 2016 to 2019 accident years. As we have previously outlined, our reserving philosophy is to react to adverse trends quickly and to allow time for favorable trends, particularly in recent accident years, to mature. We did not make any adjustments to our casualty reserves this quarter in total or within the 2016 to 2019 accident years. AIG's reserves and balance sheet are much stronger today, and our reinsurance is much more comprehensive, helping improve our underwriting results and reduce volatility.\nTurning now to investment income. AIG continues to benefit from reinvestment rates on fixed maturities and loans that exceeded sales and maturities, helping drive higher yields and net investment income in General Insurance and Life & Retirement. This quarter, consolidated net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.5 billion, up 13% from the prior year quarter and up 2% in General Insurance and 16% in Life n Retirement.\nGeneral insurance net investment income growth was negatively impacted by the sale of Validus Re which had a $5 billion portfolio. Adjusted for income on that portfolio in the prior year quarter, General Insurance net investment income rose about 7%, with a 9% increase in fixed maturities and loans driven by higher reinvestment rates.\nThis quarter, new money rates on fixed maturities and loans averaged 5.9%, 150 basis points higher than the yield on sales and maturities in the quarter. The new money rates were about 115 basis points higher in general insurance, and 165 basis points higher in Life & Retirement. The annualized yield on fixed maturities and loans, excluding calls, prepayments and other onetime items, was 3.9% in general insurance, 3 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2023 and 44 basis points higher than the prior year quarter. The sequential yield comparison in General Insurance was negatively impacted by the sale of Validus Re.\nFirst quarter General Insurance alternative investment income was $54 million or an annualized return of 5.2% this quarter, down $41 million from the prior year quarter.\nContinuing to Life & Retirement. Sales and earnings were strong this quarter. First quarter sales remained at historically high levels with premiums and deposits of $10.7 billion driven by strong sales in fixed annuities and pension risk transfer. Life & Retirement segment APTI was $991 million, up 12% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher base portfolio spread income due to higher reinvestment rates, higher fee income due to higher market levels and lower general operating expenses, partially offset by lower alternative investment income. Life & Retirement alternative investment income was negative $23 million this quarter for an annualized yield of negative 1.8% due to private equity losses and very low income on hedge funds and real estate, compared to breakeven last year.\nCorebridge's total contribution to AIG's AATI, including corporate expenses, declined by approximately $100 million or 20% over the prior year quarter due to the reduction in our ownership.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Book value per common share was $64.66 this quarter, down 1% from year-end 2023 and up 10% from the prior year quarter, driven mostly by the impact of interest rates. Adjusted book value per share was $77.79, up 1% from year-end 2023 and up 3% from the prior year quarter, reflecting the net impact of earnings, dividends and share repurchases.\nPeter covered our capital management actions year-to-date. With respect to debt leverage, consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital, excluding AOCI, which includes $9.4 billion of Corebridge debt, was 23.6% at March 31, down 70 basis points from year-end 2023. Excluding Corebridge debt on a pro forma consolidated basis, AIG debt to total capital is expected to be within the new 15% to 20% debt target range that Peter provided.\nTo conclude, AIG delivered another excellent quarter with significant financial and operational accomplishments. In 2024, AIG Next and the deconsolidation of Corebridge will drive significant progress towards achieving our 10%-plus adjusted ROCE goal. We are confident in our ability to achieve this goal and look forward to updating you on our progress.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Peter.\n\nPeter Salvatore Zaffino\n\nGlobal COO & CEO of General Insurance, American International Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sabra. And operator, we're ready for questions.",

This conference is being recorded now. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\n\nQuentin McMillan\n\nVP of Investor Relations, AIG\n\nThanks very much and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws.\nAIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change. Today's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement, and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com. Additionally, note that today's remarks will include results of AIG's life and retirement segment and other operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report.\nUntil the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial, AIG's segments and U.S. GAAP financial results, as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto, differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its earnings call on Thursday, 15 February 2024. Finally, today's remarks as they relate to net premiums written in General Insurance are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis adjusted for the international lag elimination, the sale of Crop Risk Services, and the sale of Validus Re. Please refer to the footnote on page 26 of the fourth quarter financial supplement. For prior period results for the Crop business and Validus Re. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us today to review our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more. Detail on the quarter, and some perspective on the year, and then we'll take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will join us for the Q&A portion of the call. We had a very strong fourth quarter. Which highlighted a significant year of achievements at AIG. Throughout 2023. We continue to build on our underwriting. Excellence, repositioned the portfolio through several divestitures. Made meaningful progress towards the deconsolidation of Corebridge, including three secondary sell downs, delivered.\nDisciplined premium growth in businesses where we have scale and outstanding combined ratios and continue to execute on our Balanced Capital Management strategy. I'm very proud of the work our colleagues delivered for all of our stakeholders throughout the entire year. In Q4, Adjusted After-Tax Income per diluted common share was $1.79, an increase of 29% year-over-year driven by continued strong underwriting results, 17%. Growth in net investment income and excellent execution of our Balanced Capital Management strategy that resulted in a 6% reduction in. In diluted common shares outstanding for the full year. 2023, Adjusted After-Tax Income per diluted common share was $6.79, an increase of 33% over 2022.\nAIG overall produced an adjusted return on. Common equity of 9% for the year. Up from 7% in 2022. As I will share with you today. 2023 was an extraordinary year for AIG. During my remarks this morning, I'll discuss the following topics. First, I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter financial results. Second, I will review AIG's significant accomplishments in 2023, including our strategic repositioning and our financial highlights. Sabra will comment on the Life and Retirement business in her prepared remarks. Third, I will cover insights on the. January 1 reinsurance market and specifically AIG's reinsurance renewals. Finally, I'll share some thoughts on. How we're building on our momentum and positioning the company as we enter 2024, including some specifics on AIG Next, our initiative focused on creating the AIG of the future.\nI will also discuss our capital management strategy and growth expectations. AIG's strong fourth quarter results demonstrated our. Continued execution across all aspects of our strategy. Within General Insurance, underwriting income was $642 million. Gross premiums written for the Q4 were $7.6 billion, an increase of 4% from the prior-year quarter. Net premiums written for the quarter increased by 7% from the prior year quarter to $5.7 billion. Global Commercial grew 5% and Global Personal. Grew 9% from the prior year quarter. If you exclude Financial Lines, Global Commercial. Would have grown 11%. In North America Commercial Q4 net. Premiums written grew 5% over the prior year quarter, led by Retail Property, which grew 32%, Lexington, which grew 20%.\nThese were offset by North America Financial. Lines, which was lower by 13%. In international commercial fourth quarter net premiums. Written grew 6% over the prior year. Quarter as International Property grew 28% and Talbot grew 12%. These were offset by International Financial Lines. Which was lower by 7%. In Q4. Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention. Of 86% in its in-force portfolio. As well as very strong new business performance. North America Commercial produced new business of. $503 million in the quarter, an increase of 21% year-over-year. The growth was led by Retail Casualty Lexington and Retail Property.\nInternational Commercial produced new business of $467 million for the quarter, representing an increase. Of 14% year-over-year. This growth was led by Global Specialty and Talbot. Moving to rate in North America, commercial overall rate increased 4% in the fourth. Quarter with exposure adding 3 points, and the overall pricing was up 7%.In North America Commercial expense, if you. Exclude Financial Lines and workers' compensation, overall rate would have increased 11% in the. Quarter, and with exposure adding 4 points, overall pricing would have been 15% meaningfully. Above the loss cost trend.\nNorth America Commercial rate increases were driven. By Lexington Wholesale, which was up 17%, Retail Property, which was up 19%, and Excess Casualty, which was up 13%. In international commercial, overall rate increased 3%. In Q4, with exposure adding two points, and the overall pricing was up 5%, which is slightly below loss cost trend. The rate increase was driven by property. Which was up 12%, and marine, which was up 8%. Turning to personal insurance, fourth quarter net. Premiums written increased 9% from the prior year quarter primarily driven by North America. In North America Personal net premiums written. Increased 37% in the quarter.\nAs we've seen in prior quarters. In 2023, the significant premium growth for North America Personal was driven by our High Net Worth Business, and as we discussed in prior quarters, the growth in North America earned premium continued to generate a lower expense ratio, and we expect the expense ratio will continue to improve as in 2024. Now let me turn to the full year financial results. 2023 was another year of meaningful strategic.\nRepositioning and was in many ways our best year yet. The repositioning included the disposition of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services which generated a combined $3.5 billion of proceeds including a pre-closed dividend. Additionally, we settled a $1 billion intercompany loan from Validus Re to AIG and received approximately $250 million of RenaissanceRe common stock. The changes to our portfolio further reduced. Volatility and allowed us to focus on businesses where we believe we have better opportunities for stronger risk-adjusted returns. We reshaped the reinsurance structure of our. High Net Worth Business and launched a newly formed MGA called Private Client Select.\nWe made significant progress towards Corebridge's separation, another major strategic milestone on our journey to becoming a less complex company. We completed three secondary offerings in 2023 that generated approximately $2.9 billion in cash. We worked with Corebridge on the divestiture. Of Laya Healthcare and announced the sale of the UK Life business in 2023. AIG received $1.4 billion of capital from Corebridge through $385 million of regular dividends, $688 million of special dividends, and $315. Million of share repurchases at the end of 2023. Our ownership stake in Corebridge was.. Approximately 52% in 2023. We continue to execute on a thoughtful and balanced capital management strategy. During the year, AIG returned $4 billion of capital to shareholders through $3 billion of share repurchases and $1 billion of dividends.\nWe reduced our common shares outstanding by. 6% and increased quarterly dividends by 12.5%. On 1 August, the AIG board of. Directors increased our share buyback authorization to $7.5 billion. At year-end 2023, we had $6.2 billion remaining on that authorization. We reduced AIG net debt by $1.4 billion. Billion in 2023 after successfully conducting a senior notes tender offer in November. We finished 2023 with very strong parent liquidity of $7.6 billion, which gives us. Ample capacity to continue executing on our capital management. Turning to the full year results for General Insurance. Throughout 2023, we delivered terrific financial performance.\nGeneral Insurance full year underwriting income was. $2.3 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year. For the full year, the General Insurance. Accident Year Combined Ratio excluding catastrophes was 87.7%, an improvement of 100 basis points year-over-year. Global Commercial achieved an accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes of 83.3% for the full year, an improvement of 120 basis points. Points year-over-year driven by loss ratio improvement. The Calendar Year Combined Ratio was 87.1%. A 250 basis points improvement year-over-year excluding Validus Re and Crop Risk Services for the full year. Results the Global Commercial accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes would have increased by.\n50 basis points to 83.8% and the. Calendar Year Combined Ratio would have increased. By slightly over 20 basis points to 87.3%. In Global Personal, the full year accident. Year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 99.3%. In line with the prior year. For the full year, General Insurance grew. Net premiums written by 7% year-over-year, driven by 5% growth in Global Commercial and 10% in personal insurance. North America Commercial grew 5% and International. Commercial grew 6% year-over-year.\nA couple of highlights. Lexington and Global Specialty had outstanding years. We remain very focused on these businesses. Made investments to accelerate growth and continue to deliver strong underwriting profitability. Lexington grew its net premiums written by. 17% year-over-year. Growth was driven by historically high retention. Which was 80%, $1 billion of new business, and rate increases of approximately 18%. Global Specialty, which includes businesses in marine, energy, Trade Credit, and aviation, grew its. Net Premiums Written 10% year-over-year. Driven by 88% retention, almost $750 million. Of new business, and rate increases of.7% for the year. Also, there are two parts of our.Business that impacted growth in Global Commercial.\nWhich, I would like to offer some perspective. First, if you Financial Lines, our. Net premiums written growth would have been 10%. Second, as we've outlined on prior calls, we decided to non-renew two programs. That had significant property catastrophe exposure that no longer met our underwriting guidelines. We did not believe that the premium. Increases on a risk-adjusted basis for these two programs delivered an acceptable return. The decision to non-renew impacted the. Gross and net premiums written for Lexington specifically as well as the global commercial business throughout 2023.\nIf you Financial Lines and these two programs that I just mentioned, our year-over-year net premiums written growth would have been 13%, which gives you a sense as to why we have significant confidence in our core portfolio where we saw meaningful overall growth for the year. It's worth providing a little bit more. Detail on Financial Lines. In Financial Lines, particularly in our Public Directors and Officers ook of business, we continue to exercise underwriting discipline by maintaining our primary position in our portfolio and being very prudent on large account excess layers where there's significant exposure to vertical loss. These layers are highly commoditized where. Typically the best price wins.\nWe've spoken about the cumulative rate change. In Financial Lines before, but I want to provide a little bit more detail. The compound annual growth rate for financial. Lines achieved from 2019 through 2023 was 49%. If you exclude 2023, the compound annual. Growth rate was 63%. It's a business we're very focused on, and our underwriters are continuing to carefully. Monitor market conditions and underwrite conservatively. Now I'd like to provide you with some insight into the current reinsurance market generally, and an overview of our January 1 reinsurance renewals. As I mentioned on previous calls, AIG's.\nReinsurance purchasing is deliberately weighted to January 1, which enables us to strategically optimize the outcome across our reinsurance placements and provides us with clarity on our cost of reinsurance at the beginning of the year. Before I go into detail on this year's outcomes, I want to speak about how we evaluate our reinsurance purchased. We've seen significant changes in the global property market over the last two years, and analyzing and quantifying changes in a portfolio's risk profile has become increasingly complex.\nCurrently, one of the most overused phrases has been used with more frequency. In the last year is risk adjusted pricing or risk adjusted rate changes, which have multiple interpretations, particularly when it comes to property treaty reinsurance. Calculating the risk adjusted rate change can. Be complicated and is often inconsistent. Want to outline how AIG determines risk. Adjusted pricing changes, which we believe is an industry best practice. To begin, you must determine the baseline structure and all the variables required to assess and quantify the risk-adjusted pricing change.\nTo do that, the base analysis should. Be set at the identical structure and coverage, with the exact terms and conditions of the prior year structure. The analysis needs to compare the cost. Of capital year-over-year, and any model changes from vendor model output such as RMS to determine if the loss costs have increased or decreased at the attachment point and the vertical limits deployed. Also, an analysis is needed for any changes to the coverage provided in the treaty placement. For instance, over the last few years. Many programs have gone from an all-risk coverage basis to a named or peak peril basis.\nTo correctly calculate the risk adjusted rate change, perils no longer covered need to be analyzed and priced separately, and the impact of any reduced coverage should be factored into the assessment of the price change. This can be particularly difficult when assessing. Perils that would not be economically viable to place on a standalone basis with. Significant limits, which could include wildfire, flood, or terrorism. There needs to be consideration given to. The volatility associated with the expected loss in calculating the risk adjusted rate change.\nGiven the complexity of these calculations, the Methodologies applied should be done with consistency and discipline when applying the methodology I just described. AIG had a tremendous outcome with our reinsurance partners at the January 1 renewal. Season, building upon the very strong result. Achieved in a very challenging market in 2023. Now let me turn to AIG's reinsurance renewals at January 1 of this year. To level set the natural catastrophe. Insured loss activity remained at the forefront of the market with a record-setting 37 events in 2023 that exceed a billion dollars of insured loss.\nThese events contributed to a total annual. Insured loss currently estimated at over $100 billion, marking the sixth time in the past seven years that insured loss from natural catastrophes has exceeded $100 billion. Over the last seven years, there's been. Nearly $1 trillion of aggregate losses, with over 60% driven by secondary perils. The headline is that we were able. To significantly improve our property cat structure and reinsurance coverage provided when you review what we purchased last year, including for Validus Re. The overall spend has reduced by approximately. $200 million and our core property treaties excluding Validus Re have slightly lower ceded premium year-over-year.\nLet's start with our property catastrophe placements. Our core commercial North America retention of. $500 million remained unchanged for the second straight year. The attachment on our dedicated Lexington occurrence. Tower was unchanged at $300 million. In both cases, the model detachment point. Is lower and the exhaust limit is higher. Our international property CAT per occurrence structures. Renewed with a reduced retention in Japan to $150 million, a $50 million improvement from the prior year. The rest of the world attachment remains unchanged at $125 million. We were very pleased to have achieved. Broader coverage across all of our core occurrence towers, with nominal attachment points unchanged.\nIn the case of Japan, decreasing the model probability of attaching. Our CAT reinsurance improved with respect to key perils, and across every major territory. Following the growth achieved in the property portfolio in 2023. Our property cat aggregate cover was also. Successfully renewed with improved coverage, further reducing. Our volatility from frequency of loss, the aggregate now includes a standalone sub. Limit dedicated to losses in North America arising from secondary perils. Importantly, it also now covers contributing losses. From our high net worth portfolio.\nOur annual aggregate deductible for North America is $825 million. The North America other perils deductible is. $350 million, which is a new deductible, and Japan and the rest of the world deductibles are $200 million and $175 million, respectively. These are subject to each and every loss deductibles of $20 million. Other than for North America wind and arthquake, which are at $50 million. Our return period attachment point is lower year-over-year for all of our. Major proportional treaties across a range of classes. We improved or maintained our ceding commission levels, reflecting our market-leading underwriting expertise. Position in the market.\nTurning to casualty, the challenges we've spoken. About previously regarding the impact of inflation. Both social and economic, and litigation funding. In the U.S,. we were a focal point for reinsurers at 1/1 for casualty. At AIG, we remain very focused on our underwriting standards and the positioning of the portfolio. Our team has done a terrific job of re-underwriting the entire business, particularly considering the amount of work that was needed to reposition it to where it is today. Additionally, our pricing assumptions today have loss trends ranging from the high single digits to over 10%.\nThese were increased over the past two years. Given inflationary dynamics, I do want to make a few comments about the last 10 years of casualty results for the industry. The industry as a whole has reported meaningful reserve releases in four of the past 10 calendar years, including in calendar year 2017. At the same time, there have been six years of significant reported industry strengthening.\nIn the last 10 calendar years, including in all of the most recent five calendar years focusing on AIG for accident years 2016 through 2019, our initial loss picks in our casualty lines, excluding workers compensation, averaged 78%. Looking specifically at accident years 2016 and 2017, the initial loss picks were approximately 81% in both years. These loss picks exclude unallocated loss adjustment expense. We significantly strengthened the reserves by over. A billion dollars for accident years 2016 through 2019, which revised our year-end ultimate loss picks to 91% in 2016, 96% in 2017, and an average of 87% over accident years 2016 through 2019.\nTo further analyze how our casualty results. Compared to industry results for other liability in commercial auto, using the most recent Schedule P data, they are well above the average industry loss picks on both measures. Our initial and year end ultimates for. Both lines are roughly 10–20 points higher than the overall industry average. In addition, we have reinsurance in place for 2016 and 2017 to mitigate our gross results. As we outlined last quarter, we put. A comprehensive reinsurance treaty in place starting in 2018 provides us with a substantial amount of vertical protection.\nOur renewal of the casualty reinsurance protections allowed us to maintain the same net. Retained lines with no impact on ceding commissions, which is an outstanding outcome. At January 1, our reinsurance partners maintained their significant support of AIG with consistent. Capacity and improved reinsurance terms that demonstrate. A clear recognition of the quality of our portfolio, and our underwriting teams.\nI'll now turn to discuss our efforts. To create a future state business structure for AIG post deconsolidation of Corebridge. As part of this effort, we've launched a new program, AIG Next, to create a company that's leaner, less complex, and more effective with the appropriate infrastructure and capabilities for the size of business we will be post deconsolidation. AIG Next will focus on the following: driving global consistency and local relevancy across our end-to-end processes to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness, reducing organizational complexity to create a better and differentiated experience for our clients and colleagues, creating an agile and scalable organization to support business growth.\nOptimizing our ecosystem to modernize our data analytics, digital, and technology capabilities. Clarifying roles, responsibilities, while eliminating duplication and increasing speed of execution, as we've stated in the past, we expect the simplification and efficiencies created. Through this program to generate $500 million. Of sustained annual run rate savings and to incur approximately $500 million of one-time spend to achieve these savings as part of AIG Next, we are creating a leaner parent company with a target cost structure of 1%–1.5% net premiums earned. Some of the current costs and other operations will be eliminated, contributing to the $500 million savings, and others will be moved into the business where the service is utilized in 2023.\nWe began this work as we've moved. Approximately $140 million of expenses from other operations into General Insurance for services that are more closely aligned to our business operations. Even with this shift, the full year combined ratio of 90.6% improved 130 basis points year-over-year, and the full year GOE ratio only increased 40 basis points due to offsetting savings within General Insurance. Throughout the year, we built efficiencies into our business, which have allowed General Insurers.\nTo absorb these costs. We've already begun to make meaningful progress. Against our $500 million savings target, we have established a team to drive and govern the AIG Next program with focus and discipline. Sabra and I will provide more detail on next quarter's call regarding the specific cost to achieve by category, and the expected timeline for the realized benefits in 2024 and 2025.\nAs we are approaching the final steps. Of the Corebridge deconsolidation, we remain agile and continue to explore all options based on market conditions with respect to our remaining ownership of Corebridge, always focusing on what's aligned with the best interest of our stakeholders. Sabra will take you through a pro forma capital structure based on assumptions about the deconsolidation throughout 2024. We expect to continue to execute the capital management strategy we've outlined before.\nOur insurance company subsidiaries continue to have. Excess capital to support the type of organic growth we have seen through 2023. We would expect to see in the future. We've made enormous progress on our debt structure and maturities. Since year end 2021, we've reduced over. 50% of AIG's debt outstanding, which is over $11 billion of debt reduction. The primary focus in 2024 will be. On returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Since the start of 2024, we have. Repurchased an additional $760 million of common shares. We expect to continue at this pace for the first half of 2024, subject.\nTo market conditions, which should bring us near the high end of our target share count range. Post Corebridge deconsolidation, we should achieve. The low end of our range, which is approximately 600 million of common shares. The AIG board increased the dividend in. 2023, reflecting our confidence in the future earnings power of AIG. We will continue to evaluate our. Dividend policy in 2024. Lastly, as I enter my seventh. Year at AIG, I've never been more optimistic about our opportunities for growth and the momentum that AIG has. Entering 2024, we now have a terrific business.\nGlobal Commercial, which we've been working on. For years to reposition, is now one of the most respected portfolios in the industry. While there's always pruning to do in any business, the remediation is now behind us. We're well positioned to grow based on AIG, strong retention, strong opportunities for new business, excellent combined ratios, and a company that has been able to distinguish itself among our clients and distribution partners.In personal insurance, we will continue to.Make investments, particularly in our Japan business, our global A&H business, and our High Net Worth Business where we anticipate continued growth and more importantly, profitability improvement. With that, I will turn the call over to Sabra.\n\nSabra Purtill\n\nCFO, AIG\n\nThank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide more detail on AIG's fourth quarter results. But first, as we are getting closer to Corebridge deconsolidation, I would like to start with an illustrative pro forma. With AIG's current ownership of Corebridge at 52%, the next transaction may likely result in deconsolidation. Today, Corebridge is consolidated in both AIG's balance sheet and income statement with offsets to non-controlling interests for the portion that AIG does not own. You can see those adjustments in the financial supplement on pages 8 and 11. When we deconsolidate, we will report Corebridge as an investment with dividends reported in net investment income and Corebridge shares included in parent investments.\nCorebridge's balance sheet and income statement will no longer be in our financials if we were able to deconsolidate Corebridge now. Accounting rules require us to fair value their assets and liabilities and recognize the net difference between that valuation and the current GAAP carrying value in AIG's equity. That process also includes some changes, primarily driven by differences in basis and deconsolidation of variable investment entities. The example I will provide is a hypothetical pro forma view. Please remember that there are many factors, and each one impacts the output. This view builds on the remarks I provided last quarter about pro forma adjusted shareholders' equity. For simplicity, in this example we used Corebridge's current stock price as a proxy for fair value.\nBut the process is more complicated than that, and is more dependent on interest rates than stock price, as the investment portfolio has to be valued on the day of deconsolidation, which will change based on interest rates. As a very high level illustration, as of year-end, the fair value of Corebridge's net assets and liabilities was about $2 billion higher than the book value on AIG's balance sheet. As a result, deconsolidation would have increased AIG's book value per share by almost $3 a share. However, for AIG's adjusted shareholders' equity, the fair value adjustment would have resulted in a reduction of about $4 billion, or around $6 per AIG share, given Corebridge's stock price relative to its adjusted book value.\nNow let me link these items to the AIG year-end pro forma estimate that I provided last quarter of adjusted shareholders' equity of approximately $33 billion, adjusted for the sale of Validus Re, to be used in evaluating the ROCE target.\nAt 31 December 2023, AIG's adjusted shareholders equity was approximately $53 billion. With the pro forma fair value decrease of $4 billion at deconsolidation, adjusted shareholders equity would be roughly $49 billion, including about $8 billion of value for our Corebridge shares. To get to the E, we subtract the value of Corebridge shares, and for the purposes of this exercise today, we also subtract year-end parent liquidity of almost $8 billion, most of which is to be used for 2024 capital management, interest, and other parent expenses as Peter described. That results in pro forma adjusted shareholders equity of about $33 billion invested in our business, plus whatever liquidity is at the parent as the focus of our 10%+ target. This example is illustrative based on year-end financials and subject to change based on markets and the actual path to deconsolidation.\nI hope it is helpful. Now I will turn to fourth quarter results.\nFourth quarter consolidated net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.5 billion, up 17% over the fourth quarter of 2022. General insurance net investment income was 38%, while life and retirement was up 15%. Higher new money reinvestment rates in both businesses drove the improvement. Fourth quarter new money rates on fixed maturities and loans averaged 6.5%, about 180 basis points higher than the yield on sales and maturities in the quarter. Fourth quarter new money rates were 160 basis points higher in GI and 190 basis points higher in LNR, with higher reinvestment rates. The yield on General insurance fixed maturities and loans excluding calls and prepayments rose to an annualized yield of 3.8% in the quarter, up from 3.0% in Q4 2022 and up 9 basis points sequentially. LR's fourth quarter portfolio yield was 5.0% compared to 4.4% in Q4 2022 and up 10 basis points sequentially.\nIn the first half of 2024, we currently expect continued yield pickup on fixed maturities over the prior year, but less improvement sequentially given the cessation of Fed interest rate hikes and the current. Shape of the yield curve.\nIn contrast, alternative investment returns were weak this year, coming in slightly negative in the fourth quarter and at only 2.4% for the full year. GI alternative income was $41 million in the fourth quarter, down 11% from the prior year quarter, for an annualized return of 3.9%. LR's alternative portfolio generated a loss of $24 million in the quarter for an annualized yield of -1.8% compared to income of $16 million last year.\nTurning to general insurance, as Peter said, our underwriting results remain very strong. The Q4 2023 calendar year combined ratio was 89.1%, 80 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2022, and the accident year combined ratio x Cats was 87.9%, 50 basis points better. Global Commercial Lines delivered outstanding fourth quarter results with a calendar year combined ratio of 85.4%, a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year. The accident year combined ratio x Cats was 82.4%, a 170 basis point improvement, reflecting exceptional underwriting profitability in both North America and International.\nThe fourth quarter included only one month of Validus Re due to the timing of the divestiture. Excluding Validus Re from fourth quarter results, the pro forma Global Commercial lines calendar year combined ratio would have been 85%. 30 basis points lower than reported. The accident year combined ratio x CATS would have been 82.5%, only 10 basis points higher.\nThe fourth quarter calendar year combined ratio for global personal insurance was 98.8%, 90 basis points better than Q4 2022. The accident year combined ratio Xcats was 101.8%, 140 basis points higher, driven by the repositioning of the High Net Worth Business, which made significant progress in 2023. Fourth quarter underwriting income for GI was $642 million, up slightly from $635 million in Q4 2022, as improved accident year results including catastrophe losses were offset by lower favorable prior year development net of reinsurance and prior year premiums. Catastrophe losses totaled $126 million in the quarter, down from $235 million last year. The largest event was Hurricane Otis in Mexico. For the fourth quarter and the year, catastrophe losses excluding Validus Re would have been $111 million and $937 million, respectively.\nFavorable prior year development totaled $69 million in the fourth quarter compared to $151 million. Million doll. Including the impact of prior year premiums, the total impact of prior year loss reserve development was favorable by $37 million compared to favorable development of $150 million in Q4 2022. Fourth quarter net favorable development this quarter includes $41 million of ADC gain amortization, and $28 million of net favorable development from annual DVRs and other reserve reviews, particularly prior year catastrophes. The $28 million included $75 million in additional reserves for Russia, Ukraine related claims, offset by net favorable development on shorter tail lines and older catastrophes.\nTurning to LNR, fourth quarter results were solid, especially considering the continued headwinds from alternative investment returns. Fourth quarter APTI was $957 million, up 12% over the prior year, driven by base spread expansion, strong sales, and growth in assets under management and administration. Base net investment spreads in individual and group retirement together widened 23 basis points in the quarter. Fourth quarter premiums and deposits were $10.6 billion, up 20% from Q4 2022.\nFor the fourth quarter, Corebridge's earnings included in AIG adjusted after tax income decreased by about 25% due to the reduction in AIG ownership from 78% last year to 52% as of year end. For the full year, Corebridge earnings and our adjusted after tax income declined 20%. Turning to other operations, fourth quarter 2023 adjusted pre tax loss improved by $52 million from Q4 2022 due to a $72 million reduction in AIG general operating expenses. Total other operations GOE was $242 million for the quarter, including $61 million for Corebridge. On a consolidated basis, AIG's fourth quarter adjusted after tax income rose 21% to $1.3 billion, driven by 19% growth in General Insurance APTI. The annualized adjusted return on common equity was 9.4% for the quarter, almost 2 points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022.\nMoving to the balance sheet, book value per common share ended the year at $65.14, up 18% from year end 2022, and up 16% from 30 September, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates. Adjusted book value per share was $76.65 at year end, up 1% from year end 2022, and down 2% from 30 September, reflecting the net impact of income, dividends, share repurchases, and Corebridge secondary sales. At 31 December, AIG's consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital, excluding AOCI, was 24.3%, down 1.3 points from year end 2022. With first quarter 2024 debt reduction, leverage is likely to be at the low end of our 20%–25% range upon deconsolidation.\nAs Peter noted, we made substantial progress towards our 10%+ ROCE goal this year 2023. Full year adjusted ROCE for AIG was 9.0% compared to 7.1% in 2022, and was 12.5% in General Insurance and 11.5% in LNR. The actions to reach 10% or greater will be driven by the four levers we have discussed before, including AIG Next. We are confident in our ability to achieve this goal, subject to market conditions, and look forward to updating you on our progress. With that, I will turn the call. Back over to Peter.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThank you.Sabra, Michelle, we're ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one one. If your question has been answered and you'd like to remove yourself from the queue, please press star one one. Again, our first question comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Zaremski\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks. Maybe first on the expense ratio. I appreciate the color, Peter, you gave us on the continued improvement. Anything, it looks like this quarter specifically though it took, it was a bit higher than expected. Anything we should be thinking about or, you know, I don't know if it's profit share given the excellent loss ratio or just anything, any noise in there or seasonality.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThanks Mike. We outlined in my script that the business has been taking a lot of additional costs. Think about cyber and usage on the cloud, and that might have been held centrally in the past. That has now been put into the business, and you see that they're absorbing most of it. There is some timing on that. Also, in personal insurance, there is a lot of noise in the quarter. There are some one-time true-up adjustments. There is also some profit sharing, as you mentioned, in some of our personal insurance businesses, and there was also some catch-up on some of the reinsurance on earned premiums. I'm not concerned at all about the uptick in expenses. It was very nominal.\nWhen I look at what the business has actually absorbed in terms of increased costs year-over-year, they've really built capacity to be able to invest in the future. The fourth quarter reflected that. There was a little bit of noise as well, particularly on the personal insurance side.\n\nMichael Zaremski\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nOkay, great. My final follow up is specifically on the accident year loss ratio. Validus is property centric and it's going to be kind of fully out of the numbers next quarter. You talked about non renewing some property throughout the year, and you know I understand Financial Lines has got a lot of pricing, but financial pricing is, it isn't, you know, isn't great trailing 12 month basis. Just on the underlying loss ratio, given just all the dynamics, should we be thinking about any, should we be thinking about any material changes to the underlying loss ratio as the year progresses given the moving parts?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nI don't think so. I think the accident year loss ratio that we finished the year is what I would expect in 2024. Like you said, there's always mix of business changes, there's always a little bit of noise. There could be some shift in composition. As you mentioned, property, we think we have tremendous opportunities there based on having five or six entry points across the world in terms of getting the best risk adjusted returns. When I look at what we've done in property over the last five years, we've gone from combined ratios in North America that are well north of 130 combined into the 70s and 80s now. I think we have a really good platform. We're able to scale up businesses when we see opportunities.\nI would think absent big mix of business changes, I would not expect any changes in the loss ratio. I signaled on the call that, you know, the remediation is largely behind us. I mean, again, you're always going to be re-underwriting, but you know, large programs or, you know, portions of the business in commercial. We really like what we have, and think that there's real good opportunities for growth.\n\nMichael Zaremski\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThanks Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.\n\nMeyer Shields\n\nManaging Director and PNC Insurance Analyst, KWD\n\nGreat, thanks. One quick question just to make sure I understand it. You talked about pricing assumptions for casualty. Assuming loss trends of either high single digits or low teens, does that match the loss trends embedded in the reserves?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nGood morning, Meyer. Sabra, do you want to talk about the reserves commensurate to the increase in premium, sorry, an increase in rate change, particularly on excess?\n\nSabra Purtill\n\nCFO, AIG\n\nYes, we've talked about it in the past. We've taken a proactive approach to trying to react quickly to bad news that we see in trends. As you know, even back in 2017, we moved to increase the reserves on casualty lines. Our underlying assumptions for casualty loss trend is in the 10% range. It does vary between primary and excess. Our book historically has been a little bit more balanced towards excess, and that's why you can see some of the changes in the loss ratios accident year by accident year.\nI would note that we do our. Deeper dive on the casualty lines largely in the third quarter. There's some that are in the second quarter, and we did complete those reserves this year without any meaningful changes in the reserves.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nOne other observation there on that is that, you know, the rates as we got to the back half of the year and casualty, particularly in excess casualty, started to accelerate into double digits. Also, not that this is a bellwether because there's different mix of business, but our casualty submissions in Lexington in the fourth quarter were up 100%, which just means it's getting harder to get casualty placements done in the admitted market. Pricing's going up, driven by rate, terms and conditions are being tightened, and there's more activity in ENS.\n\nMeyer Shields\n\nManaging Director and PNC Insurance Analyst, KWD\n\nOkay, fantastic. That's very helpful. Second question, I guess maybe jumping off from that. I guess I'm a little surprised that there's still, if I understand correctly, the same level of proportional sessions on North America casualty despite the fact that overall profitability has gotten so much better, and higher interest rates. I was hoping you could take us through your thinking on that.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nSure. Look at our casualty placements have evolved over time to reflect the portfolio, the gross limit deployment. If I could take you back to even 2016 and 2017, where we had quota shares before we arrived, we had a 50% quota share on primary casualty, and then we had a 37.5% placement on excess casualty. That's just continued to evolve as we got into 2018, where we bought large excess loss placements for our worldwide casualty portfolio for 75, exit 25. At the end of 2018, we bought a 50% quota share for our casualty portfolio within the United States. The reason why I just give you that as a baseline is we've changed, evolved. We've had reinsurance in place since 2016, but when you look at what we place on the quota share today, it's basically 20%.\nWe've taken that down while we've improved ceding commissions over 800 basis points from the original placement to 20% from, you know, north of 50. I think we have been recognizing, you know, that we don't need to do as much proportional, but there's a balance in those placements between the excess and the quota share partnerships with reinsurers. They like a balance between the excess loss and quota share in terms of our underwriting, and feel very comfortable that that's a good amount to cede off for looking at our overall casualty portfolio.\n\nMeyer Shields\n\nManaging Director and PNC Insurance Analyst, KWD\n\nOkay, that's very helpful. Thank you so much.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nElyse Greenspan\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks. Good morning. My first question was on the, you know, equity that you laid out, Sabra. So $33 billion pro forma adjusted equity. I believe you said parent liquidity would come on top of that. Can you just give us a sense of, you know, once you're through deconsolidation, what type of liquidity you would like to have in parent? I'm assuming it would be $33 billion plus. The parent liquidity would be the equity that we should consider in reference to the double digit plus ROCE target.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThanks, Elyse. I'll turn it over to Sabra in two seconds. I just want to caution us that we tried to outline what we expect shareholders' equity with a variety of different variables, but it was all pro forma. I think Sabra can answer the question sort of technically as to how we should be looking about our capital relative to how we get to the 10% ROC. I just don't want to go into too many more variables because that was the pro forma that had a lot of assumptions. Sabra.\n\nSabra Purtill\n\nCFO, AIG\n\nYes, certainly. Look, we have a framework around our liquidity position, and clearly, given the timing of the Corebridge secondaries and the Validus sale in the fourth quarter, parent liquidity was at very attractive and high levels at year end. The way we think of it in a normal framework is we look at what our forward holding company needs are. Think about common dividend payments of roughly $1 billion a year, AIG-only interest expense roughly $500 million a year, and then parent expenses, which, as we've talked about, we're focused on getting those down to a 1% to 1.5% of NPE range. That's what we think about in terms of a normal liquidity position, which is lower, obviously, than where we ended the year.\n\nElyse Greenspan\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks. My second question, appreciate all the color on the call on premium growth rate. I think it was around 9% in the quarter, kind of ex Validus and Crop, and so, you know, as we think about the moving pieces and just your view of price, loss trend, etc., would you expect, you know, top line growth kind of on an adjusted basis, you know, to be within that range in 2024? Are there other things that we should consider?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nWell, when you take out again there's a lot of moving pieces, but you take out Validus Crop Risk Services, and so we have a baseline. Then when we look at our commercial portfolio, I look at the fundamentals, Elyse, in terms of how are we growing the business. We gave you highlights in the fourth quarter about our new business, which was simply terrific, and that momentum continues. Our retentions have been fantastic. It's a portfolio that we have done such a great job to get to a place where we really like and find opportunities for stability and more growth. Agree on the rate. The fourth quarter was just a moment, but we would Financial Lines in 2024 not to keep up at the same pace on excess.\nWe'll see as we get into the market, but really like the opportunities in our core businesses to drive growth. Lexington, I know there's been a lot of discussion in this quarter around is excess and surplus lines slowing down, things going back to the admitted, there's no evidence to suggest that's true. Again, submission count is significantly up, and it's not just property. Property if I looked at the fourth. Quarter was the lowest submission count growth, and that was up over 30%. As I said, property is around 30%, casualty was up over 100%, and healthcare was around 50%. There's a lot more opportunity to continue to grow in excess and surplus lines.\nYou know, with the property market.You get to, you know, the second quarter and there's your opportunity. Like we have built a reinsurance structure, we built a gross, you know, portfolio that we can flex depending on market conditions. I mentioned global specialty. We think there's growth opportunities there, we think there's growth opportunities in our personal insurance business. We are cautious but optimistic that the growth rate that you outlined in the high single digits is going to be achieved. Again, we have to be in the year and we'll give you updates every quarter, but we're optimistic.\n\nElyse Greenspan\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks, Peter.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Mike Ward with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nMike Ward\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst in Equity Research, Citi\n\nThanks guys. Good morning. Maybe kind of similar question, but specifically on international, I think rate is a little below loss costs. I was just wondering if you have any commentary on how you see the top line growth there playing out.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG",
    "content2": "Good morning, Mike. Thanks for the question.\nIf I look at International on the rate side, just a reminder that we do rate on gross premium written, not net. As you take that from the portfolio, there's a heavy weighting of our specialty business in the fourth quarter. The specialty business does have a lot of quota shares and has a terrific reinsurance partnership. It's almost 50% of the business, roughly between 40%–50% in the quarter. Specialty, while it had good rate increase in marine, Political Risk had a weighting on rate in the quarter, as well as Financial Lines. Financial Lines, about 20% of the gross premium written in the quarter, and having a negative, you know, that just weights the overall rate environment. We had very strong rate in property.\nWe had very good rate, as I. Mentioned in my prepared remarks, of 8% in marine. Yeah, the overall index was at or perhaps slightly below loss cost trend. It's not something we're concerned about. The other thing too in specialty you should realize is that 1 December is when all aviation renews. That was low single digits. Again, waiting on it. It's mix of business, it's gross. Why I say gross is that when you take the gross to net for our specialty business, it's basically 50% net premium written to gross.\nLike, you know, we, you. Know, put that in the math in terms of our ceding commissions and, you know, profitability of the portfolio. Overall, you know, we were pleased and think that, you know, there's opportunities to improve that in 2024.\n\nMike Ward\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst in Equity Research, Citi\n\nThanks, Peter. Maybe just on the adverse PYD in Russia, Ukraine, is that related to aviation, and is that just accident year 2022? I think there was some adverse in other 2020 and 2019.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nSara, do you want to provide a little bit of update in terms of how we got to the adverse?\n\nSabra Purtill\n\nCFO, AIG\n\nSure. I'll just start by overall, as I mentioned, we did have some favorable prior year development from older catastrophe years. Those were basically in years 2018 through 2020. If you look at the more recent accident years, as we indicated, we did put up $75 million of additional reserves related to Russia and Ukraine related claims. We've been evaluating our exposure. For some time and based on the analysis where we are at the end of the year, we felt it was appropriate to increase our reserves for the quarter. I would also note that in the 2022 accident year, we did have some adverse development on Winter Storm Elliott, which was at the very tail end. Of the fourth quarter of 2022.\nIn the older accident years, as I said, in general, we netted to a favorable reserve development. We did have some adverse development in the 2018 and 2019 accident years on some mergers and acquisitions related exposures.\n\nMike Ward\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst in Equity Research, Citi\n\nThanks, Sabra.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThank you, Sabra.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Meredith\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nYeah, thanks. First question, I'm just curious. As we look at this, you're getting close to the 600 million kind of share count as we think about that, and the use of proceeds from Corebridge. Are you willing to go kind of meaningfully below that? If not, what is the other kind of potential uses of capital here that you're thinking about to mitigate dilution from selling down your remaining interest in Corebridge?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThank you, Brian. It's a good question. It's a little leading, but we had outlined the capital management strategy for the first six months, and that gets us below the $650 million share count at a base assumption of a stock price around where we are now. There are a few variables that could accelerate that or slow it down, depending on market conditions and share price. We know we have the liquidity, and we just wanted to outline what we thought we would do within the first six months. The next is dependent upon when we do a secondary sell down, which I would expect before the end of the second quarter, another sell down, which gives us more liquidity. The primary focus is going to be on share repurchase and dividend payment.\nBelieve that we can then get by the end of the year down to the lower end of the range. The 600 million. Once we're closer to that, we feel like we've made enormous progress on all the elements of our capital management strategy. It has been very balanced, and believe we would have to give guidan ce after that in terms of what we intend to do. I kind of want to get to the range first in the $6–$650, and then get to the lower end of the range with proceeds, and then we would provide additional guidance.\n\nBrian Meredith\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks. That's helpful. Peter, just want to chat. Briefly on Financial Lines business. It seems like everybody's Financial Lines. I'm just kind of wondering, like who is actually running the business, and do we think we're getting closer to a bottom here, and do you think that's still a significant headwind to 2024 premium growth?\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nThank you, Brian, for the question. I've been trying to find a way to bring in McElroy to close it out. Dave, why don't you give Brian some insight and then, you know, we'll. Send it back to me, and we'll finish up.\n\nDavid McElroy\n\nChairman, AIG\n\nThank you, Brian. Thank you, Peter. Yeah, honestly, Brian, you know, you see the weighting of Financial Lines in our portfolio.\nIt's a bit of an outside influence, but, you know, we've also gone through the year and I think we trade the market we're in, not the market we hope for. I think we've been prudent around letting excess underpriced P$O business go. I think we've been good about holding onto our primary business. I think that actually has held up well. I also think that it's always worth understanding there's a lot of other products in the portfolio, and they've held up well, whether that's private company business, Professional Indemnity, or the Fidelity businesses. Those are strong, and we actually anticipate those will continue to hold up in 2024. Okay.\nThe, you know, the seminal event is 2023 showed up with different securities class action experience than the 2020 to 2022 cohort year. It actually looks more like 2016 to 2019. The question will be whether the industry reacts to that. Okay.\nMuch more severity flowing through that year. It obviously exposes the verticality of loss. I do think it's put a little bit of a floor on the market going into 2024. We're seeing that. We're seeing that now. There's definitely going to be more control in primary, but I'm not going to be. You know, we won't sit on the front cover of CNBC or sitting in the middle of CNBC, but we like the business, we like the pricing of the business, and we also think that it's tethered to the economy as that shows up. That will also help with new business opportunities that we see both in M and A, both in IPOs, and both in structures. It is the first time in three years that I might give it a little bit of optimism.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nPeter, thanks Dave. Thank you very much, and thanks, Brian. Thank you, everyone, for coming to the earnings call today. I greatly appreciate the engagement, and I want to thank all of our colleagues around the world for all they've done to progress the strategic progress that we've made and just have delivered tremendous results. Everybody have a great day, and thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.\n\n[Video Narrator]\n\nVideo Narrator\n\nSa\n\nOperator\n\nGood day and welcome to AIG's fourth quarter 2023 financial results conference call. This conference is being recorded now. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\n\nQuentin McMillan\n\nVP of Investor Relations, AIG\n\nThanks very much and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change. Today's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement, and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com. Additionally, note that today's remarks will include results of AIG's Life and Retirement segment and other operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is.\nHow we expect to continue to report. Until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial, AIG segments and U.S. GAAP financial results, as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto, differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its earnings call on Thursday, 15 February 2024. Finally, today's remarks, as they relate to net premiums written in General Insurance, are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis adjusted for the international lag elimination, the sale of Crop Risk Services, and the sale of Validus Re. Please refer to the footnote on page 26 of the fourth quarter financial supplement. For prior period results for the crop business and Validus Re. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Zaffino\n\nChairman and CEO, AIG\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more. Detail on the quarter and some perspective on the year, and then we'll take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will join us for the Q and A portion of the call. We had a very strong fourth quarter.\nWhich highlighted a significant year of achievements at AIG. Throughout 2023, we continue to build on our underwriting excellence, repositioned the portfolio through several divestitures, made meaningful progress towards the deconsolidation of Corebridge, including three secondary sell downs, deliver disciplined premium growth in businesses where we have scale, outstanding combined ratios, and continue to execute on our balanced capital management strategy.\nI'm very proud of the work our. Colleagues delivered for all of our stakeholders throughout the entire year. In the fourth quarter, adjusted after-tax income per diluted common share was $1.79, an increase of 29% year-over-year. Driven by continued strong underwriting results, 17% growth in net investment income, and excellent execution of our Balanced Capital management strategy that resulted in a 6% reduction in diluted common shares outstanding for the full year 2023. Adjusted after-tax income per diluted common share was $6.79, an increase of 33% over 2022.\nAIG overall produced an adjusted return on.Common equity of 9% for the year. Up from 7% in 2022. As I will share with you today, 2023 was an extraordinary year for AIG. During my remarks this morning, I'll discuss the following topics. First, I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter financial results. Second, I will review AIG's significant accomplishments. In 2023, including our strategic repositioning and our financial highlights. Sabra will comment on the Life and Retirement. Business in her prepared remarks. Third, I will cover insights on the January 1 reinsurance market, and specifically AIG's reinsurance renewals.\nFinally, I'll share some thoughts on. How we're building on our momentum and positioning the company as we enter 2024. Including some specifics on AIG. Next, our initiative focused on creating the AIG of the future. I will also discuss our capital management. Strategy and growth expectations. AIG's strong fourth quarter results demonstrated our. Continued execution across all aspects of our strategy. Within General Insurance, underwriting income was $642 million. Gross premiums written for the fourth quarter were $7.6 billion, an increase of 4%. From the prior year quarter. Net premiums written for the quarter increased by 7% from the prior year quarter to $5.7 billion.\nGlobal Commercial grew 5%, and Global Personal. Grew 9% from the prior year quarter. If you exclude Financial Lines, Global Commercial. Would have grown 11% in North America commercial. Fourth quarter net premiums written grew 5% over the prior year quarter, led by Retail Property, which grew 32%, and Lexington, which grew 20%. These were offset by North America Financial. Lines, which was lower by 13%. In international commercial fourth quarter net premiums. Written grew 6% over the prior year quarter as International Property grew 28%, and Talbot grew 12%.\nThese were offset by International Financial Lines, which was lower by 7%. In the fourth quarter, Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention of 86% in its in force portfolio, as well as very strong new business performance. North America Commercial produced new business of. $503 million in the quarter, an increase of 21% year-over-year. The growth was led by Retail Casualty, Lexington, and Retail Property. International Commercial produced new business of $467. million for the quarter, representing an increase of 14% year-over-year. This growth was led by Global Specialty and Talbot moving to rate in North. America commercial overall rate increased 4% in the Q4 with exposure adding 3 points and the overall pricing was up 7%.\nIn North America Commercial, if you exclude. Financial Lines and workers' compensation, overall rate would have increased 11% in the quarter. With exposure adding four points, overall. Pricing would have been 15% meaningfully above. The loss cost trend. North America Commercial rate increases were driven. By Lexington wholesale, which was up 17%, Retail Property, which was up 19%, and Excess Casualty, which was up 13%. In International Commercial, overall rate increased 3%. In Q4, with exposure adding two points, and the overall pricing was up 5%, which is slightly below loss cost trend. The rate increase was driven by property. Which was up 12% and marine, which was up 8%.\nTurning to Personal Insurance, Q4 net. Premiums written increased 9% from the prior year quarter primarily driven by North America. In North America, Personal net premiums written. Increased 37% in the quarter. As we've seen in prior quarters. In 2023, the significant premium growth for North America Personal was driven by our High Net Worth Business, and as we discussed in prior quarters, the growth in North America earned premium continued to generate a lower expense ratio, and we expect the expense ratio will continue to improve in 2024. Now let me turn to the full year financial results. 2023 was another year of meaningful strategic. Repositioning and was in many ways our best year yet. The repositioning included the disposition of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services which generated a combined $3.5 billion of proceeds including a pre-closing dividend.\nAdditionally, we settled a $1 billion intercompany. Loan from Validus Re to AIG and received approximately $250 million of RenaissanceRe common stock. The changes to our portfolio further reduced volatility and allowed us to focus on. Businesses where we believe we have better. Opportunities for stronger risk adjusted returns. We reshaped the reinsurance structure of our High Net Worth Business and launched a newly formed MGA called Private Client Select. We made significant progress towards Corebridge's separation, another major strategic milestone on our journey to becoming a less complex company. We completed three secondary offerings in 2023 that generated approximately $2.9 billion in cash.\nWe worked with Corebridge on the divestiture of Laya Healthcare and announced the sale of the UK Life business in 2023. AIG received $1.4 billion of capital from Corebridge through $385 million of regular dividends. $688 million of special dividends and $315 million of share repurchases at the end of 2023. Our ownership stake in Corebridge was approximately 52% in 2023. We continue to execute on a thoughtful and balanced capital management strategy. During the year, AIG returned $4 billion. Of capital to shareholders through $3 billion of share repurchases and $1 billion of dividends.\nWe reduced our common shares outstanding by 6% and increased quarterly dividends by 12.5%. On 1 August, the AIG Board of Directors increased our share buyback authorization to $7.5 billion. At the year-end, 2023, we had $6.2 billion remaining on that authorization. We reduced AIG net debt by $1.4. billion in 2023 after successfully conducting a senior notes tender offer in November. We finished 2023 with very strong parent. Liquidity of $7.6 billion, which gives us. Ample capacity to continue executing on our capital management priorities.\nTurning to the full year results for. General Insurance. Throughout 2023, we delivered terrific financial performance. General Insurance full year underwriting income was. $2.3 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year for the full year. The General Insurance Accident Year Combined Ratio excluding catastrophes was 87.7%, an improvement of 100 basis points year-over-year. Global Commercial achieved an Accident Year Combined Ratio excluding catastrophes of 83.3% for the. Full year, an improvement of 120 basis points year-over-year driven by loss ratio improvement. The calendar year combined ratio was 87.1%, a 250 basis points improvement year over.\nyear excluding Validus Re and Crop Risk Services for the full year. Results, the Global Commercial accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes would have increased by 50 basis points to 83.8%, and the calendar year combined ratio would have increased by slightly over 20 basis points to 87.3%. In Global Personal, the full year accident. year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 99.3%. In line with the prior year. For the full year, General Insurance grew net premiums written by 7% year-over-year, driven by 5% growth in Global Commercial, and 10% in Personal Insurance.\nNorth America Commercial grew 5% and International. Commercial grew 6% year-over-year. A couple of highlights: Lexington and Global Specialty had outstanding years. We remained very focused on these businesses. Made investments to accelerate growth and continue to deliver strong underwriting profitability. Lexington grew its net premiums written by. 17% year-over-year. Growth was driven by historically high retention. Which was 80%, $1 billion of new business, and rate increases of approximately 18%. Global Specialty, which includes businesses in marine, energy, trade credit, and aviation, grew its.\nNet Premiums Written 10% year-over-year, driven by 88% retention, almost $750 million of new business, and rate increases of 7% for the year. Also, there are two parts of our business that impacted growth in Global Commercial, which I would like to offer some perspective. First, if you exclude Financial Lines, our. Net premiums written growth would have been 10%. Second, as we've outlined on prior calls, we decided to non-renew two programs. That had significant property catastrophe exposure that no longer met our underwriting guidelines. We did not believe that the premium. Increases on a risk adjusted basis for these two programs delivered an acceptable return.\nThe decision to non-renew impacted the. Gross and net premiums written for Lexington. Specifically as well as the global commercial business throughout 2023. If you Financial Lines and these. Two programs that I just mentioned, our year-over-year net premiums written growth would have been 13%, which gives you a sense as to why we have significant confidence in our core portfolio where we saw meaningful overall growth for the year. It's worth providing a little bit more. Detail on Financial Lines. In Financial Lines, particularly in our Public Directors and Officers book of business, we continue to exercise underwriting discipline by maintaining our primary position in our portfolio and being very prudent on large account excess layers where there is significant exposure to vertical loss.\nThese layers are highly commoditized where.Typically the best price wins. We've spoken about the cumulative rate change. In Financial Lines before, but I want to provide a little bit more detail. The compound annual growth rate for financial. Lines achieved from 2019 through 2023 with 49%. If you exclude 2023, the compound annual. Growth rate was 63%. It's a business we're very focused on. Our underwriters are continuing to carefully monitor market conditions and underwrite conservatively. Now I'd like to provide you with some insight into the current reinsurance market generally and an overview of our January reinsurance renewals.\nAs I mentioned on previous calls, AIG's. Reinsurance purchasing is deliberately weighted to January 1, which enables us to strategically optimize the outcome across our reinsurance placements and provides us with clarity on our cost of reinsurance at the beginning of the year. Before I go into detail on this year's outcomes, I want to speak about how we evaluate our reinsurance purchased. We've seen significant changes in the global. Property market over the last two years, and analyzing and quantifying changes in a portfolio's risk profile has become increasingly complex.\nCurrently, one of the most overused phrases that has been used with more frequency. In the last year, is risk-adjusted pricing or risk-adjusted rate changes, which have multiple interpretations, particularly when it comes to property treaty reinsurance. Calculating the risk-adjusted rate change can. Be complicated and is often inconsistent. Want to outline how AIG determines risk-adjusted pricing changes, which we believe is. An industry best practice? To begin, you must determine the baseline. Structure and all the variables required to assess and quantify the risk-adjusted pricing change. To do that, the base analysis should. Be set at the identical structure and coverage with the exact terms and conditions of the prior year structure.\nThe analysis needs to compare the cost. Of capital year-over-year, and any model changes from vendor model output, such as RMS, to determine if the loss costs have increased or decreased at the attachment point and the vertical limits deployed. Also, an analysis is needed for any changes to the coverage provided in the treaty placement. For instance, over the last few years. Many programs have gone from an all. Risk coverage basis to a named or peak peril basis.\nTo correctly calculate the risk-adjuster rate change. Perils no longer covered need to be analyzed and priced separately, and the impact of any reduced coverage should be factored into the assessment of the price change. This can be particularly difficult when assessing perils that would not be economically viable. To place on a standalone basis with significant limits which could include wildfire, flood, or terrorism.\nThere needs to be consideration given to. The volatility associated with the expected loss in calculating the risk-adjusted rate change. Given the complexity of these calculations, the. Methodologies applied should be done with consistency and discipline when applying the methodology I just described. AIG had a tremendous outcome. With our reinsurance partners at the January. First renewal season, building upon the very strong result achieved in a very challenging market in 2023. Now let me turn to AIG's reinsurance. Renewals at January 1 2024.\nTo level set the natural catastrophe insured loss activity remained at the forefront of the market with a record-setting 37 events in 2023 that exceed $1 billion of insured loss. These events contributed to a total annual. Insured loss currently estimated at over $100 billion, marking the sixth time in the past seven years that insured loss from natural catastrophes has exceeded $100 billion. Over the last seven years there's been nearly $1 trillion of aggregate losses with over 60% driven by secondary perils.The headline is that we were able. To significantly improve our property cat structure and reinsurance coverage, provided when you review what we purchased last year, including for Validus Re.\nThe overall spend has reduced by approximately. $200 million, and our core property treaties excluding Validus Re have slightly lower ceded premium year-over-year. Let's start with our property catastrophe placements. Our core commercial North America retention of. $500 million remained unchanged for the second straight year. The attachment on our dedicated Lexington occurrence. Tower was unchanged at $300 million. In both cases, the model attachment point. is lower and the exhaust limit is higher. Our international property CAT per occurrence structures renewed with a reduced retention in Japan to $150 million, a $50 million improvement. From the prior year. The rest of the world attachment remains unchanged at $125 million.\nWe were very pleased to have achieved. Broader coverage across all of our core occurrence towers with nominal attachment points unchanged or, in the case of Japan, decreasing. The model probability of attaching our CAT reinsurance improved with respect to key perils and across every major territory following the growth achieved in the property portfolio in 2023. Our property cat aggregate cover was also. Successfully renewed with improved coverage further reducing our volatility from frequency of loss. The aggregate now includes a standalone sub. Limit dedicated to losses in North America arising from secondary perils.\nImportantly, it also now covers contributing losses. From our High Net Worth portfolio. Our annual aggregate deductible for North America is $825 million. The North America other perils deductible is. $350 million, which is a new deductible. And Japan and the rest of the. World deductibles are $200 million and $175 million respectively. These are subject to each and every loss deductibles of $20 million. Other than for North America wind and. Earthquake, which are at $50 million. Our return period attachment point is lower. Year-over-year for all of our major proportional treaties across a range of classes. We improved or maintained our ceding commission levels reflecting our market leading underwriting expertise. Position in the market.\nTurning to Casualty, the challenges we've spoken. About previously regarding the impact of inflation. Both social, economic, and litigation funding. In the US, we were a focal point for reinsurers at 1/1 for casualty. At AIG, we remain very focused on our underwriting standards and the positioning of the portfolio. Our team has done a terrific job. Of re-underwriting the entire business, particularly considering the amount of work that was needed to reposition it to where it is today. Additionally, our pricing assumptions today have loss.Trends ranging from the high single digits to over 10%. These were increased over the past two. Yeah, given inflationary dynamics.",

This conference is being recorded. Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\n\nQuentin John McMillan\n\nVP, MD & Head of IR, American International Group, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.\nToday's remarks may also include non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com. Additionally, note that today's remarks will include results of AIG's Life and Retirement segment and other operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial. AIG's segments and U.S. GAAP financial results as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto, differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its earnings call on Friday, November 3.\nFinally, please note that today's remarks as they relate to net premiums written in general insurance are presented on a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis adjusted for the international lag elimination and the sale of Crop Risk Services and the sale of Validus Re. Please refer to the footnote on Page 26 of the third quarter financial supplement for prior period results for Crop Risk Services and Validus Re. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Saber will provide more detail on the quarter and then we will take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will join us for the Q&A portion of the call.\nIn the third quarter, AIG continued to deliver exceptional results. We made significant progress in our strategic, operational and financial objectives, reflecting continued execution across our entire organization. During my remarks this morning, I will discuss the following topics: first, AIG's financial results, including life and retirement and provide an update on recent divestitures; second, I will provide the results of AIG's general insurance business; third, I will provide an update on the casualty insurance market more broadly and AIG's approach to our casualty portfolio; fourth, I will provide an update on our capital management strategy and the progress we have made this quarter. Sabra will provide more detail on AIG's balance sheet and capital position in her remarks. And lastly, I will reconfirm our guidance with respect to our path to a 10% plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge.\nFinancial highlights from the third quarter included: adjusted after-tax income was $1.2 billion or $1.61 per diluted common share, representing a 92% increase year-over-year. Consolidated net investment income on an adjusted pretax income basis was $3.3 billion, a 29% increase year-over-year. In general insurance, net investment income was $756 million, a 30% increase.\nNet premiums written in General Insurance grew 9% and General Insurance underwriting income in the quarter was $611 million, which improved over 250% from the prior year quarter. The adjusted accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 86.3%, a 210 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter, which is an outstanding result.\nOur cat loss ratio was 6.9%, with $462 million of total catastrophe losses, including reinstatement premiums, which included $70 million from Validus Re. We had favorable prior year reserve development of $139 million, reflecting favorable loss experience on our portfolio, resulting from our continued focus on underwriting discipline.\nThe Life and Retirement business also delivered strong results in the third quarter with continued sales momentum and spread expansion. Life and Retirement's adjusted pretax income was $971 million, up 24% year-over-year. Premiums and deposits grew 4% year-over-year to $9.2 billion driven by strong fixed indexed annuity sales, which exceeded $2 billion for the third consecutive quarter.\nSeptember marked the 1-year anniversary of Corebridge's initial public offering. And since the IPO, Corebridge has returned approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders and is well on track to its committed payout ratio. With respect to our remaining ownership of Corebridge, we continue to evaluate options that are aligned with the best interest of shareholders and our other stakeholders.\nWe're very proud of the achievements that Corebridge has delivered towards its operational separation as a public company, and we remain committed to reducing our ownership and eventually a full separation. Turning to AIG's balance sheet. During the quarter, AIG returned over $1 billion to shareholders through $785 million of common stock repurchases and $261 million of dividends. In addition, we purchased $170 million of common stock in October.\nWe deployed $289 million to retire Validus Re debt prior to the close of the transaction yesterday. And we ended the quarter with $3.6 billion of parent liquidity. During the quarter, we continue to make significant progress on our strategic repositioning as we have further simplified our portfolio, which we've talked about over the past several quarters.\nYesterday, we announced the successful closing of the sale of Validus Re to RenaissanceRe for which we received a total consideration of $3.3 billion in cash, including a preclosed dividend and approximately $275 million at RenaissanceRe common stock. This divestiture streamlines our business model, simplifies our portfolio and further reduces our volatility.\nPrior to closing the Validus Re transaction, we entered into an agreement with Enstar Group to provide AIG with protection against any adverse development on the 95% portion of Validus Re's loss reserves that AIG retains exposure to. The cost will be included in the gain on sale in the fourth quarter.\nEnstar will provide $400 million of limit for an adverse development cover in excess of carried loss reserves on assumed reinsurance contracts underwritten by Validus Re with respect to accident year 2022 and prior. This ADC limit provides additional protection against downside exposure to reserves in excess of the expected redundancy to a modeled confidence level above the 90th percentile.\nImportantly, while we believe this ADC is prudent to mitigate the risk of any future adverse reserve development, we will benefit from any future favorable reserve development. In August, Corebridge entered into a definitive agreement to sell Laya Healthcare to AXA for $650 million, which calls on October 31. Proceeds to Corebridge net of purchase price adjustments and deal-related expenses will be approximately $730 million. It was announced that the proceeds will be used for a special dividend to Corebridge shareholders as of November 13.\nIn September, Corebridge entered into a definitive agreement to sell the U.K. life insurance business to Aviva plc for GBP 460 million pounds. We expect the transaction to close sometime in the second quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals. We anticipate that the proceeds from this transaction will largely be used for share repurchases, subject to market conditions. Both transactions streamline the Corebridge portfolio and allow the company to focus on its life retirement products and solutions in the United States.\nTurning to General Insurance. Gross premiums written were $8.9 billion, a decrease of 1% from prior year quarter. Net premiums written were $6.5 billion, an increase of 9% from the prior year quarter. Global Commercial grew 6% and Global Personnel grew 16% from the prior year quarter. North America commercial net premiums written increased 5% in the third quarter.\nThere are many variables in this quarter, and I want to provide more detail. The key businesses that drove growth were Lexington's core business, excluding Lexington programs, grew over 25% in the quarter, led by wholesale casualty, which grew 33% and wholesale property, which grew 27%.\nGlatfelter grew 12% and retail property grew 11%. In terms of headwinds in 2022, we made the underwriting decision to not renew 2 large Lexington programs. We took this action because we believe that these programs had meaningful CAT exposure in peak zones. And we do not believe the appropriate CAT loads were reflected in the pricing.\nThese programs were not the best deployment of capital in order to achieve our targeted risk-adjusted returns. Those nonrenewals tempered overall growth in Lexington. Lexington program's net premiums written reduced by 57% in the quarter. We believe, over time, we will replace this business on an individual risk basis as stronger risk-adjusted returns. However, it is a headwind in the quarter.\nThe impact of the net premiums written associated with these 2 programs was approximately $115 million in the third quarter. Also offsetting growth in North America was financial lines, which declined 11% accounting for approximately 20% of North America Commercial Lines net premiums written in the quarter.\nIn North America Financial Lines, large account public D&O remains competitive, as a result of excess capacity driven by new entrants to the market. Our renewal retention in our primary business remains strong, but retentions in our excess business were more challenged. New business in our excess book was down year-over-year as we were very disciplined in the current environment.\nRate reductions remain most prevalent on excess layers, particularly the higher excess layer vertical towers, where it's more commoditized and the most pressure exists on pricing and primary, where we are one of the few market leaders, rates remain flat to slightly down. We remain confident in our approach to financial lines, We have a global business with scale focused on underwriting profit over top line growth, which is reflected in the results this quarter.\nIn International Commercial, net premiums written grew 7%, primarily driven by property, which was up 13%; Global Specialty, which was up 12%, led by Energy & Marine; and Talbot, which was up 7%. Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention of 87% in its in-force portfolio. North America was up 200 basis points to 87% and international was up 300 basis points to 88%. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes.\nAnd across Global Commercial, we continue to see very strong new business, which was approximately $1 billion in the third quarter. North America Commercial produced new business of $516 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year or 27% if you exclude financial lines. This growth was driven by Lexington Casualty which saw excellent new business growth of over 90% as well as Western World, which grew over 50%.\nRetail Property grew new business by 26% and retail casualty grew new business by 25%. This was offset by financial lines, where new business contracted by about 30% as a result of our underwriting discipline. International Commercial produced new business of $532 million or 12% growth year-over-year. This growth was led by Talbot new business, which increased almost 50% year-over-year and Global Specialty, which grew new business by over 40%, and it was balanced across the portfolio.\nMoving to rate. In North America Commercial, rate increased 5.4% in the third quarter or 6% excluding workers' compensation. Exposure in the quarter added 3 points, bringing the total pricing change, excluding workers' comp to 9%. Rate increases were driven by Lexington wholesale, which was up 15%, marking the 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases, led by Lexington wholesale property, which was up 28%, Retail property was up 27% and admitted excess casualty was up 12%. Financial Lines rate was down 8%.\nIn International Commercial, rate increased 4% and the exposure increase was 2%. The rate increase was driven by property, which was up 13%; energy, which was up 10%; and Talbot, which was up 9%.\nTurning to Personal Insurance. Net premiums written increased 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by North America. In North America, personal net premiums written increased 59%, similar to last quarter, the increase was driven by business underwritten on behalf of PCS, offset by decreases in travel and warranty.\nIn the third quarter, AIG's net premiums written from PCS increased by over 100%, benefiting from an increase in gross premiums written and a reduction in quota share sessions. And as expected, the lag and earned premium growth continued to dissipate providing operating leverage and a reduced expense ratio primarily in general operating expenses. The high and ultra high net worth business also had significant improvement in the accident year loss ratio, benefiting from improved pricing in our admitted business and transitioning more business to the non-admitted market.\nWe expect PCS to continue to improve its financial performance and provide more operating leverage in the fourth quarter and into 2024. In International personal, net premiums written increased by 3% year-over-year, driven by growth in personal auto, travel, and that reflects the rebound post pandemic and Japan personal property.\nThe accident year loss ratio ex-CAT improved 560 basis points. Overall, we're pleased with the international personal improvement year-over-year. Shifting to combined ratios. The General Insurance third quarter combined ratio was 90.5%, a 680 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter.\nAccident year combined ratio ex cats was 86.3%, a 210 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. Global Commercial had an outstanding performance with third quarter accident year combined ratio ex-CAT of 81.7%, a 130 basis point improvement year-over-year. The accident year combined ratio, including CAT was 89.7%, a 500 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter.\nThe North America Commercial accident year combined ratio ex-CAT was 83%, and the international commercial accident year combined ratio ex-CAT was 79.7%, both of which were exceptional outcomes. We would like to provide a perspective both with and without Validus Re in crop risk services.\nAs I said, the third quarter global commercial accident year combined ratio ex CAT was 81.7%, and the calendar year combined ratio was 86.6%. Excluding Validus Re from the third quarter results, the global commercial accident year combined ratio would essentially have been flat and the calendar year combined ratio would have improved by slightly over 100 basis points from the third quarter to 85.4%.\nAnd for the first 9 months, the global commercial accident year combined ratio ex CAT was 83.6% and and the calendar year combined ratio was 87.6%. Excluding crop and Validus Re from the 9-month period results, the global commercial accident year combined ratio ex CAT would have increased by 70 basis points to 84.3% and the calendar year combined ratio would have increased by 50 basis points to 88.1%.\nGlobal Personal reported a third quarter accident year combined ratio ex cats of 99%, a 380 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter, due in part to the North America PCS business. Related to casualty liability and the excess casualty market, in particular in the United States, the level of narrative has increased over the last several years, driven in part by multiple mass tort events, as well as rising economic and social inflation.\nThe latter has been fueled by an exponential increase in third-party litigation funding, average severity trend increases and a precipitous rise in jury awards following the lull during the pandemic. Over the past couple of years, I've spoken extensively about our portfolio remediation strategy, including where AIG has reduced gross limits since 2018 by $1.4 trillion.\nWe have established strong underwriting guidelines and strong partnerships with reinsurers to manage both frequency and severity. We have filed a similar strategy with our casualty portfolio with more of a focus on severity. When we began the underwriting turnaround in AIG in 2017, we found that the prior strategy in Casualty was similar to that in the property business, which was to write large limits with a gross and net risk appetite much greater than what we offer today.\nAs I've outlined before, it was not uncommon to put out significant limits on any individual risk in excess of $100 million net on an occurrence basis. As we developed an entirely new framework and approach to underwriting, it required a change to our underwriting strategy.\nToday, our global Casualty portfolio represents 12% and of our total gross premiums written and 13% of our net premiums rate. The North America segment represents 55% and the International segment represents 45% of that number. And since North America has been the topic of discussion, I will focus on what we have done in that portfolio. In North America Casualty, our gross limit for our excess casualty portfolio, including lead umbrella, has decreased by over 50% since 2018.\nOur average limit size has also reduced by over 50%. Average lead attachment points, which protect us from frequency and lower severity losses have more than doubled since 2018. In terms of gross pricing, primary auto and primary general liability rates have increased approximately 200% since 2018, and excess casualty rates have increased by over 250% remaining well above loss cost trends.\nIn addition to the significant investment in underwriting excellence and talent, we built and executed on a strategic reinsurance program to further mitigate our net exposure and volatility. What once was $100 million net exposure for AIG, there's now a maximum net on any 1 claim of $15 million in international and $11.5 million in North America. And in our excess of loss treaties, we have reinstatement limits that exhaust based on extensive modeling done at the 1,000 return periods.\nThis adequately protects AIG from vertical exposure with significant limit available in the event there are multiple losses. Notably, the period prior to 2016 is covered by an adverse development cover for U.S. long-tail commercial lines. We purchased 80% of a $25 billion -- excess of $25 billion on payments made on or after January 1, 2016, for business written prior to 2016. The $25 billion retention was exceeded during the fourth quarter of 2020. We currently have $9 billion of the total unused recoverable limit left or $7.2 billion at the 80% level.\nConflicting views have emerged in the market on the combination of gross portfolio underwriting with the strategic use of reinsurance. There have been comments particularly recently that the use of reinsurance is not required if you're comfortable with the gross portfolio. We disagree and simply don't support that as a viable strategy for AIG.\nWe prefer to balance our approach and have developed a strong underwriting culture, which we have dramatically improved over the last 5 years, executing on the fundamentals of disciplined and consistent underwriting being very focused on preempting the evolving changes in the market and using reinsurance strategically to mitigate unpredictable outcomes, building long-term strategic relationships with our reinsurance partners for all of our reinsurance needs has been key to repositioning AIG.\nInsurers cannot reverse social and economic inflation, However, we are in control of how we predict and respond to the impact of these changes to the forward-looking landscape, including how we manage our underwriting through coverage provided, limits deployed, attachment points and pricing.\nOur business is not immune from social inflation, but we anticipated it early, and we took action. The consequence is that we're very pleased with our existing portfolio and we're well positioned to be able to prudently take advantage of opportunities that exist in the current marketplace.\nTurning to capital management. We use a balanced framework that remains focused on having ample capital in our insurance company subsidiaries to support organic growth in our business, continuing share repurchases, debt reduction in line with the lower end of the targets we provided and dividend increases.\nLastly, we will consider compelling inorganic growth opportunities to meet our strategic objectives should they emerge. We finished the third quarter with $3.6 billion of available liquidity prior to receiving the proceeds of the sale of Validus Re for the special dividend from the sale of Lea Healthcare.\nTogether, they should contribute approximately another $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Our primary use of proceeds will be on share repurchases. We plan to accelerate our repurchase activity this quarter and as we enter 2024 and we expect to reduce debt outstanding to further strengthen the balance sheet.\nWe remain mindful of our leverage as a key consideration with our accelerated share repurchases. We expect to execute on the current share repurchase authorization of $7.5 billion. which will reduce shares outstanding to close to 600 million shares subject to market conditions.\nRelated to return on common equity, as we have outlined on our prior calls, we remain very focused on delivering a 10% plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge. During the third quarter, we continue to make significant progress at all 4 components of our path to deliver on this commitment and how we are positioning AIG for the future.\nI want to provide a few observations. In the last 90 days, we've continued to improve our underwriting results on an accident year and calendar year basis. We made recent leadership changes in general insurance, which have effectively eliminated a management layer from the business, and we will continue this process throughout the organization in 2024.\nWe have strengthened the capital position of insurance company subsidiaries to enable continued profitable growth. We've moved into the final stages of the operational separation for Core Bridge. We have announced and closed several divestitures and have repositioned the portfolio to support our strategy for the future.\nWe have accelerated the progress we're making on our capital management strategy and have created a strong liquidity position. The catalyst to achieving our targets remains the deconsolidation of Corebridge. This will allow AIG to simplify its business, eliminate duplication by combining our general insurance business and our corporate functions, and create a leaner operating model for the future.\nBefore I turn it over to Sabra, I'd like to add a few more details on the closing of the sale of Validus Re to RenaissanceRe. In January of 2018, AIG announced it was acquiring Validus Holdings to position it for future growth and profitability improvement. Over the last several years, we reshaped Validus Re's portfolio by reducing the catastrophe exposure in certain U.S. peak zones while diversifying the business significantly to develop a more balanced portfolio in both property and casualty reinsurance in order to improve profitability.\nValidus Re posted its first accident year combined ratio below 100% in 2022. And as we look back, we are grateful for the hard work determination and perseverance of the team to dramatically improve the quality of the portfolio, particularly year-to-date in 2023, and it's evident in its performance today. We are very proud of Validus Re's results and are pleased that the company acquiring Validus Re is RenaissanceRe. Through Kevin O'Donnell and his leadership team's terrific work, RenaissanceRe has become one of the world's most well-respected reinsurers.\nWe are looking forward to continuing our strong partnership with RenaissanceRe, which will be further enhanced as we become an investor in RenRe's capital partner vehicles allowing us to benefit from their future performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra.\n\nSabra Rose Purtill\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations & Treasurer, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide more detail on AIG's third quarter, including general insurance reserves net investment income, life and retirement results and balance sheet and capital management. Adjusted after-tax income attributable to common shareholders this quarter was $1.2 billion, up 80% from 3Q '22 for an annualized adjusted ROCE of 8.5%.\nAATI per diluted share was $1.61, up 92%, reflecting the accretive impact of share repurchases over the last year. The earnings growth resulted from the 82% increase in general insurance adjusted pretax income to $1.4 billion, driven by top line growth, improved underwriting results and higher investment income.\nIt's important to note that while Life and Retirement also had strong earnings, AIG's ownership of Corebridge decreased to 65.6% this quarter compared to 90.1% before the IPO. And therefore, our results include a lower percentage of their consolidated earnings than last year. In total, Corebridge contributed about $32 million to the $514 million increase in AIG's adjusted after-tax income.\nTurning to General Insurance. Peter summarized our underwriting results, but I want to cover prior year development and reserves in more detail. In the quarter, General insurers prior year development, net of reinsurance totaled $139 million favorable, including $41 million from the amortization of deferred gain on the adverse development cover.\nAbout $129 million, including the ADC gain resulted from the detailed valuation reviews, or DVRs, with the balance from other items like catastrophes. The DVRs covered $34.1 billion of loss reserves on a pre-ADC basis, about 70% of the total. The DVRs of particular note this quarter were for international Casualty and Financial Lines, North America Financial Lines and North America workers' compensation, which last year was completed in the second quarter. In total, North America had $154 million of favorable development, including $39 million from the ADC.\nInternational was $15 million unfavorable. Consistent with our prior comments, casualty, bodily injury, securities class actions and medical workers' comp trends have been and continue to be more favorable than our reserving assumptions. We believe that our changes in underwriting standards reduce limits, higher attachment points on primary limits, tightened terms and conditions and better risk selection are driving the improved experience, particularly in financial lines and casualty.\nNevertheless, our philosophy is to react to bad news quickly and to allow time for favorable trends in recent accident years to mature, particularly given the impact of COVID on recent years. Therefore, this quarter's favorable development is generally from older accident years or from short tail lines like property or physical damage claims coming quickly.\nIn financial lines, changes from the DVRs were immaterial. North America had modest adverse development on an older Lexington architect and engineers book, offset by favorability in Canada. U.K. financial lines had slight adverse development, reflecting emerged experience on older D&O and professional indemnity claims, partially offset by favorable experience in Europe and Japan.\nWe also reviewed international casualty lines this quarter. Peter discussed our changes in underwriting limits and reinsurance on our global casualty book, I would add that we also evaluate economic and social inflation trends as well as our potential exposure to mass torts across the total book and hold reserves to address those items.\nThis quarter, we had adverse development in U.K. and European Casualty principally from commercial auto in France and large loss experience on a few older claims in both the U.K. and Europe. Consistent with prior trends, the DVRs for workers' compensation were favorable both for years covered by the ADC and after.\nFinally, property lines and Personal Insurance had favorable development in both North America and international, while we had about $23 million of adverse development on prior year catastrophes. We will complete the balance of annual DVRs next quarter, which cover about $6 billion of reserves on a number of smaller lines.\nNet investment income also contributed to earnings growth in the quarter driven principally by higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturities and loans. The average new money yield on fixed maturities and loans was 5.88% this quarter, about 145 basis points above the yield on sales and maturities and and it was about 130 and 150 basis points higher in General Insurance and Life and Retirement, respectively.\nYear-to-date, the total new money yield is about 202 basis points higher than sales and maturities. The portfolio yield in general insurance increased 9 basis points sequentially and 88 basis points over the last year with net investment income growth at 30%. The L&R investment income rose 23% and the portfolio yield improved 9 basis points and 63 basis points, respectively.\nBased on the current treasury yield curve, we expect continued pickup in portfolio yields particularly in LNR, given the longer duration of its portfolio. Alternative investment income totaled $26 million for an annualized return of about 1%, better than the losses last year but below our long-term experience and outlook and down sequentially.\nPrivate equity returns are the principal driver of sequential decline in alternative returns this year as we have reduced our exposure to hedge funds over the last year. Private equity is reported on a 1-quarter lag based on when we receive the fund's financial reports. So this quarter's financial results reflect second quarter markets.\nOur investment portfolios have strong credit performance and remain well diversified and highly rated. We continue to monitor commercial real estate closely. Debt service coverage ratios are strong, including in the office sector. The primary impact has been on loan-to-value ratios and real estate equity valuations rather than delinquencies or defaults. We continue to work on near-term maturities and almost all 2023 scheduled maturities have been addressed.\nLife and Retirement once again delivered strong results in the third quarter. Adjusted pretax income was $971 million, up 24% year-over-year driven by continued investment spread expansion and strong sales, particularly in fixed index annuities. Underwriting margins overall remain attractive and on a sequential quarter basis, fee income and investment spreads improved.\nDuring the quarter, the annual actuarial assumptions update was completed, resulting in a modest $22 million increase in APTI, mostly in the Life Insurance segment compared to a $29 million increase last year. Individual Retirement APTI increased $195 million or 52% over the prior year quarter from base spread expansion and general account product growth.\nThe fixed annuity surrender rate increased sequentially from 15.9% to 17.7% this quarter as operations caught up on a backlog of surrender requests from earlier in the year. On a monthly basis, surrenders peaked early in the quarter and declined sequentially each month with continued improvement in October.\nGroup Retirement APTI was flat year-over-year as higher fee income and alternative investment income were offset by lower other yield enhancement income and higher general operating expenses or GE. Net outflows included 1 large $1 billion plan, which was mostly in mutual funds and therefore, was not material to earnings. Life Insurance APT was also flat year-over-year, primarily due to lower policy fees and a lower favorable impact from the annual assumptions update, partially offset by higher net investment income.\nInstitutional Markets APTI decreased $8 million or 10% and due to less favorable mortality experience. Sales increased 19%, supported by record production of $1.9 billion, partially offset by lower PRT sales, which are highly variable quarter-to-quarter.\nTurning to other operations. Third quarter adjusted pretax loss improved by $149 million, driven by lower corporate and other GOE and higher short-term investment income. In addition, third quarter 2022 had investment losses on a legacy portfolio that was sold in 4Q '22. Corporate GOE was $243 million and included $68 million for Corebridge. Excluding Corebridge, AIG corporate GOE decreased $56 million from the prior year.\nWe remain on track to reduce 2023 corporate GOE by at least $100 million, including a higher allocation to general insurance that has not had a material impact on the expense ratio due to expense discipline across the company.\nMoving to the balance sheet. Third quarter 2023 estimated risk-based capital ratios remain above our target ranges. The general insurance U.S. pool RBC is in the high 400s, while Life and Retirement is above its 400% target. At September 30, consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital, excluding AOCI, was 25.9%, including $9.4 billion of coverage debt.\nOur approach to capital management is unchanged. We will continue to balance share repurchases and debt reduction, while also focusing on increasing common stock dividends. As Peter indicated, from the Validus and Lea sales, we expect about $3.7 billion of additional parent liquidity in the fourth quarter. We have significant financial flexibility which we intend to use for both additional share repurchases and debt reduction.\nBased on current average daily trading volumes, we expect to be able to repurchase about $1.5 billion of common stock a quarter or $500 million a month, which we will begin when the market window opens after earnings. We expect to continue at this rate into 2024, depending on excess parent liquidity levels, including future core bridge sales proceeds and general insurance dividends.\nIn the fourth quarter, we also plan to accelerate debt repayment to rightsize our debt stock for our target deconsolidated leverage ratio. Turning to our ROCE target. We remain laser focused and are making progress on achieving a 10% plus ROCE post deconsolidation. Year-to-date, annualized adjusted ROCE for AIG was 8.8% and 12.0% in General Insurance and 11.4% in Life and Retirement.\nLast quarter, I provided a pro forma AIG shareholders' equity ex-AOCI, excluding Coreridge, of about $40 billion, including deferred tax assets from the financial crisis net operating losses. That's the capital supporting our general insurance business and parent operations today, excluding our stake in Corebridge.\nWith the sale of Validus Re and the redeployment of proceeds into share repurchases and debt reduction, the current pro forma estimate of AIG equity, excluding Core Bridge, is about $37 billion, including $4 billion of deferred tax assets or $33 billion of adjusted shareholders' equity which is the number we use for calculating adjusted ROCE.\nConsidering this equity level and our plans to simplify AIG's business and operational structure and to drive more predictable and sustainable profitability, we are confident that we will achieve our 10% plus adjusted ROCE goal. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress. With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter.\n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO\n\nThanks, Sabra. And Michelle, we're ready for questions.",

This conference is being recorded. Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\n\nQuentin John McMillan\n\nVP, MD & Head of IR, American International Group, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause these actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.\nToday's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com.\nFinally, note today's remarks as they related to net premiums written in General Insurance are presented on a constant dollar basis and where applicable, are also adjusted for the lag elimination in International that is described in our earnings release and related documents. Additionally, today's remarks will include results of AIG's Life and Retirement segment and Other Operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial.\nAIG segments and U.S. GAAP financial results as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its earnings call on Friday, August 4.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter, and then we will take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will join us for the Q&A portion of the call.\nI am very pleased to report that AIG delivered another exceptional quarter with strong financial performance. In addition, we made significant progress on our strategic priorities that are strengthening AIG for the future. We again demonstrated our ability to deliver high-quality outcomes while executing on multiple complex initiatives during very difficult market conditions.\nI would like to start with financial highlights from the second quarter. Adjusted after-tax income was $1.3 billion or $1.75 per diluted common share, representing a 26% increase year-over-year and the best quarterly adjusted EPS result for AIG since 2007.\nNet premiums written in General Insurance grew 11%, led by our Commercial business, which grew 13%. Underwriting income in the quarter was approximately $600 million. The adjusted accident year combined ratio ex cats was 88%, a 50 basis point improvement year-over-year and the best result for AIG since 2007. Our cat loss ratio was 3.9% or $250 million of catastrophe losses, a terrific result against the backdrop of a very challenging cat quarter for the industry.\nThe Life and Retirement business reported very good results in the second quarter. Adjusted pretax income was $991 million, up 33% year-over-year. And premiums and deposits were over $10 billion, a 42% increase year-over-year, supported by record sales of Fixed Index Annuity products.\nConsolidated net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.3 billion in the second quarter, a 31% increase year-over-year. In General Insurance, net investment income was $725 million, a 58% increase.\nAIG returned $822 million to shareholders in the second quarter through $554 million of common stock repurchases and a $268 million of dividends, which reflects a 12.5% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend that we announced on our last call. As you saw in our press release, the AIG Board of Directors approved an increase to our share buyback authorization to $7.5 billion, which reflects our commitment to returning capital to shareholders, consistent with the capital management strategy we have previously outlined.\nLastly, our balance sheet remains very strong. And we ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in parent liquidity.\nDuring the remainder of my remarks this morning, I will provide more information on the following 5 topics. First, the significant strategic actions we took in the second quarter to reposition AIG. During that review, I will provide additional details on the divestitures of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services, the launch of Private Client Select as an MGA serving the high and ultra-high net worth markets and the actions we took with respect to Corebridge.\nSecond, I will discuss financial results for General Insurance. Third, I will give an overview of the results for Life and Retirement. Fourth, I will provide an update on capital management. And lastly, I will reconfirm our guidance with respect to our path to a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge.\nTurning to the strategic actions we executed on. I will start with Validus Re. In May, we announced the divestiture of Validus Re and AlphaCat to RenaissanceRe for approximately $2.75 billion in cash and $250 million in RenRe common stock. We expect to close this transaction in the fourth quarter, subject to regulatory approval.\nWe're very pleased to have RenRe as the acquirer. RenRe is a very important partner to us, a company with a terrific reputation. And we value the strong relationship we have with Kevin and his management team. We believe RenRe will be an excellent owner of Validus Re.\nNow let me provide some highlights on our rationale for the divestiture. We acquired Validus in 2018, which at the time provided AIG with business diversification not limited just to reinsurance but also attractive specialty businesses, including Talbot and Western World, which were not part of the sale to RenRe and will remain with AIG.\nSince 2018, we transformed Validus Re by reunderwriting the portfolio, leading to significant premium growth and improved profitability. In addition, we dramatically changed the business mix of the portfolio to achieve a more attractive balance among property, casualty and specialty businesses, improved geographic diversity and decreased peak zone exposures.\nFor AIG, this divestiture represents a key milestone on our journey as it further streamlines our business model, simplifies the structure of our global portfolio, substantially reduces volatility, which I will explain in a moment, generate additional liquidity and capital efficiencies and accelerates our capital management strategy. Due to the nature of assumed reinsurance and the portfolio mix of Validus Re, this business is capital-intensive and disproportionately contributes to AIG's overall volatility and PMLs.\nAs we have discussed over the past few years, the core objectives of the property and casualty turnaround were to substantially improve the overall quality of AIG's global portfolio and underwriting results, reduce volatility through a massive reduction in growth limits written, better manage peak zone exposures and geographic balance and strategically use reinsurance across our overall business. A turnaround of this magnitude is made harder when you have a treaty reinsurance business, which, by its very nature, has volatility.\nWe have completed a rigorous enterprise-wide modeling exercise using RMS version 21 to approximate the PMLs for AIG post closing, and all categories will significantly reduce. This analysis took into account AIG's exposure, Validus Re's exposure as of February 1, 2023, and the combined output for both companies on an occurrence and aggregate basis.\nLet me provide a few examples of the model output for AIG post closing of the Validus Re sale on an occurrence basis. For worldwide all perils, net PMLs were reduced by 45% at the 1-in-250 return period. Worldwide hurricane PMLs will reduce by 60% at the 1-in-250 return period and by 70% at the 1-in-100 return period.\nNorth America hurricane PMLs will reduce by 70% at the 1-in-100 return period. North America earthquake PMLs will reduce by 55% at the 1-in-250 return period. Japan typhoon PMLs will reduce by 50% at the 1-in-100 return period. Japan earthquake PMLs will reduce by 50% at the 1-in-250 return period. And for EMEA, all PMLs will decrease by 85% at the 1-in-250 return period and 75% at the 1-in-100 return period.\nIn addition to the strategic repositioning of our portfolio, there were several additional components that made the sale of Validus Re appealing for AIG. The required tangible equity that AIG will deliver to RenRe upon closing, which is $2.1 billion, is substantially below what Validus Re would have required if the business remained at AIG.\nWe will receive $900 million above the book value of Validus Re, which reflects the improved quality of the portfolio since AIG's purchase of the business in 2018. We also expect to receive, through a pre-closing dividend, excess capital in the legal entities being transferred to RenRe, which we estimate will be approximately $200 million.\nIn addition, a $1 billion intercompany loan from Validus Re to AIG will be settled through internal dividends, and we expect AIG to benefit from a $400 million reduction in risk-based capital requirements following the closing. As part of the transaction, AIG will retain 95% of future reserve changes in the portfolio delivered at closing. We will receive the benefit of future reserve releases as the portfolio matures, and we will likely purchase an adverse development cover prior to the closing to minimize potential future reserve exposure.\nIn the second quarter, we also announced and closed the sale of Crop Risk Services to American Financial Group for $240 million in cash. Crop Risk Services was part of the Validus acquisition in 2018. Over the remainder of the 2023 crop season, AIG will continue to benefit from earned premium for crop business booked since the start of the year. But as we enter 2024, this business will no longer have an impact on AIG's financial results.\nNext, I want to provide more detail on the formation of Private Client Select as an MGA, which is now referred to as PCS. The MGA has officially launched, and we expect to add new capital providers in the coming quarters. We believe the MGA structure is ideal for PCS as it creates flexibility and alternatives for clients, agents and brokers in an environment that's becoming more complex.\nThe high and ultra-high net worth markets PCS is focused on have significant foundational challenges include loss cost pressure, inflation, increased cat exposure through increased total insured values and more concentration in peak zones and primary and secondary peril modeling has been deficient. AIG will continue to support the MGA. And because we will be assuming risk on our balance sheet, we've established the MGA's risk framework, which is designed to improve its financial performance in 2023 and as we enter 2024.\nOverall, we are pleased with the progress we've made with Stone Point Capital on this MGA structure. And we're well positioned to accelerate the business plan through the remainder of the year.\nMoving to Corebridge. In June, we completed a secondary offering of Corebridge common stock with gross proceeds to AIG of $1.2 billion. The offering was well received by the market. And the new owners included a strong mix of long-term holders, which we believe results in a more stable and well-diversified shareholder base for Corebridge.\nAlso in June, Corebridge announced and paid a $400 million special dividend in addition to its $150 million ordinary quarterly dividend and completed the repurchase of $200 million of common stock from AIG and Blackstone. AIG's net proceeds from these actions were approximately $540 million.\nAt the end of the second quarter, our ownership stake in Corebridge was approximately 65%. These actions demonstrate our commitment to deconsolidation and eventually full separation. As we noted on our last call, we continue to explore all options with respect to our remaining ownership of Corebridge that are aligned with the best interest of shareholders.\nTurning to other strategic actions we are taking in Corebridge. The previously announced sale process for Laya Healthcare, the private medical insurance business in Ireland that is part of Corebridge, is proceeding very well. We expect to announce a positive outcome from this process in the near term and expect that the proceeds from this divestiture will largely be used for a special dividend to Corebridge shareholders.\nAdditionally, we recently retained advisers to analyze strategic alternatives for the disposition of the U.K. Life business that is part of Corebridge. The dispositions of Laya and U.K. Life will streamline the Corebridge portfolio and allow its management team to focus on core Life and Retirement products and solutions in the United States.\nTurning to General Insurance. We had another quarter of strong growth in both gross and net premiums written. Gross premiums written were $10.4 billion, an increase of 11%. Global Commercial, which represents 80% of gross premiums written, grew 15%. And Global Personal decreased 1%.\nNet premiums written were $7.5 billion, an increase of 11%. This growth was driven by Global Commercial, which grew 13%, while Global Personal grew 5%. In North America Commercial, we saw a very strong growth of 18% in net premiums written. And excluding Validus Re, net premiums written growth in North America Commercial was 13%. The major drivers were as follows: Retail Property, which grew over 50%; Validus Re, which grew 32%; and Lexington, which grew 18%, led by wholesale property and casualty.\nI would like to provide a few additional details about Lexington's growth, given it continues to be an important part of AIG's strategy. Property grew 38% year-over-year driven by very strong retention in new business as well as strong rate increases. Submission activity was up over 30% year-over-year. Casualty grew 41%, supported by strong retention in new business, and its submission count was up over 90%.\nIn International Commercial, net premiums written grew 6% primarily driven by property, which was up 34%; Talbot, which was up 17%; and Global Specialty, which was up mid-single digits, which reflected the impact of additional reinsurance purchasing in the second quarter.\nGlobal Commercial had very strong renewal retention of 88% in its in-force portfolio. International was up 200 basis points to 88%, and North America was up 200 basis points to 87%. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes.\nAnd across Global Commercial, we continue to see strong new business, which was approximately $1.1 billion in the second quarter. North America Commercial, excluding Validus Re, produced new business of approximately $600 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year.\nThis growth was driven by Lexington property, which saw excellent new business growth of over 40%. Retail Property had over 50% new business growth, offset by Financial Lines, where new business contracted by over 35%.\nInternational Commercial new business was $485 million, which grew 5%. This growth was led by Talbot new business, which increased over 100% year-over-year and property, which grew new business by 40%, offset by Financial Lines where new business contracted by over 20%.\nAs I noted on our last call, we continue to see headwinds in certain aspects of Financial Lines due to increased competition putting pressure on pricing. Despite these continuing dynamics, we remain disciplined on risk selection, terms and conditions and price while taking a long-term view on this line of business by not following the market down.\nMoving to rate. In North America Commercial, excluding Validus Re, rate increased 8% in the second quarter or 9% if you exclude workers' compensation, and the exposure increase was 2%. Rate increases were driven by Lexington wholesale, which was up 23% with wholesale property up over 35% and Retail Property, which was up 30%.\nIn International Commercial, rate increased 9%, and the exposure increase was 1%. The rate increase was driven by property, which was up 21%; Talbot, which was up 14%; and Global Specialty, which was up 11% driven by global energy, which was up 21%. Rate plus exposure was 10% in North America, 11% if you exclude workers' compensation and 10% in International, which in each case remains above loss cost trend.\nTurning to Personal Insurance. Note that second quarter results in North America Personal reflected the fact that PCG was transitioning to become Private Client Select. North America Personal net premiums written increased 17% primarily driven by lower quota share sessions in PCG, offset by decreases in travel and warranty. Overall, we had strong growth in net premiums written of 17% with PCG net premiums written growing over 60%.\nWith PCS now officially launched as an MGA, there are several components of AIG's business in the high and ultra-high net worth markets that will result in improved financial performance for AIG over the balance of 2023. First, as we outlined in prior calls, over the last few years, we evolved the model for our high and ultra-high net worth business such that we expect net premiums written to grow significantly over the remainder of the year with our current expectations showing net premiums written increasing over 75% in the third and fourth quarters.\nSecond, the lag and earned premium growth that we saw in the first quarter of 2023 dissipated. And we saw a 36% growth in earned premium in the second quarter. And we expect that earned premium growth will continue to accelerate in the third and fourth quarter. The additional earned premium will provide operating leverage, which will reduce our GOE ratio in the third and fourth quarter.\nThird, AIG has stranded costs from the transition of PCG to an MGA. And we expect to eliminate these costs over the next 18 months.\nFourth, we expect the accident year loss ratio for our high and ultra-high net worth business will improve with the combination of improved pricing in our admitted business and more business migrating to the non-admitted market, which already had a very positive impact on PCG's accident and policy year loss ratios in prior quarters. This should earn in for our high and ultra-high net worth business through the second half of 2023 and into 2024.\nIn International Personal, net premiums written increased 1% year-over-year. The modest growth was driven by travel and personal property in Japan. Overall, our key focus continues to be growing Accident & Health and our business in Japan.\nShifting to combined ratios. As I noted earlier, the second quarter accident year combined ratio ex cats was 88%, a 50 basis point improvement year-over-year. In Global Commercial, the second quarter accident year combined ratio ex cats was 84.4%, a 90 basis point improvement year-over-year.\nThe North America Commercial accident year combined ratio ex cats was 85.1%, a 310 basis point improvement year-over-year. And the International Commercial accident year combined ratio ex cats was 83.1%, which continues to be an outstanding level of profitability. Global Personal reported a second quarter accident year combined ratio ex cats of 98.1%, a 170 basis point increase from the prior year quarter largely due to a decrease in earned premium.\nNow I'd like to provide some context around midyear reinsurance renewals and recent conditions in the reinsurance market before moving to Life and Retirement. We purchased our major reinsurance treaties at January 1. However, approximately 20% of our overall core reinsurance purchasing occurs in the second quarter as we have a number of core midyear renewals, predominantly in specialty classes, and they were all successfully placed.\nIn addition, we decided to purchase additional retrocessional protection for Validus Re and a low excess of loss reinsurance placement for Private Client Group ahead of the wind season. Overall, the market exhibited more orderly behavior during midyear renewals amidst more stable trading conditions compared to January 1. Reinsure appetite for more discrete purchases increased somewhat, enabling a number of buyers to make up for shortfalls in coverage experienced at January 1.\nOverall, midyear property cat pricing increased 25% to 35% [indiscernible] in the U.S. driven by Florida. This was the second year in a row of substantial rate increases. International renewals, driven by Australia and New Zealand, saw price increase [ 20% ] to 50% with higher increases resulting from loss activity in the region.\nIn previous calls, I touched on the increase in catastrophe losses from secondary perils. Through the first half of 2023, the industry has already experienced over $50 billion of insured losses, the majority of which were due to secondary perils, making 2023 already the fourth highest year on an inflation-adjusted basis.\nA majority of insured losses continue to occur in the United States, highlighting the difficulty of managing volatility in the largest insurance market in the world. Against this challenging backdrop and a strengthened reinsurance rating environment, we maintained our conservative risk appetite and continue to have one of the lowest peak peril net positions in the market while managing our overall reinsurance spend.\nAdditionally, through each of our renewals, we maintain all of our principal relationships with our key reinsurance partners. While we are exiting the assumed reinsurance business through the sale of Validus Re, our ownership of RenRe common stock that we will receive as part of the purchase price consideration coupled with our ability to invest up to $500 million in RenRe's capital partner vehicles will allow us to continue to participate and benefit from partnering with a world-class reinsurer with less risk and capital requirements.\nTurning to Life and Retirement. As I noted earlier, the business produced very good results in the second quarter. Adjusted pretax income was $991 million. And adjusted return on segment equity was 12.2%, representing a 250 basis point improvement year-over-year.\nPremiums and deposits grew 42% year-over-year to $10 billion driven by record Fixed Index Annuity sales. Corebridge ended the [ quarter ] with a strong balance sheet with parent liquidity of $1.6 billion and a financial leverage ratio of 28%. Over the second quarter, we continue to make good progress against the Corebridge operational separation so that it can eventually be a fully standalone company.\nA key focus has been executing against IT separation, which we believe will be substantially complete by the end of this year. To date, approximately 55% of the transition service agreements put in place at the time of the IPO have already been exited.\nNow turning to capital management. As I noted earlier, in the second quarter, we returned approximately $822 million to shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends. And the additional $400 million of common stock we repurchased in July brings the total amount of capital we've returned to shareholders since the beginning of the second quarter to over $1.2 billion.\nIn addition, we continue to focus on maintaining well-capitalized subsidiaries to enable profitable growth across our global portfolio. And we remain committed to having a leverage ratio in the low 20s and a share count between 600 million to 650 million post deconsolidation of Corebridge.\nThe additional liquidity we will have following the closing of the sale of Validus Re will largely be used for share repurchases, which we expect to accelerate beginning in the fourth quarter and as we enter 2024. We also plan to use some of the proceeds from the sale of Validus Re to reduce outstanding debt.\nLastly, with respect to ROCE, we remain highly committed to delivering a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge. During the second quarter, we continued to make meaningful progress on all 4 components of our path to deliver on this commitment. As a reminder, these are sustain and improve underwriting profitability; executing on a simpler, leaner business model across AIG with lower expenses across the organization; operational separation and deconsolidation of Corebridge; and continued balanced capital management. The sequencing of each component has been very important.\nWe are now able to accelerate this work with the GI underwriting turnaround, AIG 200 and the investment group restructuring largely behind us and the operational separation of [indiscernible] further along in addition to divestitures, which I've already outlined. As I stated on our last call, we're moving away from AIG's historical conglomerate structure to being a leading global insurance company with a leaner and better defined parent company.\nWe continue to expect approximately $500 million in cost reductions across AIG with a cost to achieve of approximately $400 million with substantially faster earn-in of savings than we saw with AIG 200. Sabra will provide more details on our path to a 10%-plus ROCE in her remarks.\nOverall, I could not be more pleased with our progress and what we've accomplished in the first half of the year. Our strong momentum continues, and we have a very solid foundation to build on for the future.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Sabra.\n\nSabra Rose Purtill\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations & Treasurer, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide more detail on second quarter results, including net investment income and underwriting performance, provide a balance sheet update and review the drivers of our path to a 10%-plus adjusted ROCE.\nStarting with second quarter results. As Peter noted, adjusted after-tax income was $1.3 billion, up 15% from last year or an annualized adjusted ROCE of 9.4%. Adjusted after-tax income per diluted share was $1.75, up 26% from last year, reflecting the impact of share repurchases on EPS.\nSecond quarter results were consistent with recent trends: strong underwriting margins and higher net investment income in General Insurance, increased base investment yields and spreads and strong sales in Life and Retirement and continued expense reduction in balanced capital management and Corporate and Other.\nTurning to net investment income. On an APTI basis, investment income improved significantly, up 31% from last year and up 7% sequentially on a consolidated basis and also rose in each segment. Reinvestment rates are driving higher yields. The average new money yield was 5.46%, about 210 basis points above the yield on sales and maturities.\nIn General Insurance, this increased the yield on the fixed maturities and loan portfolios 93 basis points over last year and 23 basis points sequentially. In Life and Retirement, the yield improved 75 basis points and 15 basis points, respectively.\nAlternative investment returns also improved this quarter, although they remain below our long-term outlook totaling $147 million for an annualized return of 6.0%. Credit performance has been strong with more upgrades than downgrades in the fixed maturity portfolios and continued derisking of lower-rated assets.\nCommercial property valuations continue to face downward pressure from higher cap rates, which impacts loan to values on commercial mortgage loans and investment returns on real estate equity funds. However, debt service coverage ratios are holding up well and are generally strong across the portfolio, including office.\nTurning to General Insurance. APTI was $1.3 billion, up $62 million from the prior year. Net investment income rose by $267 million. And underwriting income for the current accident year, excluding catastrophe losses, were $73 million.\nTotal catastrophe losses were $250 million, up $129 million and included $56 million of first quarter cat mostly from U.S. events, including a tornado that occurred at quarter end. This was a very solid result, as Peter noted, given the high level of industry catastrophe losses, particularly in North America.\nNorth America cat losses were $159 million, while International totaled $91 million, largely from Typhoon Mawar. During the second quarter, we conducted North America casualty DVRs or detailed valuation reviews, which reviewed about 20% of reserves compared to 15% last year.\nIn our DVRs, we focus on changes in frequency and severity trends, including social and other types of inflation as well as changes in claims trends and settlements such as occurred during COVID. As we noted previously, casualty bodily injury and medical workers' comp trends in our book have been and continue to be more favorable than our reserving assumptions.\nOur approach in these situations is to react quickly to adverse development, but to be conservative and wait to recognize favorable trends until accident years are more mature. We maintain the same approach for the COVID accident years where claims development patterns in many casualty lines slowed.\nFor those years, we have lagged our development factors to allow more time for claims patterns to mature as we are taking the conservative position that industry claims experience will revert to pre-COVID patterns. In addition to the results of the DVRs, prior year development also includes amortization of the ADC gain, changes in prior year catastrophe losses and impacts from loss-sensitive lines that are not related to DVRs.\nIn this quarter, prior year development net of reinsurance and prior year premiums was $25 million favorable. This was made up of $115 million of favorable loss reserve development, partially offset by $90 million of prior year return premium. The lower favorable development compared to last year is mainly attributable to the excess workers' compensation DVR, which was favorable by about $75 million in second quarter last year but is being completed in the third quarter of this year.\nOur favorable loss reserve development included $167 million from North American Commercial Lines, including $41 million of ADC amortization, $50 million of favorable development from our Agrium loss-sensitive portfolio and $74 million of favorable development resulting from North America DVRs. This was partially offset by $62 million of unfavorable development in International Commercial Lines, principally from a multiyear legacy casualty policy that was written with much higher limits than we do today.\nIn the third quarter, DVRs will cover nearly 70% of reserves, including Financial Lines. Financial Lines claims have not returned to the levels we experienced pre-COVID, which we believe reflects improved underwriting, better loss selection, continued ventilation of risk, our reinsurance strategy and achieving appropriate levels of rate.\nWith respect to underwriting, AIG's share of U.S. public company D&O securities class actions where we are the primary insurer is down from 42% in 2017 to about 20% at the end of the second quarter of this year.\nWith respect to rate, since 2018, the compounded increases in the Financial Lines portfolio for corporate and national accounts are greater than 60% and 50%, respectively. However, consistent with our conservative approach, in addition to the lag development factors, we are placing more weight on longer-term experience and balancing out more favorable recent trends.\nTurning to Life and Retirement. As Peter noted, second quarter results were strong with APTI up 30% over 2Q '22 driven by higher spread in underwriting margins and strong sales in Fixed Index Annuities. Both spreads and underwriting margins remain attractive, and fee margins improved with more favorable capital market levels compared to last year.\nBase net investment spreads in Individual and Group Retirement continued to widen with 64 basis points improvement year-over-year and 9 basis points sequentially driven by reinvestment rates. Individual Retirement APTI increased $215 million or 58% from 2Q '22 driven by base spread expansion and growth in general account products. Positive net flows to the general account were about $400 million.\nGroup Retirement APTI grew by $21 million or 12% driven by continued base spread expansion despite negative flows in the general account. Life Insurance APTI decreased $42 million or 35% primarily due to lower other yield enhancement income, partially offset by improved base portfolio returns and marginally favorable mortality experience. Institutional markets delivered very strong results with APTI up $50 million or 65% driven by investment income and reserve growth. Second quarter premiums and deposits reached $2.9 billion with $1.9 billion of pension risk transfer activity and $970 million of GIC transactions.\nTurning to AIG's Other Operations. Second quarter adjusted pretax loss improved by $41 million over last year driven by an $80 million improvement in corporate and other due to the 4Q '22 sale of legacy investment portfolios that had losses of $119 million in 2Q '22. Corporate general operating expenses of $242 million included $67 million of Corebridge expenses, including separation expenses. Excluding Corebridge and separation-related expenses, corporate GOE decreased $19 million from the prior year.\nMoving to the balance sheet. We continue to execute on our balanced capital management strategy with share repurchases, an increase in our common stock dividend and repayment of maturing debt. We ended the quarter with AIG parent liquidity of $4.3 billion.\nWe remain committed to maintaining strong capitalization in our insurance subsidiaries to support risk and growth. The General Insurance U.S. pool risk-based capital ratio is estimated in the 470% to the 480% range, and Life and Retirement is projected to be above its 400% target.\nWe repaid a $388 million debt maturity in the second quarter and continue to target debt leverage in the low 20s post deconsolidation of Corebridge. At June 30, consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital, excluding AOCI, was 26.0%, including about $9.4 billion of Corebridge debt. Book value per common share was $58.49 on June 30, 2023, up 6% from year-end. Adjusted book value per common share was $75.76 per share, flat from year-end.\nTurning to ROCE. We remain intently focused and are making progress on achieving a 10%-plus adjusted ROCE post deconsolidation. Year-to-date, annualized adjusted ROCE for AIG was 9.1% on a consolidated basis and [indiscernible] in General Insurance and 11.4% in Life and Retirement.\nCapital management and rightsizing our equity base for AIG post deconsolidation are material levers for achieving our adjusted ROCE goal. In the near term, we will accelerate share repurchases in the fourth quarter and into 2024 with the additional liquidity from Validus proceeds in addition to ordinary course liquidity generated by our business operations through subsidiary dividends and ongoing profitability.\nWe will balance these share repurchases with additional debt reduction and leverage target. We are committed to achieving a share count between 600 million and 650 million shares post deconsolidation, which we will be able to achieve with the increase in our share repurchase program to $7.5 billion.\nBased on the size, risk profile and profitability of our General Insurance business and holding company needs today, we estimate a pro forma GAAP equity base, excluding AOCI, of approximately $40 billion for AIG ex Corebridge. This is inclusive of about $4 billion in deferred tax asset NOLs that we exclude for adjusted common shareholders' equity calculation.\nConsidering this equity level and our plans to simplify AIG's business and operational structure, reduce volatility and drive more predictable and sustainable profitability, we are confident that we will achieve our adjusted ROCE goal. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Peter.\n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO\n\nThank you, Sabra. And operator, we're ready for questions.",

This conference is being recorded. Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\n\nQuentin John McMillan\n\nVP, MD & Head of IR, American International Group, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, Michelle, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provided details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.\nAdditionally, today's remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com.\nFinally, today's remarks will include results of AIG's Life and Retirement segment and other operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial. AIG's segments and U.S. GAAP financial results as well as AIG's key financial metrics, with respect thereto, differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its earnings call on Tuesday, May 9.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us to review our first quarter financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more financial detail in the quarter, and then we will take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will be available for the Q&A portion of the call.\nAs you saw in our press release, we reported an excellent start to the year. We continue to make meaningful progress across AIG and achieved important milestones, even in the face of ongoing complexity in the insurance industry, volatile market conditions and general economic uncertainty. We continue to diligently execute on our strategic and operational priorities, which drove very strong financial results in the first quarter and are positioning AIG for long-term value creation. Here are some highlights from the first quarter.\nAdjusted after-tax income was $1.2 billion or $1.63 per diluted common share, representing a 9% increase year-over-year. Net investment income on a consolidated basis was $3.1 billion. In 2022, we began to take proactive steps to improve the credit quality, construction and return characteristics of our investment portfolio as well as to reduce volatility. We saw the benefits of these actions in the first quarter and expect that to continue throughout the year. Sabra will provide additional detail on net investment income in her remarks.\nNet premiums written and general insurance grew 10% on a constant dollar basis and adjusted for the International lag elimination that we discussed on our last call. This growth was driven by our Commercial business. Underwriting income was approximately $500 million, a 13% increase year-over-year, which is AIG's strongest first quarter underwriting result. The accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.7%, an 80 basis point improvement from prior year. Life and Retirement reported very good results, with premiums and deposits of $10.4 billion in the first quarter, a 44% increase year-over-year, supported by record sales in fixed annuity and fixed index annuity products.\nNet flows into the general account from individual retirement were approximately $1.3 billion. Corebridge and Blackstone have made substantial progress advancing their strategic partnership, which began in late 2021. Since that time, Blackstone has invested approximately $11 billion on behalf of Corebridge, with an average gross yield of 6.5% and an average credit rating of A. This partnership has allowed Corebridge to expand in certain asset classes where we had limited to no access in the past, which has been very beneficial for the business and is helping to support growth, particularly in fixed annuity products.\nWe returned approximately $840 million to shareholders in the first quarter through $600 million of common stock repurchases and $240 million of dividends. And we ended the first quarter with strong parent liquidity of $3.9 billion. Overall, I'm very pleased with what we accomplished in the first quarter. The strong momentum we had coming into 2023 continues.\nAs we announced last night, the AIG Board approved the first meaningful increase to AIG's common stock quarterly dividend in many years. Starting in the second quarter, this dividend will be $0.36 per share, an increase of 12.5%. This is another significant milestone for AIG and reflects our commitment to a disciplined balanced capital management strategy and our confidence in the future earnings power of AIG.\nCorebridge is also achieving important milestones. Since its IPO in September of last year, Corebridge has paid 3 dividends to public shareholders, totaling approximately $450 million. And yesterday, the Corebridge Board authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program. During the first quarter, we were prepared to launch a secondary offering of Corebridge common stock, but chose not to proceed when equity markets became volatile due to issues in the financial sector. We continue to be prepared and disciplined in terms of executing a secondary offering, which remains our base case for selling down our ownership in Corebridge, subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals. We remain committed to reducing our ownership interest in Corebridge and will explore other options that are aligned with the best interest of shareholders.\nDuring the remainder of my remarks this morning, I'll provide more information on the following 5 topics: first, I will review the first quarter results for General Insurance; second, I will give a high-level overview of the results for Life and Retirement, and Sabra will provide more detail in her remarks; third, I will provide an update on a few strategic initiatives, including the announcement last week relating to Private Client Services, our MGA partnership with Stone Point Capital, our announcement on Tuesday of the sale of Crop Risk Services, and our intent to sell Laya Healthcare, which is a part of Corebridge and Ireland's second largest health insurance provider; fourth, I will provide more information on capital management actions; lastly, I will review progress on our path to a 10%-plus ROCE, including an update on the work we are doing on the future state business model of AIG.\nTurning to General Insurance. Let me provide more detail on first quarter results, starting with our strong growth in gross and net premiums written. When we refer to gross and net premiums written, all numbers have been adjusted for both foreign exchange and the impact of the lag elimination.\nGross premiums written were $12 billion, an increase of 9%, with Global Commercial growing 13% and Global Personal decreasing 4%. Net premiums written were $7 billion, an increase of 10%. This growth was primarily driven by Global Commercial, which grew 11%, while Global Personnel grew 6%.\nIn North America Commercial, we saw a very strong growth of 15% in net premiums written due to Validus Re, which had over 40% growth year-over-year due to the exceptional results we achieved with our January 1 [ treaty ] placements, which I discussed in detail on our last call. Lexington, which grew over 25%, led by wholesale property and casualty, double-digit growth in Captive Solutions and Glatfelter.\nFocusing on Lexington for a moment, I would like to highlight a few achievements from the first quarter. The business continues to drive excellent performance, impressive growth and has consistently improved its portfolio quarter after quarter over the last couple of years. Lexington's tremendous growth has been achieved through its relevance in the marketplace and increasing its market share, not from increasing limits deployed. Strong retention, new business and rate have been the key drivers of Lexington's financial performance. Lexington has now seen double-digit rate increases for 16 consecutive quarters, and cumulative compounded rate increases totaled over 100% since the first quarter of 2018.\nAdditionally, over the last few years, the average size of a Lexington Property primary policy went from $100 million in limits deployed to $5 million. This has substantially reduced volatility in Lexington's portfolio. Our thoughtful and prudent growth strategy, together with our shift in focus to wholesale distribution, continues to serve us well, particularly in the E&S market.\nI also want to provide more color on Validus Re. We've provided significant detail on the 1/1 renewal season on our last call, and I think it's worth expanding on a few items from the first quarter. Net premiums written were very strong and balanced in Validus Re, and we continued to meaningfully improve the quality of the portfolio. Rate improvements were particularly strong in U.S. property, international property, marine and energy, casualty and specialty lines.\nWith respect to April 1 renewals across the portfolio, gross and net premiums written increased. And within International property, limits deployed were reduced slightly, and Japan property cat risk-adjusted rates were up approximately 20%. As we consider our deployment strategy at the June 1 renewal cycle, which focuses on U.S. wind exposure, we will continue to maintain a prudent approach on limits deployed. We do not expect to deploy additional limits beyond our current aggregate allocated to Florida, although we do anticipate significant rate increases and improved terms and conditions. Like General Insurance, the Validus Re portfolio has been completely re-underwritten with a focus on risk-adjusted returns. The business had a terrific first quarter and is well positioned for profitable growth through the rest of the year.\nShifting back to our 15% net premiums written growth in the first quarter, this result was impressive despite the headwinds we continue to see in Financial Lines, where overall net premiums written contracted 9% due to increased competition putting pressure on pricing, as well as continued slowdown in M&A and other transactional business. We are one of the very few lead markets in large account public D&O where primary rates have remained relatively flat year-over-year. In contrast, high excess public company D&O saw rate declines greater than 20%.\nTo put this in perspective, this represents a little over 5% of our overall North America Financial Lines business, and we will continue to manage this book very prudently. We have deep domain knowledge and experience, data, best-in-class underwriting capabilities and leading claims expertise that allow us to differentiate ourselves in the D&O marketplace.\nDuring the past year, we continue to see new competitors with limited experience into the high access public D&O market. This is driving down pricing in what is traditionally the most commoditized portion of a placement. Despite these dynamics, we remain disciplined on price and are taking a long-term view of this line of business. We have significant scale and geographic balance on our portfolio, and we will not follow the market down.\nTurning to International Commercial. Net premiums written grew 6%, primarily due to property, which was up over 40%; Global Specialty, which was up over 15%; and Casualty, which was up over 15%. Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention of 88% in its in-force portfolio, International was up 200 basis points to 88%, and North America was up 100 basis points to 87%. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes. And across Global Commercial, we continue to see strong new business, which was over $1 billion in the first quarter.\nInternational Commercial new business was over $590 million, led by specialty, which increased its new business by over 50%, driven by energy and marine. North America Commercial, excluding Validus Re, achieved new business of over $480 million, driven by Lexington, which saw excellent new business growth of over 50%. With respect to rate in North America Commercial, excluding Validus Re, rates increased 7% in the first quarter or 8% if you exclude workers' compensation, and the exposure increase was 2%.\nIn North America Commercial, rate was driven by Lexington wholesale, which was up 26% with wholesale property up 35%. For Lexington Property wholesale, this was its strongest quarterly rate increase. Rate in retail property was also up significantly at 32%; International Commercial rate increases were 8%, driven by Talbot at 16%, International Property at 11% and specialty at 9%. The exposure increase in the International portfolio was 2%. Rate plus exposure remains above loss cost trend at 9% in North America, 10% if you exclude workers' compensation, and 10% in International.\nTurning to Personal Insurance. First quarter results reflect our continued repositioning of this business, especially PCG, given our announcement of the creation of a managing general agency in partnership with Stone Point Capital. I will provide more information on the MGA later in my remarks.\nNorth America Personal net premiums written increased 57%, driven by lower quota share cessions in PCG at January 1, as we transition to writing the business as an MGA, along with the recognition of an improved portfolio. The combination of improved pricing in our admitted business and more business migrating to the non-admitting market has a very positive impact on PCG's accident and policy or loss ratios. This will earn in through the second half of 2023 and into 2024.\nEntering 2023, we required less excess to loss reinsurance on the upper end of our reinsurance program due to realized reduction in PCG's PMLs at all return periods as a result of ongoing improvements in risk selection and reductions in aggregate in peak zones. More specifically, all peril and all return periods from 1 in 20 to 1 in 1,000 reduced on average by 40%, while those same return periods with respect to wildfire reduced on average by 60%. These dynamics further impacted net premiums written in the first quarter.\nSyndicate 2019 continues to act as a mechanism to enable third-party capital providers to support PCG's high and ultra-high net worth business for the 2023 accident year.\nIn terms of expectations for PCG for the full year, we expect net premiums written growth to be at or higher than we saw in the first quarter, the loss ratio to meaningfully improve and the acquisition ratio and general operating expense to also improve.\nTurning to International Personal. Net premiums written were largely flat in the first quarter, travel and warranty grew while personal property declined, all driven by a further refinement of our cat reinsurance cost allocation methodology, making year-over-year comparisons difficult.\nAccident & Health had some timing issues that impacted net premiums written in the first quarter. We expect to see growth in International Personnel for the remainder of 2023 and believe results will continue to strengthen as we move through the year.\nShifting to combined ratios. As I noted earlier, the first quarter accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 88.7%, an 80 basis point improvement year-over-year. In Global Commercial, the first quarter accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 84.9%, a 110 basis point improvement year-over-year, and we reported a 24% increase in underwriting income.\nThe North America Commercial accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 85.7%, a 240 basis point improvement year-over-year. The International Commercial accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was essentially flat at 83.7%, which is an outstanding result. Global Personal reported a first quarter accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, of 98.6%, a 120 basis point increase from the prior year quarter, largely due to a decrease in earned premium from our deliberate reduction in gross exposure in PCG in North America.\nNow let me comment on catastrophes. The cat loss ratio in the quarter was 4.2% or $264 million of catastrophe losses. Our largest loss in the period was from 2 storms in New Zealand, which accounted for $126 million of catastrophe losses.\nLooking at North America, total losses from catastrophe-related activities in the first quarter were $116 million, which includes Validus Re. In International, excluding Japan, we have eroded approximately $75 million of our aggregate retention and have approximately $75 million net remaining, plus the annual aggregate deductible for each cat loss for the rest of the year. As we described on our last call, the reinsurance program we structured at this year's January 1 renewal provides us with the ability to manage volatility and severity. Looking ahead to the rest of 2023, we expect to see very strong top line growth in General Insurance.\nTurning to Life and Retirement. The business delivered strong performance in the first quarter. Adjusted pretax income was $886 million for the first quarter, and adjusted return on segment equity was 10.7%. First quarter results benefited from continued growth in spread-based products and related spread income. As I mentioned earlier, premiums and deposits grew significantly in the first quarter, driven by strong new individual retirement business, which, despite increasing surrenders related to interest rates, contributed to growth in the general account. The balance sheet and capital position of Corebridge remains strong, with $1.8 billion of parent liquidity.\nTurning to our strategic initiatives. Last week, we executed a definitive documentation with Stone Point Capital for the launch of Private Client Services, an MGA that will serve the high and ultra-high net worth market. We are excited about the prospects for PCS and are confident of the value this new operating structure will deliver for clients, brokers and other stakeholders. We look forward to continuing this journey with the PCS management team and the ongoing support of Stone Point Capital.\nSubject to regulatory approvals, the MGA is expected to formally launch in the third quarter of this year, and we expect to bring on additional capital providers through the second half of 2023. As part of our ongoing review process, we regularly assess the composition of our portfolio of businesses to ensure it is aligned with our long-term strategy and best positioned to create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.\nAs part of this review, as you saw in our announcement on Tuesday, we executed a definitive documentation to sell Crop Risk Services, or CRS, to American Financial Group for $240 million. We acquired CRS as part of our broader acquisition of Validus Holdings in 2018. AIG will continue to write business for the 2023 spring crop season, which ends June 30. We expect approximately $700 million to $800 million of net premiums written for 2023, 75% of which booked in the first quarter. Starting in the third quarter, AIG will act as a fronting partner for American Financial Group during a transitional period.\nFor full year 2023, we expect to retain about $800 million to $900 million of earned premiums, $750 million of which we'll earn in over the remainder of the year. CRS is a well-run and attractive business, led by a high-quality management team. In American Financial Group, we have found a high-quality partner for CRS and its employees and believe the business will benefit from being part of a larger combined platform. We also continually review the product portfolio and geographic footprint of Corebridge as we position this business for the future as a fully stand-alone company.\nAfter a comprehensive review of the health product offering, we decided to evaluate strategic alternatives and a potential sale of Laya Healthcare, the private medical insurance business in Ireland. We believe this will help to streamline the Corebridge portfolio and allow it to focus on Life and Retirement products and solutions.\nTurning to capital management. The first quarter marked another quarter of continued progress and execution of our balanced strategy. In addition to the first quarter share repurchases and dividends that I mentioned earlier, against the backdrop of an unstable macroeconomic environment, we thought it was prudent to raise $750 million of debt at the end of March. This provided us with financial flexibility to pay down a near-term debt maturity and complete additional share repurchases at what we viewed as attractive share prices.\nTurning to return on common equity. We remain highly committed and laser-focused on delivering a 10%-plus ROCE. Through the first quarter, we continued to make meaningful progress on the 4 components of our path to deliver on this commitment. As a reminder, these components include sustained and improved underwriting profitability; executing on a simpler, leaner business model across AIG; operational separation and deconsolidation of Corebridge; and continued balanced capital management. Given the number of strategic initiatives we are executing at once, we are taking a long-term view while measuring progress in 90-day increments. We advanced each component during the first quarter and expect this to continue throughout 2023.\nAs I discussed earlier, our first quarter financial results were excellent, with continued top line growth and improvement in underwriting profitability in General Insurance. Over the last few months, we accelerated our work to establish AIG's future state business model. Sequencing has been very important on our journey and the work that's been accomplished over the last few years on the General Insurance turnaround, AIG 200, the separation and IPO of Corebridge and restructuring of our Investment Management group. This has positioned us to move forward as a more focused and simplified AIG.\nEvolving our future state business model will result in us moving away from the conglomerate structure AIG operated in for decades. We will eliminate overlap and significantly reduce decentralized infrastructure across the company, which will lead to a leaner business model, particularly in our operations. In future state, we expect a redefined AIG parent expense structure to be approximately 1% to 1.5% of premiums, which today is roughly $250 million to $350 million. AIG parent will have 5 primary roles and objectives: public company matters, including finance, legal, compliance and regulatory oversight as well as corporate governance; communications with key stakeholders, including the investment community, rating agencies, regulators, policymakers and AIG colleagues; risk management; culture, performance and human capital management; and strategy, including business development, M&A and design and execution of key initiatives.\nAs we progress our future state business model, we anticipate achieving approximately $500 million in cost reductions at AIG parent and a cost to achieve of around $400 million, with substantially quicker earn-in of savings that we achieved with AIG 200.\nAs expense savings begin to earn through, the reductions will largely be seen in other operations, which is where general operating expenses are currently accounted for.\nWith respect to Corebridge, I took you through our current thinking on separation and timing of the secondary offerings.\nLastly, on capital management. We continue to maintain appropriate levels of capital in our subsidiaries to support profitable growth. We remain on track to reduce AIG common stock outstanding to be between 600 million and 650 million shares and achieve a debt-to-capital leverage at the lower end of our 20% [ and ] 25% range post deconsolidation of Corebridge.\nAs I noted earlier, we increased our common stock dividend by 12.5%, starting in the second quarter of this year. And in addition to our stock repurchases in the first quarter, to date, we have repurchased $240 million of AIG common stock in the second quarter. Apart from the progress we're making on these components of our path to a 10%-plus ROCE, we also expect tailwinds from higher reinvestment yields. We are confident that our continued progress on strategic initiatives and our capital management strategy will allow us to achieve our ROCE targets and deliver long-term profitable growth that benefits all of our stakeholders.\nI will now turn the call over to Sabra.\n\nSabra Rose Purtill\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations & Treasurer, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Peter. This morning, I will cover 2 accounting changes, provide more details on first quarter results and give an overview of commercial mortgage loans. First, the 1-month lag in financial reporting for the General Insurance International segment was eliminated last quarter. The lag elimination did not impact earnings significantly but it did affect premiums written comparisons to 2022. Details on the premium impacts are in the financial supplement on Page 26.\nSecond, we adopted the change in accounting standard for certain long-duration products, commonly called LDTI. Yesterday, 8-Ks were filed that provide restated prior year financial results for AIG and Corebridge. The cumulative effect at year-end 2022 was an increase of $1.5 billion to adjusted equity and an increase of $1.0 billion to total shareholders' equity. This impact is consistent with our previous guidance. As a reminder, this is a GAAP accounting change only and does not impact statutory results, insurance company cash flows or economic returns. Going forward, we expect a modest run rate increase in L&R APTI and less market and mortality-driven volatility from the change in accounting standards.\nTurning to the quarter, as Peter mentioned, AIG's first quarter adjusted after-tax income was $1.2 billion or $1.63 per diluted share, up 9% from last year on a restated basis and up 25% from originally reported. Key trends in the quarter, and similar to the last 3 quarters, were higher GI underwriting results and higher income from fixed maturities and loans and lower alternative investment income. Compared to the prior year quarter, there was a higher impact from noncontrolling interest from the Corebridge IPO in 3Q '22.\nConsolidated net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.1 billion. Similar to the fourth quarter, income from fixed maturities and loans in both GI and L&R rose sequentially and over the prior year, while returns on alternative investments were down $593 million compared to very strong annualized returns of 28% last year.\nIncome on fixed maturities and loans rose by $573 million over the prior year, with average new money reinvestment rates of 5.35%, about 220 basis points above sales and maturities. The yield rose to 4.29%, up 78 basis points from 1Q '22 and 23 basis points over 4Q '22. Part of the increase in fixed maturity yields resulted from our proactive repositioning over the last 2 quarters in the U.S. GI portfolio. We sold and reinvested about $6 billion in fixed maturities, resulting in a realized loss of $224 million, but added 9 basis points of GI yield improvement for the quarter. We expect incremental yield pickup from this repositioning in 2Q '23 and also from higher reinvestment rates throughout 2023 based on the current rate and spread environment.\nTurning to the segments. GI adjusted pretax income or APTI was $1.2 billion, $37 million higher than 1Q '22, principally due to a $56 million increase in underwriting income from both higher-earned premiums and a 1 point improvement in the calendar year combined ratio, which was 91.9%. Peter covered underwriting results in detail, but I want to add that GI reserves had favorable prior year development, net of reinsurance at prior year premiums of $54 million.\nTurning to L&R results for the first quarter. APTI was $886 million, down $48 million compared to $934 million in 1Q '22, as restated. Consistent with GI, L&R had a strong increase in base portfolio investment income but lower alternative investment income. Mortality experience improved, but fee income was down due to lower capital market levels compared to a year ago. As Peter noted, L&R premiums and deposits were very strong at $10.4 billion. Notably, Individual Retirement sales were $4.9 billion, a 26% increase over the prior year quarter with record levels of fixed and fixed index annuity sales because of higher crediting rates.\nGroup Retirement deposits grew 19%, with higher out-of-plan fixed annuity sales and new plan acquisitions. Strong fixed and fixed index annuity sales, net of surrenders, resulted in $1.3 billion of positive flows to the general account and Individual Retirement, up from $0.7 billion last year. While surrenders are up, they remain below projections. Variable annuity net flows, which impact the separate account, were negative.\nTo conclude on earnings for the quarter, other operations adjusted pretax loss or APTL was $491 million, a $70 million increase due to lower APTI from consolidated investment entities in Asset Management, which had strong private equity results in 1Q '22. Corporate GOE decreased $27 million from the prior year and $77 million from 4Q '22 despite $29 million of additional expense related to the corporate separation.\nTurning to AIG's balance sheet. Book value per common share was $58.87 at quarter end, up 7% from year-end, principally due to higher valuations on available-for-sale securities due to lower long-term interest rates. Adjusted book value was $75.87 per share, roughly flat with year-end. At the end of March, we issued $750 million of senior notes, a portion of which was used to pay down an April bond maturity.\nOur leverage ratio declined to 32.8%, down about 1 point from year-end even with the new issuance, due to the change in AOCI in the quarter. Excluding AOCI and the Fortitude-embedded derivative, debt leverage was 26.3%.\nFor the first quarter of 2023, AIG's consolidated adjusted ROCE was 8.7%, comprised of 11.6% in GI and 10.7% in L&R. As Peter discussed, we are laser-focused on achieving a 10%-plus ROCE post deconsolidation.\nPeter provided a lot of detail on the quarter. So I'll use my remaining time to cover investments, particularly Commercial mortgage loans, given the recent focus on this asset class. First, I want to emphasize that our investment portfolio is grounded in the liability profile of our 2 insurance businesses. We strive to achieve strong risk-adjusted returns while matching the duration, cash flow and liquidity needs of the liabilities.\nOver the last several years, we have improved the risk profile of the investment portfolio by reducing capital-intensive, less liquid or more volatile assets such as hedge funds. With the onset of COVID and again, with rising interest rates last year, we further tightened investment guidelines and moved up in quality, including the GI repositioning mentioned earlier and also sales of L&R non-investment-grade assets.\nTurning to our Commercial mortgage loan exposures, I'll start by noting that our mortgages are senior secured loans on high-quality properties that are well diversified by type and geography, with strong loan to values or LTVs averaging 59% and debt service coverage ratios averaging 1.9x. We are the lead lender on more than 80% of our loans, which gives us important control rights.\nExcluding Fortitude funds withheld assets, we had $33.8 billion of Commercial mortgage loans at the end of March, of which $30.3 billion were at Corebridge and $3.5 billion at General Insurance. The largest property type is multifamily housing or apartments, about 40% of our commercial mortgage loans. Industrial property loans are about 16% of the portfolio. Both multifamily and industrial are performing well. We are, however, focused on traditional U.S. office, which is $5.4 billion or 2% of AIG's invested assets. Our U.S. office allocation has been shrinking for several years, particularly when we tightened underwriting standards further for office, retail and hotels with the onset of COVID. Currently, 94% of the office loans are high-quality rated CM1 or CM2 with debt service coverage averaging about 2.1x and weighted average LTVs of 64%. Valuations are updated annually by a third party, and we continue to monitor valuations given rising cap rates.\nWe also have a credit or CECL allowance against the portfolio of about $330 million or 3.7% against the office loan portfolio and $584 million for the total commercial mortgage portfolio or 1.7%, which is higher than many peers as we use CMBS default data in our methodology. Roughly 3/4 of the building securing the loans are Class A or newer buildings with better amenities. The majority are in the top 5 U.S. metropolitan areas and concentrated in central business districts, including in New York City, which historically has been one of the strongest office markets in the country.\nToday, we are intensely focused on office loan maturities in the next 2 years, about $2 billion or 28 loans. We are already in discussions with many borrowers about their plans and our requirements for refinancing or extension, including additional equity revised terms or other commitments. While valuations are under pressure, cash flows are the primary source of debt service for our loans, and we will continue to monitor the loans carefully. We look forward to updating you on our investment performance in the quarters ahead.\nTo wrap up, our first quarter 2023 results demonstrate continued sustained and strong financial results, rising investment portfolio yields, significant progress against strategic initiatives, robust capital and liquidity and continued progress on our path to a 10%-plus ROCE.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Peter.",

This conference is being recorded. Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please, go ahead.\n\nQuentin John McMillan\n\nVP, MD & Head of IR, American International Group, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.\nAdditionally, today's remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at www.aig.com.\nFinally, today's remarks will discuss the results of AIG's Life and Retirement segment and Other Operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial Inc.\nAIG's segments and U.S. GAAP financial results as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its own earnings call tomorrow on Friday, February 17, and will provide additional details on its results.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on certain topics, including Life and Retirement results and our path to a 10%-or-greater ROCE, and then we will take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy would join us for the Q&A portion of the call.\nToday, I will cover 4 topics: First, I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter financial results. Second, I will review highlights from the full year, including some of our major accomplishments, which were remarkable given the very challenging conditions we faced throughout 2022 in the equity markets and the insurance industry. Third, I will unpack in some detail market conditions leading up to January 1 reinsurance renewals, where we saw significant shifts that we believe will impact the industry throughout 2023 and perhaps longer. Suffice it to say, this 1/1 renewal season was the most challenged that many, including myself, have seen in our careers. And fourth, I will outline our 2023 priorities and outlook regarding capital management.\nBefore turning to our results, I'd like to welcome Sabra to the call. We are fortunate to have her in the interim CFO role, while Shane is on a medical leave. Regarding Shane, I am personally, deeply appreciative of the tremendous outreach from many of you, the number of people who have sent good wishes for a speedy recovery is incredibly meaningful to me, and our management team, and particularly, to Shane and his family. We look forward to welcoming him back to AIG.\nNow let me begin with a brief overview of AIG's fourth quarter results. Adjusted after-tax income in the fourth quarter was $1 billion and $1.36 per diluted common share. We repurchased approximately 780 million of AIG common stock and redeemed $1.8 billion of debt. AIG paid $243 million in dividends in the fourth quarter and Corebridge paid 2 dividends, totaling approximately $300 million following its IPO in September of 2022.\nTurning to General Insurance. In the fourth quarter, the accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, improved 140 basis points year-over-year to 88.4%, representing the 18th consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Notably, underwriting income in the fourth quarter increased 27% year-over-year to $635 million.\nGlobal Commercial drove the year-over-year increase, achieving an accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, of 84.1%, a 380 basis point improvement and a 69% increase in underwriting income.\nGlobal Personal reported an accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, of 100.4%, a 610 basis point increase from the prior year quarter, as we continued to reposition this portfolio.\nMoving to Global Commercial. On an FX-adjusted basis, North America Commercial net premiums written increased 3% and international increased 2%. Global Commercial had strong renewal retention in its in-force portfolio, and new business continued to be strong.\nTurning to REIT. Momentum continued in North America Commercial, with overall rate increases in the quarter of 3%, 7% if you exclude Financial Lines and 9% if you also exclude workers' compensation. These rate increases were driven by Retail Property at 15%, Lexington at 12% and Excess Casualty at 9%, and the exposure increase in the North America portfolio was 3%.\nInternational Commercial rate increases were 4%, driven by Asia Pacific at 9% and EMEA at 7%, and the exposure increase in the international portfolio was around 2%. Pricing, which includes rate plus exposure, was up 6% in both North America and international. While we experienced downward pressure on rate in certain lines early in the fourth quarter, we saw a reacceleration of price increases towards the end of the quarter.\nFor example, Retail Property was up 15% in the fourth quarter with rate improvement of 24% in December when market impacts from increased catastrophes started to be felt. We saw a similar upward movement at Lexington and particularly within the Property portfolio, with December seeing the strongest rate increases in the fourth quarter. Overall, we continue to earn rate above loss cost trends, which contributed to positive margin expansion.\nIn Global Personal, starting with North America, net premiums written declined 7%, reflecting our ongoing reshaping of this portfolio, particularly in the high and ultra-high net worth businesses that are part of PCG. Later in my remarks, I will discuss our announcement on Monday relating to PCG and our partnership with Stone Point Capital to create a new Managing General Agency or MGA.\nIn International Personal, net premiums written slightly increased by 1% on an FX-adjusted basis due to a rebound in travel and growth in A&H.\nNow turning to the full year. We made tremendous progress throughout 2022 on a number of key priorities. I could not be more pleased with our team's ability to execute on multiple, complex, strategic objectives across AIG at once. Our most significant and impactful accomplishment was completing the IPO of Corebridge in September of 2022. Despite the very challenging equity market conditions we had to navigate. Notably, Corebridge was last year's largest IPO in the U.S. and the largest financial services IPO since 2020.\nWe also continue to grow underwriting income in General Insurance, which increased approximately $1 billion year-over-year, the second year in a row with over $1 billion of growth in underwriting income. As I noted on last quarter's call, we also reached significant milestones on AIG 200 that have modernized our technology infrastructure and operational capabilities while executing on an exit run rate savings of $1 billion, 6 months ahead of schedule.\nWe also changed AIG's investment management strategy and structure through successful partnerships with Blackstone and BlackRock, and we are seeing the benefits of these partnerships across AIG and Corebridge.\nTurning to full year consolidated financial results for AIG. Adjusted after-tax income in 2022 reached $3.6 billion and was $4.55 per diluted common share. We returned $6.1 billion to shareholders through $5.1 billion of AIG common stock repurchases and $1 billion of dividends. We finished 2022 with 734 million shares outstanding, a 10% decrease since the end of 2021. And we executed on a number of capital management actions to establish the stand-alone Corebridge capital structure while reducing AIG debt by roughly $10 billion.\nConsolidated financial debt outstanding was approximately $21 billion at year-end with $11.8 billion at AIG and $9.4 billion at Corebridge.\nNow let me cover full year 2022 results for General Insurance. As you know, an important aspect of our turnaround over the last few years has been instituting a culture of underwriting excellence. And our rigor in this area is now clearly benefiting our financial results. General Insurance achieved underwriting income of $2 billion in 2022, despite the industry again experiencing over $100 billion of insured natural catastrophe losses. And we exceeded our combined ratio commitment by achieving a sub-90 accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, in all 4 quarters.\nAs I've noted on prior calls, and it's worth repeating, since 2018, we completely overhauled our underwriting standards and overlaid these standards with a comprehensive reinsurance program that can adapt to market conditions into our portfolio as it continues to change and improve. Overall, gross limits deployed were reduced by over $1.2 trillion during this period. We also meaningfully and deliberately shifted our global portfolio mix in order to reposition AIG for the future.\nFor example, Global Commercial now represents 74% of our net premiums written, up from 57% in 2018. And Lexington is now 17% of our North America Commercial business, up from 12% in 2018. If you exclude Validus Re, Lexington is now 23% of North America Commercial. As a result of this work, our current portfolio is very well positioned for 2023. I will discuss in more detail later, when I review January 1 reinsurance renewals, how market dynamics have shifted and how AIG should benefit as we look to capitalize on attractive opportunities for better risk-adjusted returns.\nNow let me highlight a few of the key businesses in General Insurance that contributed to our performance in 2022. Lexington, our market-leading excess and surplus lines business, had 18% net premiums written growth in 2022, up over 50% since we transitioned this business to focus on the wholesale market. This business also increased underwriting profitability, excluding CATs, by 60%, and it achieved a sub-80% accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, for 2022.\nGlatfelter continued its terrific performance, growing net premiums written by 14%, increasing underwriting income and achieving an 85% accident year combined ratio, ex CATs. The acquisition of Glatfelter allowed us to significantly elevate the quality of our programs business.\nGlobal Specialty, which includes our Global Marine, Energy and Aviation businesses, grew net premiums written by over 15% on an FX-adjusted basis. This was driven by strong client retention of 88%, new business growth and rate increases across the portfolio. Global Specialty generated strong earnings in 2022 with an impressive accident year combined ratio, excluding CATs, of 80%.\nThese are just some examples of businesses that we prioritized last year based on their market position, our differentiated value proposition to clients and our ability to generate strong underwriting results. We see great opportunities for these businesses going forward, and they are strong anchors for AIG that we expect will contribute to profitable growth in 2023.\nOur Global Personal business performed well considering some of the post-pandemic headwinds we saw in the first half of 2022 and our strategic repositioning of the business. Also, as I mentioned on our last call, the impact from deemed hospitalizations in Japan and, to a lesser extent, Taiwan, contributed over $160 million in losses in 2022, having a 290 basis point impact on the International Personal accident year combined ratio. This accident health product was discontinued in 2022.\nTurning to full year net premiums written. General Insurance grew 4% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven by 6% growth in Global Commercial. North America grew 7% and International Commercial grew 6%. We had strong renewal retention in our in-force portfolio, with North America improving by 300 basis points to 86% and International achieving 86% for the full year. And as a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes.\nTurning to underwriting profitability for the full year. 2022 was another year with strong progress. The General Insurance accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, was 88.7%, an improvement of 230 basis points year-over-year. The full year saw a 180 basis point improvement in the accident year loss ratio, ex CATs, and a 50 basis point improvement in the expense ratio.\nGlobal Commercial achieved an impressive accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, of 84.5%, an improvement of 460 basis points year-over-year. The loss ratio was the biggest contributor with a 330 basis point improvement, and the combined ratio, including CATs and PYD of 89.6%, represented a 920 basis point improvement year-over-year.\nThe accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, in Global Personal deteriorated 430 basis points to 99.2% for the reasons I've outlined before.\nNow let me turn to reinsurance renewals at January 1 of this year. As I stated on our last earnings call, we knew this renewal season will be very challenging and lead to fundamental changes in the market that would impact 1/1 renewals. The market was faced with a combination of factors that added further pressure to dynamics that were already creating considerable stress. We had top global macroeconomic trends. We had geopolitical uncertainty. We had short-term pressure on the asset side of the balance sheet as a consequence of rising interest rates, inflation and currency fluctuation. We had additional natural catastrophe losses late in the fourth quarter and increasing frequency and severity of secondary perils continued.\nAnd 2022 ended with over $130 billion of insured natural catastrophe losses, making 2022 the fifth costliest year on record for insurers, with 5 out of the last 6 years having exceeded $100 billion. Hurricane Ian, in particular, proved to be a catalyst that changed market dynamics even more significantly than expected and ultimately led to shifts in the market that required the industry to rethink reinsurance placements and the commensurate changes that needed to take place in the primary market.\nThe unprecedented levels of natural catastrophes on a global scale massively impacted the reinsurance market in a couple of ways. Increased natural CAT activity has resulted in elevated property CAT ceded loss ratios, with average incurred loss ratios from 2017 through 2022 exceeding 85% compared to 2012 through 2016 when average incurred loss ratios trended below 30%, a dramatic deterioration.\nAnd over the last 5 years, secondary perils contributed more than 50% to ultimate loss when compared to primary perils. These market dynamics also impacted the supply of reinsurance and retrocessional capacity and the cost of capital increase for the industry, which impacted almost all lines of business and territories, regardless of loss experienced. On top of all of this, very little new capital entered the market. Available capital is estimated to have decreased approximately 20% year-over-year.\nNow let me outline what happened in the property CAT and retro markets in particular, due to the high level of CAT losses in 2022, which were further exacerbated by events in the fourth quarter. 50% of global Property CAT limits, which we estimate to be $425 billion, renewed at January 1. Approximately 70% of Global retro limits estimated at $60 billion incept at January 1. Reinsurers heavily reliant on peak peril retro protection face greater pressure as a result, whereas larger, more diversified reinsurers were better able to manage retro capacity constraints. As a result, a majority of programs placed on January 1 saw insurance companies forced increase retentions.\nDespite these market challenges, AIG navigated this complex and intense renewal season extremely well. We knew we were in a strong position heading into January 1, given the repositioning and the improved quality of our Global portfolio, coupled with our considerable efforts to reduce our gross portfolio peak exposures. As we expected, this allowed us to capitalize on many attractive opportunities, and this proved to be a competitive advantage as we had an exceptionally successful renewal season.\nIt's also worth noting that AIG's reinsurance purchasing is, by design, more heavily weighted to January 1 than the wider market. The benefits of this are twofold. Concentrating the bulk of our purchasing at January 1 allows AIG to maximize the outcome across all of our reinsurance placements. And we have clear line of sight on our reinsurance cost for the full year, which is particularly valuable in a market, which we believe will continue to be incredibly challenging.\nSome of the highlights of our January placements include the following: with respect to property catastrophe placements, we obtained more limit than we purchased in 2022; and we believe we have the lowest attachment points on a return period measurement for North America windstorm and earthquake amongst our peer group; and our modeled exhaust limits are at higher return periods compared to last year for each of our placements. These placements should further reduce volatility, which is something we remain very focused on, and they provide us with significant balance sheet protection in the event one or a series of significant catastrophe events occur.\nSpecifically, we separately made appropriate changes to our North America property CAT treaties to reflect our improving portfolio, with the retention of our commercial CAT portfolio attaching at $500 million and Lexington in our Programs business having an attachment point of $300 million. The property CAT aggregate cover that we placed has 4 retentions before attaching, and for North America, Japan, and Rest of World, it now could attach in the second event, which is an improvement from 2022.\nOur property CAT [per occurrence] structures largely stayed the same for International, and we believe they are market-leading with Japan's retention staying flat at $200 million and the rest of world attaching at $125 million.\nMany factors improved our overall property CAT reinsurance program, with highlights being: we were able to attain approximately $6 billion of limit, including increasing our per occurrence excess of loss placement; we maintained low attachment points on a model basis; we received support for a $500 million aggregate placement; and our overall spend for AIG increased less than 10% on an absolute and risk-adjusted basis versus 2022.\nWith respect to PCG, we accelerated portfolio remediation, which is driving further gross exposure reductions in key CAT-exposed states where loss costs, inflation and necessary modeling changes have not kept pace. This allowed us to reduce the total limit purchase for the PCG-specific CAT program, which partially offset increased pricing pressure due to Hurricane Ian.\nOverall, casualty renewals, both excess of loss and our quota share placements, renewed close to expiring terms on a risk-adjusted basis with no impact on ceding commissions. Our reinsurance partners maintain their support for AIG with consistent capacity deployment and reinsurance terms in clear recognition of the quality of our portfolio. The outcomes we achieved at January 1 also reflect the value of the investments we have made in our reinsurance strategy, and, coupled with our relationships and credibility with reinsurance partners, are a testament to the confidence the reinsurance marketplace has in AIG and its management team. We appreciate the ongoing support we have received from our reinsurance partners.\nAs we look ahead to 2023, the world faces many uncertainties. And in uncertain times, our role as a market-leading global insurance company is even more important. With the momentum we have built and the strength of our portfolio, AIG is now extremely well positioned to strategically grow and lead the market by providing thoughtful, expert advice on risk solutions for our clients, distribution partners and other stakeholders.\nBy 2022, we have set out ambitious, strategic, and operational priorities for 2023. We will continue to improve and invest in lines of business and General Insurance, where we see significant growth potential, notably Lexington and Global Specialty. I highlight Lexington because it is presented and will continue to present tremendous growth and profitability opportunities for us. And early indications are that the rate momentum we saw in this business at the end of 2022 and into early 2023 will continue. We expect meaningful growth in Lexington this year, led by Property where, over the last few years, we have prudently tightened limits, improved terms and conditions and increased profitability while driving top line growth.\nWe also plan to increase investment in our assumed reinsurance business in 2023, particularly through Validus Re. As we have discussed on prior calls, over the past few years, we've been highly focused on driving value through a disciplined approach, involving strong risk assessments, sound portfolio construction, a steadfast commitment to underwriting excellence and prudent capital management.\nOver this period of time, the derisking within Validus Re was particularly acute in the Global Property CAT market, where year-over-year, we reduced participations across the portfolio while concurrently purchasing sound retrocessional protections to prudently manage the portfolio and reduce volatility, all in line with our cycle management strategy. As a result, we were in a strong position to capitalize on attractive opportunities at January 1. The property market, in particular, repositioned and became very compelling in terms of risk-adjusted rates along with enhanced structures as well as beneficial terms and conditions.\nRate changes within property CAT range between 30% and 100% in the U.S. as well as in peak zones outside the U.S. Risk-adjusted rate increases were approximately 50% in the U.S. Property and 35% in International Property. And similarly, average margin improvement was approximately 50% year-over-year across the entire portfolio.\nProperty CAT ROEs for both the U.S. and International business increased by greater than 100% year-over-year. Additionally, we obtained improved terms and conditions, including favorable movement in attachment points in all Property lines.\nFor Casualty lines, quota shares remained sound with ceding commissions moving favorably for reinsurers by 1 to 2 points, along with terms and conditions remaining in line or improved. The result of these actions included: net premiums written at January 1 increased over $500 million or 50% year-over-year. This increase was driven roughly 30% from U.S., property 15% from International Property, 45% from casualty placements and the remaining 10% was from Specialty, including marine and energy.\nThe majority of new property limit was deployed to existing clients with a significant level of private terms being achieved on our U.S. property writings.\nLooking ahead, we will continue our measured approach for other renewals. For example, if meaningful market changes continue, we will carefully consider our positions at the April 1 Japan renewals, and we will continue to be very cautious with capital deployed at June 1 in Florida.\nTurning to Private Client Group or PCG. This business remains a strategic priority for us in 2023. As you know, over the last 2 years, we have undertaken a significant re-underwriting effort in this portfolio, reduced aggregate exposure, transitioned certain states to the non-admitted market and developed strong partnerships with Lloyd's and reinsurers to reduce volatility.\nOn Monday, we announced our intention to launch, in partnership with Stone Point Capital, a newly formed MGA that will underwrite on behalf of AIG and eventually other capital providers in the high- and ultra-high net worth markets. AIG will transfer core PCG solutions to the MGA, which will offer a single end-to-end broker and client portal, a comprehensive set of product offerings, a simplified data warehouse and the underwriting capabilities of AIG. The MGA will be rebranded as Private Client Select, or PCS, and will be led by Kathleen Zortman and our current team at PCG. We see this new structure as a logical next step in the evolution of PCG and believe it will create significant value for clients, brokers and other stakeholders.\nAdditionally, expense discipline will continue to be a priority for AIG. In addition to savings from AIG 200 that we expect to earn in during 2023, we plan to move $300 million of expenses currently sitting in AIG corporate GOE to Corebridge upon deconsolidation. Separately, we will continue to align our target operating model and further reduce absolute expenses across AIG parent and General Insurance to reflect the fact that AIG is becoming one company.\nThis year, we will also remain focused on completing the operational separation of Corebridge from AIG, and we are working towards a secondary offering of Corebridge common stock by the end of the first quarter, subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals. Our current expectation is that the majority of net proceeds of the secondary offering will be used for AIG common stock repurchases.\nAnd as I stated on our last call, we are revisiting AIG's dividend, which has not changed in many years. We expect to say more about this on our first quarter call in May.\nWith respect to capital management priorities, in 2022, we did a significant amount of work to materially improve the capital structures of both AIG and Corebridge. With the reduction in AIG debt we achieved, our post-deconsolidation leverage will be in line with best-in-class peers. And with respect to share buybacks, we have $3.8 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.\nOur balanced capital management philosophy will continue to allow for investment in growth opportunities, while returning appropriate levels of capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. We also remain open to compelling inorganic growth opportunities, should they arise.\nBefore turning the call over to Sabra, I would like to pause and say that 2022 was another incredibly important year for AIG. Our colleagues did an exceptional job, particularly on the Corebridge IPO and the continued underwriting and operational improvements that are clearly showing through in our financial results. Our journey to be a top-performing company continues, and I fully expect 2023 to be another year with significant momentum and progress across the organization.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra.\n\nSabra Rose Purtill\n\nExecutive VP & Interim CFO, American International Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Peter. Today, I will review net investment income, additional color on our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results in capital management and also update you on the progress we are making on our path to a 10%-plus adjusted return on common equity or ROCE.\nTurning to net investment income. On an APTI basis, fourth quarter net investment income was $3.0 billion, down $331 million or 10% compared to 4Q '21. Similar to trends throughout 2022, the decrease was due to lower alternative investment income, principally on private equity investments, and lower bond call and tender premiums and mortgage prepayment fees. For the full year, net investment income on an APTI basis was $11.0 billion, down $1.9 billion due to the same trends.\nFor the quarter and the full year, we achieved higher new money reinvestment rates and rate resets from floating rate securities. In 4Q '22, net investment income on fixed maturities and mortgage and other loans rose $224 million sequentially, with 29 basis points of yield improvement, which was ahead of our 10 to 15 basis point forecast. Since second quarter of '22, when we began to bend the curve on investment yields, the increase has been 55 basis points.\nIn 4Q '22, the average new money yield was just over 6% and about 173 basis points above sales and maturities. New money rates were roughly 157 basis points higher in General Insurance and 190 basis points higher in Life and Retirement. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we repositioned some of the General Insurance portfolio to lock in higher yields, while maintaining similar credit quality and duration. This resulted in a modest capital loss of $57 million, but we expect the portfolio to generate higher net investment income in '23 as a result. Given current market levels, we expect additional yield uplift of 10 to 15 basis points on the consolidated portfolio in 1Q '23.\nBefore I head into results for the quarter, I want to note that in the fourth quarter, we eliminated the 1-month reporting lag in General Insurance International, which had a $100 million positive impact on our GAAP net income for the quarter. This change did not impact 4Q APTI, which remain on the same reporting basis as the prior year. But in 2023, GI International results will be on a calendar quarter basis and 1 month different than 2022, which will create some slight timing mismatch in quarterly net premiums written comparisons, but with minimal impact for the full year. Please see Page 25 of the financial supplement for more details.\nAs Peter noted, AIG reported adjusted after-tax income of $1.0 billion or $1.36 per diluted share. General Insurance delivered APTI of $1.2 billion compared to $1.5 billion in the prior year quarter due to lower investment income, partially offset by a $136 million increase in underwriting income. Prior year development was $151 million favorable in the fourth quarter, up from $44 million of favorable development in 4Q '21.\nNet favorable amortization for the ADC was $41 million, while North America favorable development was $148 million, and International was $38 million adverse, mostly driven by casualty.\nFourth quarter Other Operations adjusted pretax loss of $451 million improved $197 million from last year, despite $23 million of additional expenses related to the Corebridge separation. Annualized adjusted ROCE was 7.5% in 4Q '22, down from 9.9% in 4Q '21, principally due to lower alternative investment income.\nTurning to Life and Retirement. Strong sales momentum continued in the fourth quarter. Life and Retirement APTI was $781 million, down from $969 million in 4Q '21, due to lower investment income on alternatives and other yield enhancements, partially offset by higher base investment income and more favorable mortality.\nIndividual Retirement sales were $3.8 billion, a 16% increase over the prior year quarter with Fixed Annuity sales up 78% and Fixed Index sales up 34%, near record sales for both products.\nGroup Retirement deposits grew 20%, driven by higher out-of-plan Fixed Annuity sales and large plan acquisitions. The Life Insurance business had solid sales with an improving mix of business in the U.S. and continued growth in the U.K.\nIn Institutional Markets, premiums and deposits were $1.6 billion, driven by $1.3 billion in pension risk transfer activity. New product margins in L&R were attractive and in excess of long-term targets, supported by higher new money yields, including from Blackstone. After years of spread compression, L&R spreads are expected to improve in 2023.\nI wanted to make you aware of an update to our LDTI estimate. In the first quarter of 2023, we will adopt a change in accounting principle for LDTI with a transition date of January 1, 2021. Our current estimate is that as of September 30, 2022, the adoption would increase shareholders' equity between $800 million and $1.3 billion and AIG's adjusted shareholders' equity would increase between $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion. This increase in the estimate has been predominantly driven by capital market movements during 2021 and 2022.\nTurning to full year 2022. AIG reported adjusted after-tax income of $3.6 billion or $4.55 per diluted share compared to $4.4 billion or $5.12 per diluted share in 2021. These results include much stronger underwriting profitability in GI, offset by lower alternative investment income, as previously described.\nGeneral Insurance APTI for the full year 2022 was $4.4 billion, up 2% from 2021 due to the $1 billion increase in underwriting profitability, offset by lower investment income. L&R APTI was $2.7 billion, down from $3.9 billion in 2021, principally because of lower investment income.\nOther Operations adjusted pretax loss improved about $400 million in 2022 due to lower general operating expenses and higher income on short-term investments. Full year 2022 included additional expenses from the Corebridge separation of $51 million. And in 2023, we expect an incremental cost of $75 million to $100 million in Other Operations' GOE related to the separation.\nAdjusted book value per share was $73.87 at December 31, 2022, up 7% from year-end 2021. Full year adjusted ROCE was 6.5%, down from 8.6% in 2021, primarily due to lower alternative investment income, which was down $1.8 billion from 2021 or about 340 basis points of ROCE compared to 2021. At year-end, our primary insurance subsidiaries remain above target ranges for statutory capital, with GI's U.S. pool estimated in the range of 485% to 495% and L&R estimated in the range of 410% to 420%.\nIn addition to the strong financial results, we also executed on multiple capital management priorities in 2022. As Peter described, we established a separate debt capitalization structure for Corebridge and subsequently reduced AIG holding company debt by $9.8 billion. This reduction in AIG debt will lower AIG's holding company interest expense from about $1 billion in 2021 to roughly $500 million in 2023, excluding interest expense on Corebridge issued debt.\nIn 2022, we also returned over $6.1 billion to shareholders with $1 billion of dividends and $5.1 billion of share repurchases, yielding a 10% reduction in shares outstanding. We ended the year with Parent liquidity of $3.7 billion.\nLooking ahead, we remain highly committed and laser-focused on delivering a 10%-plus ROCE after the deconsolidation of Corebridge. As Peter and Shane have shared previously, achieving this goal is based on sustained and improved underwriting profitability; executing a leaner operating model across AIG; separation and deconsolidation of Corebridge; and continued balanced capital management, including reducing AIG common shares to between 600 million and 650 million shares through repurchases, while targeting debt to total capital leverage at the lower end of the 20% to 25% range post deconsolidation. Progress on each of these will increase ROCE, along with additional tailwinds from higher reinvestment yields and alternative returns more consistent with long-term averages.\nAs Peter mentioned, expense reduction remains an important goal. In the following years, we expect to achieve $300 million of additional savings from AIG 200, with the majority earning in through 2023; $300 million of AIG corporate general operating expense moving to Corebridge upon deconsolidation; and additional savings as we transition to a leaner operating model. As a reminder, every $500 million of expense savings equates to 1 point of ROCE improvement.\nI will now turn the call back over to Peter.\n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO\n\nThank you. Michelle, we'll take our first question, please.",

This conference is being recorded.\nNow at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\n\nQuentin John McMillan\n\nVP, MD & Head of IR, American International Group, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by the applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.\nAdditionally, today's remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at www.aig.com.\nFinally, today's remarks will include a discussion of the financial results of AIG's Life and Retirement segment and Other Operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report Life and Retirement and Other Operations until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial.\nAIG's segments and U.S. GAAP financial results, as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto, differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. As such, we will be intentional when referring to AIG's Life and Retirement segment versus Corebridge Financial when commenting on financial results. Corebridge Financial will host its first earnings call post IPO next week on November 9, and its management team will provide additional details on the Corebridge Financial third quarter results.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO\n\nThank you, Quentin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter financial results, which I'm pleased to report were very strong, along with the excellent progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Following my remarks, Shane will provide more detail on the third quarter financial results, and then we'll take questions. Kevin Hogan, David McElroy and Mark Lyons will join us for the Q&A portion of today's call.\nThe third quarter represented an inflection point for AIG, with important milestones achieved across the organization. Our team once again demonstrated its ability to execute on significant strategic initiatives that position AIG for a strong future, to apply discipline and the successful execution of these initiatives and to achieve high-quality outcomes even against a backdrop of very complicated capital and insurance markets.\nBefore I cover the third quarter in more detail, I'd like to comment on the successful Corebridge Financial IPO, which we completed in mid-September despite very challenging equity capital market conditions. On our second quarter earnings call, we explained that volatility in the capital markets was significantly elevated and that attempting to complete an IPO at that time would not have been in the best interest of AIG, Corebridge or our stakeholders.\nAs a result, we decided to defer the IPO and revisit timing in the third quarter. We knew that there would be limited open windows and remained committed to completing a transaction as soon as we believed an appropriate opportunity was available. Throughout the summer, our team did a remarkable job and worked diligently on the operational separation of Corebridge from AIG as well as to prepare the business for a successful IPO.\nAs we noted on our last call, we had already increased the targeted savings program at Corebridge from an initial range of $200 million to $300 million to $400 million within 2 to 3 years. With the additional time available pre-IPO, the business accelerated certain actions and is now expected to deliver run rate savings of over $100 million by the end of 2022, ahead of our original schedule.\nWe were also prepared to secure the capital structure of Corebridge prior to the IPO and accessed the debt markets in late summer during a short window when conditions became more favorable. In August, Corebridge issued $1 billion of hybrid debt securities and in early September, drew down on a $1.5 billion bank facility to complete its initial capital structure. Using part of the net proceeds from these debt transactions, Corebridge closed out the remaining $1.9 billion due to AIG under a promissory note.\nThroughout this time, we also engage in continuous discussions with our financial and other advisers about equity market conditions, investor sentiment and our ability to execute the IPO in a complicated market. While equity markets remain uncertain, volatility was not as extreme leading up to Labor Day. We were confident we could complete the IPO within an acceptable valuation range, and we continue to believe it was very important for the future of AIG and Corebridge to establish Corebridge as a public company in 2022.\nThroughout the third quarter, we also made significant progress in the implementation of a new investment management model for AIG and Corebridge. As you know, in mid-2021, we finalized a strategic partnership with Blackstone, which includes the transfer of $50 billion of Corebridge AUM to Blackstone, with that number growing to $92.5 billion over 6 years.\nIn addition, earlier this year, we announced a partnership with BlackRock, under which we will transfer up to $150 billion of liquid assets from both AIG and Corebridge. To date, we have transferred $100 billion of assets, with $37 billion moving from AIG and $63 billion moving from Corebridge. The complexity of operationally separating corporate from AIG as well as implementing our new operating model for investment management cannot be understated.\nKeep in mind, these businesses have been in a combined structure for over 2 decades, with aspects of each business shifting over time between segments until just a few years ago. And until we announced our intention to separate Corebridge from AIG in late 2020, investments was a stand-alone unit at AIG, servicing all businesses across the organization. Our partnerships with Blackstone and BlackRock enable us to accelerate the reshaping of our investment portfolios.\nWith respect to the financial commitments Corebridge made as part of the IPO, I'd like to reiterate them as they too will create significant value for shareholders over time. We continue to expect Corebridge to pay $600 million in annual dividends, with its first quarterly dividend of $148 million declared 15 days after the IPO close and already paid, to have the financial flexibility to repurchase shares or reduce AIG's ownership stake as early as the second quarter of 2023 and to achieve a return on equity of 12% to 14% over the next 24 months.\nCompleting the Corebridge IPO within a very narrow window was a testament to the careful preparation, hard work and dedication of our teams at AIG and Corebridge and to the quality of the business. This was a major accomplishment for our teams, and we are all very proud of the outcome.\nTurning to other highlights in the third quarter. Adjusted after-tax net income per diluted common share was $0.66. General Insurance delivered very strong performance and continued profitability improvement despite significant natural CATs in the quarter. The accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, was 88.4%, a 210 basis point improvement year-over-year and the 17th consecutive quarter of improvement.\nThis result was primarily due to Global Commercial, which had an excellent quarter, with an accident year combined ratio, ex CATs, of 83%, a 590 basis point improvement year-over-year, driven by international commercial which had an impressive 80.4% accident year combined ratio, ex CATs. The accident year combined ratio was 98.2%, a 200 basis point improvement year-over-year. The calendar year combined ratio was 97.3%, a 240 basis point improvement year-over-year.\nCAT losses in the third quarter were $600 million, or 9.8 points of the combined ratio. Shane will break this number down for you in his remarks. Our CAT total includes losses from AIG Re related to Hurricane Ian, which came in at $125 million. This result reflects the terrific work the team has done to reduce peak zone exposure in our assumed reinsurance business, particularly in Florida, where we've reduced limits deployed by approximately 60% since 2018 and have minimal exposure to Florida domestic insurers.\nConsidering Hurricane Ian and other CATs in the third quarter, our CAT losses validate the quality of our underwriting, our reinsurance strategy and our ability to successfully manage volatility. With respect to PYD, there was a favorable release in the third quarter of $72 million or 90 basis points of the calendar year combined ratio.\nIn Life and Retirement, the business had another quarter of strong sales with premiums and deposits coming in at approximately $9 billion, up from $7.2 billion in the prior year, with positive year-over-year growth in each of its 4 business segments. Effective capital management remains a priority for AIG. In the third quarter, we repurchased $1.3 billion of common stock and paid $247 million of dividends.\nWe also announced $1.8 billion of debt repayments, which we commenced in the third quarter and closed last week, further strengthening our balance sheet. And lastly, AIG ended the third quarter with $6.5 billion of parent liquidity.\nNow let me provide additional detail on general insurance and the continued sustained improvement and very good absolute performance in our underwriting. When referring to gross and net premiums written, note that all numbers are on an FX-adjusted basis. Gross premiums written increased 5% to $9.2 billion, with global commercial growing 8% and global personal decreasing 3%. Net premiums written increased 3% to $6.4 billion.\nThe growth was in our global commercial business, which grew 6%, with global Personal decreasing 4%. North America commercial net premiums written increased 7%, and international commercial net premiums written increased 5% or approximately 8%, excluding the impact of nonrenewal and cancellations related to known Russia exposure.\nIn North America Commercial, we saw very strong growth in net premiums written in Lexington led by wholesale property, retail property and Glatfelter. In International Commercial, we also saw strong growth in net premiums written in global specialty, led by international specialty, marine and energy as well as property.\nIn global commercial, We also had very strong renewal retention of 85% in our in-force portfolio, with North America up 400 basis points year-over-year to 86% and international at 85%. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes. And across global commercial, our new business continues to be strong. North America new business was $458 million led by Lexington. International new business was $474 million led by specialty.\nTurning to rate. Momentum continued in North America commercial with overall rate increases of 9% in the third quarter, excluding workers' compensation. Areas within North America Commercial achieved double-digit rate increases. These included Lexington, which increased 20%; cyber, which increased 32%; and excess casualty, which increased 12%. International commercial rate increases were 6%, driven by Talbot, EMEA, Asia Pacific, each of which increased 10%.\nOur team analyzes loss cost trends every quarter. On our last call, we indicated that our loss cost trend view in the second quarter for North America Commercial lines had migrated upwards to 6%. Due to inflationary and other related factors that have resulted in an increase in property loss costs, we are increasing our aggregate loss cost trend to 6.5%, both in North America and international. Overall, we continue to receive rate above loss cost trends, which contributes to margin expansion on a written basis.\nMoving to global Personal Insurance. We continue our work across the portfolio to prioritize growth in A&H, to reposition our capabilities in Japan Personal and to transform our North America high net worth portfolio. Starting with North America, personal net premiums written declined 11%, driven by warranty as well as our ongoing reshaping of our high net worth business that we've discussed on prior calls.\nWe continue to make progress in our high net worth business by reducing peak zone aggregation, improving the overall quality of the portfolio, transitioning a portion of the portfolio where appropriate to excess and surplus lines and enhancing the value we offer to clients. Third quarter results reflect this repositioning, with North America's gross and net premiums written declining as we continue to reduce exposures and increase reinsurance sessions to mitigate volatility.\nNorth America Personal Insurance's premium declines were partially offset by continued momentum in individual travel and Personal A&H. In International Personal, net premiums written declined 2% due to a reduction in warranty that was partially offset by a rebound in individual travel as well as growth in A&H, which is our largest and most profitable International Personal portfolio.\nOne item to note in the International Personal Insurance third quarter accident year loss ratio is that it reflects approximately $100 million of losses related to COVID claims in Japan and, to a lesser extent, Taiwan. These losses were primarily due to the Japanese government instituting a policy relating to deemed hospitalizations resulting from COVID, which impacted our A&H book.\nThis government policy was revised in the third quarter, and as a result, we expect the issue to have a de minimis impact in future quarters, starting with the fourth quarter of this year. Additionally, some of these losses related to cleanup expense benefits offered to small businesses, which AIG no longer provides.\nTurning to PYD. We conducted our annual review of approximately 75% of pre-ADC loss reserves in the third quarter. We applied conservative assumptions in this review as we believe it is appropriate to be prudent given current economic conditions. As a result of our review, we've recorded $72 million of net favorable development for the third quarter or 90 basis points of the loss ratio. This reflects $42 million of amortization from the ADC combined with $30 million of other favorable development.\nOur international operations were favorable in every region totaling $328 million, whereas North America was unfavorable by $256 million. Furthermore, in North America, virtually every line of business was favorable, except for U.S. financial lines, which was unfavorable by $660 million net of the ADC, predominantly in accident years 2018 and 2019 and, to a lesser extent, 2020.\nLet me unpack the drivers of unfavorable development in U.S. financial lines a bit more because it's been an area of focus for us for several years given AIG's history in this line of business. The unfavorable development was primarily driven by excess D&O written out of both the U.S. and our Bermuda business. And while there was some movement on the primary side, the excess book was the most significant driver. D&O prior year emergence continues to be driven by large losses. Many from security class actions and earlier accident years also experienced stacking exposures where primary mid-excess and high-excess policies were all exposed on the same insured.\nThis issue is similar to what we saw across the portfolio when we first started our remediation strategy. The company had too much vertical limit on a per account basis. As we've discussed on prior calls, our underwriting strategy and ventilation standards were completely overhauled over the last few years, including U.S. financial lines to prevent stacking and overexposure to anyone insured. And we've dramatically reduced limits deployed on individual policies, obtained tighter terms and conditions and achieved higher attachment points on primary limits. Shane will provide more detail on PYD in his remarks.\nNow I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about Hurricane Ian, which was a very tragic event on a human level that also left devastating physical damage. AIG rapidly deployed significant resources to the affected areas, providing immediate support and infrastructure to help individuals, businesses and communities rebuild. Hurricane Ian is projected to be the second largest insured natural CAT loss in U.S. history.\nThere remain a considerable number of variables contributing to industry ultimate losses, but based on what we know today, total insurable losses are expected to be in the range of $50 billion to $60 billion. For context, Hurricane Katrina and Irma, the first and third largest U.S. natural CAT losses in the last 100 years are estimated at $85 billion and $40 billion of insured losses, respectively, on an inflation-adjusted basis.\nWhile Hurricane Ian will have an impact on the broader insurance, reinsurance and retro markets, we believe AIG is well positioned. Very importantly, we have strong and strategic relationships with our major reinsurers, and we are confident in our ability to obtain similar levels of capacity for 2023 as we did in 2022. In addition, we've improved and continued to improve our portfolio, and therefore, the reinsurance we require will reflect this during 2023. And we see significant growth opportunities across the market especially in the near term and for property specifically, and our significant financial flexibility will allow us to be nimble as we deployed capital at attractive risk-adjusted returns to Retail Property, wholesale property, Talbot, global specialties and AIG Re.\nWith respect to the industry and markets more broadly, as we noted on our second quarter call, there are a few things you need to believe about the market prior to Ian in order to understand the impact Ian may have in the future. If you believe, as we do, that the retro market was already contracting from last year's available capacity, which itself was reduced from the prior year and the anticipated capital for 2023 was already going to further contract approximately 10%, the retro market and the property CAT market would have already been challenged even prior to Ian.\nIn addition to reduced capacity over 2022, prior to Ian, there was also an expectation of increased retentions, more specific apparel coverage as well as rate increases resulting from several factors including increased frequency and severity of CATs over the last several years. Keeping this context in mind, 2022 will be another year with over $100 billion in natural CAT industry losses. Prior to 2017, on an inflation-adjusted basis, there were only 2 years, 2005 and 2011, that had greater than $100 billion of global natural CAT losses. And in both of these years, losses were led by primary apparels.\nSince 2017, 5 of the last 6 years have had greater than $100 billion in global natural CAT losses, with the predominant portion of losses in the aggregate coming from secondary apparels. Furthermore, other issues potentially impacting 1/1 capacity prior to Ian were the strengthening of the dollar, euro-denominated capacity likely decreasing due to currency devaluation, asset valuations, inflation and demand surge from the post pandemic economy, just to name a few.\nWhen considering the impact of Ian and the complexity it adds to already challenging market conditions, there are a few additional factors to consider. In Florida, residential total insured values have increased by more than 50% over the last 10 years. The significance of commercial losses, which will likely exceed 40% of the ultimate losses for Ian compared to the average of prior natural catastrophes, where commercial losses were 30% of the ultimate loss. The prevalence of commercial losses exacerbates the complexity of CAT modeling generally and the resulting deficiencies regarding appropriate CAT load and pricing.\nWhen considering the modeled estimated output for losses related to Ian, for example, commercial losses were deficient by 2.5x and Personal by 1.5x after adjusting for inflation and other factors. Furthermore, when major CATs occur in Florida, a disproportionate amount of the loss finds its way to the reinsurance market because of the proportional and low attaching excess to loss placements completed by Florida domestic insurers as their capital structures require significant reinsurance. Available reinsurance capacity is forecasted to be the lowest aggregate limit available in over a decade, making conditions in the property CAT reinsurance market even more challenging.\nNow turning to life retirement. Adjusted pretax income was $589 million, decreasing from $877 million in the prior year period, mainly due to lower alternative investment income and lower call and tender income. There were no significant reserve adjustments arising out of the third quarter actuarial assumption review. As I mentioned earlier, Life and Retirement had excellent sales with premiums and deposits of approximately $9 billion, up 23% on year-over-year. Sales of annuities over the course of 2022 have benefited from our relationship with Blackstone with $5 billion of assets originated year-to-date in private ABS, direct credit lending and structured assets.\nWhile our strategic partnership with Blackstone is still in the early days, the quality and the performance of the portfolio relative to what the business could have done on its own are very encouraging. Sequential improvement in fixed income and loan portfolio yields accelerated, with a 24 basis point improvement in base investment yields. Year-over-year fixed income and loan portfolio yields also improved 8 basis points, confirming the business has surpassed year-over-year yield compression for the first time in recent memory. Shane will provide more information on the Life Retirement segment and Corebridge in his remarks.\nShifting to capital management. We continue to be balanced and disciplined as we maintain appropriate levels of capital in our subsidiaries for profitable growth opportunities across our global portfolio as well as reduced levels of debt while returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. Looking ahead, with respect to share buybacks, we have $4.3 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization and expect to end 2022 with over $5 billion of share repurchases for the full year. And balance sheet actions we've taken put us in a position of strength with significant financial flexibility that AIG has not had in many years.\nAs we look to 2023, our lockup agreement with the underwriters of the IPO with respect to Corebridge common stock expires in March. Subject to ordinary course blackout periods, this means that our likely windows for a secondary offering of Corebridge common stock in the first half of 2023 will be in mid- to late March as well as mid-May to late June. Our current expectation is that the net proceeds will largely be deployed to share repurchases.\nWhile we remain committed to consistently returning capital through share repurchases for the foreseeable future, we believe there will be attractive organic growth opportunities in general insurance and AIG Re given current market dislocations that may prove compelling. Lastly, as we discussed on our second quarter call, we continue to expect that post deconsolidation of Corebridge, AIG will achieve a return on common equity at or above 10%. Shane will provide more details in his remarks.\nAs we approach year-end and plan for 2023, our path forward is clear with General Insurance solidifying its position as a global market leader, the deconsolidation and eventual full separation of Corebridge firmly underway and a significantly strengthened balance sheet. With that, Shane, I'll turn the call over to you.\n\nShane Fitzsimons\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American International Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Peter. As Peter noted, I will provide more detail on the third quarter results, specifically EPS, reserve reviews, net investment income, capital management and the path to achieving an above 10% return on common equity. Adjusted after-tax income was $509 million or $0.66 per share compared to $837 million or $0.97 per share in the prior year quarter. This was driven by a $741 million decline in net investment income, offset by improved underwriting results in General Insurance and solid performance in Life and Retirement as well as improved GOE and other operations.\nGeneral Insurance finished the third quarter with adjusted pretax income of $750 million. Underwriting income was up $148 million despite Hurricane Ian, offset by a $209 million decline in net investment income due to alternative investment returns. Life and Retirement contributed adjusted pretax income of $589 million, which is $288 million below prior year quarter driven by lower alternative investment and call and tender income.\nOther operations adjusted pretax loss of $614 million compared to $562 million prior year quarter, mostly due to lower alternative investment income, partially offset by lower interest expense. This quarter, Other Operations included $16 million of additional expenses for setting up Corebridge as a stand-alone company. Excluding such expenses, GOE improved by $17 million versus prior year.\nAs Peter noted, results in General Insurance reflects strong underwriting performance with continued combined ratio improvement of 240 basis points to 97.3%, an accident year combined ratio, ex CAT of 210 basis points to 88.4%. North America Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, improved 590 basis points over the prior year quarter to 84.6%. International Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, at 80.4% showed 640 basis points of improvement.\nNorth America Personal reported an accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, of 112.8%, primarily reflecting higher reinsurance costs and lower ceding commission for high net worth business. International Personal accident year combined ratio, ex CAT, was 99.9%, mainly due to increased frequency of A&H claims in Japan and Taiwan.\nNet CAT losses, excluding reinstatement premiums, were $600 million or 9.8 loss ratio points in the third quarter, which included $450 million from Hurricane Ian and $84 million from Japanese typhoons. Additionally, the reinstatement premium impact across all CAT events was $55 million.\nSwitching to reserves. Nearly $40 billion of reserves were reviewed this quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately 90% of carried pre-ADC reserves. As Peter noted, prior year development, excluding related premium adjustments, was $72 million favorable this quarter compared to favorable development of $50 million in the prior year quarter.\nPrior year emergence in accident year 2019 and 2020 was largely due to policies written in 2017 and 2018. And an accident year 2020 was largely due to policies in private and not-for-profit where gross premiums have been reduced by 54% since 2018, and limits provided have been reduced by 85%. In 2018 and prior, AIG wrote multiyear policies that contributed to accident year 2019 and 2020 losses. So for example, a policy written in 2017 had loss emergence in accident year 2020. We have strategically shifted away from this business, which now makes up less than 1% of policies in those lines.\nAs we've discussed previously, we overhauled the General Insurance underwriting strategy, including U.S. financial lines, resulting in reduced limits deployed on individual policies, tighter terms and conditions on higher attachment points on primary limits and termination of certain businesses.\nSince 2018, we have seen the following: total primary limits exposed in U.S. financial lines have been reduced by $32 billion on a comparative basis or nearly 80% through the third quarter of this year; total primary limits in both corporate and national D&O have been reduced by nearly 50% on a comparative basis; and private and not-for-profit primary limits have been reduced by nearly 85%.\nAnd in all cases, rates have increased substantially over this time period. Since 2018, we have achieved cumulative rate increases of nearly 85% in both primary corporate and national D&O on a third quarter cumulative basis and over 115% in private and not-for-profit primary business.\nOverall, we recognize bad news early but wait to recognize good news over time as we monitor developments, which we believe leads to a conservative view on our reserves. Along these lines, we've built in an expectation of higher inflation given the uncertainty over its potential impact on our reserves.\nTurning to Life and Retirement. Adjusted pretax income was $589 million compared to $877 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was due to lower alternative investment, call and tender and fee income, partially offset by higher investment income from fixed maturity and loan portfolios, less adverse mortality and an improved outcome in the annual actuarial assumption review, which other than DAC acceleration of $57 million, showed no meaningful net movement in reserves this year.\nProduct margins were attractive and in excess of long-term targets in all businesses, supported by robust new business origination from Blackstone. Corebridge now expects spread compression to convert to expansion beginning in 2023. Strong sales momentum continued in Individual Retirement, with $3.8 billion in sales, a 16% increase year-over-year and led by over 100% growth in fixed annuity sales on a record $1.7 billion in index annuity sales.\nGroup Retirement deposits grew 11%, driven by higher large plant acquisitions in the third quarter. The Life business had solid sales with an improving mix of business in the U.S. and continued underlying growth in the U.K. In Institutional Markets, premiums and deposits of $1.9 billion were up from $1 billion in the prior year quarter, with larger GIC issuances on higher pension risk transfer transactions. Mortality, including COVID losses, was once again below original pricing expectations. COVID losses remain within original sensitivities of $65 million to $75 million for each 100,000 U.S. population deaths.\nAdjusted pretax net investment income for the third quarter was $2.54 billion, a decline of $741 million or 23% compared to prior year quarter, with $431 million attributable to Life and Retirement. $665 million of the decline was due to alternative investment income and $150 million was due to reduced call and tender income, offset by increase in the fixed maturity and loan portfolios of $153 million from yield uplift.\nOur fixed maturity and loan portfolio saw a lift in yield of 17 basis points in the third quarter, building on top of the 9 basis points from the second quarter, and we expect 10 to 15 basis points additional in the fourth quarter. The new money yield on our fixed maturity and loan portfolio was approximately 120 basis points above the assets rolling off during the third quarter, roughly 60 basis points higher in General Insurance and 130 basis points higher in Life and Retirement.\nNow turning to the balance sheet and capital management. We began 2022 with $10.7 billion of parent liquidity. And since then, we have paid dividends totaling $768 million, repurchased approximately $4.4 billion or 77 million shares of common stock, bringing our ending count to 747 million shares, a 9% reduction year-to-date.\nIncluding recently announced bond make-whole calls of $1.8 billion, we established a Corebridge debt structure of $9.4 billion and reduced $9.8 billion of AIG debt. We completed the Corebridge IPO with its parent liquidity of $1.7 billion. AIG received $1.6 billion of net proceeds from the IPO, and we exited the third quarter with $6.5 billion of AIG parent liquidity, including $1.8 billion to fund the make-whole calls.\nAt third quarter end, our GAAP leverage was 36.5%, a 540 basis point increase quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in AOCI added 320 basis points to the overall leverage ratio, with over 80% of the change relating to Life and Retirement. AIG's debt leverage ratio, excluding AOCI, was 27.5%, up 220 basis points from the second quarter as a result of the issuance of Corebridge debt as planned prior to the IPO. Including the impact of the make-whole calls post quarter end, AIG's leverage is 34.7% or 26%, excluding AOCI. Total adjusted return on common equity was 3.7%, down from 6.5% in 3Q '21. The decrease is mostly caused by a decline in net investment income.\nMoving to the risk-based capital ratio, our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized, with General Insurance's U.S. pool fleet and Life and Retirement's U.S. fleet RBC ratios both above our target ranges. We continue to make progress on the 4 priorities to achieve a 10% or greater return on capital employed. They are: underwriting profitability; leaner operating model; separation of the Life and Retirement business and capital management; 2 points of improvement in combined ratio; or $500 million of expense savings; or $5 billion in share repurchases approximate to 1 point improvement in ROCE.\nWe expect to achieve expense savings from multiple areas, including: the remaining $350 million of savings yet to be realized from AIG 200; roughly $300 million of corporate GOE and approximately $400 million of interest expense that will be transferred to Corebridge; an additional expense savings as we transition AIG to a leaner operating model. Additionally, we've seen a 26 basis point yield uplift in the fixed maturity and loan portfolios in the past 2 quarters. Over time, we expect the yield uplift from net investment income could add 1 to 2 points to ROCE.\nWe are confident about delivering on our 10% plus ROCE commitment, and we will continue to execute on a prudent capital management strategy, which will reduce the share count to 600 million to 650 million range while maintaining leverage at the 20% to 25% level post deconsolidation.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to you, Peter.\n\nPeter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO\n\nThank you, Shane. And operator, we're ready for questions.",

This conference is being recorded.\nNow at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\n\nQuentin John McMillan\n\nVP, MD & Head of IR, American International Group, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by the applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change.\nAdditionally, today's remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at www.aig.com.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. AIG had an excellent quarter with strong momentum continuing across all of our strategic, financial and operational objectives. I could not be more pleased with the exceptional results in General Insurance. And Life and Retirement again delivered good results despite very challenging equity market conditions, significant volatility and other headwinds.\nAs you saw in our press release, adjusted after-tax net income per diluted common share was $1.19.\nGeneral Insurance achieved a calendar year combined ratio of 87.4%, the first sub-90 quarter and best result this business has achieved in over 15 years. The accident year combined ratio, excluding CATs, was 88.5%, a 260 basis point improvement year-over-year and the 16th consecutive quarter of improvement. And the accident year combined ratio, excluding CATs, in Global Commercial was 85.3%, an improvement of 400 basis points year-over-year.\nConsistent with our strategy to manage volatility, catastrophe losses were very modest in the quarter, coming in at $121 million or 1.8% of a combined ratio. Life and Retirement has strong fixed annuity sales with over $1.3 billion in deposits for the second straight quarter, which benefited from the origination capabilities of Blackstone.\nAIG returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through $1.7 billion of common stock repurchases and $256 million of dividends. In addition, we are on track to buy back at least $1 billion of common stock in the third quarter. We ended the second quarter with $5.6 billion of parent liquidity, which Shane will go through in more detail in his remarks.\nOn today's call, I will provide more detail on 5 topics. First, I will provide an update on the IPO of our Life and Retirement business, which will be known as Corebridge Financial once the company is public, and discuss why we chose not to proceed with the IPO in the second quarter. I will also review the significant progress we've continued to make on various aspects of the separation of Corebridge as we prepare this business to be a stand-alone public company.\nSecond, as a follow-on to the IPO discussion, I will review Life and Retirement results where, as I mentioned, the core business showed continued resilience and solid performance despite headwinds largely driven from a reduction in net investment income.\nThird, I will review the performance of General Insurance, where underwriting excellence continues to produce outstanding results with strong profitability and top line growth, particularly in our Global Commercial portfolio.\nFourth, I will provide an update on AIG 200, where we achieved critical milestones and delivered on our stated goal of $1 billion in exit run rate savings 6 months ahead of schedule.\nLastly, I'll provide an update on capital management, particularly with respect to stock buybacks and debt reduction.\nFollowing my remarks, Shane will provide more detail on the quarter and then we will take questions. Mark Lyons, David McElroy and Kevin Hogan will join us for the Q&A portion of today's call.\nAs you can see, our team has accomplished a lot on many fronts. Before expanding on our financial and operating performance, I want to address the status of the Corebridge IPO. Our base case had always been to complete the IPO in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions. In deciding whether to launch the initial public offering in May or June, we weighed several variables, which were all market-related, some specific to Corebridge and some more macro level. These included equity market conditions and particularly the trading values of companies in the Life and Retirement sector that we consider to be the most comparable to Corebridge.\nIn the second quarter, equity markets were down 16% with only 3 weeks seeing positive market returns, the VIX, which was above 30 resulting in extremely elevated market volatility and feedback we received from advisers, analysts and many potential institutional investors following the public filing of the S-1. While completing the IPO is a significant priority for us and something we are laser-focused on, we believe this is an attractive business and did not want to execute a transaction that would be detrimental to stakeholders in the long run. Absent something we don't see today, we remain ready to execute on the IPO, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions. And the next window will be in September.\nIn the meantime, throughout the summer, we continue to make significant progress to position the business for long-term success. I'll highlight 3 areas of focus. One, expanding on our plan to achieve expense savings at Corebridge. Last quarter, we estimated these savings to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million, but we now expect to generate closer to $400 million of savings over the next 3 years with the majority of the run rate savings to be achieved in the next 24 months.\nTwo, progressing the implementation of a new operating model for our investments unit. This includes our strategic partnership with Blackstone announced in July of 2021 and our partnership with BlackRock, where we began moving assets under management in the second quarter of this year pursuant to the arrangement we announced in late March.\nAnd three, planning our transition to BlackRock's Aladdin platform, which will replace aging and end-of-life technology infrastructure and provide enhanced risk analytics and reporting. We continue to expect that Corebridge will pay an annual dividend of $600 million post-IPO that will have a payout ratio of 60% to 65%, and that it will achieve a return on equity of 12% to 14% over the next 24 months.\nNow turning to Life and Retirement's performance in the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, adjusted pretax income was $563 million, decreasing from the prior year period due to lower NII, which was driven by lower alternative investment income, accelerated DAC amortization and an increase in SOP reserves. Given the pending IPO, we remain somewhat limited in what we can say about the business, but let me provide some details from the second quarter. The core business produced strong sales in fixed annuities, which were up 48% to $1.4 billion and strong sales in indexed annuities, which were flat at $1.5 billion.\nIn Group Retirement, contributions grew 1%, nonrecurring deposits grew 4% and enrollments were up 11%. Second quarter deposits of $1.8 billion were strong with base net investment spread growing 4 basis points sequentially due to the higher interest rate environment. The Life and Retirement balance sheet and capital position remains strong with an RBC ratio of 415% to 425%, still above our target ranges.\nNow let me provide more detail on our second quarter results in General Insurance, where we continue to drive improved financial performance. Gross premiums written increased 5% on an FX-adjusted basis to $9.6 billion, with Global Commercial growing 8% and Global Personal decreasing 3%.\nNet premiums written increased 5% on an FX-adjusted basis to $6.9 billion. This growth was led by our Global Commercial business, which grew 8% with Global Personal decreasing 4%.\nGlobal Commercial net premiums written increased 10%, excluding AIG Re, where we have significantly reduced property CAT writings and exposure, particularly in the Southeast region of the U.S.\nNorth America Commercial net premiums written increased 10% or 14% excluding AIG Re. And international net premiums written increased 5% or 8% excluding the impact of nonrenewal and cancellations related to Russia exposure in each case on an FX-adjusted basis.\nIn North America Commercial, we saw very strong growth in net premiums written: In Lexington, which grew 31% led by wholesale property, which was up 46%; retail property, which grew 17%; and our Canadian commercial business, which grew 10%.\nIn International Commercial, on an FX-adjusted basis, we also saw strong growth in net premiums written: In Global Specialty, which grew 16% led by energy, which was up 20%; and marine, which was up 10%; North America Specialty, which grew 17%; and International Specialty, which grew 15%.\nIn Global Commercial, we also had very strong renewal retention of 85% in our in-force portfolio, with North America up 200 basis points to 85% and International holding steady at a very strong 86%. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes. And across Global Commercial, our new business continues to be very strong, coming in slightly over $1 billion for the fifth consecutive quarter.\nNorth America's new business grew to $542 million led by Lexington. International new business was $466 million, slightly down year-over-year due to intentional actions we took in Talbot and in our Specialty business related to Russia, Ukraine.\nTurning to rate. Momentum continued in Global Commercial with overall rate increases of 7%. And in the aggregate, rate continued to exceed loss cost trends. This is the fourth consecutive year in which we're achieving rate above loss cost trends and where we are successfully driving margin expansion.\nNorth America Commercial achieved 7% rate increases with some areas achieving double-digit increases led by Lexington, which increased 18% with 17% in Lexington wholesale property; Financial Lines, where professional increased 34% led by cyber, which increased 52%; and excess casualty, which increased 10%.\nInternational commercial rate increases were 7% driven by Financial Lines, which increased 11%, including more than 47% rate increases in cyber; property, which increased 10%; and EMEA, which also increased 10%.\nLast quarter, we indicated that our loss cost trend view in the aggregate for North America Commercial had migrated upwards from 4% to 5%, mostly driven by shorter tail lines. And as a result, we moved the upper end of the range to 5.5%.\nIn the second quarter, trends in casualty and other liability lines continue to show no obvious impact in either internal or external data to support a large move on loss cost, whereas property businesses have been more clearly affected. As a result, based on a review of more recent information, we again modified our view on loss cost trend to 6%. Loss cost trend represents the composite of frequency and severity. However, there is an additional mitigant to inflation built into rate decisions. Exposure trend, which we view as a partial offset to loss cost trend, reflects the additional premiums an insurer receives driven by growth in underlying inflation sensitive exposure basis. When taking this exposure mitigant into account, our current North America Commercial loss cost trend net of these inflationary exposure benefits is approximately 4%.\nAdditionally, our North America Commercial accident year loss ratio, ex CAT, is booked at 63% year-to-date, which is consistent with pure actuarial rate over loss cost and exposure trends but is a pure numerical approach and does not reflect our improved risk selection and continued improvement in terms of conditions. Those benefits will emerge over time.\nAs we discussed on prior calls, since 2018, we have implemented a clear ventilation strategy in our casualty, financial lines and property portfolios that directs our capacity deployment towards higher average attachment points, which is a strong defensive measure towards rising inflation. And this strategy continues today. We also implemented the strategy in our AIG risk management loss-sensitive workers' compensation business. And over the last few years, average deductibles have increased 30% to $1.3 million.\nTurning to Personal Lines. In North America Personal, net premiums written declined nearly 4% driven by a reduction in warranty, which was partially offset by a rebound in travel. In International Personal, net premiums written declined 4% on FX-adjusted basis also due to a reduction in warranty and partially offset by growth in accident and health and travel.\nNow I'd like to spend a few minutes on our high net worth business. This is a business we will continue to invest in where there are attractive opportunities for profitability improvement. Over the last 2 years and through the second quarter, we've already invested $140 million to improve digital workflow, data, a customer interface that will provide enhanced insight and value to distribution partners and policyholders. The actions we are taking are designed to position this business to be more balanced with less density and lower volatility in order to provide more sustainable financial results.\nLet me review some of the market dynamics impacting this business that have created significant complexity and the resulting actions we are taking to reposition the portfolio. Currently, the level of reinsurance we purchased and the commensurate model ceded profit is a headwind to net premiums written growth and combined ratio improvement. This has been intentional as we are not willing to take volatility on frequency or tail risk on CAT in our high net worth business.\nAdding to this, the inability to pass on increased loss and reinsurance costs through rate increases or limit management largely due to regulatory constraints further deteriorates margin in the short run. But we have made a deliberate decision to continue writing this business as we believe the trade-off is appropriate in the near term given the opportunity we see over the long term.\nAnd while each of our CAT-exposed businesses has different attributes, I don't see reinsurance costs for the high net worth market generally becoming less expensive for the foreseeable future, but instead, seeing it putting pressure on the segment. In fact, for a business that is primarily underwritten in peak zones with high total insured values, reinsurance costs will likely increase and, in some cases, materially.\nTo understand the complexity of reinsurance for peak zones, you need to look no further than in what has happened in the retrocessional market over the last few years. While overall small market, retrocession provides approximately $60 billion of available limit across various structures, of which roughly $20 billion is indemnity-based for reinsurers with this capacity primarily supported by alternative capital.\nThe dynamics in the retrocessional market over the last few years are important to understand because they have materially changed even though overall retrocessional capacity has remained flat since 2017. First, the cost of retrocession has increased significantly more than in the reinsurance industry on a risk-adjusted basis. Second, available capacity has shifted from predominantly aggregate to predominantly occurrence. Third, first event aggregate and lower attaching occurrence retrocession have been put under significant stress. Fourth, the retrocessional market return period attachment points have increased 50%. And fifth, compounded risk-adjusted rate changes have also increased by over 50%, even though retrocessional exposure is reduced compared to prior year.\nWhen you couple these factors with the additional adjustments going forward for inflation, model changes, trapped capital, you have a very complicated and challenging market. Additionally, if you review global insured net cat retrocessional losses over the last decade, 9 out of 10 years have had larger contributions from secondary peril aggregate losses than peak peril losses, which highlights the complexity of modeling catastrophes.\nAs a result of these dynamics and challenging circumstances, we concluded that to continue to provide high net worth clients with comprehensive solutions that meet their emerging risk issues, we needed to move property homeowners product to the non-admitted market, particularly in CAT-exposed states. In the second quarter, we exited the admitted personal property homeowners market in certain states as we could no longer maintain our level of aggregation especially given the inability to reflect the loss cost increases, inflation and increased reinsurance costs and rates as well as limitations on our ability to make coverage changes in this market.\nAs part of our go-forward high net worth strategy, we're going to move homeowners and possibly other products in more states to the non-admitted market. And we plan to set up a structure that, over time, we expect to be supported by third-party capital providers in addition to AIG. This structure will provide more flexibility to manage aggregation, price, limit, terms and conditions and to innovate to solve evolving client needs. We will continue to provide coverage to our clients in the U.S. utilizing a hybrid model of non-admitted and admitted products in some states and admitted-only products in other states.\nWe're already seeing the benefits of this strategy in our portfolio as the reduction in key catastrophe perils is apparent in these early stages. For example, since year-end 2021, gross wildfire PMLs are down approximately 35% to 40% across the entire PML return period curve.\nNow I want to review Russia, Ukraine. Last quarter, I addressed the many complexities and uncertainties that this situation presents, particularly those related to aviation policies issued to airline operators and leasing companies, including questions surrounding the occurrence of actual losses, loss mitigation efforts, whether any losses arise from war versus non-war apparels and the potential applicability of sanctions. These complexities and uncertainties very much continue. The claims we have received continue to be largely reported under political violence or political risk policies. And we continue to reserve our best estimate of ultimate losses, heavily comprised of IBNR despite the fact that the information we have received in connection with these claims remains very limited. Moreover, in the event of losses and the lines of business we have outlined that are subject to a potential loss, we have multiple reinsurance programs available.\nTurning to AIG 200. We started this 3-year journey in 2019. AIG 200 was designed to transform our core foundational capabilities across the company, and our financial objective was to deliver $1 billion of exit run rate savings with a cost to achieve of $1.3 billion. At the end of the second quarter, we achieved these goals 6 months earlier than expected. Delivering on these critical operational and financial objectives is a major accomplishment for our team.\nAIG 200 was successful because we maintained a tight governance structure and saw exceptional collaboration from colleagues across all major areas of the company. While the original objectives of AIG 200 have been completed, our team will remain focused on continuous improvement in operational excellence.\nAIG 200 has put the company in a significantly better place. Specifically, we modernized our IT platform, retiring over 50% of our identified applications and moving 80% of our infrastructure to the public cloud. We now have a global standard commercial underwriting platform that streamlines our processes and allows over 3,000 underwriters to make better risk management decisions in real time. This platform also includes a new global location management system that allows us to better understand and manage our PML exposure. We made significant investments in key capabilities, including building a consistent underlying data infrastructure, enhancing our digital capabilities through new distribution partner and client portals linked to a single common call center platform and fundamentally streamlined our finance reporting capabilities for faster decision-making. And we streamlined our global operations and shared services capabilities by moving over 10,000 roles to outsourcing partners.\nI want to thank all of our colleagues involved in AIG 200 for their outstanding performance. They should take great pride in knowing they established a new infrastructure and foundation for AIG that we will continue to build on and that will drive benefits for our stakeholders now and in the future.\nTurning to our capital management strategy. We will continue to be balanced and disciplined as we maintain appropriate levels of debt while returning capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends while also allowing for investment in growth opportunities across our global portfolio.\nAs I said earlier, we had a very successful second quarter where we reduced net debt outstanding by $1.4 billion, repurchased $1.7 billion of common stock, paid $256 million in dividends and ended with $5.6 billion in parent liquidity. Looking ahead, with respect to debt repayment, AIG will receive the remaining $1.9 billion under the promissory note from Life and Retirement prior to the IPO. And we expect to use these proceeds to pay down additional AIG debt and for other purposes.\nWith respect to share buybacks, we have $5.8 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization and expect to repurchase at least $1 billion of common stock in the third quarter. With respect to growth opportunities, our priorities continue to be focused on allocating capital in General Insurance where we see opportunities for profitable organic growth and further improvement in our risk-adjusted returns.\nAs we discussed on our last call, we expect that post deconsolidation of the Life and Retirement business, AIG will achieve a return on common equity at or above 10%. Shane will provide more details on ROE and on capital management in his remarks.\nShane, I'll turn the call over to you.\n\nShane Fitzsimons\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American International Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning to all. As Peter noted, I will provide more detail on our second quarter financial results and unpack a number of our key performance metrics, specifically EPS, liquidity, leverage, net investment income and ROCE.\nI will begin by providing more detail on the financial results of General Insurance and Life and Retirement in the second quarter. I will then provide more detail on net investment income. I will then review our balance sheet, leverage, AOCI, liquidity and share count, which benefited from excellent execution on a number of capital transactions. And finally, I want to provide you more detail on the execution path to 10% ROCE for AIG and more detail on what we intend to do to get there, including income drivers, expense reduction and AIG 200 where, as Peter noted, we have contracted or executed on our stated goal of $1 billion of exit run rate savings 6 months ahead of our original time line.\nTurning to EPS. Adjusted after-tax EPS was $1.19 per diluted common share. Improvements in General Insurance profit of $1.26 billion contributed $0.06 year-over-year. Within General Insurance, strong underwriting income of $799 million contributed $0.31 of improvement, offset by a $0.25 decline in net investment income primarily driven by the decline in alternatives. And reduction in shares outstanding also contributed $0.10.\nLife and Retirement declined $0.52 in APTI to $563 million, which was below last year's second quarter primarily due to $0.36 or $387 million unfavorable from lower net investment income, $0.19 or $202 million from accelerated DAC amortization and an increased SOP 03-1 reserves. The net investment income decline in Life and Retirement was due to alternatives being down $0.21 and an $0.11 decline in yield enhancement income.\nAs I noted, General Insurance's adjusted pretax income contribution in the second quarter was $1.26 billion, which reflects strong underwriting profit growth and continued improvement in the calendar year combined ratio of 510 basis points to 87.4%, and the accident year combined ratio ex CAT of 260 basis points to 88.5%.\nGeneral Insurance adjusted pretax income improved by $63 million year-over-year. Underwriting income improved by $336 million driven by a $182 million improvement in accident year underwriting income in addition to $137 million from an improved PYD, offset by a reduction in alternative investment income in the quarter. The combined ratio improvement was due to improved underwriting income, earned premium growth, expense discipline, low catastrophe losses and favorable PYD, which all contributed to pretax underwriting income being up 73% year-over-year, increasing to $799 million from $463 million.\nNorth America Commercial had another 300 basis points improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT over the prior year quarter, coming in at 88.2%. International Commercial also continued to improve profitability with 550 basis points improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT this quarter, coming in at a strong 81.4% for the second quarter.\nNorth America Personal had a 40 basis points improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT over the prior year quarter, coming in at 99.7%. International Personal experienced a 120 basis points deterioration in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT, coming in at 95.2% for the second quarter.\nIn the second quarter, CAT losses were $121 million or 1.8 loss ratio points compared to $138 million or 2.1 loss ratio points in the prior year quarter. Prior year development, excluding related premium adjustments, was $202 million favorable this quarter compared to the favorable development of $51 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter, the ADC amortization provided $42 million of favorable development. And the balance of $160 million favorable arose mostly from old accident years in workers' compensation along with primary casualty lines in the U.S. The review in the quarter was mainly focused on North America and represents approximately 15% of reserves.\nWithin both AIGRM loss-sensitive work comp and U.S. primary casualty lines, there were additional indications of higher favorable development, but we felt it prudent to wait and see how the inflationary environment evolves, particularly as it relates to the casualty bodily injury and the medical side of workers' comp. We look at this quarterly, and as is our standard practice, we will be reviewing approximately 75% of the total pre-ADC General insurance reserves in the third quarter.\nLife and Retirement adjusted pretax income of $563 million compared to $1.12 billion in the second quarter of 2021. The year-over-year decline was due to $387 million of lower net investment income, of which $224 million is from lower alternative investment income as well as accelerated DAC and increased SOP reserves of $202 million driven by the market declines in the second quarter. The DAC and SOP charges had approximately 300 basis points negative impact on ROCE in the quarter, but these are largely noncash.\nWithin Individual Retirement, fixed annuity sales increased 48% year-over-year, aided by origination activity to the Blackstone relationship. And fixed index annuity had another solid quarter of sales. Sales of variable annuities declined in the quarter, consistent with market conditions.\nNet flows were positive $628 million this quarter compared to negative net flows of $77 million in the prior year quarter. And variable and indexed annuity spreads expanded 2 basis points from the first quarter of 2022.\nGroup Retirement had strong deposits in the quarter of $1.8 billion, while surrenders declined and base net investment spread was up 4 basis points versus the first quarter of 2022.\nLife Insurance adjusted pretax income was $117 million. The second quarter represented the lowest COVID mortality quarter since the pandemic began, while non-COVID mortality also ran favorable in the period. Premiums and deposits also continued to benefit from the solid international life sales, which comprise approximately 45% of new sales activity.\nOur previously reported level of spread rate compression has been in the range of 8 to 16 basis points annually. But given current market conditions, we now expect to be better than 8 basis points for the full year.\nAs you are aware, for the Life and Retirement business, we conduct our entire reserve review in the third quarter. However, with the recent focus on the guaranteed universal life product, I will provide a few comments. First, this is not a large block for us. So we do not have much exposure in our in-force block, which is approximately $3 billion in net statutory reserves, which represents 2% of our net liabilities. For context, we did participate in the recent industry study on this topic. And our projected lapse rates, fund bases and dynamic premium modeling approach are consistent with the recommendations of the study. As additional background, over the last 5 years, we have been reviewing and strengthening our reserve assumptions for the guaranteed universal life product. And as a result, we don't expect significant adjustments.\nTurning to other operations, which includes interest expense, corporate general operating expenses, institutional asset management expense, runoff portfolio and eliminations, it was a positive contributor to adjusted pretax income year-over-year by $149 million. Corporate general operating expenses improved $74 million year-over-year in the second quarter, benefiting from AIG 200 and continued emphasis on expense management.\nAdjusted pretax net investment income for the quarter was $2.5 billion, a decline of $678 million compared to the second quarter of 2021. As a reminder, we report the results of our private equity holdings on a 1-quarter lag, and we may have an impact in the third quarter as well.\nOver the last few years, we focused on improving the risk profile of the investment portfolio with continued vigilance around corporate and consumer credit and a strong capital and liquidity profile in both General Insurance and Life and Retirement, which support our ability to manage through difficult times as evidenced by our financial stability through COVID.\nIn Life and Retirement, our weighted average credit rating has improved since the end of 2015, while the percentage of capital-intensive assets has declined in the portfolio from 10.5% to 8.3%. In the second quarter, we continued the proactive steps in the investment portfolio to avoid potential overexposure in the event credit deteriorates.\nWe sold RMBS and ABS securities with a market value of $3.2 billion in the second quarter. In addition, we have alternative investments, particularly hedge funds, that have generated good returns over time but with more quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and that is more volatility than we would prefer.\nGoing forward, we would expect to move over time to an asset allocation with less volatility. We've also executed on sales of approximately $4 billion of low-yielding longer-duration corporate bonds to buy higher-yielding, shorter-duration structured securities, privates, ABS and CMLs with many of them being floaters. We feel it is appropriate to take advantage of the higher rate environment and turn the portfolio over a little more quickly than would naturally occur at maturity, thereby enhancing our forward APTI and ROCE.\nThe second quarter saw significant increases in benchmark treasury yields with a 65 basis point increase on the 10-year or 146 basis points through June 30. With General Insurance and Life and Retirement portfolio durations are just under 4 and 8 years, respectively, the overall rising interest rate environment will provide a tailwind to our investment portfolio returns.\nOur base fixed income portfolio saw a lift in yield of 18 basis points in the second quarter versus first quarter with $17 million additional within General Insurance and $28 million additional in Life and Retirement.\nThe new money yield on our base portfolio was approximately 80 basis points above the assets rolling off the portfolio during the second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, the new money yield is roughly 130 basis points higher than the overall current portfolio in General Insurance and roughly 75 basis points higher in Life and Retirement.\nMoving on to the balance sheet, leverage and liquidity. As Peter noted, we closed the quarter with $5.6 billion of parent liquidity. The second quarter includes execution of $1.7 billion in share repurchases, $256 million of common and preferred dividends and $1.4 billion net spend on debt reduction actions, including AIG debt retirement and extinguishment costs of $7.9 billion that is partially offset by the Corebridge debt issuance of $6.5 billion.\nIn the second quarter, we saw a large AOCI movement as a result of increasing interest rates. Adjusted AOCI, which excludes the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude, moved from negative $5.9 billion to negative $15.4 billion or an additional reduction of $9.5 billion. We exited the second quarter with GAAP leverage of 31.1%, up from 27.8%, a 330 basis point increase quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in AOCI in the period added 390 basis points to the leverage ratio. This was partially offset by the net debt reduction of $1.3 billion in the period in addition to net income gains. The impact of AOCI is substantially larger in Life and Retirement and General Insurance, given the duration of their respective asset portfolios. At quarter end, our debt leverage ratio, excluding AOCI, was 25.3%, down 60 basis points versus 25.9% at the end of the first quarter of 2022.\nTotal adjusted return on common equity was 7%, down from 10.5% in 2Q '21. And total company adjusted tangible return on common equity was 7.6%. The decrease is mostly caused by decline in net investment income. General Insurance's adjusted attributable return on common equity was 12% in the second quarter while Life and Retirement was 7.6%. Life and Retirement's ROCE was impacted by approximately 300 basis point drag from the acceleration of DAC, an increase in the SOP 03-1 reserves in the second quarter.\nAdjusted book value per share of $72.23 increased 2.1% sequentially and 20.2% year-over-year. Adjusted tangible book value per share of $66.06 increased 2.2% sequentially and 21.8% year-over-year. Our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized with General Insurance's U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the second quarter estimated to be between 475% and 485%. And the Life and Retirement U.S. fleet estimated to be between 415% and 425%, both above our target ranges.\nFinally, during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 30 million shares at an average cost of $58.25, bringing our GAAP ending share count to 771 million with the quarterly average of 801 million compared to 873 million in the prior year quarter, representing an 8% reduction in average share count.\nAs we previously disclosed, our agreement with Blackstone includes an exchange right put option, which is not exercisable until November of 2024. That gives Blackstone the right to exchange their stake in Corebridge for shares in AIG. Under the applicable accounting principles, this put option was dilutive in the second quarter and resulted in 43 million additional shares outstanding for the purposes of the adjusted EPS calculations in the period. It is worth noting that this put option goes away upon the execution of the IPO.\nLooking ahead, we have 4 priorities, which all lead to ROCE improvement towards our 10% or greater goal: continued momentum on underwriting excellence, expense reduction through operational excellence and expense discipline, the successful IPO and separation of the Life and Retirement business and continued execution on our capital management priorities.\nContinued momentum on underwriting excellence will include further improvements in our underwriting profitability without an increase in volatility as well as underwriting portfolio optimization, which involves both measured growth on proper leverage to optimize return allocation. While we have made significant progress to date, we are still achieving written rate above trends, both in business today and that which we have not yet earned in.\nExpense reduction will come through continued cost discipline, operational excellence, earn-in of AIG 200 run rate savings and a reduction of parent GOE. As Peter mentioned, we have now contracted or executed on $1 billion of savings related to AIG 200, and we have realized $610 million of savings to date. That leaves $390 million of savings that AIG expects to earn in over the coming 12 to 18 months.\nWe also expect roughly $300 million of the AIG corporate expenses will move to Life and Retirement upon deconsolidation. In addition, as Peter stated, we now expect Life and Retirement to execute a cost savings program, which will generate close to $400 million in savings and expect the program to deliver the first $100 million before year-end.\nWith respect to the execution on our capital management priorities, we have already accelerated our share repurchases this year and expect additional repurchases as we get more clarity on the timing of the proceeds from the Corebridge IPO. Contemplated in our current plan, which includes the completion of the Corebridge IPO, we expect to reduce our share count to somewhere in the range of 600 million to 650 million shares, while maintaining leverage in the 20% to 25% level along with strong capitalization at the insurance subsidiary company level.\nEach of these drivers has some elements of tailwind to them. Additionally, yield enhancement in the base investment portfolio should provide meaningful lift in earnings power over time based on the current economic backdrop. To date, we're beginning to see the benefit of higher yields driving higher base portfolio returns where we are not dependent on higher interest rates to achieve our goal. These focus areas give us a line of sight to a minimum of 300 to 400 basis points of ROCE improvement. We will continue to provide updates over time.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call back over to you, Peter.\n\nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director\n\nGreat. Thank you, Shane. And operator, we're prepared to take questions.",

This conference is being recorded. Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\n\nQuentin John McMillan\n\nVP, MD & Head of IR, American International Group, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, Jake. Good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by the applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statement if circumstances or management's estimates or opinion should change.\nAdditionally, today's remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at www.aig.com.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us to review our first quarter financial results. I'm very pleased to report that AIG had an excellent start to 2022. We are successfully executing on several strategic, operational and financial priorities, and our team has significant momentum on many fronts, which we believe will continue throughout the year.\nFollowing my remarks, Shane will provide more detail on our financial results, and then we will take questions. Mark Lyons, David McElroy and Kevin Hogan will join us for the Q&A portion of today's call.\nToday, I will cover 4 topics. First, I will outline the tremendous progress we've made towards the separation of our Life and Retirement business, which will be renamed Corebridge Financial. Second, I will review the excellent first quarter performance of General Insurance, where we continue to drive top line growth, particularly in Global Commercial, and saw meaningful improvement in underwriting profitability. Third, I will cover Life and Retirement's financial performance. This business remains a meaningful contributor to our overall results. And fourth, I'll provide an update on our capital management strategy, particularly as to stock buybacks, which we plan to accelerate over the course of 2022, given our positive view of AIG's future over the near, medium and long term.\nBefore I turn to these topics, I'd like to discuss the situation in Russia and Ukraine. It goes without saying that what is happening is heartbreaking. Ukrainian people are experiencing unimaginable pain and suffering. And it's our hope that a peaceful resolution will be achieved.\nWith respect to the insurance industry, we've not seen a situation like this in modern times. It presents a unique set of circumstances that make any exposure or coverage analysis complex. Let me start by commenting on what we saw at AIG in the first quarter and what we did with a few claims that were submitted.\nThe claims we received were largely reported under political violence or political risk policies. While the amount of information included in the claims was limited, we did reserve our best estimate of ultimate losses, including IBNR. While we know it will take time for the full impact of the Russia-Ukraine situation to emerge, based on the work we did in the first quarter to analyze our exposures and review known claims, we do not believe the impact will be material to AIG. And in the event of losses, we have multiple reinsurance programs available.\nWith respect to the industry more broadly, there's not been much discussion so far in this earnings season regarding what the Russia-Ukraine situation means. So I thought I'd spend a few minutes on the complexity that it presents.\nAs a starting point, it's important to bear in mind that standard property and energy policies issued to the types of insureds most likely to have suffered losses due to the conflict typically contain broad exclusions for losses arising at a war and other hostile acts. In instances where affirmative coverage has been provided for losses that would typically fall within the scope of these exclusions, the most relevant coverages relate to policies such as political violence, political risk and trade credit, aviation and marine.\nNow I'd like to spend a few minutes on aviation because it's the topic that has received the most attention over the last 30 to 45 days. Aviation is similarly complex and it will take time before all the relevant facts and resulting coverage implications fully emerge.\nLet me start with what we know. We know that aviation policies can be issued to both airline operators and airline leasing companies and typically provide separate coverage for, on the one hand, losses caused by war perils, such as nationalization and confiscation; and on the other hand, losses caused by nonwar perils.\nWe also know that the invasion of Ukraine first occurred on February 24, and there were sanctions issued by the U.K. and the EU on February 26, which have since been updated. These sanctions generally required airline lessors to cancel leases with Russian airline operators and gave them a brief period in which to do so. Additionally, we know that there was an aircraft reregistration law passed in Russia on March 14, which permitted Russian airline operators to reregister aircraft leased from Western lessors on the Russian aircraft registry.\nWhat we don't know is much more expansive. As an initial matter, we don't know whether or to what extent actual losses have occurred or when they occurred, given the uncertainty surrounding the location and condition of aircraft and other equipment as well as the timing of their potential return to lessors, nor do we know if efforts have been undertaken by lessors to mitigate any damages.\nAs to the question of losses caused by war perils versus nonwar perils, this is a critical question that will need to be answered as the outcome will determine which policy might apply and the amount of coverage that may be available.\nWith respect to war perils such as government confiscation, this type of loss would typically be included in a whole war policy, but it must be first be determined if there's an actual confiscation. Even where it is determined that a government confiscation took place, consideration will also have to be given to the timing of notices and the geographic scope of coverage. The answers to these questions will impact whether there is a covered loss and, if so, whether a given whole war policy response.\nWith respect to reinsurance, structures likely implicated in a war peril scenario include war, marine and energy and political violence, but it's also possible that other types of reinsurance contracts could be available for recoveries. If a loss is alleged to be due to a nonwar peril, it could be covered in an all-risk policy. As an initial matter, however, a determination would need to be made that a loss in fact has occurred and then, if it has, that is due to a nonwar peril.\nAdditionally, as with war perils, you would have to consider if reinsurance is available. The reinsurance that would be typically available in an all-risk scenario may be in different structures than in government confiscation or other war peril scenario.\nAs to all potentially covered perils, there are many issues requiring analysis, including the potential applicability of any sanctions. Assuming claim payments are made, insurers will also have to consider their recovery rights through salvage and subrogation and contribution from other available insurance. This is just a high-level summary of some of the issues the industry will grapple with, but I thought they were important to highlight, and you get the idea that it's a complex situation.\nNow turning to the separation of Life and Retirement. We made significant progress to prepare this business to be a stand-alone public company. We continue to target an IPO in the second quarter, subject to market conditions and required regulatory approvals. We also continue to expect that we will retain a greater than 50% interest in this business post IPO. As you can appreciate, given where we are in the process, there are limitations on how much I can say about Life and Retirement, but let me give you some highlights of what we've accomplished since our last call. In March, we announced several important milestones: the public filing of the S-1; the new name for Life and Retirement which, as I mentioned, is Corebridge Financial; and the Independent Directors who currently serve on the Corebridge Board of Directors and those who will join and strengthen the Board as of the IPO.\nAt the same time, we launched a $6 billion Corebridge senior notes offering which was upsized to $6.5 billion based on significant demand. Shane will provide more detail on the maturities and coupons. We also made substantial progress on the operational separation of the Life and Retirement business from AIG, including identifying $200 million to $300 million of cost savings for this business, inclusive of $125 million in savings already in flight as part of our AIG 200 transformation program. And we continue to execute on establishing a hybrid investment management model that will allow Corebridge to benefit from strategic partnerships with world-class firms that offer excellent origination and investment capabilities and that complement our own capabilities in asset classes such as commercial mortgage loans, global real estate and private equity.\nThe first step in moving to this hybrid model was our strategic partnership with Blackstone, which we announced in 2021. In March of this year, we announced an arrangement with BlackRock, whereby BlackRock will manage up to $90 billion of Corebridge's liquid assets.\nIn addition, we developed a plan to modernize the mid- and back-office functionalities of the business and the transition to BlackRock's Aladdin technology platform with respect to Life and Retirement's entire investment portfolio. Aladdin enables us to replace aging and end-of-life technology infrastructure, provides risk analytics, establishes a single accounting book of record and a single investments book of record as well as reporting, stress testing and other services currently performed across multiple systems at AIG.\nWe expect that the cost for Corebridge to operate this hybrid model, taking into account both Blackstone and BlackRock, will be approximately the same as the fully loaded costs of our prior investment management operating model, where asset management was largely handled in-house.\nShifting to our first quarter financial results. As you saw in our press release, adjusted after-tax income was $1.30 per diluted share, representing an increase of 24% year-over-year. This result was driven by significant improvement in profitability in General Insurance, good results in Life and Retirement considering the current environment, continued expense discipline, savings from AIG 200 and strong execution of our capital management strategy.\nIn General Insurance, we reported an accident year combined ratio, excluding CAT, of 89.5%, a 290 basis point improvement year-over-year and the 15th consecutive quarter of improvement. We were especially pleased with the accident year combined ratio, excluding CAT and commercial, which was 86%, an improvement of 440 basis points year-over-year.\nIn Life and Retirement, first quarter results benefited from product diversity despite headwinds in the capital markets. Return on adjusted segment common equity was 10%. AIG ended the first quarter with $9.1 billion in parent liquidity after returning $1.7 billion to shareholders through $1.4 billion of common stock repurchases and $265 million of dividends.\nNow let me provide more detail on our first quarter results in General Insurance, where we continue to drive improved financial performance, with core fundamentals being key contributors. Gross premiums written increased 10% on an FX-adjusted basis to $11.5 billion, with commercial growing 11% and personal growing 8%. Net premiums written increased 5% on an FX-adjusted basis to $6.5 billion. This growth was led by our commercial business, which grew 8% with personal contracting 1%. Growth in North America Commercial net premiums written was 6% and then International net premiums written growth was 10%, both on an FX-adjusted basis.\nI'd like to unpack certain components of North America Commercial net premiums written as we had a very strong growth in our core business that may not be immediately obvious. While there are always movements each quarter in various aspects of our portfolio, both positive and negative, there were 3 items that impacted the first quarter that I'd like to provide more insight on. These items relate to assumed and ceded reinsurance and the timing of purchases, which is not something we have focused on previously but which I think is worth spending a few minutes on given the impact they had on North America Commercial net premiums written.\nThe first item relates to AIG Re, our assumed reinsurance business. Financial results for AIG Re are included in the financial results for North America Commercial and, in the first quarter, represented 40% of the segment's total net premiums written. For AIG Re, the first quarter is the largest quarter of the year with over 50% of its annual business written at 1/1. In the first quarter of 2022, AIG Re's net premiums written were flat year-over-year. This result was deliberate as we applied a disciplined approach to underwriting, and the market environment that persisted leading up to 1/1 led us to conclude that AIG Re could not achieve appropriate levels of risk-adjusted returns in property CAT, in particular, even with a comprehensive retrocessional program in place.\nAs a result, we reduced gross limits deployed in property CAT primarily in the U.S. by $500 million, which was the main reason for AIG Re's net premiums written being flat.\nWith respect to the second item, you may recall that in 2021, AIG Re made discrete retrocessional purchases throughout the year to further reduce frequency and volatility, whereas this year, retrocessional purchases were consolidated into the 1/1/2022 renewals as the retro market rebalanced. As a result of this decision, AIG Re ceded premiums were higher in the first quarter of 2022, which also reduced North America Commercial's net premiums written when compared to the first quarter 2021.\nThird, a similar dynamic occurred with respect to our core property CAT reinsurance program for AIG. In 2021, we purchased reinsurance throughout the year to lower net retentions and reduce volatility, particularly with respect to North America property CAT. In 2022, however, those purchases were also consolidated into our core property CAT placement at 1/1.\nWe were able to consolidate these reinsurance purchases because our portfolio is much improved from last year with significantly reduced exposures. Like the actions we took in AIG Re, however, this reduced North America Commercial net premiums written in the first quarter. To summarize, some of these headwinds in the first quarter of 2022 will largely reverse in the second quarter.\nNow turning back to growth. In North America Commercial, we saw a very strong growth in net premiums written, particularly in Retail Property, which grew more than 20%; Crop Risk Services, which also grew more than 20%; Lexington wholesale, which grew more than 15% led by property, which grew more than 50%; and our Canadian commercial business, which grew more than 15%.\nIn International Commercial, we also saw very strong growth, including in property, which grew 50%; specialty, which grew 34% driven by energy and marine; and Financial Lines, which grew 14%. In Global Commercial, we also had very strong renewal retention of 86% in our in-force portfolio in both North America and International, with North America improving retention by 300 basis points and International retention holding constant year-over-year. We calculate renewal retention prior to the impact of rate and exposure changes.\nAnd across commercial on a global basis, our new business was very strong, coming in north of $1 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter. New business growth in North America and in International were both up 13%. North America new business growth was led by Lexington and Retail Property. International Commercial new business growth was led by Financial Lines and global specialty.\nTurning to rate. Strong momentum continued in Global Commercial, with overall rate increases of 9% or 10% if you exclude workers' compensation. And in the aggregate, rate continued to exceed loss cost trends. This continues to be a market in which we are achieving rate on rate in many cases for the fourth consecutive year and where we're successfully driving margin expansion above loss cost trends.\nNorth America Commercial achieved 8% rate increases overall, 10% excluding workers' compensation, with some areas achieving double-digit increases led by Retail Property, which increased 14%; Lexington, which increased 13%; Financial Lines, which increased 12%, including more than 85% rate increases in cyber; and Canada, where rate increased 13%, representing the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases in this region.\nInternational Commercial rate increases were 10% overall driven by Financial Lines, which increased 21%, including more than 60% rate increases in cyber; property, which increased 14%; EMEA, which also increased 14%; and Asia Pac, which increased 10%.\nLast quarter, we indicated that our severity trend view in the aggregate in North America Commercial range from 4% to 5% and that we were migrating towards the upper end of that range. We now believe the upper end is moving towards 5.5% mostly driven by shorter-tail lines. Our property rate changes, where we continue to achieve mid-teen increases, equal or exceed loss cost trends in our own data and in government-published inflationary indices. Our liability trend assumptions continue to be in the 7% to 9% range, with International indications continuing to be less than those in North America.\nTurning to Personal Lines. In North America, personal net premiums written grew nearly 40%, albeit off a smaller base, driven by a rebound in Travel and A&H, which was offset by a reduction in Warranty and increased reinsurance cessions supporting Private Client Group. International Personal saw a 5% reduction in net premiums written on an FX-adjusted basis, due to a reduction in Warranty and personal auto in Japan offset by a rebound in A&H and Travel. Overall, Personal Lines is an area where we continue to invest where there are attractive opportunities for profitable growth.\nNow let me review Life and Retirement's results. This business had a good quarter considering the headwinds created by the capital markets. These market dynamics were offset by continued strong alternative investment income and strong growth in premiums and deposits, which increased 13% year-over-year to $7.3 billion. Adjusted pretax income in the first quarter was $724 million, with return on attributed segment equity of 10%. Adjusted pretax income decreased in the period due to lower call and tender income and continued elevated COVID-19 mortality, which is still within our previously established guidance.\nBlackstone's capabilities in the early days of our partnership resulted in Life and Retirement seeing one of its strongest fixed annuity sales quarters in over a decade, with premiums and deposits up nearly 150% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, while surrenders and death benefits both improved slightly. Post separation, we continue to expect that Life and Retirement, meaning Corebridge, will achieve a return on equity of 12% to 14%, and that it will pay an annual dividend of $600 million.\nOverall, I'm pleased with the momentum in Life and Retirement and, in particular, the early success of our partnership with Blackstone that was evident in the first quarter results.\nWith respect to capital management, we had a very active first quarter, which ended with $9.1 billion in parent liquidity. As a result of the actions I outlined earlier in my remarks, AIG received $6.5 billion of the $8.3 billion promissory note issued to AIG from Corebridge, and those funds were used to repay outstanding AIG debt, resulting in AIG's interest expense being reduced by 23% year-over-year. In addition, AIG will receive the remaining $1.9 billion under the Corebridge promissory note during the second quarter.\nOur capital management strategy will continue to be both balanced and disciplined as we maintain appropriate levels of debt while returning capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends while also allowing for investment in growth opportunities across our global portfolio. This will also be true over time as we continue to sell down our stake in Life and Retirement.\nWith respect to share buybacks, as I mentioned earlier, we repurchased $1.4 billion of common stock in the first quarter and are on track to buy back at least $1 billion more in the second quarter. This will leave us with approximately $1.5 billion remaining under our prior Board authorization. And as you saw in our press release, the AIG Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $5 billion in share repurchases.\nWith respect to growth opportunities, our priorities continue to be focused on allocating capital in General Insurance, where we see opportunities for profitable organic growth and further improvement in our risk-adjusted returns. As we move through 2022 and are further along with the separation of Life and Retirement, we will provide updates regarding our capital management strategy.\nBefore I turn the call over to Shane, I want to emphasize how pleased I am with how we started the year across AIG and how we are continuing to execute on multiple complex strategic priorities with high-quality results that are positioning AIG as a top-performing company. Our teams have overperformed across the board, and our deep bench continues to provide us with opportunities to leverage skill sets and further develop talent across the organization.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Shane.\n\nShane Fitzsimons\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American International Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning to all. I am very pleased to be AIG's CFO, and I look forward to working with everyone moving forward. I will provide more detail on our first quarter financial results and unpack a number of our key performance metrics, specifically EPS, liquidity, leverage, net investment income and ROCE.\nI will begin by going through the financial results of the businesses in the quarter. I will then touch upon the balance sheet, leverage and liquidity, which benefited from excellent execution on a number of capital transactions. I will then supplement Peter's remarks on the separation of Corebridge, including the arrangement we announced with BlackRock and liability management actions we recently completed. I will then spend some time on investment income and will provide insight on the impact of rising interest rates. And finally, I will talk about the execution path towards our long-term 10% ROCE goal for AIG, including income drivers, AIG 200 and other areas of corporate GOE reduction.\nAs Peter mentioned, adjusted EPS attributable to AIG common shareholders grew 24% year-over-year to $1.30 per diluted common share compared to $1.05 per diluted common share in 1 quarter '21. Compared to the first quarter '21, improvements in General Insurance contributed $0.33 year-over-year, reduction in share count contributed $0.07 and lower interest expense contributed $0.04, offset by Life and Retirement being $0.19 unfavorable primarily due to $0.20 unfavorable due to lower net investment income.\nGeneral Insurance's adjusted pretax income contribution in the quarter was $1.2 billion, which reflects strong underwriting profit, growth in Global Commercial and continued improvement in both the GAAP combined ratio up 590 basis points to 92.9% and the accident year combined ratio ex CAT improving 290 basis points to 89.5%. The combined ratio improvement was due to improved underwriting, premium growth, expense discipline and lower CATs, which all contributed to pretax underwriting income being 6x higher than the first quarter of 2021, increasing to $446 million from $73 million. With net investment income down $7 million year-over-year, the $366 million improvement in adjusted pretax income was driven by underwriting income, of which $223 million was from improved accident year underwriting income, $146 million due to lower CAT and $4 million from improved net PYD.\nNorth America Commercial has shown a 580 basis points improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT over the prior year quarter, coming in at 88.1%. International Commercial also continued to improve profitability with 330 basis points improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CAT this quarter, coming in at 83.5% for the first quarter.\nPersonal Insurance GAAP combined ratio of 97.2% improved by 160 basis points year-over-year. In the first quarter, CAT losses were $274 million or 4.5 loss ratio points compared to $422 million or 7.3 loss ratio points in the prior year quarter. The most significant loss events in the quarter came from flooding in Australia and a Japanese earthquake. The ongoing events with Russia and Ukraine, which Peter discussed, contributed approximately $85 million of the estimated loss.\nPrior year development, excluding related premium adjustments, was $93 million favorable this quarter compared to favorable development of $56 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter, the ADC amortization provided $42 million of favorable development, and the balance of $51 million favorable arose from old accident years in U.S. workers' compensation along with short-tail lines in North America and in Japan Personal Lines.\nLife and Retirement adjusted pretax income of $724 million compared to $941 million in 1Q '21, a reduction of $217 million mostly attributable to lower net investment income, which was $2.1 billion in the quarter compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year quarter, a decrease of $224 million, reflecting lower call and tender activity from rising interest rates; the absence of the affordable housing portfolio, which was sold in fourth quarter '21 as well as reduced fee income; and an increase in deferred acquisition cost and statement of position reserves due to lower separate account asset values.\nWithin Individual Retirement, excluding the Retail Mutual Fund business, which was sold, net flows were positive $874 million this quarter compared to positive net flows of $50 million in the prior year quarter, benefiting from higher fixed annuity sales aided by origination activity through the Blackstone partnership.\nGroup Retirement grew deposits by 3.9% in the quarter, driven by higher group acquisition and individual deposits driving a slight uptick in fee and advisory income due to higher assets under administration. Life Insurance adjusted pretax income was a loss of $44 million due to continued elevated COVID mortality, while premium and deposits grew 3.4% to $1.2 billion, benefiting from growth of international life sales. Institutional Markets grew premiums and deposits as well as reserves due to increased pension risk transfer activity in the period.\nTurning to Other Operations, which includes interest expense, corporate general operating expenses, institutional asset management expense, runoff portfolios and eliminations and was a positive contributor to adjusted pretax income year-over-year by $109 million. These results benefited from lower interest expense of $51 million as we reduced our general borrowings through the course of 2021 by $4 billion and lower eliminations of $43 million. Corporate general operating expenses, excluding increased functional costs to set up Corebridge as a stand-alone public company of $6 million, were largely flat year-over-year.\nMoving on to the balance sheet, leverage and liquidity. Our financial flexibility remains strong. We closed the quarter with $9.1 billion of parent liquidity. We saw a large AOCI movement as a result of increase in interest rates. Adjusted AOCI, which excludes the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude, moved from $3.9 billion positive to a $5.9 billion negative, or a reduction of $9.8 billion. Although this mark-to-market impact is a drag on capital, as long as we hold the assets to maturity, we will not realize this unrealized loss.\nOperating interest rate movements impact our metrics primarily in 2 places: one, we end up with a gain on the Fortitude Re embedded derivative, which impacted GAAP EPS by $3.21 in the quarter; and second, it impacts our GAAP leverage by a little over 300 basis points. And with interest rates up another 55 basis points in April, we expect to see further movement in Q2.\nWe exited the quarter at a GAAP leverage of 27.8%, up from 24.6%, the increase of which is attributable to the AOCI movement. The impact is larger in Life and Retirement than General Insurance given the duration of their respective asset portfolios.\nTotal adjusted return on common equity was 7.6%, up from 7.4% in the first quarter '21, and total company adjusted tangible return on common equity was 8.3%. General Insurance's adjusted attributable return on common equity was 12.3% in the first quarter, while Life and Retirement was 10%. Adjusted book value per share of $70.72 increased 2.7% sequentially and 20.5% year-over-year. Adjusted tangible book value per share of $64.65 increased 2.9% sequentially and 22.3% year-over-year.\nOur primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized, with General Insurance's U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the first quarter estimated to be between 470% and 480%, and the Life and Retirement U.S. fleet is estimated to be between 430% and 440%, both well above our target ranges.\nFinally, on EPS during the quarter. We repurchased 23 million shares at an average cost of $60.02 for $1.4 billion, bringing our ending share count to 800 million with a quarterly average of 826 million compared to 876 million in the prior year quarter, representing a 6% reduction in average share count, which contributed $0.07 of EPS growth in the quarter.\nTurning to Corebridge. Since the start of the year, we continue to make progress on numerous fronts with respect to the separation. As Peter mentioned, at the end of the first quarter, Corebridge entered into a strategic partnership with BlackRock to manage up to $90 billion of liquid assets. At the same time, AIG also entered into a separate arrangement with BlackRock, whereby BlackRock will manage liquid assets for AIG representing up to $60 billion. Having now signed IMAs, we expect to begin transferring assets to BlackRock over the course of the second quarter.\nIn early April, Corebridge successfully raised $6.5 billion of senior notes which, along with the remaining $2.5 billion of delayed draw term loan facility and commitments for the $2.5 billion of revolving credit facility, this establishes the capital structure for Corebridge Financial. AIG proactively hedged treasury rates earlier in the year, and upon unwinding the hedge at quarter end, AIG realized a $223 million gain, which equates to approximately 50 basis points in yield on the notes issued. While the debt issuance closed early in Q2, the $223 million gain was realized as a gain in the first quarter.\nThe senior notes offering, excluding the hedge, was well structured and laddered with a 3.91% weighted average coupon rate. Corebridge used the proceeds from that offering to repay $6.4 billion of the $8.3 billion promissory note payable to AIG. Following the success of Corebridge's senior notes issuance, AIG initiated a debt tender offer. Taking advantage of strong demand, the tender offer was upsized, and AIG parent debt was ultimately reduced by $6.8 billion. An additional EUR 750 million will be redeemed on May 10, bringing the total expected AIG parent debt reduction to $7.6 billion. The average coupon on the debt that we retired was 3.82%, and the annualized interest expense savings is approximately $290 million.\nWe continue to target debt leverage in the high 20s, excluding AOCI for Corebridge; and in the low 20s, including AOCI for AIG going forward. Given the significant progress we have made and with $1.9 billion of proceeds from the $8.3 billion note yet to be received, we have the necessary cash to finalize our planned debt actions without utilizing any of the proceeds from the IPO. With these actions completed, we remain on track for an IPO in the second quarter subject to market conditions and regulatory approval.\nNet investment income on an adjusted pretax income basis for the quarter was $3 billion. Total cash and investments were $305 billion, excluding Fortitude. Net investment income in the first quarter decreased $193 million compared to prior year, primarily reflecting lower call and tender income.\nThe first quarter saw significant increases in benchmark treasury yields, with an 80 basis point increase on the 10-year. With General Insurance and Life and Retirement's portfolio durations of 4 and 8.4 years, respectively, the overall rising interest rate environment will provide a tailwind to our investment portfolio returns.\nIn April, our portfolio crossed the equilibrium point, where new money yield is now 50 basis points higher on average than the yield on the assets rolling off the portfolio. The new money yield is higher by 20 basis points in General Insurance versus assets rolling off and 70 basis points in Life and Retirement versus the yield on sales and maturities currently.\nMoving forward, the new money yield is roughly 60 basis points higher than the current portfolio in General Insurance and roughly 90 basis points higher in Life and Retirement. To illustrate the point, holding all other variables constant and assuming 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, we would anticipate approximately $500 million of benefit to adjusted net investment income over a 1-year period with nearly $200 million in General Insurance and $300 million in Life and Retirement.\nWithin General Insurance, we have $11 billion of floating rate securities, which will begin to see some benefits in the near term, most of which are not tied to longer-dated liabilities. Life and Retirement is $25 billion of floating rate assets, but most of this portfolio is tied to floating rate liabilities that will offset the benefits.\nTurning to investments that have Russian exposure. At December 31, AIG held $359 million of sovereign and other foreign debt of the Russian Federation, of which $79 million were within Fortitude. Through proactive sell-downs of $129 million, which generated a loss of $41 million as well as the establishment of a credit allowance of $127 million, the market value of these securities at the end of the first quarter was $86 million, of which $18 million is held by Fortitude.\nLooking ahead, we have 3 priorities beyond continued progress on underwriting optimization and completing AIG 200. They are the successful separation of the Life and Retirement business, continued execution on our capital management priorities and ROCE improvement towards 10%. Post deconsolidation of Corebridge, we expect that AIG will earn a 10% ROCE, although there are many moving pieces that will get to this result, including the size and timing of the Corebridge IPO, additional capital management actions and continued progress on reducing expenses.\nAs we've improved expense ratios in General Insurance, one of the key drags on ROCE is corporate expenses, which we have been reducing through AIG 200 and work on the separation, but there remains more work to be done. As Peter noted, with respect to AIG 200, we continue to achieve significant milestones and, in the first quarter, reached $890 million of exit run rate savings with $590 million of that realized to date. We currently expect to have full line of sight into the $1 billion of exit run rate savings either contracted or identified by the end of the second quarter, 6 months earlier than originally planned.\nOf the $1 billion of parent expenses, we expect that approximately $300 million will move to Corebridge upon deconsolidation. We will continue to provide updates over time, but the components to get to a 10% ROCE, our continued growth in underwriting profit; improved net investment income as we benefit from higher interest rates; continued execution on expense management, particularly at parent; and optimizing capital allocation in terms of leverage and returns to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends whilst making sure that we continue to grow the company.\nPeter, I will now hand it back to you.\n\nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director\n\nThank you, Shane. Operator, we're ready for questions.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead.\n\nQuentin John McMillan\n\nVP, MD & Head of IR, American International Group, Inc.\n\nThank you very much, Katie. Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements, including comments relating to company performance, strategic priorities, including AIG's pursuit of a separation of its life and retirement business, business mix and market conditions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations. Actual performance and events may differ materially. .\nFactors that could cause results to differ include the factors described in our third quarter 2021 report on Form 10-Q and our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and other recent filings made with the SEC. AIG is under is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nAdditionally, some remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at www.aig.com.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO of AIG, Peter Zaffino.\n\nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. Following my prepared remarks, Mark will provide more detail on our financial results and other relevant updates to close out 2021. Shane Fitzsimons, who became AIG's CFO on January 1, will be available for Q&A, along with David McElroy and Kevin Hogan.\nToday, I will cover 4 topics: First, an overview of General Insurance fourth quarter and full year performance, where we continue to drive meaningful underwriting profitability improvement. I will also briefly touch on the 1/1 reinsurance renewal season. Second, I will review results from our Life and Retirement business, which continues to be a meaningful contributor to our overall results. Third, I will provide an update on our progress towards an IPO of Life and Retirement and operational separation of the business from AIG. And fourth, I will review our current plans regarding capital management.\nBefore turning to those topics, I want to take a few minutes to highlight some noteworthy achievements in 2021, which were significant for AIG. 2021 was a pivotal year and one in which our team executed on several strategic priorities. As you saw in our earnings release, adjusted after-tax income in 2021 was $5.12 per diluted share, representing a substantial increase of more than 100% year-over-year. We produced [strongly] throughout 2021, which provided flexibility and allowed us to return $3.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also repurchased $4 billion of debt, which reduced our debt leverage by 380 basis points to 24.6%. Notwithstanding these actions, we ended 2021 with $10.7 billion in parent liquidity.\nAs I said on prior calls, the path we've taken to improve AIG and our portfolio in General Insurance, in particular, with a significant undertaking. In General Insurance, given the portfolio we started with in 2018, we needed to make fundamental changes. We quickly overhauled our underwriting standards and developed a culture of underwriting excellence, including significantly reducing gross limits.\nTo give you a sense for the magnitude of what we needed to do, we reduced gross limits by over $1 trillion in our Property, Specialty and Casualty businesses. In addition, we took a conservative approach to volatility by reducing net limits and exposure through strategic implementation of reinsurance. As a result of this strategy, since 2018 and through 2021, we've been able to grow net premiums written in Commercial by over $3 billion, while ceding an additional $2 billion of reinsurance premium to further reduce volatility and protect the balance sheet. At the same time, we improved the combined ratio, excluding CATs, by [1,000] basis points. Simply put, today, we have a different portfolio with a markedly different risk profile, which we believe is significantly stronger by all measures.\nTurning to Life Retirement, we again had solid and consistent results throughout 2021, benefiting from product diversity within the business. Return on adjusted segment common equity was 14.2% for the full year. Throughout 2021, we also made tremendous progress on the separation of Life Retirement from AIG. We're executing on multiple work streams to operationally separate the business, and we closed on the sale of 9.9% equity stake and transferred $50 billion of assets under management to Blackstone.\nAdditionally, we achieved significant milestones at AIG 200 and remain on track to deliver $1 billion in run rate savings by the end of 2022 against the spend of $1.3 billion. I could not be prouder of what the team has accomplished. While we still have plenty of work ahead of us, it would be remiss of me not to recognize these accomplishments and the significant momentum we have heading into 2022.\nNow let me turn to our business results in General Insurance for the fourth quarter of 2021. Mark is going to go into more detail, but we had a terrific quarter to close out the year. In the fourth quarter, General Insurance net premiums written increased 8% overall on an FX-adjusted basis, with another strong quarter of 13% growth in Commercial, which was tempered somewhat by a slight contraction in Personal, with a 1% reduction in net premiums written. The growth in Commercial lines was balanced with 11% in North America and 16% in International.\nPersonal Lines net premium growth contracted by 1% in the quarter due to a 5% reduction in International, driven by our repositioning of the Personal Property portfolio in Japan, offset by 17% growth in North America, which largely reflects less year-over-year ceded reinsurance.\nLooking at fourth quarter profitability, I'm very pleased with the accident year combined ratio ex CATs, which improved 310 basis points year-over-year to 89.8%, the first sub-90% quarterly result since the financial crisis. This improvement was driven by Commercial, which achieved an accident year combined ratio ex CATs of 87.9%, a 380 basis point improvement year-over-year and the third consecutive quarter below 90%. Personal report 130 basis points of improvement in the accident year combined ratio ex CATs to 94.3%.\nPivoting to the full year 2021, we made enormous progress in improving the quality of the underwriting portfolio and driving growth throughout the year. Net premiums written grew 11% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven by Global Commercial growth of 16%. Growth in Commercial was particularly strong in both North America at 18% and International at 13%. We had very strong retention in our in-force portfolio with North America improving by 300 basis points and International improving by 500 basis points for the full year. Gross new business in Global Commercial grew 27% year-over-year to over $4 billion, with 24% growth in International and 30% in North America.\nTurning to rate. Overall, Global Commercial saw increases of 13%, and strong momentum continued in many lines. In Global Personal, we had some growth challenges in this segment, but Accident & Health performed very well, and overall, we had a solid year with net premiums written up 1% on an FX-adjusted basis. These results also reflect less reinsurance cessions in our high net worth business and some growth in Warranty.\nTurning to underwriting profitability for full year 2021. General Insurance's accident year combined ratio ex CATs was 91%, an improvement of 310 basis points year-over-year. The full year saw 140 basis point improvement in the accident year loss ratio ex CATs and 170 basis point improvement in the expense ratio, split evenly between the GOE ratio and the acquisition ratio. These positive results were driven by our improved portfolio mix, net earned premium growth, achieving rate in excess of loss cost trends, continued expense discipline, and the benefits we are receiving from AIG 200.\nGlobal Commercial achieved an impressive accident year combined ratio ex CATs of 89.1%, an improvement of 410 basis points year-over-year. The accident year combined ratio ex CAT for North America Commercial and International Commercial were 91% and 86.7%, which reflected improvements of 450 basis points and 340 basis points, respectively.\nIn Global Personal, the accident year combined ratio ex CATs was 94.9%, an improvement of 120 basis points year-over-year, driven by improvement in the expense ratio. These notable combined ratio improvements across General Insurance reflected improved higher-quality Global portfolio driven by the strategic underwriting actions and strong execution, which have enabled us to shift our focus towards accelerating profitable growth in areas of the market where we see attractive opportunities. We are very pleased with these materially improved results, which provide tangible evidence of our successful underwriting strategy and the significant progress we have made.\nTurning to January 1 renewals with respect to our ceded reinsurance, we were very pleased with the outcome of our reinsurance placements. While the markets presented significant challenges across the industry, with retrocessional limited along with other capacity issues, our reinsurance partners recognize the strength of our improved underwriting portfolio and reduced aggregation exposure, which translated to many improvements in our reinsurance structures, along with better terms and conditions. It's important to keep in mind that we placed over 35 treaties at 1/1, with over 65 discrete layers and over $12 billion of limit placed and we cede over $3 billion of premium in the market.\nAs you can imagine, we're not an index of market pricing because of the significant improvement in the portfolio, along with the size and complexity of our placements. We continue to maintain very strong relationships with our reinsurance partners. And the support we receive in the marketplace is evident in the quality of the overall reinsurance program. We continue to make meaningful improvements to our core placements in every major treaty on January 1, and as a result, continue to reduce volatility in our portfolio.\nWhile there's too much detail to cover on this call, I want to provide a few key highlights on our placements. For our Property CAT treaty, we improved the per occurrence structure and improved our aggregate structure for our Global Commercial businesses. For the North America per occurrence Property CAT treaty, we lowered our attachment point to $250 million for all perils, which is a reduction from our core 2021 program that had staggered attachment points, depending on apparel, that range from $200 million to $500 million. And we maintained our per occurrence attachment points in International, which are $200 million for Japan and $100 million for the rest of the world.\nFor our Global shared limit aggregate cover, we were able to reduce our attachment point in every region across the world, most notably, $100 million reduction in the attachment point in North America. Our Global shared limit, each and every deductible remain the same or reduced in every Global region, most notably $25 million reduction in North America-named storms.\nOur attachment point return periods are the same or lower in every region across the world when compared to our 2021 core reinsurance program, and our exhaustion period returns are higher in every instance across the world on an OEP and AEP basis. And we achieved these significant improvements while modestly reducing the total aggregate reinsurance CAT spend.\nOn our core Casualty treaty, we reduced our net limits on our excess to loss treaty in both North America and International. On our proportional core North America placement, we maintained the same session amount while improving our ceding commission by 400 basis points, which represents an 800 basis point improvement over the last 24 months, reflecting our significantly improved underwriting and recognition from the reinsurance market.\nLastly, we renewed our cyber structure at 1/1, with additional quota share [C] increasing from 60% to 70% and the aggregate placement attaching at 85% versus a 90% loss ratio.\nGiven the tight terms and conditions and discipline in our portfolio, along with significant rate increase we achieved during the year, we were able to secure more quota share authorization, which is a great example of the reinsurance market's flight to quality.\nAs we discussed on last earnings call, we've spent considerable time through AIG research and our Chief Underwriting office analyzing the impact of climate change and the increased frequency and severity of natural catastrophes. A few observations about 2021.\nIt was the sixth warmest year on record since NOAH began tracking global temperatures in 1880. Hurricane Ida estimated at $36 billion of insured loss was the third largest hurricane on record. In North America, $17 billion of winter weather losses was the largest on record for this peril. And $13 billion of insured loss for European flooding was the costliest disaster on record for the continent.\nWhile we've been working over the past few years to reposition our portfolio to limit exposure and dampen volatility, changing weather patterns and increased density of risk in peak zones have caused stress on aggregation and have [hampered] the ability of property underwriters to make appropriate risk-adjusted returns on capital deployed. These changes have caused us to look deeper into the exposures we are underwriting in several lines of business.\nAn example of a business that needs further attention and strategic repositioning is our high net worth Property portfolio within our Personal Insurance segment. By the nature of the business, it's exposed to peak zones and is susceptible to increased frequency and severity. This reality, together with secondary perils that have become primary perils in the underwriting and modeling process, as well as secondary perils and modeling, have all driven up loss costs, creating a significant issue that needs to be addressed.\nWhen analyzing the portfolio over the last 5 years, we've seen catastrophe levels that are 10x the level the portfolio dealt with in the prior 10 years for losses in excess of $50 million. The inability to reflect emerging risk factors, the effects of changes to modeling, increased loss costs from cats has put the profitability of the business under pressure. In addition, when you consider the increased exposure in most peak zones in the United States over the last few years, with significantly increased total insured values, in some cases, greater than 100%, more density, supply chain issues, reinsurance availability and increased reinsurance costs, and all this with heightened complexity the pandemic has caused, along with the impact of demand surge post-CATs, not being tested, the business model simply needs to change.\nRecognizing these realities, after careful review, we decided to take meaningful steps to address this risk issue in our high net worth business, which will allow us to continue to offer comprehensive solutions to our clients that are more consistent and sustainable. Aggregation and profitability challenges led us to the conclusion that we have to offer the property homeowners product as an example, through excess and surplus lines on a non-admitted basis in multiple states.\nFor example, in December, we announced that we would no longer be offering admitted personal property homeowners policies in the state of California. We cannot maintain our current level of aggregation in the state nor have we been able to achieve any profitability from this line of business.\nBeing a prudent steward of capital, these actions will enable us to segment the portfolio, achieve an acceptable return, reduce volatility and offer clients more comprehensive policy wordings and service.\nNow turning to Life Retirement. Full year results were driven by improved equity markets, strong alternative investment income, higher interest rates, higher call and tender income and higher fee income, partially offset by elevated mortality and base spread compression across products.\nAdjusted pretax income in the fourth quarter and full year was $969 million and $3.9 billion, respectively. The full year growth of 11% was driven by strong alternative investment and fee income. Full year sales were strong with premiums and deposits increasing 15% year-over-year to $31.3 billion.\nSales within our Individual Retirement segment grew 34% across our 3 product lines for the year. Assets under management were $323 billion, and assets under administration increased to $86 billion, benefiting both from strong sales activities and favorable economic conditions.\nWe also made excellent progress with Blackstone in the fourth quarter, completing the initial $50 billion asset transfer, incorporating them into our asset liability management process, finalizing the investment guidelines and developing initial product offerings based on Blackstone's origination platform.\nLastly, having analyzed our exposure to long duration target improvements, or LDTI accounting, based on the current interest rate and macro environment, we expect the transition impact of LDTI is well within Life Retirement's current balance of AOCI. Mark will provide more detail on this topic in his remarks.\nTurning to the separation and IPO of Life Retirement. In addition to closing Blackstone transactions, we also continue to make significant progress on operationally separating Life Retirement from AIG, both with respect to what can be done by the IPO and longer term to transition service agreements. We are applying the same rigor and discipline to our separation work [streams] as we have with our AIG 200 transformation program, but with a clear focus on speed to execution. We continue to work towards an IPO in the second quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions.\nAs I mentioned on our last call, due to the sale of our affordable housing portfolio in the fourth quarter, and the execution of certain tax strategies, we are not constrained in terms of how much of Life Retirement we can sell in an IPO. Having said that, the size of the IPO will be dependent on market conditions. We continue to expect to retain a greater-than-50% interest immediately following the IPO and to continue to consolidate Life Retirement's financial statements at least until such time as we fall below the 50% ownership threshold.\nFinally, turning to capital management. We've been giving significant thought to both Life Retirement as a stand-alone business and AIG as we continue the path to separation.\nWith respect to Life and Retirement, our goal remains to achieve a successful IPO of a business with a capital structure that is consistent with its industry peers. Life and Retirement has a strong balance sheet and limited exposure to legacy liabilities, and its insurance operations have a history of strong cash flow generation. We expect that over time, this business will sustain a payout ratio to shareholders of 60% to 65% between dividends and share repurchases on a full calendar year basis.\nWe also expect that post IPO, Life and Retirement will pay an annual dividend in the range of $400 million to $600 million, which equates to roughly a 2% to 3% yield on book value. Additionally, as part of the separation process, in the fourth quarter of 2021, Life and Retirement declared a dividend payable to AIG in the amount of $8.3 billion, which will be funded by Life and Retirement debt issuances and paid prior to the IPO. Our expectation is that a vast majority of this dividend payment will be used to reduce debt at AIG, and therefore, the overall amount of debt across our consolidated company will remain relatively constant at the time of the Life Retirement IPO.\nPost deconsolidation, we expect Life Retirement to maintain a leverage ratio in the high 20s, with AIG maintaining a leverage ratio in the low 20s.\nRegarding our current capital management plan for AIG, ending 2021 with $10.7 billion in parent liquidity provides us with a significant amount of flexibility. Our capital management philosophy will continue to be balanced to maintain appropriate levels of debt and to return capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, while also allowing for investment in growth opportunities across our Global portfolio. This will also be true post-IPO and over time as we continue to sell down our stake in Life Retirement.\nWith respect to share buybacks, we have $3.9 billion remaining under our current authorization and expect to complete this amount in 2022, weighted more towards the first half of this year. We do not expect the Life Retirement IPO to impact AIG's dividend and expect to maintain our current annual dividend level at $1.28 per share.\nWith respect to growth opportunities, our priorities will be to allocate capital in General Insurance, where we see opportunities to grow and further improve our risk-adjusted returns. We believe there are excellent opportunities for continued growth in Global Commercial Lines, which Mark will cover in more detail in his remarks.\nAs we move through 2022 and are further along with the IPO and separation of Life Retirement, we will continue to provide updates regarding capital management. As you can see, we made significant progress in 2021 and had a terrific year. 2022 will be another busy and transformational year for AIG. We started 2022 with a significant amount of momentum, and our colleagues continue to demonstrate an ability to execute on multiple fronts as we continue our journey to be a top-performing company.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark Lyons;Executive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning to all. Given Peter's comments, I will head directly into the fourth quarter results. Diluted adjusted earnings per share were $1.58, representing 68% growth over the prior year. This material improvement in adjusted EPS was driven by an over 1,000 basis point reduction in the General Insurance calendar quarter combined ratio; 9% growth in net earned premiums, led by Global Commercial with 13% net earned premium growth; and an improvement in the underlying accident year combined ratio ex CATs to 89.8%, as Peter mentioned, our first sub-90% quarterly results since before the financial crisis, which also represented a 310 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter.\nLife and Retirement delivered another quarter of solid returns and remained well positioned, with a 13.7% return on adjusted segment common equity for the fourth quarter and 14.2% for the full year 2021. The strength of our operating earnings and capital actions in the quarter helped drive a near 10% adjusted annualized ROE and growth in adjusted tangible book value per share of nearly $7, which represents a sequential increase of 12% and a full year increase of 23%. We fulfilled our capital management commitments and finished the year with a GAAP leverage ratio of 24.6%, a reduction of 150 basis points in the quarter and 380 basis points over the course of the year, which is another milestone, as we stated our goal was to be at or under 25% on this important metric.\nThis improvement was driven by approximately $4 billion of debt and hybrid retirement, along with $2.6 billion of share repurchases, nearly $2.1 billion of which occurred in the second half of 2021, which was slightly above our guidance.\nMoving to General Insurance. I will provide some color in areas which Peter did not touch upon in his opening remarks. Catastrophe losses of $189 million were significantly lower this quarter compared to $545 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's main drivers were the Midwest tornadoes and the Colorado wildfire. Prior year development was $44 million favorable in the fourth quarter compared to unfavorable development of $45 million in the prior year quarter. As usual, there was net favorable amortization from the ADC, which was $45 million this quarter. So PYD was essentially flat without this amortization.\nOn a full year basis, net favorable development amounted to $201 million relative to $43 billion in net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. In 2020, we released $76 million of net favorable development.\nShifting to premium growth. Overall Global Commercial Insurance net premiums grew 13% on a reported and constant dollar basis for the quarter, and growth in North America commercial was 11%, driven by Casualty, which increased 50%; Lexington, which increased 14%; and Financial Lines, which increased over 10%.\nIn International Commercial, growth was 16% on an FX-adjusted basis. And by line of business, Global Specialty, which is booked in International, grew over 25%. Talbot had 20% growth, and Property grew by 13%. Overall growth in the fourth quarter was driven by strong incremental rate improvement, higher renewal retentions and strong new business volumes.\nCommercial retention improved by 300 basis points year-over-year in North America to 80% and by 400 basis points in International to 86% in the period. This increase in wholesale business in North America Commercial brings with it lower channel retention ratios in addition to purposefully lower retentions in cyber and private D&O. Excluding these items, the retention ratios between North America and International Commercial are comparable. Commercial new business grew by 33% in the fourth quarter with 41% growth in North America and 25% growth in International.\nTurning to rate, where overall Global Commercial Lines saw increases of 10% in the quarter, we achieved the third straight year of double-digit increases. Strong momentum continued across most lines, and we continue to achieve rate above loss cost trends.\nNorth America Commercial's overall 11% rate increases were balanced across the portfolio and led by Financial Lines, which increased by 15%; Excess Casualty, which increased by 14%; Retail Property, which was up 13%; and Lexington, which increased by 11%. International Commercial rate increases in the aggregate were 9%, driven by EMEA, which increased by 18%; the U.K., which increased by 12%; Financial Lines, which increased 18%; and Energy, which was up 11%, which is also its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases.\nShifting now to a calendar year combined ratio comparison. General Insurance produced a 95.8% combined ratio for 2021, an improvement of 850 basis points over 2020 and nearly 1,600 basis points better from 2018's 111.4% calendar year combined ratio. Peeling back a bit more, the combined CAT and prior period development improvement has been 720 basis points since 2018, indicating both a material CAT exposure reduction, in line with the movement we have shown in our PMLs, and a much stronger loss reserve position than 3 years ago.\nTurning to additional pricing. Rate increases continue to be favorable and outpaced loss cost trends in most areas of the portfolio. With the level of rate that we have achieved in just the last 12 months, we expect that margin expansion will continue at least through 2022 and likely into accident year 2023.\nGetting more specific for illustrative purposes, we have communicated written rate changes during prior earnings calls and will continue to do so. However, since earned rate changes more directly impact reported results, and given recent discussions around the inflation component of loss cost trend, I thought I'd go over a few areas on an earned rate basis for full year 2021.\nIn North America Commercial, for example, Excess Casualty business that focuses on our national and corporate accounts has achieved an approximate earned rate increase approaching 40% in 2021 over 2020's earned rate level, as has cyber. D&O and non-admitted Casualty achieved earned rate increases in the mid-20s. And importantly, retail and wholesale property achieved earned rate increases during 2021 in the low 20s. This is noteworthy because Property is getting most of the inflation attention, and yet the level of earned rate that was achieved is, in my view, still materially ahead of property and loss cost trend. And the same could be said for both Excess Casualty and D&O.\nRecent Property written rate increases are still in the low teens, and looking into policy year 2022 should keep them above loss trend even with an inflationary spike. Property pricing needs to remain firm to cover these increased costs of labor, materials and transportation.\nTurning to International Commercial. Similar to North America, there are large areas of material earned rate increases for full year 2021. International Financial Lines achieved a 23% earned rate increase over 2020's earned rate level. The International property book achieved an 18% earned rate increase, and the Energy book achieved earned rate increases in the mid-20s.\nLet's now step back and look at the last 3 years of cumulative written rate increases achieved at a high level during 2019 through 2021. North America Commercial across all lines of business had a 47% cumulative written rate increase, and International Commercial's cumulative written rate increase during that same time period was 40%. These measures, although they don't take into account improved terms and conditions and other difficult-to-track impact, indicate, on their own, a significant ingredient of margin improvement as evidenced by the material reduction in our reported accident year results.\nAs we think about moving forward into calendar year 2022 and 2023, we need to be cognizant about the absolute, significantly favorable impact on combined ratios over the last 3 years and realize that most lines of business are well into the green. Although there are several opposite forces that work, such as economic and social inflation, my sense is that the 2022 market will continue to produce tight terms and conditions and strong pricing to sustain additional margin expansion into calendar 2023.\nAs we think about 2022, major areas of growth for North America would be Accident & Health as the economy is expected to begin rebounding, and Lexington on a non-admitted basis. And on the International side, we see growth in our Global Specialty operations, A&H as well and select Casualty and Financial Lines areas around the globe, whereas AIG Re sees growth mostly in casualty business.\nThe AIG Re portfolio strategically took the opportunity to further derisk and rebalance the portfolio away from property CAT due to our view of less-than-adequate returns in that space and expanded further into Casualty and Specialty Lines and expects to continue that trend. Furthermore, limits deployed in U.S. property were down about 10%, and the retrocessional program provided $1 billion of protection, with peak U.S. zone PML down meaningfully across most points in the return period curve.\nMoving to Life and Retirement. Premiums and deposits grew 19% in the fourth quarter, excluding Retail Mutual funds, relative to the comparable quarter last year. Growth was driven by Individual Retirement and $2.1 billion of pension risk transfer activity. APTI for the quarter was $969 million, down 6%, driven primarily by lower net investment income and unfavorable COVID-19 base mortality, although non-COVID-19 mortality returned to being better than pricing expectations.\nOn a full year basis, APTI increased to $3.9 billion, reflecting higher net investment income and fee income, partially offset by adverse mortality. Our investment portfolio and hedging program continued to perform extremely well for both the quarter and the year.\nComposite base spreads across Individual and Group Retirement, along with institutional markets, compressed 12 basis points during 2021 within the sensitivity guidance we've previously provided.\nWithin Individual Retirement, Index Annuities continued to be the net flows growth engine with $880 million of positive net flows for the quarter and $4.1 billion of the full year. APTI was essentially flat for full year 2021 over full year 2020, but premiums and deposits were up 34% and AUM was up 2% year-over-year to $159 billion.\nGroup Retirement had APTI of $314 million for the fourth quarter, virtually flat with last year's comparable quarter, but was up 27% on a full year basis, with premium and deposits up roughly 4% and assets under administration up over 7.5% on a full year basis to $140 billion.\nLife Insurance APTI was a negative $8 million in the fourth quarter, but had a gain of $106 million for the full year. Premiums and deposits grew 4% from fourth quarter of 2020 and over 5% for the full year to $4.7 billion. Additionally, total insurance in-force grew to $1.2 trillion, representing over 3% growth.\nOur COVID-19-related mortality exposure sensitivity of $65 million to $75 million pretax per 100,000 U.S. population deaths was in line based on the externally reported fourth quarter COVID-related population deaths in the U.S. Institutional Markets grew premiums and deposits by 74% relative to last year's comparable quarter, primarily due to the significant pension risk transfer sales.\nMoving to other operations. The adjusted pretax loss before consolidation and eliminations was $178 million, a $250 million improvement versus the prior year quarter, with the primary drivers being higher net investment income of $237 million; a lower corporate interest expense on financial debt of $51 million, resulting from our debt redemption activities; partially offset by higher corporate GOE of $12 million, which include increases in performance-based compensation.\nHeading to Peter's comment about AIG 200, $810 million of run rate savings are already executed or contracted towards the $1 billion run rate savings objective, with approximately $540 million recognized to date in our income statement and $645 million of the $1.3 billion cost to achieve having been spent to date.\nShifting to investments. Total cash and investments were $361 billion, and fourth quarter net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.3 billion, which was essentially the same both sequentially and year-over-year and was aided by higher alternative investment income, particularly within private equity. NII for the full year of $12.9 billion was up over $600 million from 2020. Private equity returns were nearly 32% for the full year, up from approximately 10% last year. Hedge funds returned approximately 14% each year, and mortgage loan returns were stable at 4.2%.\nWe ended the year with our primary operating subsidiaries being profitable and well capitalized, with General Insurance's U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the fourth quarter estimated to be between 460% and 470%. And the Life and Retirement (inaudible) is estimated to be between 440% and 450%, both well above the upper bound of our target operating ranges.\nWith respect to share count, our average total diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter were 847 million, a reduction of 2%, as we repurchased approximately 17 million shares in the quarter. The end-of-period outstanding shares for book value per share purposes was approximately 819 million at year-end 2021.\nNow I'd like to address the forthcoming LDTI accounting changes affecting our Life and Retirement business. First, this is a GAAP-only accounting standard, and there should not be impacts to cash flow or statutory results. As this continues to be a work in progress for us and the industry at large, I'd like to provide a range towards the transitional balance impact at January 1, 2021, as being between $1 billion and $3 billion decrease to shareholders' equity, with our current point estimate being towards the lower end of this range. This decrease represents a netting between an increase to retained earnings and a decrease to AOCI. Once again, Life and Retirement's breadth of product offerings provides value as the LDTI impact of old traditional products covered by FAS 60 involving mortality are roughly offset by the elimination of historical AOCI adjustment associated with certain longevity products.\nAlso, current GAAP accounting for living benefits is at fair value, and changes go through the income statement, whereas under LDTI, a portion of that charge will be recorded in AOCI, pertaining to the company's own credit spreads, which, for that piece, will help to dampen some volatility. But mortality benefits will now also be at fair value and will act as an offset to take volatility in the other direction within the GAAP income statement.\nTurning now to the recent S&P capital model changes. The deadline to respond has been extended to March of 2022, and S&P will presumably conclude shortly thereafter. Both the property, casualty and the life retirement insurance industries will likely see higher capital charges for in insurance exposures as well as for asset credit and asset market risks. Additionally, reduced benefits of holding company cash liquidity and lower levels of accessible debt leverage is an indicated outcome, but all with material offsets due to increased diversification benefits. We have spent considerable time on the analysis of this proposal so far, but it is probably premature to make any predictions at this point before S&P in the industry have had more time to land upon the exact details of the final framework.\nNow in conclusion, by virtually all measures, growth, profitability, returns, margin expansion, adjusted book, adjusted tangible book value, debt leverage reduction, EPS, adjusted pre- and after-tax income and net income all point to an outstanding year for AIG. When you also factor in our global platform, our marketplace actions and impact, the strength of our loss reserves, a robust reinsurance program and massive portfolio reconstruction AIG is exceedingly well positioned as we look to the separation of L&R, completing AIG 200, maintaining our path towards increasing profitable growth and for whatever else the future holds.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Peter.\n\nPeter Zaffino;President, CEO, Global COO & Director\n\nGreat. Thank you, Mark. Operator, we're ready for questions.",

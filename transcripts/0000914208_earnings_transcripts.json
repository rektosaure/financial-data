[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Over to Greg Ketron, Invesco's Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nGregory Wade Ketron\n\nSenior VP & MD of IR, Synchrony Financial\n\nAll right. Thanks, Cedric, and to all of you joining us today. In addition to the press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address. The press release and presentation are available on our website, invesco.com. This information can be found by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.\nOur presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slide 2 as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. Finally, Invesco is not responsible for the accuracy of our earnings transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcast are located on our website.\nAndrew Schlossberg, President and CEO; and Allsion Duke, Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning, and then we'll open up the call for questions. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Ryan Schlossberg\n\nChief Executive Officer, Invesco Perpetual and Head of Invesco’s EMEA Region, Invesco Ltd.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Greg, and good morning to everybody. I'm pleased to be speaking with you today. We continue to perform remarkably well against our strategic priorities, which are centered on emphasizing the intersection of market size and secular change while leveraging our unique position to drive growth in the highest opportunities, regions, channels and asset classes.\nWe delivered another strong quarter of broad-based progress, and we continue to generate significant operating leverage while executing on initiatives to unlock value across the organization to deliver for both clients and shareholders. If you turn to Slide 3 of the presentation, which highlights some of our most recent high-impact initiatives over the past several months.\nIn aggregate, these initiatives will help to streamline our business, drive profitability and margin expansion, build a stronger balance sheet and continue to enhance shareholder returns. Significant among these efforts is the strengthening of our capital management through the recapitalization of our balance sheet. Here, we have improved flexibility, enabling us to continue to further deleverage.\nWe have already repaid approximately 25% of the term loans used for the $1 billion preferred stock repurchase announced earlier this year, accelerating the expected earnings accretion from that transaction and paving a path for future redemptions. We have also made substantial progress in our efforts to simplify and hone our organizational focus. Of note is the implementation of our hybrid investment platform which we announced in May, would be shifting to a combined Alpha and Aladdin program.\nProgress continues in our conversion. During the third quarter, we launched the second wave of significant equity AUM onto the Alpha platform. This entire hybrid implementation, which is on track to be complete by the end of 2026 will drive simplification, improved investment system consolidation and future cost avoidance. Also under the banner of simplifying our business and focusing on improving performance, earlier in the quarter, we realigned our fundamental equities, global international and regional investment teams.\nWe have consolidated capabilities under a single CIO for these particular asset classes and made portfolio management changes to our U.S. developing markets and aspects of our international and regional equity strategies. This consolidated global related equity platform mirrors our already established global fixed income structure and as part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen our investment returns in this important area for the firm. The single platform also allowed us to elevate our top investment talent and use our scale advantages to gain efficiencies.\nInvestment performance does take time to turn around, but we are beginning to see progress on this front. Further advancing our efforts to simplify and streamline our focus, we announced in late summer, our decision to sell Intelliflo, which is our cloud-based practice management software subsidiary. This sale will generate net cash of approximately $100 million at closing, which is expected in the fourth quarter, and it could also generate up to $65 million in additional future potential earn-outs.\nFinally, we are accelerating growth through a number of recently announced business development initiatives noted on the bottom of Page 3. I'm pleased to report that we have made significant progress with our Barings private markets partnership, launching our first joint product together earlier this month. The speed at which we have been able to execute is notable. Together, we have come to market with the jointly managed Invesco Dynamic Credit Opportunity Fund within just a few months of our announced partnership.\nThis product strategy is an interval fund targeting the U.S. wealth management market that dynamically allocates across the full spectrum of private corporate credit. By combining our 2 firms complementary strengths, we're accelerating our ability to meet client demand for income-oriented solutions in this rapidly evolving market. This represents the first milestone of the broader private market strategic product and distribution partnership with Barings, which MassMutual will intend to support with a total of $650 million of capital.\nA second co-managed fund is currently in development and is expected to be in market at the beginning of next year. These new strategies will complement our existing private real estate offerings that are targeting U.S. wealth management clients and have seen significant organic traction over the past several quarters. Also in the category of accelerating our growth, we are in the final stages of selling a majority interest in our Indian business to the Hinduja Group and jointly establishing a local joint venture. We believe that the combined benefits of our existing Indian asset management business with Hinduja's domestic financial institution and local expertise will enhance the growth of that business.\nOur ongoing minority ownership structure will allow us to participate in the Indian market development, while also refocusing our resources accordingly. We expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter and Allison will detail the financial implications and anticipated timing of these transactions later in the call. Finally, as you are all well aware, a significant transformative growth initiative is underway as we seek to modernize the structure of our sizable QQQ ETF.\nWe are in the process of soliciting shareholder approval, and we are pleased to report that we have seen strong participation and momentum in the proposals outlined in the proxy and votes casts are overwhelmingly in favor of the proposals. We are getting close to the vote totals needed and to allow for additional time to solicit the votes needed to pass the proposals.\nLast week, we announced that the special meeting of the QQQ shareholders has been adjourned until December 5. Our scheduled time to complete the solicitation process is not an all uncommon. And given the sheer size of this fund and its large retail shareholder base, it is not unexpected. We are proud of the progress on these significant initiatives highlighted on Page 3.\nWe believe they are indicative of the exceptionally hard work of our Invesco colleagues to drive these and other efforts to completion, while continuing to seek incremental opportunities to unlock value. I am grateful for all that has been done and the ongoing disciplined focus on delivering to our clients and our shareholders.\nSo let's pivot now to Slide 4 for our third quarter business highlights. We had strong momentum coming into the quarter, which continued as key market indices reached new highs and increasing investor confidence was bolstered with the Fed rate cut in September. These dynamics are leading to some broadening out of investor demand, which is a welcome shift in the asset management landscape and one that we are beginning to see reflected in our results.\nWe reached a record AUM of $2.1 trillion with exceptionally strong net long-term inflows of nearly $29 billion or an 8% annualized organic growth which is our best flow quarter since 2021. Even more encouraging with the breadth of these flows, reflecting our diversified scaled global platform. We had strong growth on many dimensions, including across most of our strategically important investment capabilities. It also included positive flows in aggregate in both our active and passive products, the retail and institutional channels and across the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions.\nNearly 40% of our long-term AUM is now from clients outside of the U.S. and 2/3 of our net inflows this quarter were from EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. In the quarter, we continued to scale our ETF platform, gaining market share and launching products to meet client demand. When considering the entirety of our ETF and index offerings across all investment capabilities and including the QQQ, we recently reached an important milestone of $1 trillion in AUM.\nThis was among our best-performing quarters for our increasingly profitable ETF and index investment capability with an annualized organic growth of 15%. We garnered record net inflows in a diverse set of products for our U.S. range, including the QQQ M,several ETFs within our S&P Factor suite, the China technology ETF. And in EMEA, we generated strong flows in our use of QQQ ETF and our synthetic product suite.\nWe continue to innovate and evolve our ETF lineup to offer investors new ways to access our in-house, high-quality active strategies. Notably, 65% of our ETF launches this year have been active. Our 5 new active ETFs launched during the third quarter brings our total to 36 months. The development is not only a U.S. trend. We now have 10 active UCIT ETFs, extending our smart beta range of products in the EMEA region.\nOur ending active ETF AUM firm-wide stands at $16 billion. However, when including our active teams engaged in our passive and index capabilities, it elevates that total AUM to nearly $30 billion. Bringing the depth of our investment capabilities into the ETF wrapper has long been part of our overall strategy and will continue to be as we innovate to meet client demand.\nShifting to fundamental fixed income where we garnered over $4 billion in net long-term inflows in the third quarter. However, this only considers what's included in our fundamental fixed income capability. Looking more broadly at the fixed income asset class across all of our investment products, the third quarter net long-term flow number jumps to nearly $13 billion with the inclusion of our fixed income ETFs and China JV-based fixed income assets.\nHere again, the strength of our geographic profile is evident with more than half of our overall fixed income inflows coming from clients outside the United States. Though overall recent client demand trends remained largely intact this quarter in fixed income, we did begin to see a measured extension from ultrashort and short-term fixed income to the intermediate and longer end of the curve. We saw institutional interest for investment-grade bonds with strong demand in Asia, driving net inflows.\nFurther, we saw demand for our leading United States defined contribution focused, stable value capability, and we are exiting the quarter with a healthy pipeline for this product. Additionally, our U.S. Wealth Management SMA platform continued to help drive fixed income flows, particularly in municipal bond strategies. Our entire SMA platform which also includes a portion of equity assets continued to capture market share, and it now stands at nearly $34 billion in AUM.\nWe have one of the fastest-growing SMA offerings in the U.S. wealth management market with an annualized organic growth rate of 19%. Moving to our China JV and Indian capabilities where we produced exceptionally strong results this quarter. Our broad product suite and scale position in China is empowering us to perform as well as dynamic shift in this market. We reached a record high AUM in our China JV of $122 billion, reflecting a 16% increase over last quarter. We delivered a robust $8.1 billion of net long-term inflows in these capabilities, marking one of our best quarters to date, $7.3 billion of that total came from our China JV which represents a 34% annualized organic growth rate.\nFlows during the quarter in our China JV were led by Fixed Income Plus and our ETF funds. Institutional investors are favoring fixed income plus strategies as they provide an effective means of enhancing equity exposure. We are also beginning to see interest in pure equity strategies, particularly in passive funds, as demand for active equity is slower to regenerate. We are exceedingly well positioned for the near and longer-term trends developing in the onshore China market.\nWe continue to innovate to meet client demand across both active and passive capabilities. Of note, we launched 12 new products this quarter in our China JV, including our first fixed income ETF. We believe that in time, demand for fixed income products will shift towards those offered in the ETF wrapper. We also launched equity index funds to capture increasing demand for these growth-oriented products.\nWhile we continue to launch innovative products to meet current and future client demand in our China JV, existing products have been the more significant driver of our organic growth, an indication of the strength of our platform. We expect our China JV to continue to benefit as both the secular and now cyclical tailwinds develop in the world's second biggest economy.\nShifting to private markets where we posted $600 million of net inflows driven by private credit and direct real estate. Private credit had nearly $1 billion of net inflows with strong CLO demand during the quarter in both the U.S. and EMEA as these products continue to offer meaningful value versus corporate bonds. We launched 3 new CLOs during the quarter, 2 in Europe and 1 in the United States.\nDirect real estate contributed nearly $100 million of net inflows. INCREF, which is our real estate debt strategy targeting the U.S. wealth management channel continues to generate net inflows, and we continue to onboard platforms and clients. INCREF is now on 3 of the 4 major U.S. wealth management platforms. Assets in this fund with leverage now total over $4 billion after just 2 years in the market.\nOur real estate team also remains well positioned -- the institutional markets, with $7 billion of dry powder to capitalize on emerging opportunities. And as I outlined earlier, EMEA and Asia Pacific, specifically for global and regional equities and headlined by our Global Equity Income Fund managed out of the United Kingdom. This fund posted record net inflows of $3.8 billion during the quarter predominantly from clients in the Japanese market, where it ranked first among retail active funds and has rapidly grown to $20 billion in AUM and has a very favorable net revenue yield to the firm.\nThis is a compelling representation of our ability to have the right products in the right markets at the right time. Despite these positive flow highlights, we did record overall net outflows in fundamental equities of $5 billion in the quarter. Our results partially reflect the broader secular outflow trend in actively managed equities, particularly in the United States. This was compounded by the expected acceleration of net outflows from our developing markets fund, which totaled $4.5 billion for the quarter.\nGiven our strategic decision to reposition the fund to a new internal portfolio management team, this wasn't wholly unexpected. We are confident that the aforementioned fundamental equity platform changes that have been recently implemented sharpen our focus on investment performance and risk management as we continue to identify areas of demand within fundamental equities and mitigate redemptions at a better rate than the market.\nMoving on to Slide 5, which shows our overall investment performance relative to benchmark and peers as well as our performance in key capabilities where information is readily comparable and more meaningful to driving results. Investment performance is key to winning and maintaining market share despite overall market demand. As such, achieving first quartile investment performance remains a top priority for Invesco. Overall, more than half of our funds are performing in the top quartile of peers on a 3-year time horizon with 45% reaching that bar on a 5-year basis. Further, nearly 70% of our AUM is meeting its respective benchmarks over those measurement periods.\nOf note, we saw significant improvements in some of our fundamental equity performance with more than half of our funds beating benchmark on a 3-year basis and 39% in the top quartile on a 5-year basis. Continuing to strengthen our investment performance is key to reducing redemption rates in these critically important equity strategies. Fixed Income continues to have strong performance with nearly half of our funds performing in the top quartile on a 3-year basis and nearly 2/3 beating their benchmarks.\nSo with that, let me turn the call over now to Allison to discuss the quarter's financial results, and I look forward to your questions.\n\nLaura Allison Dukes\n\nSenior MD & CFO, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the third quarter financial results on Slide 6. Strong markets and net asset inflows drove assets under management to a record level for Invesco in the third quarter. Total AUM exceeded $2.1 trillion at quarter end. This was $123 billion or 6% higher than at the end of the second quarter and $329 million or 18% higher than the end of the third quarter of 2024.\nAverage long-term assets under management were $1.46 trillion, an increase of 9% over last quarter and 16% over the same quarter last year. Growth in total assets under management during the quarter was driven by market gains of $99 billion and net long-term inflows of $29 billion.\nNet revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin all significantly improved from last quarter and the third quarter of 2024, while adjusted operating expenses continued to be well managed. This drove meaningful operating -- this drove meaningful positive operating leverage on both a sequential quarter and a year-over-year basis.\nOn a sequential quarter basis, positive operating leverage was 480 basis points delivering a 300 basis point improvement in the third quarter operating margin to 34.2%. On a year-over-year basis, positive operating leverage was 410 basis points delivering a 260 basis point improvement in operating margin. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.61 for the third quarter. We continue to strengthen the balance sheet during the quarter through the repayment of $260 million of the 3-year bank term loan.\nWe also ended the quarter with no draws on our revolving credit facility. Given the level of operating cash generation going into the fourth quarter, we are in a position to repay the remaining $240 million of the 3-year term loan by the end of this month. When we announced the repurchase of $1 billion of preferred stock in April funded with $1 billion in term loans, we indicated that once the loans will repay, the EPS run rate benefit would reach $0.13 annually.\nGiven that we will have repaid $500 million, up to $1 billion in term loans earlier than projected, we will have captured approximately 60% of that EPS run rate benefit on a go-forward basis. The magnitude of the potential reduction in the remaining $500 million term loan that matures in 2030 will depend on the level of cash flow we generate going forward. Additionally, we have a $500 million senior note that we intend to redeem when it matures this coming January of 2026.\nFinally, we continued common share repurchases, buying back $25 million or 1.2 million shares during the quarter. Moving to Slide 7, a slide most of you are familiar with by now is we've been including this update for a number of quarters, and hopefully, you have found this helpful in analyzing our net revenue and net revenue yield dynamics. Client demand continues to drive diversification of our portfolio.\nAnd as a result, concentration risk and higher fee fundamental equities and multi-asset products has been reduced while our portfolio reflects a higher mix of ETFs, index and fundamental fixed income capabilities. Our more balanced AUM profile better positions the firm to navigate various market cycles, events and shifting client demand. The ranges by capability are representative of where the net revenue yield has trended over the past 5 quarters, and we know where in the range yields have trended more recently.\nTo provide context for the net revenue yield trends during the third quarter, our overall net revenue yield was 22.9 basis points. This is similar to the sequential quarter decline that we experienced in the second quarter. The magnitude of the last 2 quarterly declines is notably lower than prior quarters. And maybe aside, we're closer to reaching a degree of stabilization in the net revenue yield, but this will be dependent on the future direction of asset mix shift. The exit net revenue yield at the end of the third quarter was 22.8 basis points near the adjusted net revenue yield for the quarter.\nAs Andrew noted earlier, last week, we announced a special meeting of QQQ shareholders have been adjourned until December 5 to allow for additional time to solicit votes. We did want to note that under the new structure, the revised fee allocation would work similar to how we currently recognize fees on most of our ETFs. The 18 basis point fee will be recognized as investment management fees, approximately 12 basis points, which is principally for the licensing fee and administrative custody and transfer agency services will be recognized as third-party distribution, service and advisory expense.\nUnder the current structure, marketing expenses associated with the QQQ are included a third-party expense. Upon finalization and filing of the definitive proxy statement, reflecting comments from the SEC and further accounting review, it would determine that the marketing expenses associated with the QQQ should be included in the marketing expense line item versus third-party expense.\nThis is solely a reclassification of where the marketing expenses are reported and the expected overall net impact to adjusted operating income of approximately 4 basis points of QQQ AUM and is unchanged from what we previously disclosed.\nNow turning to Slide 8. Net revenue of $1.2 billion in the third quarter was $82 million higher as compared to the same quarter last year. The increase in net revenue was largely from investment management fees, which were $102 million higher than last year and mainly driven by higher average AUM. Operating expenses continue to be well managed with the increase of $24 million, partially driven by variable employee compensation related to higher revenue.\nOn a sequential quarter basis, the increases in net revenue and operating expenses were driven by similar dynamics as the year-over-year changes. And that result is a substantial increase in positive operating leverage on both the year-over-year and sequential quarter basis. The Alpha hybrid platform implementation costs of $11 million were below our expectations for the third quarter, but near the range of prior quarters.\nWe launched the second wave of equity AUM onto the Alpha platform during the third quarter. We will continue to implement the hybrid approach we announced earlier this year. We expect the overall implementation to be completed by the end of 2026. Regarding implementation costs going forward, we expect onetime implementation costs to continue in the $10 million to $15 million range for the fourth quarter as we transition more AUM onto the platform.\nThis amount in future quarters may fluctuate to a degree due to timing as we work towards completion by the end of 2026. We'll provide further updates as the implementation progresses throughout next year. As disclosed in August, we reached an agreement with Carlyle to sell Intelliflo, our cloud-based practice management software subsidiary.\nWe moved Intelliflo to held for sale in the third quarter and the noncash impairment charge of $36 million was recorded in other gains and losses, somewhat lower than the $40 million to $45 million that we had indicated previously. We expect to close this transaction in the fourth quarter and then the annual net operating impact of Intelliflo is insignificant to the overall Invesco operating results.\nGiven Intelliflo is the U.K. subsidiary, the loss is not a taxable event. As such, we anticipated the effective non-GAAP tax rate for the third quarter to be closer to 29%. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.2% as we were subsequently notified late in the quarter of a favorable resolution of a certain tax matter, including the reversal of a reserve for uncertain tax positions which had a significant impact on our third quarter non-GAAP effective tax rate.\nFor the fourth quarter, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate will move back to the 25% to 26% range, excluding any discrete items. The actual effective rate can vary due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items. Andrew also noted that the sale of a majority interest in our India asset management business is expected to occur in the fourth quarter, potentially at the end of October.\nPost closing, given we will retain a minority interest India's AUM, which is near $15 billion and future asset flows will not be reported in our results. In addition, India's operating results will no longer be reported as part of Invesco's overall operating results including the associated revenues and expenses.\nOur 40% share of the joint venture's net income will be reported in equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates going forward. We currently expect $140 million to $150 million in cash proceeds from the sale. I'll wrap up on Slide 9. As I noted earlier, we continue to make considerable progress on building balance sheet strength.\nDuring the third quarter, we repaid $260 million of the $1 billion in bank term loans used to fund the $1 billion repurchase of preferred stock held by MassMutual earlier this year. The $260 million repayment reduced the 3-year term left to $240 million. And as I noted earlier, we're in a position to repay the remaining balance by the end of this month, leaving only $500 million in the 5-year maturity term loan.\nThe full impact of the $14.8 million reduction in the preferred dividend was realized in the third quarter and the go-forward run rate preferred dividend is $44.4 million per quarter. The $14.8 million reduction is now earnings available to common shareholders. We also continued common share repurchases and the third quarter buying back $25 million or 1.2 million shares during the quarter.\nWe intend to continue a regular common share repurchase program going forward and expect our total payout ratio, including common dividends and share buybacks to be near 60% this year as well as in 2026 as we continually evaluate our capital return levels. The partial repayment of the bank term loan improved our leverage ratios for the quarter with the leverage ratio, excluding and including the preferred stock, improving to 0.63x and 2.5x, respectively.\nGoing forward, we expect this ratio to continue to improve as we repay the term loan and redeem the $500 million senior note maturing in January. To conclude, the strength of our net flow performance and diversity of our business is evident again this quarter, driving strong revenue growth. This, combined with well-managed expenses resulted in significant operating leverage and a sizable improvement in our operating margin.\nWe're pleased with our progress on building a stronger balance sheet. And we are committed to driving profitable growth, a high level of financial performance and enhancing the return of capital to shareholders. With that, operator to open up the line for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] This call will last 1 hour to allow more participants to ask questions. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Invesco's Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nGregory Wade Ketron\n\nSenior VP & MD of IR, Synchrony Financial\n\nAll right. Thanks, Andrew, and to all of you joining us today. In addition to the press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address on the call. The press release and presentation are available on our website, invesco.com.\nThis information can be found by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slide 2 as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. Finally, Invesco is not responsible for the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties, daily authorized webcast are located on our website.\nAndrew Schlossberg, President and CEO; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning, and then we'll open up the call for questions. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew. Thanks, Greg, and good morning to everybody. I'm pleased to be speaking with you today. I'll start as I have for the last several quarters on Slide 3, which covers our strategic initiatives and our performance drivers as it is an important framing for the second quarter and for highlighting significant recent accomplishments.\nWe remain focused on generating positive client outcomes, executing against our strategic priorities and making meaningful progress in our efforts to improve operating leverage while strengthening our balance sheet. I'm appreciative of the hard work of my colleagues around the world as we continue to look across the organization to unlock value.\nBefore we review the quarterly results, I'd like to take a moment to highlight to you significant examples of this progress over the past several months. First, I'd point to our partnership with MassMutual and Bearings. During the quarter, we completed the repurchase of $1 billion of cured stock held by MassMutual, a significant step in reducing our preferred position and ultimately further strengthening our balance sheet flexibility.\nWe also announced in June MassMutual's intention to invest $150 million into the Invesco Dynamic Credit Opportunity Fund. This is the first example of our intention to pay the private credit strength of Invesco in bank loans, CLOs and distressed and lower middle market direct lending with bearings asset-backed finance, higher market direct lending and capital solutions capabilities.\nThis also presents the first tranche of the broader prime market strategic product and distribution partnership with Barings that focuses on the U.S. wealth channel, and which MassMutual will intend to support with a total of $650 million of capital.\nWe are very pleased with the pace at which the teams are working to [indiscernible] following our partnership announcement just a few months back in April. As the private credit market continues to grow and diversify, we are committed to leveraging the existing strength of our $130 billion private markets platform evolving our wealth management product offering to better meet client needs and partnering with complementary private market managers.\nThere will be more to come on our expanded relationship with Barings and we will continue to keep you updated. Also, during the second quarter, we announced a realignment with our Fundamental Equity's platform and made changes to our developing markets and global and international investment teams to better serve our clients' interests. This included consolidating capabilities under a single CIO for these particular asset classes and making portfolio management changes to our U.S.-based developing markets and aspects of our international and regional fundamental equity strategies.\nThis is part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen our investment returns in this important area of the firm to also elevate our top talent and to use our scale advantages to gain efficiencies. An additional milestone occurred last week when we announced the filing of a preliminary proxy statement with the intent of seeking the approval of QQQ beneficial owners to change the operational structure of the Qs so that its classification changes from a unit investment trust to an open-end fund ETS, the latter being how the vast majority of ETFs, including others offered by Invesco Operate.\nAs you can imagine, given that this is still subject to approval, there is little we can say about this at this time other than directing you to the as-filed preliminary proxy statement. That said, Allison will walk you through some of the potential impacts of the proposed changes later in her remarks. As mentioned, these and other examples demonstrate our determination to unlock value across the organization for the benefits of clients and shareholders, including looking at how we fundamentally operate leaving no stone unturned or opportunity unexamined as we seek to improve client outcomes and our employee value proposition, generate operating leverage and profitability and continue building a strong balance sheet and enhance our ability to return capital to shareholders.\nLet's pivot now to Slide 4 to talk about our second quarter business highlights. As we all experienced, the second quarter market volatility was pronounced. After a challenging start to the quarter, markets ended the period with strong momentum that has carried forward into July as the volatile start to the second quarter ultimately gave way to a global rebound for equities, while bond markets began to steady later in the quarter.\nAgainst this backdrop, once again, our diversified platform, global scale and breath of products were integral to sustaining long-term organic flow growth and resilience during the period. For the quarter, we generated $15.6 billion in net long-term asset inflows or a 4.7% annualized growth rate, and we hit a record of $2 trillion in assets under management at the end of the period. We also built on the momentum of our first quarter financial results. We continue to deliver profitable growth with adjusted operating income up 3% and operating margins expanding 30 basis points in the second quarter when compared to the same quarter last year.\nAs Alison will discuss later, we've also continued to strengthen our balance sheet while returning capital to shareholders at the top end of our projected range. From a client sentiment, asset class and geographic perspective, we continue to see a diverse range of flows with positive results in both active and passive institutional and retail and broad geographic strength, particularly within Asia Pacific and EMEA, which collectively accounts for 40% of our overall long-term client assets under management and generated $31 billion in our first half 2025 long-term net flows.\nFrom a more specific perspective, our global ETFs and index platform continued to produce strong results recording 10% annualized organic growth or $12.6 billion of long-term net inflows in the quarter. ETF growth in the U.S. market was augmented by another solid quarter in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Top net flowing products in the U.S. were led by Q2 QM with record inflows of $5.6 billion. The fund has now passed $50 billion in AUM after starting the year at $38 billion. Additionally, our factor suite drove significant net flows as precision investments became a more critical buying decision with our momentum and quality ETFs generating $4 billion of net inflows.\nWe also continue to innovate in the ETF space during the quarter. We launched 4 new active ETFs in addition to the 3 launch last quarter, bringing our total to 31 active ETFs including expanding our active use of ETFs to a total of 8 products, while we also extended our Smart beta range of products in the EMEA region as well.\nShifting to fundamental fixed income. Overall, we garnered nearly $3 billion of net long-term inflows were strictly looking at our fundamental fixed income platform, but looking more broadly at the asset class across all of our capabilities, that number jumps to nearly $10 billion of inflows with the inclusion of our fixed income ETFs and our China-based assets. Fixed income is another area where you can see the strength of our geographic profile within EMEA and Asia Pacific driving significant flows in this asset class during the quarter.\nThere was obvious caution around fixed income risk taking as the quarter commenced, and this translated into some softening of U.S. demand, particularly for municipal bonds. However, institutional interest for investment-grade bonds continued with demand in EMEA driving our net inflows. We also saw the remaining $4 billion of the Peoples pension fixed income mandate in the United Kingdom Fund during the quarter. This is an important win as we continue to build Invesco's leadership in the retirement market in the U.K. and globally. Additionally, our wealth management SMA platform in the U.S. continued to help drive fixed income flows. Our entire SMA platform, which also includes a portion of equity assets continued to capture market share and now stands at nearly $32 billion in AUM.\nWe have one of the fastest-growing SMA offerings in the U.S. wealth management market with an annualized organic growth rate of 15%. Shifting to private markets. Overall, our private real estate franchise recorded net inflows of just over $200 million, driven by continued strong inflows into in craft which is our real estate debt strategy targeting the wealth management channel, which saw its largest fundraising to date in June and where we continue to onboard new platforms and clients.\nAssets in this fund with leverage now totaled $3.5 billion in AUM after just 2 years in market. Our performance in direct real estate was somewhat clouded by the planned wind-down of the St. James Place U.K. real estate portfolios. We were appointed earlier this year to take over management and wind down of these portfolios, which totaled $1.8 billion.\nSt. James Place is a key U.K. client, both in real estate and beyond and being selected for this mandate affirms our wider service and relationship with SJP. The associated outflow totaled $400 million this quarter. Overall, our real estate team remains well positioned in the institutional markets with $7 billion of dry powder to capitalize on emerging opportunities. Within our private credit franchise, we were in negative flows in the quarter, but this was driven exclusively by April risk off sentiment in our market-leading bank loan ETFs and funds.\nHowever, as the quarter progressed and investor sentiment improved, so did net inflows in these products, which totaled $1 billion in aggregate from May and June and offset some of April's losses. Additionally, we saw good demand for CLOs. We closed a $500 million CLO at the end of June, and the pipeline remains strong going into the back half of the year. Moving to our China JV and India capability where we saw further strengthening this quarter.\nWe delivered $5.6 billion of net long-term inflows, led by fixed income and strong here bond and flows from Invesco great wall. Later in the quarter, these per bond inflows were augmented with additional inflows into fixed income plus, which is a more balanced strategy as risk appetite improved amid lower interest rates and an improving equity market. We reached a record high period ending AUM in our China JV of $105 billion, surpassing the previous record of $102 billion set over 3 years ago.\nAnd while we launched 5 new products this quarter at Invesco great Wall, our organic growth in this market continue to be driven by existing products which is a good sign for the strength of the platform we have built. We are well positioned for the near- and long-term emerging trends in this market, and we should benefit from both the secular and now cyclical tailwinds developing.\nTurning to our multi-asset related capabilities. We saw net long-term inflows of $0.5 billion, driven by quantitative strategies. Finally, the relative pressure on fundamental equities was maintained as the secular shifting demand challenges to active equities continue, particularly among U.S. clients. Our results reflect that change albeit at a better rate than recent history with overall net outflows of $3.6 billion for the quarter.\nDespite this, we have continued to see positive flows for fundamental equities coming from our clients in EMEA and Asia Pacific, specifically for global and regional equities, headlined by our Global Equity Income Fund, which is managed out of the U.K. This fund posted record net inflows of $2.4 billion during the quarter, rapidly growing the fund of $17 billion in AUM, predominantly from clients in the Japanese market. Among retail active funds, this is the #1 ranked product in Japan on a flow basis and has a very favorable net revenue yield to Invesco.\nOffsetting this are continued fundamental equity outflows in the U.S. wealth management channel, particularly from our emerging markets fund. The aforementioned fundamental equity platform changes this past quarter, further, our focus on investment performance and risk management as we continue to identify areas of demand within fundamental equities and mitigate redemptions and are better than the market.\nMoving to Slide 5, which highlights the diversity of our business that I was referencing earlier, our geographic profile with $600 billion of our client assets coming from markets outside of America is a key Invesco differentiator and empowers organic growth in various operating environments like we are seeing today. Furthermore, our broad range of public and private market portfolios and our active, passive and multi-asset range of capabilities provides the opportunity to capture reallocations occurring in client portfolios.\nThe bottom line is that our diverse profile provides a more resilient asset flow, revenue and profit growth profile. Moving on to Slide 6, which shows our overall investment performance relative to benchmarks and the peers as well as our performance in key capabilities where information is readily comparable and more meaningful to driving results.\nInvestment performance is a key to winning and maintaining market share despite overall market demand, achieving first quartile investment performance remains a top priority for us. Overall, half of our funds are performing in that top quartile peers over a 3-year time horizon with 46% reaching that bar on a 5-year basis.\nOf note, we saw significant improvement in some of our fundamental equity performance, which is reflected in our 1-year peer ranking. Further, over 2/3 of our AUM is beating its respective benchmarks over those measurement time periods. So with that, let me take a pause here and turn the call over to Alison to discuss this quarter's financial results. and I look forward to taking your questions.\n\nLaura Allison Dukes\n\nSenior MD & CFO, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the second quarter financial results on Slide 7. After a challenging start to the second quarter in April, we experienced strong growth in assets under management during the remainder of the quarter. We ended the second quarter at a record level for total AUM, slightly over $2 trillion. .\nThis was $157 million or 8% higher than the end of the first quarter and $286 million or 17% higher than the end of the second quarter of 2024. Average long-term assets under management were $1.34 trillion, an increase of 1% over last quarter and 12% over the second quarter of last year. The increase of only 1% in average AUM was driven by market weakness early in the quarter with AUM growth rebounding in May and June.\nGrowth in total assets under management during the quarter was mainly driven by market gains of $126 billion, of which $52 million was driven by the QQQ. ETF and index market gains were $41 billion and fundamental equity market gains were $26 billion. Net long-term inflows drove a $16 billion increase in AUM during the quarter, representing an annualized organic growth rate of nearly 5% for the quarter.\nAs Andrew noted, net inflows in our ETF capability for $13 billion. China JV in India added $6 billion of net inflows and fundamental fixed income contributed $3 billion of debt in post. Net outflows of $4 billion in fundamental equities and $2 billion in private markets partially offset the net inflows. Net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin all improved from the second quarter of 2024 while operating expenses continued to be well controlled.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.36 for the second quarter. We continue to strengthen the balance sheet during the second quarter, repurchasing the $1 billion of preferred stock held by Mass Mutual and funding the repurchase with $1 billion in bank term loans. We ended the quarter with no draws on our revolving credit facility. We also continued commentary repurchases in the second quarter buying back $25 million.\nGiven our cash position as we begin the third quarter, we believe we may be in a position to begin repaying a portion of the term loan during the second half of the year. The magnitude of the potential reduction in the term loans will depend on the level of cash flow we generate for the remainder of this year. We also intend to continue purchasing common shares at a similar level on a regular basis going forward.\nComparing the first 2 quarters of 2025 versus 2024 demonstrates the strong performance we have achieved year-to-date despite the market volatility in the first half of this year. Our annualized organic growth was 5% with average AUM growing 15% and average long-term AUM growing 13%. Over this period compared to the same period last year, net revenues increased 3.5% and expenses increased less than 1%, driving positive operating leverage of 270 basis points and operating margin improvement of 190 basis points.\nMoving to Slide 8. The secular shift in client demand continued to impact our asset mix and net revenue yields and our broad set of capabilities has allowed us to capture evolving client product reference systems. Client demand continues to drive diversification of our portfolio, a trend we've seen for a number of years now.\nAs a result, concentration risk and higher fee fundamental equities and multi-asset products has been reduced. And our asset mix has a higher concentration of ETFs, index and fundamental fixed income capabilities. The more balanced AUM profile better positions the firm to navigate various market cycles, events and shifting by demand.\nConsistent with prior quarter, current net revenue yield trends are included on the slide. The ranges by capability are representative of where the net revenue yield has trended over the past 5 quarters. We know in the bullets what the net revenue yield drivers are and where in the range yields have trended more recently.\nTo provide context for the net revenue yield trend during the second quarter, our overall net revenue yield was 23.2 basis points. This is a smaller decline than prior quarters. and may be a sign that we're closer to reaching stabilization for an inflection point in the net revenue yield, but this will be dependent on the future direction of asset mix shift.\nThe exit net revenue yield at the end of the second quarter was 23.2 basis points, in line with the adjusted net revenue yield for the quarter. As Andrew noted earlier, our subsidiary, Invesco Capital Management, LLC, announced the filing of a preliminary proxy statement with the intent of seeking approval of QQQ beneficial owners to change the operational structure of the QQQ so that its classification under the 1940 Act, changes from a unit investment trust to an open-end fund ETF.\nAs you know, given that it is preliminary and the SEC will first need to approve this and then the shareholders also need to improve it, there is not much I can share other than to direct you to the proxy itself, which has all of the material information about what is being proposed. The boat will happen at the earliest in the first -- fourth quarter.\nAnd if approval occurs, the changes likely will be implemented shortly thereafter. That said, we will say a few things that we think will be helpful for you all to provide context on what is being proposed and how it may differ from the current treatment of the QQQ. Currently, the QQQ fee structure is allocated as follows: of the 20 basis, 8 point fee basis for the licensing fee, 8 basis points is for marketing expenses and 4 basis points of the trustee fee.\nThe current benefit to Invesco is marketing as the expenses to market the Invesco QQQ are reimbursed through the 8 basis point marketing fee. On Invesco's adjusted operating income statement, the marketing expenses are recognized in third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, and the reimbursement is recognized as service and distribution fees.\nSo there is virtually no impact to net revenue or adjusted operating income. If the new structure is approved, the revised fee allocation would work similar to how we currently recognize speed on most of our ETFs. The 8 basis point fee would be recognized as investment management fees, approximately 14 basis points, which is principally the 8 basis points for the licensing fee, 3.5 basis points for administrative, custody and transfer agency services as well as marketing, which will be at our discretion, but at intended amounts and ranges that we have put in the proxy.\nAnd most other expenses of the fund would be recognized as third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, for licensing, custodian and other extensive. As a result and while we can't be precise, net revenues and adjusted operating income would benefit by approximately 4 basis points.\nNow turning to Slide 9, net revenue of $1.1 billion in the second quarter was $19 million higher versus the same quarter last year. Investment management fees were $35 million higher than last year, with the increase driven by higher average AUM and FX impact, partially offset by the AUM mix shift previously noted.\nPerformance fees were $14 million lower than last year due to a smaller number of funds generating performance fees this year. Operating expenses continue to be well managed with total adjusted operating expenses only $10 million higher or 1% from the second quarter of last year, driven by the impact of FX on our expense base.\nAdjusting for the impact of FX, operating expenses were flat year-over-year. Sequential quarter adjusted operating expenses were also impacted by FX, the impact increased operating expenses by $14 million on a sequential basis. And excluding this, operating expenses declined by $14 million. Regarding the overall foreign exchange impact on our operating income, it is negligible as the FX impact on net revenue is mostly offset by its impact on operating expenses.\nAlpha platform implementation costs of $12 million were in line with our expectations for the second quarter and consistent with the $13 million incurred in the first quarter. We announced in May that Invesco has decided to adopt a hybrid solution by utilizing platforms from both State Street for equities and BlackRock who we currently use for fixed income. The hybrid approach allows to leverage the strength of each platform optimizing outcomes for our clients and enhancing our operational capabilities.\nThe hybrid approach provides for more certainty of execution while maintaining the same benefits of the single provider approach, leveraging the best-of-breed platforms for both equities and fixed income. With this high approach, we expect to be complete with the implementation by the end of 2026.\nRegarding implementation costs going forward, we expect onetime implementation cost to be in the $15 million to $20 million range for the third quarter as we expect a higher level of implementation activity related to preparing to transition more AUM onto the platform. We then expect implementation costs to return to the $10 million to $15 million range for the fourth quarter of 2025. This may fluctuate to a degree due to timing and as AUM has moved onto the platform as we work towards completion by the end of 2026. We'll provide further updates as the implementation progresses.\nSecond quarter over year positive operating leverage was 40 basis points, driving a $9 million or nearly a 3% increase in operating income and a 30 basis point improvement in our operating margin to 31.2%. The effective tax rate was 26.5% in the second quarter versus 24.4% in the first quarter with the increase primarily due to discrete tax items and a change in the mix income across tax jurisdictions.\nWe estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate will be closer to 26% for the third quarter of '25 excluding any discrete items. Increase in the rate is driven by a shift of income across tax jurisdictions. The actual effect of rates can vary due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items.\nI'll wrap up on Slide 10. As I noted earlier, we continue to make significant progress on building balance sheet strength. The $1 billion repurchase of preferred stock held by MassMutual funded by 3 and 5 bank term loans was completed on May 16. The full impact of the reduction in the preferred dividend will be realized in the third quarter and the go-forward run we will be $44.4 million per quarter, a reduction of $14.8 million per quarter that becomes earnings available to common shareholders. We ended the quarter with no draws on our revolving credit facility.\nRegarding the revolving credit facilities, we renewed and extended the facility in May, concurrent with the bank term loan funding, we increased our borrowing capacity through the revolver from $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the next 5 years.\nAs I noted earlier, given our cash position as we begin the third quarter, we believe we may be in a position to begin repaying a portion of the term lines during the second half of this year. The magnitude of the potential reduction of the term loans will depend on the level of cash flow that we generate for the remainder of this year. We also continued common share repurchases in the second quarter, buying back $25 million or 1.7 million shares during this. We intend to continue a regular common share repurchase program going forward, and we expect our total payout ratio, including dividends and share buybacks to be near 60% from 2025 as we continually evaluate our capital return level.\nGiven the repurchase of the preferred stock funded with the term loan, we will see some divergence in our leverage ratios, depending on whether the preferred stock is included or not. Excluding the preferred stock, the leverage ratio increased to a still very difficult level of 0.83x, and for $1 billion in term loans are now included in the ratio. Going forward, we expect this ratio to improve as we repay the loan. The leverage ratio, including the preferred stock continued to show improvemnt, declining to 2.7x from 3.0x a year ago. The ratio was not as impacted the transaction as we simply replaced the repurchase preferred stock with term loans, giving us the flexibility to substantially improve this ratio going forward as we repay the loan.\nTo conclude, the resiliency and strength of our firm's net flow performance is evident again this quarter, and we continue to make significant progress on building a stronger balance sheet, enhanced further by the $1 billion reaches of the preferred stock. We remain committed to driving profitable growth, a high level of financial performance and enhancing the return of capital to shareholders. And with that, we'll end up and align Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Invesco's Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nGregory Wade Ketron\n\nSenior VP & MD of IR, Synchrony Financial\n\nOkay. Thanks, Cedric, and to all of you joining us on the Invesco's quarterly earnings call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address. The press release and presentation are available on our website, invesco.com. This information can be found by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.\nOur presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slide 2 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures, as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. Finally, Invesco is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website.\nAndrew Schlossberg, President and CEO; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning. Then we'll open up the call for questions. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Ryan Schlossberg\n\nChief Executive Officer, Invesco Perpetual and Head of Invesco’s EMEA Region, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to be speaking with you today. Not only about our Q1 results, but also the significant developments that we announced in our ongoing relationship with MassMutual, which we are very excited about. Allison and I will walk through the details of this new strategic product and distribution partnership and the $1 billion repurchase of preferred stock a little later in the call.\nIn recent quarters, I've been commencing our earnings calls with a recap of our strategic focuses and advantageous market position, as seen on Slide 3 of your presentation. During this period of uncertainty in capital markets and economies around the world, I cannot think of a more pertinent time to heighten our position and our steadfast focus. Our strategic priorities were conceived with conviction that regardless of near-term market volatility, cyclical, structural or fundamental developments, our focus would leverage the best of Invesco, ignite our growth engines and deliver durable results. The hallmarks of the global Invesco platform places us in a position of strength to navigate the current operating environment. Our geographic diversity and local presence is a differentiator across the Americas, EMEA and our [ skin ] and unique Asia Pacific profile.\nFurthermore, our broad range of public and private market portfolios and active and passive multi-asset range of capabilities provides the opportunity for us to stay closely connected to clients and capture expected reallocations in their portfolios. Furthermore, our diverse profile provides a more resilient asset flow revenue and profit growth profile. Our strategic clarity has helped us drive organic growth through various operating environments and continued to prove effective in the first quarter.\nWe generated $17.6 billion in long-term net asset inflows, or a 5.3% annualized growth rate. And we've delivered strong profitable growth, with adjusted operating income up 18% and operating margins expanding over 330 basis points when compared to the same quarter last year. Furthermore, against the backdrop of a turbulent start of the second quarter, our diversified platform provided some resilience in our asset flows and an ability to use our global scale for the benefits of our clients and our shareholders.\nTurning to Slide 4. I'll cover our first quarter flow performance by investment capability and provide some additional context in which to think about the new uncertain operating environment that we've now entered. Before I begin, though, I want to point out a change we have made to the reporting of our investment capabilities to isolate the performance of our China JV and India business. It's important to note that this line item now only represents products managed through our China JV and India business. The approximately $10 billion in other assets that were previously in the Asia Pacific managed capability but not managed directly through the JV or India are now allocated to the representative investment capabilities, with the majority being allocated to Fundamental Equities. We made this reporting change to better reflect how we view our business and the unique dynamics in the Asia Pacific region, where we are increasingly able to bring more international products managed outside of the region to our clients in these local markets.\nA good example of this is our Global Equity Income Fund managed out of the U.K., which has rapidly grown to $14 billion of assets under management, predominantly from clients in the Japanese market. We've provided an 8-quarter look back in the Appendix of today's presentation to help you align to this adjustment.\nCurrently, we'll continue to report our assets and flows sourced from clients and in each region, which you can see on Page 5 of the presentation. The Asia Pacific and EMEA regions account for $276 billion each in assets under management, representing nearly 1/3 of the overall company. And between them, they generated $15 billion in net long-term inflows in quarter 1, a positive trend we have seen in the past several quarters. This further highlights the importance of our local profile in key markets around the world.\nShifting to our recent business results. The year started with a risk on client sentiment, which shifted to a more cautious stance at the end of the quarter, continuing through April. By illustration, money markets for the industry recently topped $7 trillion, a record level for the asset class. Thus far in April, we've seen investors largely stay invested, but they remain more muted with new capital deployments as they rethink their asset allocation.\nDespite the volatility, we continue to see strong client activity in the first quarter, with significant growth across channels, asset classes and product vehicles. A key headline for us was the funding of a $10 billion mandate to deliver a range of customized fixed income portfolios for The Peoples Pension fund, which is one of the largest master trusts in the United Kingdom. $6 billion of this mandate funded in the first quarter, with the incremental $4 billion funded during April. This is an important mandate as we continue to build Invesco's leadership in the retirement markets in the U.K. and globally.\nOur Global ETF and Index platform continued to produce strong results, recording 13% annualized organic growth in the first quarter. More recently, in the March time frame and continuing into April, ETF demand has cooled as global financial markets experienced increasing volatility. That said, we have continued to see our ETF flows broaden by asset class and factors across our clients in Americas, EMEA and Asia. Strong ETF growth in the U.S. market was augmented by another solid quarter for growth in EMEA, where we saw $8 billion in net new ETF flows. Top net flowing products in the U.S. were led by our QQQM, with a near record flow of $4 billion. Additionally, our [ factor suite ] drove significant net flows as precision investments become an even more critical buying decision. We continue to innovate in the ETF space, launching 3 new active ETFs in the quarter, with plans for increased expansion this year.\nFurther, our QQQ ETF was successfully listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in February. This launch marks the first cross listing of Invesco QQQ outside of North America and represents a milestone in the expanding market for ETFs into Asia. Shifting to fundamental fixed income. In the current environment of uncertainty and tight valuations, there is caution around risk taking. We saw this play out with our fixed income results, particularly during the back end of the quarter. But given our range and strength of our fixed income offering, we garnered $8 billion in net long-term inflows with an additional nearly $9 billion in global liquidity flows during the quarter. During the period, demand for investment grade and certain municipal bond strategies continued to be strong, and we also had net inflows into our ultra short duration strategies and saw a positive reversal in our stable value platform with net long-term inflows for the quarter, a trend line that has strengthened into April. Our retail SMA platform, which tends to be more focused on short duration, continued to capture flows and now stands nearly $30 billion in AUM. We have one of the fastest-growing SMA offerings in the U.S. wealth management market with an annualized growth rate of 25%.\nShifting to Private Markets. In direct real estate, we recorded net inflows of $1.1 billion, driven by the funding of a large U.K. mandate as well as continued inflows into INCREF, which is our real estate debt strategy targeting the wealth management channel, where we continue to onboard new platforms and clients. Our real estate team remains very well positioned in the institutional markets with over $5 billion of dry powder to capitalize on emerging opportunities.\nOur Private Credit capabilities recorded modest net outflows for the quarter as our market-leading bank loan ETF turned from a strong net inflow position at the beginning of the quarter to net outflows in March, which continued into April as recession fears have increased. Client interest in Private Markets remains high, and we expect to see continued activity in the key areas where we focus on real estate and Alternative Credit, including the advancements announced today with our partnership with MassMutual and Barings.\nMoving to our China JV and India capability. We saw continued net long-term inflows of $2.2 billion, which was led by Fixed Income and augmented by continued growth in ETFs, which have been gaining traction in China. While 6 new products were launched in our China JV this quarter, our organic growth in this market was largely driven by existing products, which is a good sign for the strength of our platform. Furthermore, within these markets, we have seen resiliency thus far in April with continued positive organic flow growth in these local fund ranges.\nClearly, the most recent heightened trade tensions have created an overhang for the domestic Chinese economy. The continued anticipated government stimulus, heightened domestic consumption and reforms on social service will have an impact on the development of capital markets and the retirement system, both of which are benefits for our domestic to domestic business.\nTurning to our Multi-Asset related capabilities. We saw net long-term outflows of $1.1 billion, driven by our global risk parity strategies. Finally, the relative pressure on Fundamental Equities has continued. We saw outflows in our global equities in developing market funds in the U.S. region, but importantly, by contrast in our EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, we had modest net inflows in Fundamental Equities, which is an important change in the trajectory. Overall, our focus will remain on delivering strong investment performance and gaining market share in key fundamental equity categories in which we compete.\nMoving on to Slide 5. As mentioned earlier, we provide an alternative aggregation of our AUM and our flows to provide additional context for our business results. I've covered most of the key highlights, but I will reiterate that the diversity of our asset flows across geography, channel and investment style provide a balance to market conditions and an ability to meet a range of client needs, which is an important part of our organic growth potential through various market cycles.\nMoving to Slide 6, which shows our overall performance relative to benchmarks and peers, as well as our performance in key capabilities where information is readily comparable and more meaningful to driving results. Investment performance is key to winning and maintaining market share despite overall market demand. Achieving first quartile investment performance remains our top priority. Overall, roughly half of our funds are performing in the top quartile of peers across the 3- and 5-year time horizons. Further, over 2/3 of our AUM is beating its respective benchmarks over these measurement periods.\nMoving on to Slide 7. Two important strategic priorities for Invesco have been expanding our footprint in Private Markets, particularly with wealth management clients, and ensuring that we have balance sheet and capital management flexibility to continue to invest in our growth and deliver shareholder returns. The partnership we announced today with MassMutual and Barings for private market product development and distribution in the U.S. wealth management market and the repurchase of part of our preferred stock are exciting developments in driving these strategic priorities for the benefits of our clients and our shareholders, and it also demonstrates the commitment, strength and strategic nature of our relationship with MassMutual.\nThe near-term focus of our partnership with Barings will be on delivering differentiated and industry-leading private credit-oriented income solutions and product structure suitable to reach a wide set of our U.S. wealth management clients. We're going to leverage both Invesco and Barings' capabilities and global private credit and public fixed income. The partnership is going to rely on Invesco's deep client relationships in the U.S. Wealth Management channels for our distribution and the extensive product structuring and unique asset allocation capabilities of both firms. We're also excited that MassMutual intends to support this initiative with an initial investment of $650 million in seed and co-investment capital to accelerate bringing these initial and innovative solutions to our clients. This augments MassMutual's previous commitment to Invesco's Private Market and other strategies, which has exceeded $3 billion in total.\nToday's announcement of this partnership with an institutional private markets leader like Barings complements nicely the existing strengths of our $130 billion Private Markets platform and will allow us to expand the existing Real Estate, Alternative and Private Credit strategies that we currently have in market for wealth management clients in the United States. It also demonstrates our ongoing commitment to look for opportunities to broaden our Private Market offerings to meet client needs across all market cycles and across the full spectrum of sectors and geographies.\nWith that, I'm going to turn the call over to Allison to discuss the important aspects of our announcement with MassMutual, including the details and benefits of the $1 billion repurchase of preferred stock and also our financial results for the first quarter. I look forward to your questions.\n\nLaura Allison Dukes\n\nSenior MD & CFO, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8 with the strategic rationale and impact of the $1 billion repurchase of Invesco's preferred stock. We're very pleased that we were able to reach an agreement with MassMutual to repurchase 25% of the preferred stock which they hold. There are a number of advantages for Invesco in being able to repurchase the stock.\nWe'll be funding the repurchase with committed floating rate 3- and 5-year bank term loans. They have a rate in the 5.5% to 5.75% range based on SOFR today or an after-tax cost in the 4.2% to 4.4% range. This compares favorably to the fixed 5.9% dividend rate on the preferred stock, which is not tax deductible. We expect the transaction, both the repurchase and financing, will close in May. The transaction will be earnings accretive in the second half of this year, and the accretion will increase over time as we pay down the term loans.\nUltimately, once the loans are repaid, we expect the EPS accretion related to this transaction will reach $0.13 on a run rate basis. Based on our projected future cash flows, we expect to have the loans fully repaid by mid- to late 2029. We would also anticipate paying the loans off earlier, should cash flows provide the opportunity to do so. By repurchasing the preferred stock, we will save $59 million in annual preferred stock dividends that become earnings available to common shareholders. And while the initial annualized borrowing costs associated with the term loans will be in the $40 million to $45 million range after tax, this will decrease as the loans are paid down through future cash flows.\nThe terms and conditions are similar to our floating rate revolving credit facility, and they're prepayable at any stage with no make-whole fees. There are no principal payments required for the first 3 years. The 5-year term loan does have a principal amortization feature in years 4 and 5 at 10% per year. Our balance sheet flexibility will be enhanced by the repurchase in the sense that we are pulling forward a $1 billion reduction in the preferred stock that is otherwise noncallable until May of 2040. This will enable us to further deleverage and increase balance sheet flexibility nearer term.\nIt's important to note that our capital deployment priorities remain intact. We anticipate ample cash flow capacity to repay the bank term loans and a $500 million senior note that matures in January of 2026 without restricting our current capital deployment priorities. These include continued investment in growth initiatives, regular share repurchases and modest dividend increases, as underscored by our announced common dividend increase today. We do expect that our cash and cash equivalents will remain near $1 billion going forward. It's also important to note that the repurchase agreement with MassMutual provides for discussions regarding future repurchases of the remaining $3 billion of preferred stock.\nOn the next slide, we show the expected progression of the EPS accretion through time that the term loans are repaid in 2029 and the expected run rate EPS accretion after the term loans are fully repaid. There is a 15% premium being paid to MassMutual to repurchase the $1 billion of preferred stock based on the present value of 5.9% dividend rate being eliminated 15 years ahead of the first call date. The premium will be included in our second quarter GAAP results, but it will not impact our adjusted operating results. We also show the expected impact that repurchase will have on our leverage ratios and the progression of our debt by maturity.\nLooking at the leverage ratio, excluding the preferred stock, we do see a near-term increase in leverage from the term loans, but to a very manageable level near 1x, followed by significant improvement as we repay the loan. The change to the leverage ratio, including the preferred stock, is not as impacted near term as we are effectively replacing the preferred stock with the term loan. However, with this transaction, we're able to meaningfully improve our leverage profile over the next 5 years in a way we could otherwise not attain without the repurchase. The leverage ratio shown here are pro forma, assuming no change in EBITDA from what we are reporting as trailing 4-quarter EBITDA for the first quarter of this year.\nI'll move on to the first quarter financial results on Slide 10. We continue to see strong growth in assets under management during the first half of the quarter before weaker markets set in during the second half of the quarter. Total AUM at the end of the quarter was $1.84 trillion, nearly flat to the end of the fourth quarter of '24 and $182 billion or 11% higher than the end of the first quarter of 2024. Average long-term assets under management were over $1.3 trillion, and increase of 1% over last quarter and 14% over the first quarter of last year. Growth in assets under management during the first quarter was mainly driven by net long-term inflows, net inflows into our QQQ ETF, net inflows into money market funds and positive FX impact. The impact of market declines in the latter half of the first quarter offset this growth by quarter end.\nNet long-term inflows drove an $18 billion increase in AUM during the quarter, representing an organic growth rate of over 5%. As Andrew noted, net inflows in our ETF and Index capabilities, excluding the QQQ, were over $16 billion. Fundamental Fixed Income contributed $8 billion of net inflows, and the China JV in India added $2.2 billion of net inflows. Net outflows of $7 billion in Fundamental Equities partially offset these inflows.\nNet revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin all improved from the first quarter of '24, while adjusted operating expenses continued to be well controlled. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 33% to $0.44 for the first quarter versus prior year EPS of $0.33. We continue to strengthen the balance sheet during the first quarter, ending in a net debt position of $143 million, substantially better than the first quarter of 2024's net debt position of [ $362 million ], below historical seasonal levels.\nWe also continued share repurchases in the first quarter, buying back $25 million. We intend to continue repurchasing shares at a similar level on a regular basis going forward. Our Board also improved an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend from [ $0.205 ] to $0.21 per share, reflective of our strong cash position and cash flow.\nMoving to Slide 11. As we've noted in prior calls, secular shifts and client demand have altered our asset mix and net revenue yields as our broad set of capabilities has allowed us to capture evolving client product preferences. This dynamic has been increasingly reflected in our results. Client demand has led to continued diversification of our portfolio, a trend we have seen for a number of years now. As a result, concentration risk and higher fee Fundamental Equities and Multi-Asset products has been reduced. The firm is increasingly better positioned to navigate various market cycles, events and shifting client demand. Consistent with prior quarters, current net revenue yield trends are included on the slide. The ranges by capability are representative of where the net revenue yield has ranged over the past 5 quarters. We note the net revenue yield drivers and where in the range the yields have trended more recently.\nTo provide context for the net revenue yield trend during the first quarter, our overall net revenue yield was 23.5 basis points, including the impact of 2 fewer days in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, which accounted for 0.5 basis point or [ 0.5 ] basis point of the decline. Excluding the day count impact, the net revenue yield declined 0.6 basis point compared to the fourth quarter yield of 24.6 basis points. The exit net revenue yield at the end of the first quarter was 23.8 basis points, only 0.2 basis points lower than the day count adjusted net revenue yield for the first quarter of 24 basis points.\nTurning to Slide 12. Net revenue of $1.1 billion in the first quarter was $55 million higher than the first quarter of last year, a 5% increase. Investment management fees were $59 million higher than last year. The increase was driven by higher average AUM, partially offset by the AUM mix shift previously noted. Higher performance and other fees were offset by lower service and distribution fees and higher third-party expense. Operating expenses continue to be well managed, with total adjusted operating expense only $2 million higher or 0.3% from the first quarter of last year. Sequential quarter adjusted operating expenses were $8 million lower despite seasonal expenses and compensation due to payroll tax and other compensation-related expense resets that typically occur in the first quarter.\nDeclines in marketing, property, office and technology and G&A offset the increase in compensation expense on both a year-over-year and sequential [ quarter ] basis. We did have $7 million of nonrecurring expense benefits in the first quarter that mainly impacted G&A expenses.\nAlpha platform implementation costs of $13 million were in line with our expectations for the first quarter and consistent with the $14 million incurred in the fourth quarter. We did move a small first wave of AUM on the Alpha platform in the fourth quarter of 2024. Fees paid on the assets under management that were transitioned over in the first wave were nominal expense-wise in the first quarter. As the implementation continues, we expect Alpha-related onetime implementation cost to be in the $10 million to $15 million range next quarter.\nRegarding operating expenses for 2025, we're focused on disciplined expense management. Given the recent market volatility, it's become more difficult to provide specific guidance on operating expenses, but we're managing it carefully day by day. In terms of expense flexibility, without any management intervention, our expenses are approximately 25% variable. With management intervention, some of which can take several quarters to fully realize the variability increases to 30% to 35%.\nFirst quarter year-over-year positive operating leverage was over 500 basis points, driving a $53 million or 18% increase in operating income and over a 330 basis point improvement in our operating margin to 31.5%. Effective tax rate was 24.4% in the first quarter. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate will be between 25% to 26% for the second quarter of 2025, excluding any discrete items. A slight increase in the rate is driven by shift of income across tax jurisdictions. The actual effective rate can vary due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items.\nI'll wrap up on Slide 13. As I noted earlier, we continued to make progress on building balance sheet strength in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with a net debt position of $143 million, significantly better than the prior year first quarter net debt level of $362 million. We ended the first quarter with just $74 million drawn on our credit facility, substantially lower than what we have drawn historically, with the first quarter being a seasonally high cash usage quarter.\nOur leverage ratios continued to show improvement versus a year ago, with the leverage ratio excluding the preferred stock at 0.3x versus 0.54x a year ago, and including the preferred going from 3.36x a year ago to 2.77x in the first quarter. We expect continued share repurchases, buying back $25 million or 1.5 million shares during the quarter. I'm sorry, we continued share repurchases, buying back $25 million, 1.5 million shares during the quarter. And as noted earlier, our Board approved an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend.\nWe intend to continue a regular share repurchase program going forward, and we expect our total payout ratio, including common dividends and share buybacks, will move closer to 60% in 2025 as we continually evaluate our capital return levels. To conclude, the resiliency and strength of our firm's net flow performance is evident again this quarter, and we continue to make significant progress on building a stronger balance sheet, enhanced further by the $1 billion repurchase of the preferred stock. We remain committed to driving profitable growth, a high level of financial performance and enhancing the return of capital to shareholders. With that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for Q&A."

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Invesco's Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nGregory Wade Ketron\n\nSenior VP & MD of IR, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Cedric, and to everyone joining the call today. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address. The press release and presentation are available on our website, invesco.com. This information can be found by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slide 2 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP.\nFinally, Invesco is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcript provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website. Andrew Schlossberg, President and CEO; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning, and then we'll open up the call for questions.\nI'll now turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Ryan Schlossberg\n\nChief Executive Officer, Invesco Perpetual and Head of Invesco’s EMEA Region, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThanks a lot, Greg, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to be speaking with you today. During the fourth quarter and throughout 2024, we continue to make meaningful progress in executing our strategic priorities and leveraging our competitive advantages to improve on several key performance drivers. Amid a backdrop of volatile markets across the world, mixed economic signals and geopolitical risks, our focus remains steadfast. This enabled us to deliver for clients and shareholders and meaningfully improve our operating results. I want to thank my colleagues around the world for their focus and teamwork throughout the year.\nBut before we get into the specifics of the fourth quarter, we thought it would be helpful to look at the whole of 2024 and the progress made against the 8 key financial measures that are noted on Slide 4 of our presentation. The combination of strong long-term net inflows of $65 billion or a 5% organic growth rate, higher revenues and disciplined expense management while reinvesting into the business drove an increase in operating income of $1.4 billion. We generated positive operating leverage of over 100 basis points and improved our operating margins to over 31% for the year and 34% for the fourth quarter, marking good sequential momentum throughout 2024.\nWhile client demand and net flows remained more narrowly focused, in the aggregate, we continued to gain market share and revenue growth in key high-demand strategic capabilities, including our global ETF, fixed income and SMA product ranges, all of which are highly scalable. We saw momentum build throughout the year for private and alternative credit strategies, both for institutional and wealth management clients.\nGeographically, our net long-term flows remain positive across all 3 of our regions, with a notable pickup through the second half of the year in both our Asia Pacific and EMEA markets. Specifically in Asia Pacific, we generated 10% organic growth, marking its best year since 2021.\nThroughout 2024, we remain highly focused on retaining and selectively growing our fundamental equity investment strategies against the backdrop of outflows in the industry and for Invesco. This remains a key focus for the firm. As we stressed throughout 2024, strengthening our balance sheet continues to be a priority. Through disciplined execution, we made strong progress and improved the financial flexibility of the firm.\nDuring the year, we reduced our debt, we improved our operating leverage and ended the year with a net cash position of nearly $100 million. Additionally, after commencing a more consistent share buyback program in the second half of the year, we returned 54% of earnings to common shareholders through buybacks and dividends in 2024, which was an increase from the previous year. Our success in 2024 gives us conviction in our focused strategic priorities, our execution mindset and our ability to continue to deliver enhanced and consistent operating performance and returns for our shareholders.\nTurning now to Slide 5, and focusing on the fourth quarter. Growth continues to be led by our highly innovative ETF and index platforms, which had near historic organic long-term flows of $30 million, which is a 25% annualized organic growth rate\nImportantly, we continue to see our flows through ETFs broaden by asset classes and factors across our clients in all 3 regions. Growth in the U.S. market continued to be led by our S&P 500 [ Equal Way ] strategy, our equity momentum strategy, which accounted for nearly $5 billion of the net flows and our innovation suite, which is headlined by QQQ which garnered $3 million of net inflows. This fund, which was launched just over 4 years ago, had one of its best quarters on record and has grown to nearly $40 billion in assets today.\nWe also saw strong ETF growth from the EMEA region, with nearly $11 billion of net inflows on a source basis, with our locally listed S&P 500 topping the list. We also continue to innovate at scale. In the fourth quarter, we launched a new ETF that we customized in partnership with a finished pension insurer to media climate-focused investment objectives. This ETF began trading with nearly $2.5 billion in assets and set a new milestone as the largest ETF launched on record.\nOur ETF platform finished the quarter with record AUM and revenues. Revenue growth remained strong, up 7% from the third quarter and 31% from the fourth quarter last year. We remain very well positioned to continue to gain market share and use this scale platform for profitable growth.\nShifting to fundamental fixed income. After a strong third quarter, we saw modest net long-term outflows in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by stable value, which continues to be out of favor in the current rate environment, as money market yields are paying a premium to stable value. Excluding this specific U.S. defined contribution product, our fundamental fixed income strategies continue to see solid flow growth of $1.5 billion in the quarter.\nWithin the fundamental fixed income category, flow growth was led by our municipal bond strategies and driven by our fast-growing SMA platform, which reached $28 billion in AUM or 33% organic growth rate. Additionally, revenue generated from fundamental fixed income strategies grew by 9% in the fourth quarter as compared with the same quarter in '23.\nIt's important to note that our large and diverse fixed income product line, which totaled over $600 billion at year-end spans our geographic footprint and encompasses more than just our fundamental fixed income capability that's expressed on this slide.\nLooking at this more holistic view of our fixed income product set, which also includes fixed income ETFs, our China JV, private credit strategies and global liquidity, we generated 8% AUM growth and net long-term inflows of nearly $27 billion in 2024.\nOur fixed income capabilities have strong performance and are well positioned to meet client needs across the credit and duration spectrum, geographic preferences, active and passive exposures in public and private markets. We have plenty of reasons to be optimistic about our ability to capture flows as money increasingly rotates into these asset classes.\nShifting now to private markets, which, in aggregate, drove long-term net inflows of nearly $1 billion in the quarter. Within the category, our private credit capabilities reported net inflows of $3.5 billion or 31% annualized organic growth rate. Growth was driven by bank loans and CLOs across several fund structures, including our industry-leading senior loan ETF.\nIn direct real estate, we also continue to see flows into INCREF, which is our real estate debt strategy, targeting the wealth management channel. Launched only in 2023, this fund has doubled in size over the past 2 quarters and now stands at nearly $2.5 billion in AUM. I'll also note that our real estate team is well positioned in the institutional markets with over $5 billion of dry powder to capitalize on emerging opportunities.\nMoving on to Asia Pacific. On a managed basis, in Asia, we saw a rebound this quarter with net long-term inflows of $3.5 billion, led by positive flows from India and $2.5 billion of net inflows into our China JV. Our China growth was driven by equities, particularly ETFs, which are becoming a fast-growing part of our China business and where we see strong demand continuing. These flows were augmented by net inflows into fixed income.\nWe had 6 new products launched in our China JV this quarter, including 3 ETF products. At a macro level in China, we are encouraged by the government's recent focus on economic stimulus. But overall, market sentiment has remained relatively weak and volatility remains high.\nLooking more broadly in Asia Pacific as a region on a client source basis, net inflows were even stronger at $7.5 billion for the quarter, which is a 13% annualized organic growth rate. This broader flow strength in the region highlights our success in leveraging our global product suite and our investment capabilities to meet demand across this important growth region.\nWe had good inflows in Southeast Asia, driven by ETFs, along with continued strong inflows in Japan through our global equity and income strategy, which had $1.5 billion of net inflows and continues to be 1 of the top-selling active retail equity funds in the growing Japanese market.\nTurning to our multi-asset related capabilities. we saw net long-term outflows of $1.5 billion, driven by global asset allocation, particularly in our balanced risk allocation strategy. Finally, the relative pressure on fundamental equity flows have continued. However, as I pointed out previously, we have seen some moderation over time in the global international and emerging market segments.\nNet outflows of these strategies have been in the $2 billion per quarter rate. Outflows in our emerging market strategies have been partially offset by the continued strength of global equity and income that I noted earlier as well as net inflows in small-cap equities.\nWhile asset flows in our fundamental equity capabilities remain below our long-term expectations, market growth has aided revenue, resulting in a 10% increase in net revenues this quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2023.\nOur team continues to focus on driving high-quality alpha, upgrading our talent bench and continuing to strengthen our risk management tools. Regardless of client demand, our focus remains on improving investment performance and gaining market share in key fundamental equity categories in which we compete.\nMoving on to Slide 6. We provide an alternative aggregation of our AUM and flows to provide additional context for our business results. I covered most of these key highlights underlying these charts, but I'll point out that the diversity of our assets and our flows across geography, channel and investment style, provide us the balance to weather any market condition and our ability to meet a range of client needs, which is an important part of our ongoing positive organic flow growth story.\nMoving on to Slide 7, which shows our overall investment performance relative to benchmarks and peers as well as our performance in key capabilities where information is readily comparable and more meaningful to drive results. Investment performance is key to winning and maintaining market share despite overall market demand.\nAchieving first quartile investment performance remains a top priority, and we're making progress on this front. Overall, nearly half of our funds are performing in the top quartile peers across the 1-, 3- and 5-year time horizons. Further, 2/3 of our AUM is beating its respective benchmark over all measurement periods. We continue to have strong fixed income performance with approximately 40% of our funds in the top quartile on a 3- and 5-year basis.\nWe are acutely focused on improving fundamental equity performance and we're making progress here, too. We have continued to improve the percentage of AUM in the top quartile of peers across each time line shown with 1/3 or more now hitting that target.\nWith that, I'm going to turn the call over to Allison to discuss our financial results for the quarter, and I look forward to your questions.\n\nLaura Allison Dukes\n\nSenior MD & CFO, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 8, with our fourth quarter financial results. We continue to see strong growth in assets under management during the fourth quarter with total AUM at the end of the quarter at $1.85 trillion, $50 billion or 3% higher than last quarter end, and $261 billion or 16% higher than the end of 2023.\nAverage long-term assets under management were over $1.3 trillion, an increase of 4% over last quarter and 20% over the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in AUM was mainly driven by net long-term inflows, net inflows in our QQQ ETF and net inflows in the money market funds. Unlike recent quarters, markets did not have a significant impact on AUM in the fourth quarter.\nNet long-term inflows drove a $26 billion increase in assets under management during the quarter, representing an organic growth rate of nearly 8%. As Andrew noted, net inflows and our ETF and index capabilities were nearly $30 billion. QQQ Net inflows were $10 billion, and money market fund inflows were strong at $25 billion.\nNet revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin all improved from the third quarter and showed substantial improvement from the fourth quarter of last year. I'll cover the drivers of that shortly.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.52 for the fourth quarter versus prior quarter EPS of $0.44. We continue to strengthen the balance sheet, ending the quarter in a net cash position with cash and cash equivalents exceeding debt by nearly $100 million, better than our goal of 0 net debt. We also continued share buybacks, repurchasing $25 million during the quarter, and we intend to continue buying back on a regular basis going forward.\nMoving to Slide 9. As we stated in prior calls, secular shifts and client demand have altered our asset mix and net revenue yields as our broad set of capabilities has allowed us to capture evolving client product preferences. Client demand has led to continued diversification of our portfolio, a trend we've seen for a number of years now. As a result, concentration risk and higher fee fundamental equities and multi-asset products has been reduced.\nThe firm is increasingly better positioned to navigate various market cycles, events and shifting client demand. Consistent with prior quarters, current net revenue yield trends are included on the slide. The ranges by capability are representative of where the net revenue yield has ranged over the past 5 quarters, and we note the net revenue yield drivers and where in the range, the yields have trended more recently.\nTo provide context for the net revenue yield trend during the fourth quarter, our overall net revenue yield was 24.6 basis points. The exit net revenue yield was 24.1 basis points, 0.5 basis points lower due to continued mix shift during the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 10. Net revenue of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter was $111 million higher than the fourth quarter of last year, an 11% increase and $53 million were 5% higher than the third quarter. Investment management fees were $123 million higher than last year and $29 million higher than the third quarter. The increases were driven by higher average AUM, partially offset by the AUM mix shift previously noted. Performance fees were $14 million higher than last year and $32 million higher than the third quarter, reflecting typical seasonality.\nOperating expenses continued to be well managed. Total adjusted operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $767 million, a slight decrease of $4 million or less than 1% from the fourth quarter of last year. There was a slight increase of $11 million or less than 2% and adjusted operating expenses over the third quarter.\nCompensation was $14 million higher than the fourth quarter of last year, which included $22 million of organizational change related expense. Higher compensation expense was driven mainly by higher revenue in 2024. Compensation expense was $15 million higher than the prior quarter and mainly driven by higher revenue, including compensation associated with seasonally higher performance fees.\nG&A was lower on both the year-over-year and sequential quarter basis. G&A was $28 million lower than the fourth quarter of last year, mainly to lower professional related fees and an insurance reimbursement of $13 million in the fourth quarter of this year. G&A was $11 million lower compared to the third quarter, mainly due to the insurance reimbursement, partially offset by slightly higher professional related fees.\nOutlook platform implementation costs of $14 million were in line with our expectations in the fourth quarter and consistent with the $15 million incurred in the third quarter. We did move a small first wave of AUM on the Alpha platform in the fourth quarter. Fees paid on the assets transitioned in the first wave were nominal expense wise in the fourth quarter.\nAs the implementation continues, we expect alpha-related onetime implementation cost to be in the $10 million to $15 million range per quarter in 2025. Depending on the timing of when future waves are executed, which we currently expect will continue through 2026, the implementation costs will begin to fade as we approach full implementation of Alpha. Fees paid to State Street as we transition assets to Alpha will increase as future ways are executed. Under this scenario, the combination of implementation costs and total platform fees paid to third parties could peak late this year or during the first half of 2026.\nLooking at 2025, we expect costs related to Alpha, which includes both the implementation costs and fees paid to platform providers to be $20 million to $25 million higher than 2024. We'll continue to update our progress and related costs as we move forward with the implementation.\nRegarding operating expenses for 2025, we will continue our disciplined expense management. We expect a slight uptick in expenses, driven by the higher revenue levels that we are currently generating. If you assume flat markets from year-end '24, we would expect total operating expense to increase by approximately 1% over 2024. That includes the higher Alpha related costs in 2025 that I noted.\nBack to the fourth quarter. Our quarter-over-quarter positive operating leverage was 330 basis points, driving a $41 million or a 12% increase in operating income and a 210 basis point improvement in our operating margin to 33.7%. The effective tax rate was 22.2% in the fourth quarter.\nWe estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate will be near 25%, the high end of our historic range for the first quarter of 2025, excluding any discrete tax items. The actual effective rate can vary due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items.\nI'll wrap up on Slide 11. As I noted earlier, we continued to make progress on building balance sheet strength in the fourth quarter. We ended the quarter in a net cash position with cash and cash equivalents, exceeding debt by nearly $100 million, better than our goal of 0 net debt.\nWe ended the quarter with no draws on our credit facility. Our leverage ratios continue to improve, and we're now down to a leverage ratio excluding the preferred stock of 0.25x a significant improvement over the past several years.\nWe continued share buybacks in the fourth quarter, repurchasing $25 million or 1.4 million shares during this quarter. We intend to continue a regular share buyback program going forward, and we expect our total payout ratio, including common dividends and share buybacks to move closer to 60% in 2025, as we continually evaluate our capital return levels.\nTo conclude, the resiliency and strength of our firm's net flows performance is evident again this quarter, and we continue to make progress on simplifying the organization and building a stronger balance sheet while continuing to invest in areas of growth. We remain committed to driving profitable growth, high level financial performance and enhancing the return of capital to shareholders.\nWith that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line to Q&A."

I'm pleased to be speaking with you today. During the second quarter, we had several bright spots of performance and growing business momentum against the continued complex market, economic and geopolitical backdrop.\nLeveraging our vast client network, our broad product suite and improving investment results, we continue to drive higher demand for our capabilities. For the period, we garnered $16.7 billion of net long-term flows, which is a 6% annualized organic growth rate, marking our best quarter in over two years. Importantly, we were in net positive long-term inflows in each of our three regions across active and passive strategies and in both our institutional and retail channels. We ended the quarter with over $1.7 trillion in AUM, which was up 12% from the prior year, reaching a record high for Invesco. We generated positive operating leverage with revenues up over 3% from the first quarter, and we expanded our operating margin by over 270 basis points to 30.9%. This resulted in adjusted operating income growth in the second quarter that was in double digits on both the sequential quarter and year-over-year basis.\nAs mentioned, the market environment remained choppy in the quarter, and while we saw some broadening and increasing demand for risk assets, general uncertainty and continued higher interest rates have impacted client investment behavior and our business results. Notably, after an up and down April and May, most major equity indices rallied towards the end of the second quarter. U.S. markets continue to lead the way with the NASDAQ gaining 8%, followed by the S&P 500 increasing 4%. However, the theme of narrow market returns continued with the S&P 500 equal weighted index by contrast declining by 3% in the quarter.\nEquity returns outside the U.S. were mixed with the MSCI emerging markets up 4%, Asia up 2% and Europe down 1%. Improvement in China's equity markets, which were up 6% in the quarter, were a welcome bright spot. On the fixed income side of the market, the Bloomberg global ag index declined by 1% in the quarter, while most [ days our ] major bond indices were relatively flat. All of that said, we have plenty of reasons to be optimistic that with increasing market and interest rate clarity, a broadening of participation will continue to take hold and investor appetite for more duration risk on and global oriented assets will increase.\nSo moving on to Slide 3 of the presentation, we continue to believe that our advantageous market position and clarity of strategic focus provides us with the tools to deliver enhanced operating performance and returns for our shareholders. Specifically, we have built a strong global footprint with scale businesses in the U.S. and other key developed markets and a significant and unique Asia Pacific profile, which includes hard to replicate and a leading 20-year-old joint venture in China and 30 years of longevity in the growing Japanese market. We have also developed a diverse yet focused range of active investment strategies. This includes both public and private market strengths and a multi-asset profile that empowers Invesco to meet a range of client demands, provides us diversification to perform in various market cycles and allows us to adjust as secular changes continue to develop. One of those secular trends is the continued client appetite for ETFs.\nHere, again, we are extremely well positioned with a scaled and growing suite of capabilities. Our focus is on innovation and providing access to passive factor and active strategies. Our ETF franchise continues to gain market share globally while accelerating its profitability and its overall contribution to the firm.\nFinally, a hallmark of Invesco is our leading distribution platform. It's an area of particular strength in the U.S. wealth management market, which is the world's largest asset channel and an area with significant growth potential, particularly given the democratization of certain asset classes like private markets.\nOur strategic focuses, which you can see in the middle of Slide 3 are predicated on prioritizing the intersection of market size and secular change with Invesco's unique position to drive growth in the highest opportunity regions, channels and asset classes. As you expect, our top priority is investment performance, which is key to winning market share regardless of overall client demand of highest order is continuing to enhance the quality of our active equity strategies and thereby driving greater retention and net flows into this important segment. We have tightened elements of risk management and the relationship between investments, products and distribution has never been stronger. Our investment teams have started to put up much better performance numbers, which I'll highlight momentarily.\nAn additional area of focus is on profitable organic growth. A significant driver of this is through our focus on high demand, scalable investment capabilities and delivery vehicles. In this regard, we are continuing to work to improve the operating leverage and profitability of our fixed income and multi-asset capabilities on the asset side of things and ETFs and SMAs on the vehicle side. Furthermore, we have a focus on private markets. We have a very strong institutional footprint, which has been historically focused on real estate and private and alternative credit. We are now taking steps to bring those capabilities into the faster growing wealth management space, while continuing to tap into ongoing demand in institutional markets globally. More tactically, we're focused on taking next-generation technology and deploying it through our platform at the enterprise distribution and investment levels.\nAnd finally, we are improving the financial flexibility of the firm. Strengthening the balance sheet and generating operating leverage as we continue to deliver better returns for our shareholders. These are the outcomes that we're seeking to achieve through the key performance indicators that are outlined on the right-hand side of Slide 3. They are also the themes at the forefront of today's discussion on second quarter results.\nSo flipping forward to Slide 4. Against the backdrop of the aforementioned market conditions and Invesco's strategic priorities and strengths that I just outlined, you can see on this slide the key flow drivers across our investment capabilities. Our strong organic flow growth in the second quarter continued to be led by our global ETF franchise. During the period, we continued to gain market share in this segment, recording $12.8 billion in net long-term inflows which represented a 13% annual organic growth rate. This was our highest growth ETF quarter in over two years, and we ended the period with a record high of $415 billion in long-term ETF AUM.\nGrowth this quarter was led by our equity innovation suite, our factor-based equities and our fixed income bullet shares franchise. The QQQM is our fastest-growing ETF and is now the third largest fund on our platform. This innovative product leverages our QQQ popularity, but we earn a direct fee instead of the marketing benefits we received on the QQQ trust, which equates to around $200 million annually.\nWe also saw strong growth from EMEA this quarter with over $5 [ million ] of net inflows, and we recently broke through the $100 billion mark of ETF AUM in that region. Additionally, we continue to innovate to meet client needs, Invesco is one of the few global asset managers capable of servicing clients to one customizable [ frost ] regional ETFs for exacting exposures such as the recently launched sustainable energy ETF, which garnered $1.6 billion in assets at its launch in June. The continued advantage of ETFs are evident in both passive and active formats and across all channels creating even more opportunity for expansion in this space.\nShifting to fixed income. We continue to believe that as investors gain greater clarity on inflation and Central Bank interest rate policy, they're going to move out of cash and extend their duration profiles of their fixed income allocations into a wider range of strategies. Though this anticipated shift may be more protracted than originally expected, we continue to see some green shoots. During the second quarter, client demand accelerated, and we garnered $1.6 billion in net long-term inflows into our active fundamental fixed income strategies, which is in addition to the $2 billion of fixed income ETF flows achieved. Active inflows were driven in part by municipal bond strategies delivered through our mutual funds and our SMA platforms. We ranked in the top five overall in munis and #2 for high-yield munis, we're also well positioned in SMAs with over 50 strategies placed to more than 80 broker-dealers and [ RIA ] platforms. Our retail SMA offering has rapidly expanded to over $25 billion and has had an annual organic growth rate of 28%, making it one of the fastest-growing in the industry.\nWe're also positioned with fixed income strategies in our institutional channels globally. In this quarter, we had solid net inflows driven by investment-grade strategies sourced in the Asian regions. We remain well positioned across the risk and duration fixed income asset classes and have plenty of reasons to be optimistic about our ability to capture flows as we continue to generate investment performance.\nMoving on to private markets. Here, we also maintained momentum in the second quarter, reporting net long-term inflows of $2.6 billion driven by the strength in our credit strategies, notably bank loans and CLOs. We also saw modest positive flows into direct lending as well as continued inflows into [indiscernible] which is our [ non-exchange ] traded REIT focused on private real estate debt. This fund has maintained good momentum in the U.S. wealth management advisory space since its launch last year. It's important to note that our global real estate team has over $5 billion of dry powder to capitalize on opportunities emerging from the market dislocation of the last several quarters.\nPicking up on Asia Pacific managed assets, we generated exceptionally strong net long-term inflows of $6.7 billion in assets managed in this region. This was led by our China JV, where our net long-term inflows of $8.5 billion in the second quarter surpassed the full year of 2022 and 2023 flows combined. These flows were driven by our strong performing fixed income and balanced strategies where demand return from investors seeking higher returning fixed income products given the low rate environment in China. We anticipate that this dynamic will continue to play out in the coming quarters given the evolving economic environment in the market.\nWe also launched four new equity products this quarter in China, which added $200 million of flow during the period. Additionally, as part of a collaboration between our China JV and global ETF team, we launched in June, Europe's first ETF [ link ] to the ChiNext 50 Index, which is a fund with unique access to long-term growth potential in China. The ETF market in China has seen rapid growth recently, and we are uniquely positioned to gain share and be an early mover and innovator in this space.\nPicking up on multi-asset related capabilities. As noted, we saw modest net outflows attributable to lower fee quantitative strategies. And finally, the relative pressure on active fundamental equity flows did continue. However, as I have pointed out previously, we have seen moderation namely in the global, international and emerging market segments. Net outflows in these strategies have slowed during the past several quarters to $1 billion to $2 billion in aggregate which is markedly lower than the 2022 quarterly peak outflows where we sold $6 billion.\nA continued bright spot in our active fundamental equity capabilities has been our global equity and income strategy, which is among the top-selling active retail funds and in the growing Japanese market. This fund delivered an incremental $1.2 billion of net inflows in the second quarter and its rapid rise in AUM has placed it in our top 10 active equity funds at Invesco. Overall, we're confident that the high-quality active equity management will continue to be an area of significant portfolio allocations, and it's a reason that we are so acutely focused on investment quality and performance in this area.\nSo moving on to Slide 5. This chart provides an alternative aggregation of our AUM and our flows to provide you with additional context on our results. From a geographic perspective, you can see that we delivered solid net long-term inflows across all three regions with particular strength in Asia Pacific, where we had over $10 [ billion ] sourced from clients in these markets. Strong growth in China was augmented by continued momentum in Japan, where we have seen institutional demand for fixed income, most notably investment grade as well as the continued retail demand for the aforementioned global equity and income strategy. It's important to note that this view of the Asia Pacific region is a more holistic measure of the scale of our business than the previous slide. The AUM and flow numbers not only include the products that we manage in the region, but also the breadth of Invesco's other products managed globally that are sold into the Asia Pacific market.\nAn additional key takeaway from Slide 5 is depicted in the chart at the bottom center of the page. Here, you can see the significant improvement in return to positive net flows in our overall active investment strategies. This cuts across all asset classes, public and private markets. Furthermore, you'll note the graph on the bottom right of the page, the positive flows and strong improvement seen in our institutional channel. This is driven by demand pickup across both public and private credit.\nSo moving forward to Slide 6 for an update on investment results. As I have reiterated several times this morning, investment performance is a top priority of our firm. This slide shows our overall results relative to benchmark and peers as well as our performance in key capabilities where information is readably comparable and more meaningful to driving results. Investment performance was solid in the second quarter, on a 1-, 3- and 5-year basis, overall performance improved incrementally from last quarter with 70%, 65% and 76%, respectively, of our AUM beating its benchmark. Additionally, on a 1-year basis, we have improved, and we now have nearly 70% of our AUM in the top half of peers and 45% in the top quartile of peers.\nAt the asset class level, we continue to have excellent fixed income performance across nearly all capabilities and time horizons, supporting our strong conviction and our ability to attract flows as investors deploy money into these strategies. Specifically, 92% of our fundamental fixed income capabilities are beating their benchmark with 83% of our AUM in the top half of peers on a 5-year basis. We're acutely focused on improving fundamental equity performance and have been making progress here as well. Half of our funds are now performing above benchmark on a 1-year basis, with 52% beating peers on a 1- and 5-year basis. So hopefully, the overall additional context and the more detailed disclosures that we have shared today and last quarter have further clarified our results, outline the significant opportunities that we have before us and provided more clarity on our approach to capitalize on them over time.\nSo with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Allison to discuss our financial results for the quarter, and I look forward to your questions.\n\nLaura Allison Dukes\n\nSenior MD & CFO, Invesco Ltd.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin on Slide 7 with our second quarter financial results. Total assets under management at the end of the second quarter were over $1.7 trillion, $53 billion or 3.2% higher than last quarter end and a record high for Invesco. Higher markets account for $27 billion of the increase, while net long-term inflows drove a $16.7 billion increase in AUM during the quarter. Of the $27 billion increase due to higher markets, $24 billion was driven by ETFs, including $21 billion by the QQQ.\nAs Andrew noted, net long-term inflows were strong at $16.7 million, which represented an organic growth rate of nearly 6%. We had long-term net inflows across most of our investment capabilities. ETF inflows, excluding the QQQ, were $12.8 billion in the second quarter. APAC managed generated $6.7 billion in net inflows. Private markets drove $2.6 billion in net inflows and fundamental fixed income had $1.6 billion in net inflows. Partially offsetting this was $6.3 billion in fundamental equity net outflows during the quarter. Average assets under management grew $56 billion or 3.5% quarter-over-quarter to $1.67 trillion.\nNet revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin improved from the first quarter, and I'll cover the drivers of those improvements shortly. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.43 for the second quarter versus the prior quarter EPS of $0.33. We further strengthened the balance sheet during the second quarter by paying down the credit facility from $368 million drawn at the end of the first quarter to zero drawn at the end of the second quarter. We ended the quarter with net debt of nearly zero, and we're on track to remain at net debt of zero or better in the second half of this year. As a result, we do expect to resume share buybacks in the third quarter.\nMoving to Slide 8. As we've discussed in prior calls, secular shifts in client demand have altered our asset mix and net revenue yields as our broad set of capabilities has allowed us to capture evolving client product preferences. And this has been increasingly captured in our results. Our portfolio is better diversified today than four years ago, and our concentration risk and higher fee fundamental equities and multi-asset products has been reduced. These dynamics should portend well for future revenue growth and marginal profitability improvement. The firm is better positioned to navigate various market cycles, events and shifting client demand.\nOne other element to note on this slide are the current net revenue yield [ trends ]. The ranges by capability are representative of where the net revenue yields have ranged over the past five quarters, and we note the net revenue yield drivers and where in the range, the yields have trended more recently. This should provide you better visibility on where current net revenue yields are running by capability.\nTurning to Slide 9. Net revenue of $1.1 billion in the second quarter was $33 million higher than the first quarter, a 3% increase and nearly unchanged from the second quarter of last year. The increase from last quarter was largely in line with a 3.5% increase in average AUM quarter-over-quarter. Investment management fees were $27 million higher than last quarter, driven by higher average AUM and partially offset by the aforementioned AUM mix shift. Performance fees were $16 million higher than the first quarter due to seasonality as we typically see an increase in performance fees in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter. The increase in performance fees was primarily driven by private real estate and our China JV business.\nTotal adjusted operating expenses in the second quarter were $750 million, a decrease of $7 million or 1% from the first quarter. Compensation expense was $1 million lower than the prior [ year ], the benefit from lower seasonal-related compensation expenses in the second quarter was offset by higher compensation related to higher revenues in the second quarter, including higher performance fee related comp. G&A was $7 million lower than the prior quarter as costs associated with our Alpha platform implementation increased from $7 million in the first quarter to $12 million in the second quarter, which was more than offset by lower professional related fees in the second quarter. Going forward, we continue to expect alpha-related onetime implementation cost to be approximately $10 million per quarter for the remainder of 2024 with some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter. We'll continue to update our progress on the implementation and related costs as we progress through the implementation.\nOn a year-over-year basis, total adjusted operating expenses were $12 million lower, adjusting for $27 million related to executive retirements and organizational change related expenses in the second quarter of last year largely driven by lower G&A expenses. Quarter-over-quarter positive operating leverage was 400 basis points, driving a $39 million or 13% increase in operating income and a 270 basis point improvement in our operating margin to 30.9%.\nThe effective tax rate was 22.1% in the second quarter. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 25% for the third quarter of 2024. The actual effective tax rate can vary due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items.\nNow I'll finish on Slide 10. We continue to make progress on building balance sheet strength in the second quarter. At the end of the first quarter, we had $368 million drawn on our credit facility as we redeem the $600 million in senior notes that matured on January 30, and the first quarter is a seasonally high cash usage quarter. We ended the first quarter with net debt of $362 million. During the second quarter, we paid down the credit facility to zero and improved our net debt position to nearly Europe. Both results were ahead of our expectations. These actions resulted in an improvement in our leverage ratios, and we're now down to a leverage ratio excluding the preferred stock of 0.28x, a significant improvement over the past several years. Given these results, we expect to maintain or improve our net debt position going forward.\nWe're also in a position to begin a more regular stock buyback per [ gram ] in the third quarter. Initially, we expect to buy back around $25 million per quarter depending on market conditions. We expect our total payout ratio to move into the 50% to 60% range, which we will continually evaluate.\nTo conclude, the resiliency and strength of our firm's net flow performance is evident again this quarter, and we continue to make progress on simplifying the organization and building a stronger balance sheet while also continuing to invest in areas of growth. We remain committed to driving profitable growth, a high level of financial performance and enhancing return of capital to shareholders.\nAnd with that, we'll open up the call to Q&A, if the operator would like to open it up."

[Operator Instructions] This call will last 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Invesco's Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nGregory Wade Ketron\n\nSenior VP & MD of IR, Synchrony Financial\n\nAll right. Thanks, operator, and to everyone joining us on the call today. In addition to our press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address. The press release and presentation are available on our website, invesco.com. This information can be found by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nPlease review the disclosures on Slide 2 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures of appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. Finally, Invesco's is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcast are located on our website.\nAndrew Schlossberg, President and CEO; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning, and then we'll open up the call for questions. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Ryan Schlossberg\n\nChief Executive Officer, Invesco Perpetual and Head of Invesco’s EMEA Region, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to be speaking with you today. Economic conditions remained relatively resilient this quarter. And even though this diminished expectations for central bank cuts this year, equity markets continue to rise. The S&P 500 gained 10% during the quarter, again making it the best-performing major equity [indiscernible]. As the quarter progressed, market breadth began to improve though gains in large-cap growth and tech stocks continue to significantly lead the U.S. equity market rally.\nMore modest growth was recorded in developed markets outside of the U.S. In China, markets continue to lag, but economic indicators and sentiment are showing some signs of a [indiscernible]. Fixed income markets were generally weak this quarter with prices dropping as Fed expectations changed. During the quarter, we continued to see increasing client demand overall. We delivered $6.3 billion in net long-term inflows for an organic growth rate of 2.2%.\nOrganic flow growth and signs of improving sentiment drove markets and assets levels higher again this quarter at Invesco and ended the period with nearly $1.7 trillion in asset management, resulting net revenue and adjusted operating income growth were up 1% and 7%, respectively, from Q4 levels, which reflects where we saw growth against our diversified asset mix profile. We remain optimistic that increasing market clarity, a broadening of market participation will continue to take hold and investor appetite for duration, risk on and global-oriented assets will increase.\nWe are well positioned to [ penetrate ] our business in this type of environment. Now moving on to Page 3 of the presentation and against this market backdrop, we highlight results in each of our investment capabilities.\nYou'll note these categories aligned with those presented in conjunction with our net revenue yield and portfolio migration disclosures, which we've been highlighting the last several quarters, and Allison will expand on later in her comments. We are aligning disclosures in the way we speak about our business to present a more holistic and consistent view that encompasses all of our investment capabilities. And though each of these areas of our business is in a different part of its life cycle with different trajectories, these are the capabilities where we have invested resources and had conviction about the market and our position within it.\nThe objective of our enhanced disclosure is to foster a better understanding of various components of our investment capabilities and their performance and potential in order to drive a clearer view of Invesco as a whole, our advantages in the market and our plans to drive profitable growth. Now turning to a deeper look into Q1 across each of these capabilities. An ongoing key driver of our strong organic flow growth is our [indiscernible] and index platform. During the quarter, we continued to gain market share, recording $11.2 billion in net long-term flows, representing a [ 12% ] annual and growth rate.\nThis was one of our best flow quarters to date as we hit a record high of nearly $400 billion in long-term AUM. Growth this quarter was led by our equity innovation suite, notably our fund Q2QM. This innovative product leverages our QQQ popularity. But with this fund, we earn a direct fee on this product instead of significant marketing benefits. In a relatively short time, it has become our third largest ETF in our product suite outside the QQQ. Additionally, we continue to expand and leverage our active investment teams into our ETF and index franchise. Our U.S.-listed ETF strategies incorporating our active teams now exceed $25 billion in AUM across over 25 products and multiple asset classes.\nThe advantages of ETFs in both passive and active formats remain a focus for Invesco and our clients. Shifting to fixed income. We continue to believe that as investors gains greater clarity on inflation and Central Bank interest rate policy, they'll move out of cash and extend their duration profiles of their fixed income allocations into a wider range of strategies. Though this anticipated shift may be more protracted given the mixed economic signals of late, we're beginning to see green shoots, and we're well positioned across the risk and duration fixed income asset classes to capture flows.\nWe did see continued momentum into fundamental fixed income with $1.1 billion of net long-term flows in the [ third ] quarter or nearly a 2% annual organic growth rate. Leading drivers included investment-grade strategies delivered through our institutional channels as well as municipal bond strategies delivered through our mutual fund and SMA platforms. Beyond our fundamental fixed income capabilities, an additional $2.1 billion of assets flowed into our fixed income-related ETF strategies.\nImportant to our fixed income demand story is rapidly expanding retail SMA offering, which is one of the assets growing in the industry with an annual organic growth rate of 24% and nearly $20 billion in AUM. We're starting to see extension of duration with our top-selling SMA this quarter being the intermediate tax-exempt strategy, and we're seeing growing interest in our intermediate taxable investment-grade strategies as well. We are well positioned to continue to grow our retail SMA platform to support the client demand for this vehicle delivery structure, especially U.S. wealth intermediary market. We have a long-dated and established track record on our SMA platform that represents not only fixed income, but also traditional active equity and custom equity index SMAs.\nWe see a lot of opportunity in this space and we look forward to continuing to share our progress with you. Moving on to private markets. We made momentum into the first quarter with net long-term flows of $1 billion driven by inflows in our credit strategies, notably bank loans. We also saw modest positive flows into direct real estate, primarily driven by [ craft ], which is our nonexchange-traded REIT focused on the private real estate debt markets, which has had good momentum in the wealth advisory space since its launch last year.\nAdditionally, it's important to note that our real estate team has $6 billion of dry powder to capitalize on opportunities emerging from the market dislocation of the last several quarters. Greater market clarity is going to be required before we can begin to see significant return of demand and growth. Moving on to our Asia Pacific-managed assets. Despite overall client sentiment in China remaining relatively weak, we did generate modest positive net long-term flows in our China need driven by equities, particularly fast-growing ETF lineup. This was augmented by the launch of 4 new products, and we continue to believe that some early signs of recovery in China could bode well for a more constructive market as 2024 progresses.\nWe maintain our conviction in this market and our leading position within it as the asset management industry matures with the development of local retirement and capital market systems in the world's second largest economy. Beyond China, we also saw nets interest in our in [indiscernible] business. We recently announced a joint venture with a leading Indian company for our funds business in that market. This partnership with the Hinduja Group will enable us to continue to expand our distribution to serve more domestic investors in the Indian market.\nIn our multi-asset and other related capabilities, we also generated net inflows led by our quantitative equity strategies which were offset by outflows of remaining assets in our GTR capability in the U.K., which we decided to close last year. Finally, the relative pressure on fundamental equity flows continued. However, as I pointed out previously, we've seen some moderation in certain areas of active equity flows, particularly in the global, international and emerging market segments. Our net outflows in these strategies have moderated during the past several quarters to $1 billion to $2 billion per quarter, markedly lower than 2022 quarterly peak outflows of $6 billion.\nOne notable standout in our fundamental equity flows was in our global equity and income strategy, which is among the top-selling active refunds in the growing Japanese market. This fund delivered an incremental [ $2 ] billion of net flows in the quarter as AUM has nearly tripled in the past year. Overall, our asset flows in the first quarter continue to demonstrate the breadth of capabilities that we offer to serve our clients' diverse needs and perform through various market cycles. We believe that this positions us well in front of the rapid evolution underway in our industry. Our team remains focused on the value drivers that we believe create a competitive advantage to deliver sustained strong asset flows.\nNote investment quality, product breadth and differentiation and exceptional client engagement. So moving on to Slide 4, investment performance, which is always a top priority of our firm and as displayed on this slide. We're showing overall results relative to benchmarks and peers as well as our performance in key capabilities, where information is readily comparable and more meaningful driving company outcomes. Overall, investment performance was solid in the first quarter on a 1-, 3- and 5-year basis, 66%, 64% and 75%, respectively, of our AUM is beating its benchmark and around 70% of our AUM is in the top half of peers across all periods.\nWe also have a significant number of funds that are now in the top quartile of performance with 46% hitting that mark on a 5-year basis, which is a considerable improvement over the last several quarters. We continue to have excellent fixed income performance across nearly all capabilities and time horizons, supporting our strong conviction in our ability to direct flows as investors deploy money into these strategies. 90% of our fundamental fixed income capabilities are beating their benchmark with 68% in the top quartile on a 5-year basis. Fundamental equities 3 and 5 performance has improved meaningfully over the past year, with [ 66 ]% in the top half of peers on a 3-year basis and 52% over 5 years.\nWe've seen strengthening results across many of our domestic and global equity strategies as well. So hopefully, you find this more streamlined approach to discussing our results, our investment capability and investment performance more straightforward and useful as you think about Invesco and its potential. As we continue to simplify and focus our business, we are also tightening our financial discipline to enable the allocation of resources to drive innovation and growth in our investment capabilities.\nWith that, I'm going to turn the call over to Allison to discuss our financial results for the quarter, and I look forward to your questions.\n\nAllison Dukes\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin on Slide 5. Total assets under management at the end of the first quarter were nearly $1.7 trillion or $77 billion higher than last quarter end. Higher markets, coupled with net long-term inflows drove the increase in AUM during the first quarter. Of the $68 billion increase driven by higher markets, $46 billion was driven by ETF including $20 billion by the QQQ. Fundamental equity AUM was $19 billion higher due [indiscernible]. As Andrew noted, we generated $6.3 billion in net long-term inflows for organic growth of 2.2%. Long-term net inflows were largely driven by ETFs, excluding the QQQ.\nETF flows were $11.2 billion in the first quarter. Partially offsetting this was $5.6 billion in fundamental equity net outflows during the quarter. Net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin all improved from the fourth quarter, and I'll cover the drivers of that improvement shortly.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.33 for the first quarter. We continue to simplify and streamline the organization to better position Invesco for greater scale and improved profitability in the future. We did incur $5 million of organizational change related in the quarter, we also achieved an incremental $4 million of net savings, more than we had expected previously. These efforts resulted in $60 million of annual net savings this year exceeding our goal of $50 million for 2024. Overall, operating expenses remained well managed.\nWe further strengthened the balance sheet by redeeming the $600 million senior notes that matured on January 30. As expected, we used $500 million in cash, and we drew approximately $100 on our credit facility to fully redeem the notes. We ended the quarter with net debt of $362 million as we had other seasonal related cash usage during the quarter and we're still on track to approach net debt of [ zero ] in the second half of this year.\nMoving to Slide 6. Dealerships and client demand across the asset managed industry coupled with more recent market dynamics have had a significant impact on our asset mix since the acquisition of Oppenheimer Fund. Going back to 2019 after the acquisition, ETF and index AUM, excluding the QQQ, have grown from $171 billion or 14% of our overall $1.2 trillion in average AUM in 2019 to $398 billion or 23% of our average AUM of $1.6 trillion in the first quarter. The QQQ a product we earn no management fees from, but does provide a substantial marketing benefit has more than tripled in size over this time, growing from $74 [ billion ] to $259 [ billion ] or 6% to 15% of total average AUM. We've also seen very strong growth in global liquidity, growing from $77 billion or 7% of average AUM to $165 billion or 10% of average AUM in the first quarter.\nThese product areas carry lower net revenue yields compared to our overall net revenue yield. During the same time frame, we've seen weaker demand for fundamental equities and multi-asset products, which carry higher net revenue. This has been driven in part by the risk-off sentiment that was sparked in early 2022, coupled with the pressure we experienced in developing market and global equities as well as the closure of our GTR capabilities.\nOur fundamental equity portfolio in 2019 was $348 billion or 29% of our average AUM. By the first quarter, that portfolio had declined to $274 billion or 16% of our average AUM. Multi-asset also declined from 9% to 4% of average AUM over this time frame. Looking at the first quarter of '24 as compared to the fourth quarter of '23, we continue to experience similar dynamics with ETF and growing from 20% to 23%, and the QQQ grew from 14% to 15% of average AUM, while fundamental equities and multi-asset remained flat at 16% and 4%, respectively. The result of revenue headwinds created by these dynamics has weighed on our results over the last several years.\nWhile we've experienced excellent organic growth and lower fee capabilities like ETFs and global liquidity is not enough to offset the revenue loss from higher fee fundamental equity and multi-asset outlet. Our overall net revenue yield has declined meaningfully during this time frame, but that decrease has been driven by the shift in our asset mix, not degradation in the yield in our investment strategies. Net revenue yields by investment strategy have been relatively stable within the ranges provided on the slide. The other point that I want to [indiscernible] is the multiyear secular shift in client preferences have been and recaptured in our results.\nOur portfolio is better defined today than 4 years ago and our concentration risk and higher fee fundamental equities and multi-asset [indiscernible] have been reduced. These dynamics, though challenging to manage through as they occur should portend well for future revenue growth and marginal profitability improvement. Further, we now have a more diversified business mix, which better positions the firm to navigate various market cycles, tests and shifting client demand.\nNow turning to Slide 7. Net revenue of $1.05 billion in the first quarter was $23 million lower than the first quarter of '23 and $7 million higher than the fourth quarter of '23. The decline from last year was largely due to a [indiscernible] decline in investment management fees driven by the shift in our asset mix just discussed. Service and distribution fee increased $43 million due to higher than related fees and higher AUM to which the fees apply. But this is largely offset by third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses that are passed through from service and distribution fees. The revenue increase from the prior quarter was primarily due to a [ $30 ] million increase in invest management fees due to higher average AUM, partially offset by the incremental asset mix shift and lower seasonal performance fees.\nService and distribution fees increased $32 million due to higher fund-related fees but were offset by third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses. Before I cover operating expenses, I did want to note that the first -- for the first quarter, certain operating expenses were reclassified to more accurately portray the nature of the expenses. These expenses were previously classified as either marketing or property office and technology and they've now been reclassified as G&A expenses.\nWe've included in the appendix a 2-year look back on the reclassifications to show the impact by expense category. The reclassification had no impact on our reported operating revenues, total operating expenses, operating income or net income. For comparability, the variances I will be discussing include the reclass expense categories for the first quarter [indiscernible] and the first quarter and fourth quarters of last year. Total adjusted operating expenses in the first quarter were [ $770 ] -- excuse me, $757 million, an increase of [indiscernible] from the first quarter of last year. Included in the first quarter of this year's operating expenses, or $5 million related to organizational change expenses and $7 million of Alpha platform-related implementation expenses, which in the first quarter of last year would have been recorded in transaction, integration and restructuring expenses, and not included in our operating expenses.\nAdjusting for these items, first quarter expenses were $4 million lower than the first quarter of last year. Total adjusted operating expenses were $14 million lower than fourth quarter largely driven by lower G&A expenses. Employee compensation was $6 million higher in this quarter due largely to the seasonal impact of higher payroll tax and other benefit resets in the first quarter which totaled approximately $20 million. This was partially offset by lower costs related to organizational changes that I'll touch on shortly.\nG&A expense was $21 million lower than last quarter as we typically see higher G&A in the fourth quarter. Lower professional services fees in the first quarter were the primary driver of the decline in G&A expense. We also had $7 million in spending related to our Alpha platform implementation, lower than the $12 million incurred last quarter. Going forward, we continue to expect onetime implementation costs of Alpha to be approximately [ $20 ] per quarter in '24, with some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter.\nWe'll continue to update our progress on the implementation and related costs as we move forward. The effective tax rate was 20.6% in the first quarter. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 25% for the second quarter 2014. The actual issue tax rate can vary due to the impact of occurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items.\nMoving to Slide 8. We have an incremental $4 million in net expense savings in the first quarter related to the organizational changes. On an annualized basis, we have achieved $60 million in net savings, exceeding our $50 million target for 2024. And while we did realize $5 million of organizational change related expenses in the first quarter, we're not currently expecting any further significant restructuring costs associated with these efforts. The full benefits from our simplification efforts will be seen over time as we generate revenue growth and margin recovery. As we discover manage variable compensation to a full year outcome in the company performance and competitive industry practices.\nHistorically, our compensation to net revenue ratio has been in the 38% to 42% range, trending towards the upper end of the range and periods of lower revenue. At current AUM levels, we would expect the ratio to be slightly above the higher end of this range for 2024. I'll finish on Slide 9. We continue to make progress on building balance sheet strength and the further. We redeemed the $600 million senior note that matured on January 30, using the $500 million in cash and drawing $100 million on our credit facility to accomplish this.\nWe ended the quarter with $900 million in cash and [ $38 ] million drawn on the facility as the first quarter is a seasonally high cash usage quarter. We ended the quarter with net debt of $362 million compared to nearly $600 million a year ago, all in line with our expectations. These actions resulted in an improvement in our leverage ratios, and we're now down to a leverage ratio excluding the preferred of 0.54x, a significant improvement over the past several years. We expect to pay down the credit facility as we move through the second and third quarters, approaching our goal of zero net debt in the second half of this year. We also hope to begin a more regular stock buyback program as we move towards this goal.\nWe're pleased to note that our Board approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to [ $0.205 ] per share effective this quarter. This reflects the strength of our balance sheet, cash position and stable cash flows. To conclude the resiliency of our firm net flows performance is evident again this quarter, and we continue to make progress on simplification and building a stronger balance sheet while also investing in areas of growth. We are committed to driving profitable growth and a high level of financial performance, and we have the right strategic positioning to do so with that, I'd like to open it up to Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Invesco's Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nGregory Wade Ketron\n\nSenior VP & MD of IR, Synchrony Financial\n\nAll right. Thanks, operator. It's all of you joining us today. In addition to the press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address on the call today. The press release and presentation are available on our website at invesco.com. This information can be found by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slide 2 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP.\nFinally, Invesco is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website. Andrew Schlossberg, President and CEO; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning, and then we'll open up the call for questions. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Ryan Schlossberg\n\nChief Executive Officer, Invesco Perpetual and Head of Invesco’s EMEA Region, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThanks, Greg, and hello, everyone, and I'm pleased to be speaking with you today. In a reversal from the third quarter, overall market sentiment in the fourth quarter turned more constructive as investors began to gain confidence, putting money back to work in the last several weeks of the calendar year. Equities and fixed income were both beneficiaries of a growing belief that central banks would cut rates sooner in 2024.\nThe S&P was the best-performing major equity index and while outside the U.S., there was solid market growth in Europe, while China continued to lag. Fixed income markets performed well, led by government bonds as expectations for tightening interest rates earlier in 2024 prevailed. The market volatility and shifting macro trends exhibited this past quarter, strengthened our conviction in the areas we focused on throughout 2023, and continuing to reposition Invesco to perform through various market cycles and in front of the rapid evolution underway in our industry.\nAs discussed on previous calls, we continue to streamline and simplify the company for the benefits of our clients, colleagues and shareholders. The focus of these efforts is to further emphasize long-term investment quality strengthen our diverse product offering and build on our value proposition that uniquely meets a broad range of client needs around the world. We are also tightening our financial discipline, which will further enable us to allocate resources to drive innovation and acceleration for the benefits of clients.\nWe're going to continue to leverage our scale to more effectively invest in profitable growth and further strengthen a culture that attracts and retains the top talent in our industry. While our work in each of these areas continues, we are making good progress, and I'm appreciative of the client focus and dedication of my Invesco colleagues around the world. Our results, which are highlighted on Slide 3 of the presentation, summarize many of these external and internal factors at play.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to benefit from growing client demand and assets beginning to move off the sidelines. In the fourth quarter, we delivered $6.7 billion in net long-term inflows and which is a testament to our advantageous position with deep client relationships, strong geographic mix and a broad suite of in-demand solutions. While organic flow growth and improving sentiment drove asset levels higher, most of the gains occurred later in the quarter, limiting the revenue impact in the fourth quarter but increasing AUM nearly 7% from September 30 levels.\nSeveral factors contributed to our strong organic flow growth in the fourth quarter. Most notably, demand for our ETFs and our SMAs continue to drive market share gains in these important product platforms. During the quarter, we achieved $14 billion in positive flows in our ETF factor and index capabilities globally and hit a record high of $634 billion in AUM. We also produced our 13th consecutive quarter of positive flow growth in SMAs as we continue to see strong demand for custom tax optimized solutions in the U.S. wealth management channel, in particular.\nThe second set of quarterly organic growth drivers were the return to positive flows in 2 of our most critical growth areas, our China business as well as the broader Asia Pacific region and private market alternatives. While overall sentiment in China remained relatively weak, our well-established position in the country drove positive organic growth in the fourth quarter. The majority of the flow growth came from the launch of 7 new products which were augmented by equity product sales in existing capabilities.\nStrong demand for these new products could signal a more constructive 2024 in China. Long term, we remain optimistic about this market and our unique leadership position within it. We continue to believe that the Chinese asset management industry will grow and mature in the coming years with the development of the local retirement and capital market systems in the world's second largest economy. In private markets, we generated net long-term inflows led by a stabilization and modest inflow into direct real estate and inflows to credit strategies, notably bank loans, which includes CLOs.\nWe have over $6 billion in dry powder to capitalize on opportunities emerging from the market dislocation of the last several quarters, but we will need greater market clarity before we begin to see significant growth. Shifting to fixed income, which is a key area of strength for Invesco. We continue to see steady ongoing growth, having reported positive inflows in 19 of the past 20 quarters. Leading contributors in the fourth quarter included investment grade, custom SMAs as well as municipal bond strategies.\nAs investors gain greater clarity on inflation and Central Bank interest rate policy, we expect clients to move out of cash and extend the duration profiles of their fixed income allocations into a wider range of strategies. As previously highlighted, fixed income is one of our absolute strengths in Invesco, and we remain focused on ensuring we're well positioned to capture an outsized share of this ongoing reallocation.\nFinally, pressure on active equity flows continued in the fourth quarter for both the industry and for Invesco. We continue to emphasize investment quality, product differentiation and client engagement to ensure we remain a leading provider in this space with a focus on our in-demand capabilities where we can gain market share. Despite the continued headwinds, we have seen some moderation in certain areas of active equity flows particularly in global, international and emerging market segments.\nOur net outflows into these important strategies moderated during 2023 to $1 billion to $2 billion a quarter significantly lower than what we experienced in 2022. These early signs of reversal have been led by our Global Equity and income strategy, which achieved top retail selling status in Japan and delivered an incremental [ $1.4 billion ] of net inflows in the fourth quarter. While we are cautiously optimistic about market conditions for 2024, we remain prepared to meet client and shareholder expectations across a range of scenarios.\nWe have the breadth of capabilities, the discipline to drive performance as well as the organizational structure and focus to ensure we are well positioned to meet evolving client demands. As market sentiment improves, this should translate to even greater scale, performance and improve profitability. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Allison for a closer look at our results, and I look forward to your questions.\n\nAllison Dukes\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4. Overall investment performance was solid in the fourth quarter with 64% and 71% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers were beating benchmark on both a 3-year and a 5-year basis, respectively. Investment performance improved considerably on a 5-year basis, going from 65% in the third quarter to 71% in the fourth quarter reflective of improved performance that we're seeing across several categories, including in U.S., global and international equity.\nWe continue to have excellent performance in fixed income across nearly all capabilities and time horizons. An important fact given our strong conviction in our ability to attract flows as investors deploy money into these strategies. Turning to Slide 5. AUM was nearly $1.6 trillion at the end of the fourth quarter, $100 billion higher than last quarter end. The fourth quarter began with weak markets in October and then recovered as the quarter progressed ending the year with equity and fixed income markets higher versus the third quarter.\nHigher markets, coupled with net long-term inflows and favorable foreign exchange movements drove the increase in assets under management during the fourth quarter. We generated $6.7 billion in net long-term inflows, which was an organic growth rate of 2.4% that we expect to once again outperform peers in what has been a challenging environment for organic asset growth.\nLooking at flows by investment approach, client demand for passive capabilities remain strong as we garner nearly $14 [ billion ] of net long-term inflows during the quarter. inflows were $12.4 billion, an annualized organic growth rate of 17%, marking this as one of our best quarters for ETF. The S&P 500 Equal Weight Index bond once again led the quarter with $4.6 billion of net long-term inflows. This ETF was also our leading flow driver for the year with nearly $13 billion of inflows.\nOur Q2 QM ETF through the second highest inflows in our ETF suite with over $2 billion for the quarter. The Q2 QM was launched a little over 3 years ago and now stands at over $18 billion of AUM, making it our third largest ETF outside the QQQ. We demonstrate the ability to sustain growth in ETFs throughout the full market cycle with organic growth in 13 of the past 14 quarters. Offsetting some of the growth in passive was $7.2 million of net outflows in active strategies. What's encouraging is that the level of outflows in the fourth quarter was the second lowest since the market sell-off began in early 2022.\nThe lower level of net outflows was driven by growth in active fixed income products led by our custom fixed income SMA, which totaled $2.1 billion in inflows. Regarding active equity strategies, we experienced another quarter of strong growth in Japan with our Henley Global Equity and income fund garnering $1.4 billion of net inflows from Japanese clients. This fund continues to be the top-selling retail fund for the industry in Japan on both a quarterly and a year-to-date basis.\nActive global equity products experienced net outflows of $1.6 billion, of which $1.2 billion came from the developing markets fund. The level of outflows from this investment class has declined after significantly elevated redemptions in the second half of 2022. Looking at flows by channel. The retail channel generated $4.6 billion of net long-term inflows, while our institutional channel had net inflows of $2.1 billion. Driving the growth in the retail channel or the ETF products I noted previously, as well as the custom fixed income estimate.\nGrowth in the institutional channel resumed after net long-term outflows in the third quarter that were driven by the global targeted returns redemptions. Moving to Slide 6 inflows by geography. Asia Pacific delivered net long-term inflows of $5.8 billion, representing organic growth of 12%, driven by growth in Japan and a resumption of growth in our China joint venture. Japan's net long-term inflows were $3 billion in the fourth quarter, representing an organic growth rate of 21% driven by the Henley Global Equity and income fund as well as fixed income products.\nWe believe Japanese markets are seeing the most constructive conditions for risk on assets in many years, and we're well positioned to capture that growth. Our China joint venture generated $1.7 billion in net long-term inflows driven by ETFs and fixed income strategies. Turning to flows by asset class. Equities generated $8.3 billion and net long-term inflows, mainly driven by the strong growth in ETFs. Fixed income flows were impacted by our planned bullet share ETF maturities that occur each December which totaled $2.8 billion.\nThis is an annual occurrence, and these outflows are typically offset by new bullet share products launched in the first quarter, where we are already seeing strong inflows in January. Excluding these maturities, fixed income and net long-term inflows were $2.9 billion. In alternatives, we generated $1 billion of net long-term inflows in bank loans, including CLOs and $400 million in net long-term inflows into direct real estate. These inflows were offset by outflows and other products that we classify as alternative products, such as global asset allocation and commodity ETFs.\nWe have a strong track record in our private markets platform with alternatives and are well positioned to capture long-term flows in this asset class as client demand shifts to these strategies. Moving to Slide 7. Secular shifts in client demand across the asset management industry, coupled with more recent market dynamics have significantly changed our asset mix since the acquisition of Oppenheimer Fund. Going back to 2019 after the acquisition, ETF and index AUM, excluding the Q2 have grown from $171 billion or 14% of our overall $1.2 trillion in average AUM in 2019 to $362 billion or 22% of our average AUM of $1.5 trillion in the fourth quarter.\nIn Q2Q, a product we earn no management fees from, but does provide a substantial marketing benefit has tripled in size over this time, going from [ $74 million to $230 million ] or from 6% to 14% of total average AUM. We've also seen very strong growth in global liquidity going from $82 billion or 7% of average AUM to $170 billion or 12% of average AUM in the fourth quarter. These product areas carry lower net revenue yields compared to our overall net revenue yield. During the same time frame, we've seen weaker demand for fundamental equities and multi-asset products, which carry higher net revenue.\nThis has been driven in part by the risk off sentiment that was sparked in early 2022, coupled with the pressure that we experienced in developing markets and global equities as well as the closure of our GTR capabilities. Our fundamental equity portfolio in 2019 was $348 billion or 29% of our average AUM. By the fourth quarter, that portfolio had declined to $261 million or 16% of our average AUM. Multi-asset also declined from 7% to 3% of the average AUM over this time frame. Looking at the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2023, we continue to experience similar dynamics with ETF going from 21% to 22% and the QQQ going from 13% to 14% of average AUM, while fundamental equities declined from 17% to 16% and multi-asset from 4% to 3% of average AUM in the quarter.\nThe result of revenue headwinds created by these dynamics has weighed on our results over the last 4-plus years. While we've experienced excellent organic growth and lower fee capabilities like ETFs and global liquidity was not enough to offset the revenue loss from higher fee fundamental equity and multi-asset outflows. Our overall net revenue yield has declined meaningfully during this time frame, but that decrease has been driven by the shift in our asset mix not degradation in the yields in our investment strategy.\nNet revenue yields by investment strategy have been relatively stable within the ranges provided on the slide. The other point that I want to emphasize is that this multiyear secular shift in client preferences has been increasingly captured in our results. Our portfolio is better diversified today than 4 years ago, and our concentration risk and higher fee fundamental equities and multi-asset products has been reduced.\nThese dynamics, though challenging to manage through as they occur should portend well for future revenue growth and marginal profitability improvement. Independent of market gains. Further, we now have a more diversified business mix, which better positions the firm to navigate various market cycles, events and shifting client demand. Turning to Slide 8. Net revenue of $1.05 billion in the fourth quarter was $62 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2022 and $52 million lower than the third quarter of 2023. The decline from last year was due largely to a $35 million decline in performance fees and the shift in our asset mix that was just discussed.\nThe decline in performance fees was mainly driven by lower fees generated from real estate related and other private market activities. The decline from the prior quarter was primarily due to incremental asset mix shift and lower average assets under management, partially offset by higher performance fees in the quarter. Total adjusted operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $771 million. relatively unchanged from the fourth quarter of last year. Included in fourth quarter 2023 are $22 million related to organizational change expenses and $12 million of Alpha platform related implementation expenses.\nAdjusting for these items, fourth quarter expenses were $32 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2022. Total adjusted operating expenses were $18 million lower than the third quarter. More specifically, looking at employee compensation that has been impacted by the organizational change expenses. Compensation was $26 million lower in the fourth quarter which includes $11 million in expense savings related to the organizational changes that I'll provide more detail on shortly. Marketing expenses of $28 million were $6 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2022 as we continue to tightly manage discretionary spend given the ongoing challenging revenue environment.\nProperty office and technology expenses were flat to last year and $4 million higher than last quarter. G&A was $19 million higher than last quarter as we typically see higher G&A in the fourth quarter.\nWe also had $12 million in spending related to our Alpha platform implementation, higher than the $8 million incurred in the third quarter due to incremental implementation costs in the fourth quarter. Going forward, we expect onetime implementation cost to be approximately $10 million per quarter in 2024 with some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter. We will continue to update our progress on the implementation and related costs as we move forward.\nNow moving to Slide 9. We realized $11 million in expense savings in the fourth quarter related to the organizational changes. On an annualized basis, we have achieved $44 million or nearly 90% of the $50 million in expense savings we expect to realize in 2024. We expect to realize the remaining $6 million in the first quarter. We're not expecting any further significant restructuring costs associated with these efforts.\nThe full benefits from our simplification efforts will be seen over time as we generate revenue growth and margin recovery. As we've discussed, we managed variable compensation to a full year outcome in line with company performance and competitive industry practices. Historically, our compensation to net revenue ratio has been in the 38% to 42% range, trending towards the upper end of the range and periods of revenue decline. At current AUM levels, we would expect the ratio to be at or slightly above the higher end of this range for 2024.\nSeasonally, we see approximately $25 million in higher compensation expenses related to payroll tax and other benefit reset in the first quarter. As a result, we would expect the ratio will exceed 42% during the first half of 2024. Moving to Slide 10. Adjusted operating income was $275 million in the fourth quarter, which included the costs related to organizational changes. Adjusted operating margin was 26.3% for the fourth quarter. Excluding the costs related to organizational changes, fourth quarter operating margin would have been 210 basis points higher.\nEarnings per share was $0.47 in the fourth quarter. Excluding the costs related to organizational changes, fourth quarter earnings per share would have been $0.04 higher. Effective tax rate decreased to 9.9% in the fourth quarter from 23.6% last quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a discrete tax benefit related to the resolution of certain tax matters, favorable tax treatment related to a gain on sale of certain Hong Kong pension sponsorship rights, and the favorable impact of a change in mix of income across tax jurisdictions.\nWe estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 25% for the first quarter of 2024. The actual effective rate can vary due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items. I'll conclude on Slide 11. As stated priority for us is building balance sheet strength. This quarter, our cash balance was $1.5 billion, and we ended the year with nothing drawn on our credit facility. We have lowered our net debt significantly, and it now stands near zero.\nWe have a $600 million senior note maturing on January 30, and we are in a position to redeem the notes at maturity. We estimate we'll have approximately $500 million in excess cash and will draw approximately $100 million on our credit facility to fully redeem the notes. The first quarter is a seasonally high cash usage quarter so we do expect to have a balance on the credit facility at quarter end, which will pay down as we move through the second and third quarters and reach our goal of 0 net debt.\nWe also hope to begin a more regular stock buyback program as we move towards this goal. To conclude, the resiliency of our firm's net flow performance and a difficult market for organic growth is evident again this quarter, and we're pleased with the progress we're making to simplify the organization and build a stronger balance sheet while continuing to invest in key capability areas. We're committed to driving profitable growth and a high level of financial performance, and we have the right strategic positioning to do so. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Invesco's Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nGregory Wade Ketron\n\nSenior VP & MD of IR, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, operator, and to all of you joining us today.

The only authorized webcasts are located on our website. Andrew Schlossberg, President and CEO; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning, and then we'll open up the call for questions. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Ryan Schlossberg\n\nChief Executive Officer, Invesco Perpetual and Head of Invesco’s EMEA Region, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to be speaking with you today. But before I begin my commentary on the quarter, I did want to take a moment to acknowledge the humanitarian crisis in the Middle East. We are deeply saddened by the loss of life and devastation and the impact it's had on civilians across the region. We're on the safety and the well-being of our colleagues and their families, and our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by the heartbreaking recent events.\nBut now turning to the topic of the third quarter earnings. I'll start today's presentation on Slide 3. Volatility and uncertainty continue to define global financial markets with interest rates rising and investors awaiting more clarity from central bankers, there's an extraordinary amount of cash that's been moved to the sidelines where investors can earn acceptable returns while they await more certainty. The slowing and narrowing investor activity has been a near-term challenge for our industry, but it also sets the course for an eventual reallocation and money moving back into higher risk-based assets.\nOur results, which are highlighted on Slide 3, in many ways, reflect these dynamics. However, our unique positioning with deep client relationships, a strong geographic mix and a broad suite of investment solutions helped us deliver positive net long-term inflows in the third quarter. One of the primary contributors to our relative net flow strength is our robust EPF and SMA platforms. Our ETF [ business ] delivered record flows in the third quarter, which were concentrated in our leading factor-based capabilities. It was one of the strongest ETF quarters we have experienced as we continue to gain market share. We captured nearly 3x our industry share of net asset lows to our market share of AUM and importantly, over 3x of our industry share on a revenue flow basis as well.\nAdditionally, we continue to enhance the commercialization of our SMA platform and are seeing strong momentum in flows, particularly within fixed income, where we have posted 12 consecutive quarters of positive net flows despite the challenging market environment. Within these vehicles, we are well positioned to meet the increasing interest around personalization and tax optimization that we're seeing by wealth management clients in both the U.S. and around the world. While areas of growth like ETFs, SMAs and fixed income have been strong for us this year, we continue to see flow pressure in active equities. While headwinds have persisted in this asset class industry-wide, we are beginning to see marked improvement in Invesco, in particular in the global, international and emerging market equity segments.\nIn aggregate, our net outflows in these strategies are significantly lower than what we experienced in 2022 and have stabilized at around $1 billion in outflows each of the last 2 quarters. We continue to put considerable effort into further improving investment quality, product differentiation and client engagement in these capabilities to ensure we are well situated ahead of the eventual renewed demand in these important and higher fee-yielding asset classes. We're going to spend some time on the call today highlighting how we're positioning the firm against shifting investor demand, its impact on our asset mix, net revenue and our net revenue yield and how we're organizing to meet the evolving client demand in both the near and the longer term. As we've outlined previously, we are undertaking a multi-quarter plan to simplify and streamline the organization to position the firm around rapidly evolving client demands.\nOur aim is to operate with more agility, improve our consistency of investment quality, create a more seamless client experience and more efficiently leverage our size and our global scale to enable better outcomes for our clients and drive even greater profitability. We have already made meaningful progress in these areas, and we will continue to execute pace in the coming quarters. Some of the key highlights on the evolved investment platform that we have achieved to date include the following: we've established a unified globally integrated fixed income platform, we're creating a single, highly focused multi-asset group from 3 distinct teams. We're bringing together leadership across our fundamental active equity teams and we're further strengthening our private market platform that spans both real estate and private credit capabilities. Notably, all of these simplification efforts will enable us to more fully take advantage of the benefits of our State Street Alpha platform, as a single global investment operation engine across asset classes.\nOn the product and distribution side of our business, we've also made considerable progress in repositioning growth and efficiency. We've combined our ETF SMA and model portfolios efforts into a single strategy and group. Going forward, we believe that these capabilities will be the leading vehicles of choice for our clients. Our established infrastructure, brand and innovation will enable us to continue to lead and bring both active and passive capabilities to investors in an even more personalized and efficient way. We're also continuing to prune our product line, and we've reduced it by over 150 products in the past year. Further, by globalizing many aspects of our marketing and digital delivery, we're finding opportunities to leverage our scale, simplify our applications, unify our data and use technology to strengthen these capabilities while lowering costs.\nThere are efficiencies to be gained from all of these simplification efforts, which we are beginning to realize, and we will continue to do so over time. However, these efforts are much more or more about -- much more than just expense savings. We view these as drivers of revenue acceleration, which will allow us to improve our investment quality, reallocate our expenses and capital base much more effectively and deliver sustainable profit growth and margin expansion and time.\nMoving ahead to Slide 4. As investors gain greater clarity on inflation and Central Bank interest rate policy, we expect clients to move out of cash and extend their duration profiles of their FICAM allocations into a wider range of strategies. Fixed income is a clear area of strength for Invesco, and we're focused on ensuring we are well positioned to capture what we believe will be an outsized share of this reallocation. As you can see on this slide, our $500 billion plus fixed income platform has strong investment performance, requisite scale, diversity across asset classes and client geography, it spans public and private investments and it has a robust offering of both active and passive products. The globally integrated institutional quality platform has been a consistently strong grower for Invesco, having posted long-term net flows over the previous 18 quarters and its very strong top-tier investment returns across a wide range of fixed income capabilities.\nA few highlights to note on our favorable position that are on the page include our global liquidity capabilities, which have grown AUM by over 150% over the past 5 years, and we're now squarely in the top 10 of institutional money fund managers in the top 5 amongst nonbank-owned providers. Our stable value capability is well placed in DC platforms and ranks as a top manager in the U.S. institutional marketplace. Our municipal capabilities rank in the top 5 largest among mutual fund managers in the U.S. and #2 amongst high-yield muni fund managers. Within our investment-grade capabilities, our relative performance has been improving since the recent mini banking crisis and our long-term performance strength has helped us nearly double our AUM in the past 5 years. Furthermore, our global and emerging markets fixed income capabilities of stellar performance and are very well placed for growth in the U.K., European and Asian institutional and retail markets.\nAnd finally, we believe that significant opportunity exists for even greater expansion of our fixed income ETFs and bank loan capabilities which are too notable strengths of Invesco. So against the backdrop where clients are seeking to work with fewer asset managers to meet the breadth of investment requirements, fixed income is clearly an area of our business that is poised to continue to gain market share and drive even greater profitability as the eventual rotation beyond cash unfolds.\nFinally, and before I turn the call over to Allison, I want to take a moment to highlight on Slide 5, another important piece of the Invesco investment thesis, our strategic relationship with MassMutual. Our engagement with MassMutual has many facets that create a meaningful, mutually beneficial strategic relationship. First, MassMutual is one of our largest investors as both a common equity and preferred shareholder. So we're mutually aligned to delivering profitable growth and long-term success against the backdrop of an evolving industry. MassMutual is also a significant investor over the past years and supporting many of our newly launched private market and other key strategies with a total of $3.5 billion of commitments.\nNotably, this is 3 to 4x the multiple of seating of our own products on our own balance sheet. MassMutual has significantly increased their commitments since the inception of our relationship, and this is meaningfully bolstering our growth trajectory in our private markets business both institutionally and in our wealth management channels where early access to capital is paramount to setting the course for growth.\nFinally, we work closely with MassMutual on behalf of their clients and we are pleased to be a third party manager of $9 billion of assets through their insurance and broker-dealer channels, where we ranked the largest sub-advised and defined contribution investment-only manager on the MassMutual platform.\nTo summarize, this is a powerful and important relationship for Invesco with significant potential ahead. We continue to explore avenues with MassMutual to make this relationship even more meaningful in the future. With that, let me turn the call over to Allison for a closer look at our results, and I look forward to your questions.\n\nAllison Dukes\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 6 with investment performance. Overall, our investment performance was solid in the third quarter with 67% and 65% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers are beating benchmark on both a 3-year and a 5-year basis, respectively. This is in line with those time frames in the second quarter. We did see investment permits improved considerably on a 1-year basis, going from 67% in the second quarter to 70% in the third quarter, reflective of the improved investment performance we are seeing across several categories, including global and international equities and alternatives. As Andrew noted, we have excellent performance in fixed income across nearly all capabilities and time horizons, an important fact given our strong conviction and our ability to attract flows as investors deploy money into these strategies.\nTurning to Slide 7. AUM was $1.49 trillion at the end of the third quarter, $51 billion lower than last quarter. The quarter began with what appeared to be a continuation of a recovery in markets, albeit uneven that we saw in the second quarter. However, that quickly shifted to a risk of posture again as the quarter progressed and uncertainty grew, marking another volatile quarter for markets worldwide. Market declines, coupled with foreign exchange movements, drove the decline in AUM. Despite the market volatility, we did generate $2.6 billion in net long-term flows, and we expect we will outperform peers in what has been a very difficult environment for organic asset growth. Client demand for passive capabilities remain strong as we garnered $13.5 billion of net long-term inflows during the quarter. ETF inflows were $11.8 billion, marking one of our best quarters for ETFs. Our SMB 500 Equal Weight Index funds led the quarter with $3.6 billion of net long-term input.\nThis ETF is also our leading flow driver year-to-date, with our newer QQQM, drawing the second highest flows in our ETF suite year-to-date. The QQQM was launched 3 years ago and has attracted $14 billion of AUM since inception, now making it our fourth largest ETF. We've demonstrated the ability to sustain growth in ETFs throughout the full market cycle with organic growth in 12 of the past 13 quarters. We also saw solid growth in our index strategies with $2.3 billion in net long-term flows for the quarter. Offsetting some of the growth in passive was $10.9 billion of net outflows in active strategies. Contributing to the outflows was a single sizable redemption in our global targeted return strategy. This strategy has been in significant outflows for several years and now has less than $1 billion remaining in the fund.\nIn September, we announced plans to close the fund and focus on other capabilities within our multi-asset franchise where we are seeing stronger client demand. Our global active equities, which includes the developing market funds were also drivers of net outflows in this quarter. The level of outflows from this investment class has moderated after significantly elevated redemptions in the second half of 2022. Looking at flows by channel. The retail channel generated $4.3 billion of net long-term inflows while the institutional channel had $1.7 billion of net long-term outflows. This was driven by the global target of returns redemption. Outside of this redemption, we would have had $800 million in institutional inflows for the quarter.\nMoving to Slide 8 and closed by geography. Asia Pacific delivered net long-term inflows of $2.8 billion due to growth in Japan, which offset outflows in Greater China during the quarter. In Japan, we experienced another quarter of strong growth with our Henley Global Equity and income funds, guarding $1.8 billion of net inflows from Japanese clients making it a top-selling retail fund for the industry in Japan on both a quarterly and a year-to-date basis. We are well positioned in Japanese -- as Japanese markets are experiencing some of the most constructive conditions for risk on assets in many years, including favorable new regulations.\nAfter resuming organic growth in the second quarter, our business in Greater China experienced net long-term outflows of $1.9 billion for the quarter. The outflows in our China JV were $1.7 billion. Outflows were concentrated in fixed income, where continued weak market sentiment and interest rate tightening has led to diminished growth across the industry this year. However, as China's economy recovers, Invesco is extremely well positioned to capture additional share in the world's fastest-growing market.\nTurning to flows by asset class. Equities generated $7.4 billion in net long-term inflows, mainly driven by the strong growth in EPS. The $2.4 billion in outflows in alternatives was largely driven by the previously mentioned single client global targeted returns [ redemption ]. Excluding this redemption, alternatives were in flight inflows of $100 million. We have a good track record in our private markets platform within alternatives and are well positioned to capture long-term flows in this asset class as client demand shifts to these strategies. We have over $6 billion of dry powder to capitalize on opportunities emerging from the market dislocation of the last several quarters, but greater market clarity will be required for this opportunity to meaningfully materialize.\nFixed income net long-term flows turned modestly negative with $1.3 billion of net outflows with growth in investment grade, SMAs and global debt, offset by the outflows experienced in China. As Andrew outlined, we like our position in this space and believe we are well positioned to capture flows as investors put more money to work in fixed income products. We have the track record to support our conviction with 18 straight quarters of net inflows prior to this quarter.\nMoving to Slide 9. We've provided additional insight into our portfolio and the trends driving our revenue profile. Secular shifts in client demand across the asset management industry, coupled with more recent market dynamics, have significantly altered our asset mix since the acquisition of Oppenheimer Funds. As you'll note, ETF and index AUM, and this excludes the QQQ, have grown from $171 million or 14% of our overall $1.2 trillion in AUM in 2019 to $318 million or 21% of our nearly $1.5 trillion of AUM in the third quarter. We've also seen very strong growth in Asia Pacific, driven primarily by our success in China. During the same time frame, we've seen weaker demand for fundamental equities, driven in part by the risk off sentiment that was sparked in early 2022, coupled with the pressure we experienced in developing markets and global equity as well as the closure of our GTR capabilities.\nOur fundamental equity portfolio in 2019 was $348 billion or 29% of our AUM. At the end of the third quarter, that portfolio was $242 million or $0.16 of our AUM. The result of revenue headwinds created by these dynamics has weighed on our results over the last 2 years. While we have experienced excellent organic growth and lower fee capabilities like ETFs and liquidity, it was not enough to offset the revenue loss from higher fee fundamental equity outflows and market depreciation. Our overall net revenue yield has declined significantly during this time frame, but that decrease has been driven by the shift in our asset mix, not degradation in the yields of our investment strategies. Net revenue yields by investment strategy have been relatively stable within the ranges provided on the slides.\nThe other point I want to emphasize is that this multiyear secular shift in client preferences have been increasingly captured in our results. Our portfolio is better diversified today than 4 years ago, and our concentration risk and higher fee fundamental equity has been reduced. These dynamics though challenging to manage through as they occur, should portend well for future revenue trends and marginal profitability improvement, independent of market improvement. Further, we now have a more diversified business mix, which better positions the firm to navigate various market cycles events and shifting client demand.\nTurning to Slide 10. Net revenues of $1.1 billion in the third quarter was $12 million lower than the third quarter of 2022 and $7 million or 1% higher than the second quarter. The decline from the third quarter of last year was due largely shift in our asset mix that was just discussed. Total adjusted operating expenses in the third quarter were $789 million, $48 million higher than the third quarter of 2022 and unchanged from the prior quarter. Included in our third quarter operating expenses were $39 million of compensation expenses related to the organizational changes we are making to position the firm for greater scale and profitability as we grow our revenue base. In the second quarter, we had $27 million of compensation expenses related mainly to executive retirements. The full benefits from our simplification efforts will be seen over time as we generate revenue growth and margin recovery.\nTo this point, we have identified $50 million of annual run rate expense savings that will be realized by the beginning of 2024. The restructuring costs associated with these efforts were $39 million in the third quarter as we accelerated several of the reorganization activities that we were undertaking into the quarter. Next quarter, fourth quarter, we expect an incremental $15 million to $20 million of expense associated with these efforts, bringing the total expense associated with the efforts to $55 million to $60 million. As we've discussed, we managed variable compensation to a full year outcome in line with company performance and competitive industry practices. Historically, our compensation to net revenue ratio has been in the 38% to 42% range, trending towards the upper end of that range and periods of revenue decline.\nAt current AUM levels, we would expect the ratio to be slightly above the high end of the range for 2023 when excluding the cost pertaining to executive retirements and other organizational changes. Marketing expenses of $27 million were $6 million lower than the prior quarter and $3 million lower than the third quarter of last year as we continue to tightly manage discretionary spend given the ongoing challenging revenue environment. Property, office and technology expenses were relatively unchanged as compared to last quarter and the third quarter of last year. Another area in which we are diligently managing expenses as G&A. G&A expenses of $108 million in the quarter were down $6 million from the prior quarter. Compared to the third quarter last year, G&A expenses increased $2 million.\nHowever, the third quarter of this year includes $8 million in spending on our Alpha platform, which prior to the second quarter of this year was included in transaction integration and restructuring expenses. We expect quarterly average spending on our Alpha platform to remain near this level for the next few quarters.\nMoving to Slide 11. Adjusted operating income was $309 million in the third quarter which included the costs related to organizational changes. Adjusted operating margin was 28.2% for the third quarter. But excluding the costs related to the organizational changes, third quarter operating margin would have been 350 basis points higher. Earnings per share was $0.35 in the third quarter. Excluding the expenses related to the org changes, third quarter earnings per share would have been $0.07 higher. The effective tax rate was 23.6% in the third quarter. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 25% for the fourth quarter of 2023. The actual effective rate can vary due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items.\nI'll finish up on Slide 12. Stated priority, where I'm pleased to say that we've made significant progress in building balance sheet strength. This quarter, our cash balance exceeded $1.2 billion. We've lowered our net debt significantly, and it now stands at less than $250 million. I'm pleased with the improvement we've made on the balance sheet as we continue to work to bring net debt excluding the preferred shares down to 0 by the second half of next year. Our leverage ratio, as defined under our credit facility agreement was 0.7x at the end of the third quarter. We have an opportunity to further address outstanding debt with the maturity of the $600 million in senior notes at the end of this January. We ended the third quarter with 0 drawn on the credit facility.\nTo conclude, the resiliency of our firm's net flow performance in a difficult environment for organic growth is evident again this quarter, and I'm pleased with the progress we're making to simplify the organization and build a stronger balance sheet while continuing to invest in key capability areas. We're committed to driving profitable growth and a high level of financial performance. We have the right strategic positioning to do so. And with that, I'll ask the operator to go ahead and open it up to Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] This call will last 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is also being recorded.\nNow I'd like to turn today's meeting to your host, Mr. Greg Ketron, Invesco's Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nGregory Wade Ketron\n\nSenior VP & MD of IR, Synchrony Financial\n\nOkay. Thanks, operator, and to all of you join us on Invesco's quarterly earnings call.

Andrew Schlossberg, President and CEO; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning, and then we'll open the call up for questions. First, however, I'd like to turn the call over to Marty Flanagan, Chairman Emeritus, who retired as CEO on June 30 after 18 years to provide a few comments before we get into the second quarter results. Marty?\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Greg. And before I turn the call over to Andrew and Allison, I want to say it's been a pleasure to work with all of you over the years. It's really been an exciting, challenging or participate in a fascinating industry that has continued to evolve and change, but always seeking to create better outcomes for clients and shareholders.\nOver the years, I've learned from my engagement all of you, all the key stakeholders, clients, analysts and shareholders, which has been instrumental in the success of Invesco. I'm immensely proud of the organization and the talented people around the world that make Invesco what it is. There's a tremendous opportunity for the [indiscernible] fund going forward.\nInvestor has the right strategy to right team leading this organization into the future while navigating a challenging current market [indiscernible]. The reality is that the strategies across firms in our industry are not very different. What separates winners and losers are those organizations that can execute effectively across all cycles and market conditions.\nAndrew, Allison and the rest of the executive leadership team and our broader senior leadership team, perusing the most talented and experienced team Invesco's ever had. Their laser focus on accelerating the growth strategy and making the necessary changes for the benefit of clients and shareholders. This is a team very well prepared and knows how to execute and deliver for all stakeholders.\nI'm confident in Andrew's and the leadership team's ability to achieve the full potential, and I look forward to seeing the firm to do great things in the years ahead. Thank you.\nAndrew, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nAndrew Ryan Schlossberg\n\nChief Executive Officer, Invesco Perpetual and Head of Invesco’s EMEA Region, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThanks very much, Marty, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to be speaking with you today, and I look forward to continuing to work with all of you on the call. It's an absolute privilege to lead a global investment management organization built with such a solid client-centered foundation and which possesses significant potential as we focus on delivering value for clients while innovating to meet their evolving needs.\nWe have exceptional talent, robust investment capabilities, deep relationships with clients and a strong presence in key markets across the globe, all of which positions us well to stay in front of and lead during a period of growth and change in the asset management industry. At our core, we will be focused on delivering investment excellence for our clients.\nWhile we're pleased to have a strong foundation, we're not at all satisfied with our results to date and we're committed to improving our performance by simplifying our organizational model, aligning our expense base, strengthening our strategic focus, being agile and innovative in advancing our use of technology and executing at pace. We believe this will lead to outstanding client experience, attraction and retention of top talent and an enhanced ability to generate profitable growth for the future.\nI could not be more confident in the talented, experienced and collaborative team we have in place to take advantage of opportunities in the market and address the challenges confronting our clients and our industry. I want to again thank Marty for his visionary leadership that has provided Invesco, the foundation to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead. With that, I'll start today's presentation of second quarter results on Slide 3 for those following along.\nIn the second quarter, financial markets showed signs of recovery even as investors continue to grapple with significant uncertainty. Recovery was uneven across sectors and geographies and while the headline moves in market indices were positive, the underlying client environment continues to be relatively cautious given the uncertain economic backdrop. Market gains were narrowly distributed U.S. equity market increases were concentrated in large-cap technology stocks, while non-U.S. equity markets, most notably emerging international and China as well as most long-dated bond index returns were flat or negative.\nClient actions in the quarter remained risk off, resulting in slower industry growth and long-term assets while cash strategies continue to account for a historically large proportion of client portfolios. We did see an uptick in investor appetite for risk assets in June, providing some optimism for a broader recovery on the horizon.\nAcross our investment platform, performance is steadily improving in several of our key global equity capabilities and our fixed income performance remains robust across the board. Building on the delivery and quality of investment performance remains a key focus for me and for the management team.\nFrom an asset flow perspective, in the second quarter, Invesco's diversified business continues to deliver for our clients and prove resilient against market and industry challenges with sustained organic growth in several key capability areas where there is continued high client demand. The largest driver of growth in the quarter was our global ETF business. Net long-term inflows accelerated to $5.7 billion, more than double the growth we experienced in the first quarter and higher than our AUM market share.\nOur ETF capabilities have demonstrated the ability to sustain growth through the full market cycle with organic growth in 11 of the past 12 quarters. Our business maintains a revenue profile that is differentiated from competitors with the concentration of strategies, including things like alternative beta, commodities, senior loans and laddered maturity products. I'm also pleased to note that our business in Greater China returned to organic growth this quarter with $1.6 billion in net long-term inflows. While the higher fixed income redemptions the industry experienced earlier this year have abated, organic growth in China's asset management industry has remained slower so far this year and overall assets raised by new fund launches across the industry sent to their lowest levels since 2019.\nDespite this, Invesco Great Wall raised $1.4 billion from 6 new product launches in the second quarter, which ranked us fifth amongst all asset managers in China, which is well above our overall #12 ranking in that market. As the China economy recovers, we are extremely well positioned to capture additional market share in the world's fastest-growing asset management market. Client preferences for risk-off assets did continue to benefit our fixed income franchise across both institutional and retail channels, including mutual funds and SMAs.\nWe generated a positive $1 billion in net long-term fixed income flows this quarter, extending our streak to 18 consecutive positive flow quarters. Our money market business continues to show strong growth and market share gains. We brought in $15 billion of net new assets this quarter, and we've moved into the top 10 of money market managers in the U.S. institutional channel. We expect our overall fixed income franchise to continue to grow and benefit from our strong investment performance and the greater clarity we expect on the horizon as the interest rate picture becomes more clear in coming quarters.\nWithin active equity strategies, we did experience net long-term outflows of $4.5 billion in the second quarter, global and emerging market equities, where client demand has been slow to recover, and industry flows remain negative. This accounted for nearly 70% of our active equity net outflows. While headwinds have persisted in the asset class, net outflows for Invesco in developing markets were $1.2 billion. This is consistent with our experience last quarter, but meaningfully lower than last year. I'm optimistic for further stabilization of net flows in these key investment strategies as performance continues to improve and when client demand for risk on assets returns.\nAs we discussed on our last earnings call, growth in private markets has been more challenging this year due to overall market conditions, and we experienced $1.7 billion in net outflows in these areas during the second quarter. Despite the near-term headwinds, we have an excellent track record in both private real estate and private credit sectors, and we're well positioned to capture long-term growth in these asset classes, particularly in the underpenetrated wealth management channels in both the U.S. and globally.\nWe expect our private markets and alternative capabilities to be an engine of growth in our future years and Allison is going to provide much more color on that business later in her comments. From a client and channel perspective, retail and wealth management flows were modestly positive in the second quarter, while our institutional channel had $2.2 billion in net outflows. This is the first outflow quarter in 3 years. And this comes following an especially strong quarter for fundings in the first quarter, where we had $6.6 billion of net inflows.\nAs Allison will discuss later, our pipeline remains robust and a significant portion of our one-not-funded mandates are in higher fielding equity and alternative strategies. The longer-term growth of our institutional channels is a testament to our strength of that business and the depth of our client relationships that we have built over many years. As such, I am confident that we will again see robust growth in this channel as client caution abates and as reallocations begin to occur across this industry -- this part of the industry. Building balance sheet strength, continuing to invest in key growth areas and returning shareholders -- returning capital to shareholders are top priorities for us.\nTo that end, I'm pleased to note that in the first half of June, we repurchased $150 million in common stock. We are able to capitalize on an attractive valuation because of the strong balance sheet position that the firm has worked hard to build over the last several years. We are determined to continue to build on that progress. We're also committed to driving a high level of financial performance in Invesco. We will keep our clients and service levels front and center while also striving for accelerated profit growth.\nThe leadership changes we announced in February have put us in a position to unlock more opportunity for the [ firm ], and we continue to implement related organizational ranges in the second quarter. We're taking action to simplify the company and eliminate sources of complexity that were necessary in the past but may no longer be appropriate today. This will help us shift investment to our strategic priorities and areas of growth while ensuring our clients continue to receive investment quality and the exceptional service that's 1 of the hallmarks of Invesco. The primary benefits of these changes will be seen over time as revenue growth recovers and we take advantage of our further scale. At the same time, we're taking actions that will enhance our near-term profitability and have identified an initial set of cost savings.\nWork will continue to identify and action additional efficiencies and enhancement opportunities and Allison is going to provide further detail on those efforts shortly. Although there is lots of work to do, Invesco is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities and address the challenges confronting the marketplace. I could not be more confident in the team that we have in place to execute on the opportunities that Marty created over his 18 years as CEO of Invesco.\nWith that, I'm going to turn the call over to Allison for a closer look at our results, and I look forward to your questions.\n\nAllison Dukes\n\nThank you, Andrew, and I also want to convey my appreciation to Marty for his leadership. Good morning to everybody joining us today. I'm going to begin on Slide 4. Overall investment performance improved in the second quarter with 66% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or beating benchmark on both a 3-year and a 5-year basis.\nThis is an improvement from 64% for both time frames in the first quarter. We have excellent performance in fixed income across nearly all capabilities and time horizons. Performance lagged benchmark in certain U.S. core and gross equity funds. Performance in global and emerging markets equities has been a headwind, but we're encouraged to see steady and meaningful improvement emerging in this asset class.\nTurning to Slide 5. AUM was $1.54 trillion at the end of the second quarter, which was $55 billion higher than the last quarter. Technology stock surged in the second quarter, and as a result, QQQ AUM reached $200 billion, an increase of $27 billion as compared to the end of the first quarter. Market increases and additional products, foreign exchange movements and reinvested dividends combined to increase assets under management by a further $15 billion.\n[ Bet ] in Fed in the money market products were [ $15 ] billion, and net long-term outflows were $2 billion. Despite the net long-term outflows for the quarter, we exited the quarter with strong momentum after more than $2 billion of net inflows for the month of June. We expect that we outperformed most peers on a net flow basis, another data point demonstrating the value of our breadth of capabilities in a difficult environment for our organic asset growth.\nClient demand for passive capabilities was strong. And as a result, we garnered $6.4 billion of net long-term inflows in the second quarter. Offsetting the growth in asset was $8.4 billion of net outflows and active strategies. Through growth in our key capability areas, we are recapturing client demand as it moves to favored capabilities led this quarter by growth in ETF and our business in Greater China.\nOur global ETF franchise delivered a strong quarter, growing at a 9% annualized organic growth rate with $5.7 billion of net inflows. Our top-selling ETFs included the S&P 500 Equal Weight and the QQQM, which grew over $13 [ million ] in AUM after posting $3.3 billion net influx. Innovation remains a key strength in this area, the QQQM, which was launched less than 3 years ago, now representing the fifth largest ETF in our lineup. Currency and commodity ETFs, part of our alternative asset class experienced net outflows of $1.1 billion during the quarter. We delivered net inflows of $200 million from retail clients in the second quarter, an improvement from $3.7 billion in net outflows in the prior quarter. A rebound in Asia Pacific net flows was the primary driver of growth.\nMore specifically, we've experienced strong growth in Japan for several quarters now, ending the second quarter with $54 [ million ] of AUM. Our Henley Global Equity and income fund garnered $1.6 billion of net inflows from Japanese clients, making it the top selling retail fund in Japan on both a quarterly and year-to-date basis. Moving forward, we are well positioned in this important market and Japanese markets are experiencing some of the most constructive conditions for risk on assets in many years.\nOffsetting growth in the retail channel was $2.2 billion of net long-term outflows in the institutional channel, primarily in the Americas. The channel remains in net inflows year-to-date after $6.6 billion of net inflows in the first quarter. Further, we have a robust and diversified one-not-funded pipeline.\nMoving to Slide 6. Net long-term inflows resumed in Asia Pacific with $1.5 billion in the second quarter due to the growth I just discussed in Japan and a rebound to net inflows in our China joint venture. Net outflows were modestly negative in the Americas and in EMEA. Looking at flows by asset class. Fixed income capabilities experienced net inflows for the 18th straight quarter with $1 billion.\nDrivers of growth this quarter included China, where we launched an institutional fixed income product and our tax-managed SMA capability, partially offset by net outflows in EMEA ETFs. Net outflows in global and emerging market equities continued to be a headwind in the second quarter with $3 billion of net outflows, including $1.2 billion from our emerging market [ spot ]. Encouragingly, this is similar to the net outflows experienced last quarter from emerging markets and below the redemption rates we experienced last year. We're optimistic that headwinds appear to be further diminishing in emerging markets.\nAlternative net outflows were $3.4 billion in the second quarter. Public alternatives accounted for $1.9 billion with $1.1 billion concentrated in commodity and currency ETFs as commodities have been out of favor across the industry in recent quarters. Private markets net outflows were $1.5 billion, inclusive of $1 billion of net outflows in direct real estate strategies.\nAs we move to Slide 7, I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight our global alternative platform, which had $182 billion in assets under management as of June 30. Although market conditions have made it a challenging year for organic growth in the asset class, we have high conviction that alternatives will be 1 of the key pillars of our long-term success.\nWithin alternatives, we have a diverse range of capabilities. including $72 billion of public alternatives, spanning commodity strategies, listed real estate and hedged and macro strategy. Real estate is the largest component of our private alternatives platform, with $72 billion in direct real estate AUMs at the end of second quarter. Invesco competes throughout the capital stack by investing in direct real estate and originating real estate debt.\nOur direct real estate business offers a range of investment styles, including core and core+ strategies as well as funds with higher return strategies. Our private credit platform is the second component of our private alternatives business with $38 billion in assets under management, anchored by our bank loan capability that holds U.S. and European securities. We have over 30 years of experience managing senior corporate loans, relationships with over 2,000 unique companies and more than 200 private equity firms. More recently, we began to offer direct lending to middle-market companies as well as opportunistic investments in special situations and distressed credit.\nOn Slide 8, we want to provide a deeper look at our direct real estate portfolio, where we have [ 40 ] years of experience investing on behalf of our clients worldwide. Our direct real estate holdings are well diversified by product property type. Commercial office properties comprise about 35% of our AUM. Apartments and other residential properties account for approximately 23%. And the AUM share of industrial properties, about 22% at the end of the second quarter. The final 20% of our AUM is invested in retail and specialty sectors, including mixed-use developments, self-storage and medical.\nFocusing on office properties specifically, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we've been deliberately managing our exposure down, particularly in the Americas and EMEA as market dynamics have shifted with attitudes towards remote work. In the first quarter of 2020, 42% of our institutional open-end AUM and core and core+ strategies was comprised of traditional office properties. At the end of the second quarter, it was 27%, and our exposure in the Americas was reduced by about 1/3. Several of our direct real estate funds use leverage but were measured in our approach and the average loan-to-value across our direct real estate funds was approximately 35% as of March 31, 2023.\nThese figures may fluctuate over time and vary across specific funds. We serve our clients through a range of vehicle types and manage liquidity in accordance with the established bylaws of each fund. Approximately half of our AUM is in institutional separate accounts or closed-end funds with a predetermined life. The remainder in open-end vehicles that manage redemptions on a best effort basis. In our open-end funds, redemption requests go into a queue and are mainly met by net investors into the fund. Investors in our open-end strategies are highly sophisticated institutional investors that understand it may take several quarters to work down a redemption queue while preserving the fund performance for all investors.\nOf our full business cycle, we would expect funds to average a redemption queue of 5% to 6% of NAV. This can fluctuate higher in times of market volatility like we've been experiencing recently. As of the end of the second quarter, all of our open-end funds were operating according to normal redemption protocols and our real estate teams have successfully navigated market cycles for 4 decades. Real estate activity has been slower during the first half of 2023, and we would expect activity to be muted in the near term until market conditions improve.\nIn the long run, we expect that investor demand for private market capabilities will grow significantly, and we're well positioned to capitalize on that growth. Let's all move to Slide 9. Our institutional pipeline was $22 billion at quarter end, consistent with last quarter. Although we experienced net outflows in the second quarter, our institutional business remains in net inflows for the year-to-date, and we continue to win new mandates. Our pipelines have been running in the [ mid-20 ] to mid-$30 billion range, dating back to late 2019.\nSo this is on the lower end of that range. We view our pipeline as strong given the market volatility we've been experiencing and the $6.6 billion in net inflows that occurred in the first quarter. As we've noted previously, some mandates are taking longer to fund in this environment, we would estimate the funding cycle of our pipeline is running in the 3 to 4 quarter range versus 2 to 3 quarters prior to the market [ doubter ].\nOur solutions capability enabled 35% of the global institutional pipeline in second quarter and we're pleased to see the share increase from 14% last quarter. We embed solutions into our client interactions, and we have ongoing engagements about new opportunities. The pipeline reflects a diverse business mix with alternative and active equity accounting for 40% of the total associated assets.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Net revenue of $1.09 billion in the second quarter was $83 million lower than the second quarter of 2022 and $15 million or 1% higher than the first quarter. The decline from the second quarter of last year was due largely to lower investment management fees, driven by asset mix favoring lower-yielding strategies. The sequential quarter increase was primarily due to higher performance fees earned on private real estate mandates, a $4 million decline in other revenues partially offset the increase in performance fees.\nA shift in asset mix has had a meaningful impact on our revenue due to the uneven performance across key market indices as well as investor preferences for passive and risk of strategies, including demand for money market products. Total average AUM for the second quarter, $1.49 trillion, with $32 billion or 2% higher than the first quarter. However, $25 billion of the increase was in QQQ average AUMs for which we do not earn management fees. A further $4 million of the increase was in money market AUM.\nMeanwhile, average passive AUM ex-QQQ was up $3 billion and average active AUM was flat to last quarter. As compared to the second quarter of 2022, total average AUM increased by $38 [ million ] or 3%. The primary driver was a $58 [ billion ] increase in average money market AUM and given the risk of investor sentiment of the past 12 months. Average assets in the QQQ were $12 billion higher than the second quarter of 2022.\nAverage passive AUM, excluding the Qs, increased by $9 [ million ], while average active AUM declined by 5%. We believe that a meaningful portion of the asset mix shift that has occurred is a product of market movements and risk of cinema, and those pressures should abate as preference for risk assets, returns and conditions improve. That said, growth in investor preference for passive exposure and solutions capabilities is a long-term secular trend, and we continue to reposition our cost base to align with changes in our business mix as we build greater scale in key capability areas. Total adjusted operating expenses in the second quarter were $789 million, $27 million higher than the second quarter of 2022 and an increase of $40 million from the prior quarter.\nIncluded in our second quarter operating expenses were $27 million of compensation expenses related to executive retirements and organizational changes. In the second quarter of 2022 expenses of this nature were not included in our non-GAAP results as they were included in transaction, integration and restructuring expenses. We recognized $13 million of such expenses in the first quarter of 2023. Also impacting second quarter compensation expense with higher incentive pay on $22 million of performance fees partially offset by a seasonal decline in payroll taxes.\nAs Andrew noted, we are simplifying the organization to position the firm for greater scale and profitability as we grow our revenue base. The majority of the $27 million of compensation expense I mentioned was related to executive retirements and the balance was a result of other organizational actions taken in the quarter. We will action further adjustments to our operating model over the remainder of 2023 and would expect to recognize approximately $20 million of additional costs associated with these decisions in the third quarter. The full benefits from our simplification efforts will be seen over time as we generate revenue growth and margin recovery. To this point, we have identified $50 million of annual run rate expense savings that will be realized by the beginning of 2024.\nWork is ongoing to quantify and action additional opportunities, and we will keep you informed on our progress. As we've discussed, we managed variable compensation to a full year outcome in line with company performance and competitive industry practices. Historically, our compensation to net revenue ratio has been in the 38% to 42% range, trending towards the upper end of that range and periods of revenue decline. At current AUM levels, we would expect the ratio to continue to be at or slightly above the high end of the range for 2023, when excluding the cost pertaining to executive retirements and other organizational changes.\nMarketing expenses of $32 million, $4 million higher than the prior quarter, indicative of the seasonally higher activity we typically see in second quarter. Marketing expenses were $4 million lower than the second quarter of last year as we are tightly managing discretionary spend in this revenue environment. Property, office and technology expenses were $2 million higher than the first quarter primarily due to higher software costs, partially offset by the end of overlapping rent now that we have completed the move to our new Atlanta headquarters.\nG&A expenses of $114 million increased $19 million from the prior quarter. Second quarter expenses included approximately $7 million in spending on our Alpha NextGen program, which was previously included in transaction, integration and restructuring expenses. Going forward, these costs will be reflected in our non-GAAP results. We would expect quarterly average spending on Alpha NextGen to remain at the same level for the next few quarters. As we mentioned on our last call, we benefited from indirect tax credits in the first quarter, a reduction in credits received drove a $3 million increase in expenses quarter-over-quarter.\nThe remaining increase in G&A expenses related to higher project spending for ongoing technology improvement initiatives as well as normal fluctuation that we can see in G&A period to period after relatively lower spending in Q1. Looking ahead, we expect G&A expenses in the third quarter to be flat to modestly lower than the second quarter. We're balancing continued investment in our key growth areas and technology programs while diligently managing discretionary spend, and we are limiting hiring to key growth areas and critical positions. We've also been increasing our use of lower cost locations where it makes sense to do so. As an executive leadership team, we are committed to driving profitable growth in the coming quarters.\nMoving to Slide 11. Adjusted operating income was $302 million in the second quarter, which included the costs related to executive retirements and other organizational changes. Adjusted operating margin was 27.7% for the second quarter. Excluding the costs related to retirement and other org changes, second quarter operating margin would have been 250 basis points higher.\nEarnings per share was $0.31 in the second quarter, excluding those same expenses related to executive retirement and organizational changes, second quarter earnings per share would have been $0.05 higher. The effective tax rate was 24.7% in the second quarter. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 25% for the third quarter of 2023.\nThe actual effective rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items. I'll finish on Slide 12. Building balance sheet strength has been an unwavering priority, and I'm pleased to note that our cash balance increased in the second quarter to $1.01 billion, and that with $1.5 billion of outstanding debt that lowered our net debt to less than $500 million.\nWe were able to achieve this reduction in net debt while also repurchasing $150 million of common stock in the quarter, or 9.6 million shares, equivalent to 2% of the total common shares outstanding. The share buybacks occurred at an average price of $15.65, which we viewed as a very attractive opportunity. The improvements we have made on the balance sheet in the past several years facilitated our ability to take advantage of this opportunity. Our leverage ratio, as defined under our credit facility agreement was 0.7x at the end of the second quarter modestly lower than last quarter.\nWe are committed to building an even stronger balance sheet, and our goal is to bring net debt excluding the preferred shares down to zero in 2024. We have an opportunity to further address outstanding debt with the maturity of the $600 million in senior notes at the end of January. We ended the second quarter with nothing drawn on our revolving credit facility. To conclude the resiliency of our firm's net flows performance in a difficult market for organic growth is evident again this quarter, and I'm pleased with the progress we're making to simplify the organization and build a stronger balance sheet while continuing to invest in key capability areas.\nAs a firm, we're committed to driving profitable growth and a high level of financial performance, and we're confident that we have the right talent, mindset and strategic positioning to do so. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line to Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Invesco's Head of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.\n\nGregory Wade Ketron\n\nSenior VP & MD of IR, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, operator, and all of you joining us on the call today. In addition to the press release, we've provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address today. Press release and presentation are available on our website, invesco.com. This information can be found by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.\nOur presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slide 2 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix of the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP.\nFinally, Invesco's [ net ] response before does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings call transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcast are located on our website.\nMarty Flanagan, President and CEO; Andrew Schlossberg, Invesco's Head of Americas and who will become President and CEO upon Martin's retirement on June 30 of this year; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer will present our results this morning. After we complete the presentation, we will open up the call for questions.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Martin.\n\nMartin L. Flanagan\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThank you, Greg. And I'm going to start on Page 3, which is the highlights for the first quarter, if you want to follow along.\nThe early part of 2023, provided investors and money managers reason for modest optimism as most major financial markets gained ground in that period, partially offsetting the significant declines we saw last year. Inflationary pressures showed some sign of easing. And the COVID-19 pandemic, at long last, looks behind us.\nThat said, heightened level of volatility persists, and the financial markets reacted with caution in March as we experienced several bank failures during that period. Investors, once again, [ seeked ] safety and risk-off assets, and net flows across the industry were pressured again.\nAlthough organic growth remains lower across our industry, Invesco [ supersized ] platform generated $2.9 billion net inflows in the first quarter, margin returned to organic growth. This progress is especially significant, considering the mix flow picture for the industry overall during the quarter.\nGrowth this quarter was driven by areas in which we've invested for years and have been intentional in cultivating deep client relationships. Fixed income capabilities, the institutional channel, ETFs, all experienced strong net inflows during the quarter. Each of these areas has demonstrated Invesco's ability to sustain growth throughout the full market cycle.\nFixed income delivered net flows for the 17th straight quarter, while the institutional channel has now been in net flows for 14 straight quarters.\nAs we'll discuss later, our pipeline remains strong for telling well for future growth. Our solutions business helped drive the institutional business to net long-term inflows of $6.6 billion in the quarter.\nMeanwhile, net long-term flows in ETF vehicles have now been positive 10 out of 11 last quarters. Growth in the ETF business is broad-based with net inflows this quarter, both equity and fixed income strategies. I'm confident that when investor appetite have returns to risk assets, we will see significant growth in this area.\nNet flows in active equities remained a headwind, but improved meaningfully compared to our experience in 2022. Net long-term outflows in global equities were $2.5 billion in the first quarter, including $1.2 billion from our developing markets fund.\nWhile still a challenging environment, this was the best outflow before this quarter in the asset class since 2021, with net outflows being less than half the net outflows in the fourth quarter.\nAs we discussed on our last earnings call, the Chinese markets have continued to be unsteady for several months as the country is in the midst of transition period post-COVID-19 policies, and higher interest rates led to an uptick in fixed income redemptions industry-wide.\nConsistent with that industry direction, our Greater China business experienced $2.9 [ billion ] of net outflows in the first quarter, primarily in the fixed income [ capabilities ] I just mentioned.\nDespite the near-term challenges, we remain extremely bullish on the opportunity in China over the long term. We ran 12 out of 160 refund companies operated in China and remain the largest foreign known asset manager in the fastest-growing market in our industry.\nWe expect to be in the market for new product launches during the second quarter, and we are optimistic for recovery inflows on the balance of 2023.\nLet me briefly touch on our private market capabilities, which experienced net long-term inflows of $600 million in the first quarter. We were very active in the CLO market and raised $1.5 billion from 3 new CLOs launched in that period.\nReal estate transactions slowed across the industry as markets [ absorbed ] the turmoil and the banking sector and the higher interest rates made financing more difficult. However, our direct real estate portfolio has performed well. It is diversified across geographies, sectors and investment styles. Allison will get into great detail in just a few minutes.\nWhile we expect the growth may be more challenging in real estate due to market conditions, our portfolio is well managed, and we continue to source new opportunities and are having constructive conversations with our clients.\nInvesting in growing our business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and providing a steady return capital to our shareholders made us a top priority. I'm pleased to note that our Board had approved a 7% increase in quarterly common dividend to $0.20 per share, effective this quarter, which reflects our strong cash position and stable cash flows despite the uncertain markets we've been facing.\nLong-term debt continues to run at the lowest levels in over a decade. And we've recently renewed and increased the size of our credit facility from $1.5 billion to $2 billion, providing us significant flexibility, moving forward.\nLastly, as you're aware, last -- in February, we announced that Andrew Schlossberg will take over as President and CEO when I retire on June 30. Schlossberg has more than 20-year career at Invesco. Andrew has successfully led several large businesses and earned the respect of clients and employees, the Board of Directors and executive leadership team.\nAndrew, our highly experienced executive leadership team are well placed to lead Invesco into the next chapter. I'm excited for the future of the firm as we build on our market-leading position to further accelerate growth under Andrew's leadership and that of the executive leadership team.\nThis is the most talented, experienced leadership team Invesco's ever had, from Andrew, Allison and the rest of [ ELT ]. I could not be more excited. I will continue to work with Andrew and the team as Chairman Emeritus from June 30 through the end of 2024.\nBefore we turn over the call to Allison, I'd like to introduce Andrew, invite him to say a few words. Andrew?\n\nAndrew Ryan Schlossberg\n\nChief Executive Officer, Invesco Perpetual and Head of Invesco’s EMEA Region, Invesco Ltd.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Marty, and good morning to everyone. Let me start by saying how grateful I am to Marty for his tremendous leadership as Invesco's CEO these past 18 years. Marty has truly been a visionary in the industry, and he's positioned Invesco extremely well to win in a fast-changing environment.\nAnd during my 22 years at Invesco and working closely with Marty during his tenure as CEO, I've seen it being a part of the evolution of our firm. And during this time, we have routinely updated our strategic priorities ahead of changing client needs, evolve the leadership and develop the talent of the firm.\nAnd I'm looking forward to the opportunity to build on this strong foundation and a legacy that Marty and our team have developed over many years of hard work and dedication for our clients, our shareholders and everyone at Invesco.\nI know that we have the right capabilities. We have deep client relationships, strong talent and an experienced executive leadership team in place to be a force in the asset management industry for years to come.\nI'm also looking forward to assuming the CEO role at a time when, once again, our industry is going through a meaningful change with new technological developments, enhanced client delivery capabilities and a high bar for investment quality.\nAs an organization, we're committed to our growth strategy and the key capabilities that we've been discussing with all of you, including ETFs, Greater China, private markets, active fixed income and active global equities and our solutions offering.\nOur executive leadership team is focused on further enhancing these capabilities and evolving these strategic priorities, both at pace and with conviction. And as Marty noted, we're very well positioned to capture demand and develop even deeper relationships with our clients over time.\nI'm also committed to driving a high level of profitable growth and financial performance, continuing to further strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders.\nAnd finally, I'm excited to engage more deeply with the investment community, and I look forward to spending time and working with all of you in the quarters and years to come.\nAnd with that, I'm going to turn it over to Allison to provide a more detailed look at our results.\n\nLaura Allison Dukes\n\nSenior MD & CFO, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with Slide 4. Overall, investment performance improved in the first quarter, with 64% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or beating benchmark on both a 3-year and a 5-year basis, up from 61% and 63% in the fourth quarter. We have strong performance strength in fixed income and balanced strategies for their solid client demand.\nPerformance lacked benchmark in certain U.S. equity strategies, but performance is trending positively in a number of global equity and alternative strategies.\nTurning to Slide 5. We ended the first quarter with $1.48 trillion in AUM, an increase of $74 billion as compared to the last quarter as most market indices posted gains, despite continued volatility. Market increases, foreign exchange movement and reinvested dividends increased assets under management by $65 billion. Total net inflows were $9 billion, inclusive of $8 billion into money market products.\nI'm pleased to note a return to organic growth as we generated $2.9 billion in net long-term inflows in the first quarter. The improvement in net flows, given the ongoing uncertainty in financial markets, further demonstrates the diverse nature of our business mix and should once again place Invesco among the best-performing asset managers in terms of organic growth.\nAsset capabilities generated net inflows of $5.4 billion, while net redemptions and active strategies moderated with net long-term outflows of $2.5 billion in the first quarter as compared to $10.5 billion in the fourth quarter of last year.\nKey capability areas, including ETFs, fixed income and the institutional channel, all contributed to our growth this quarter. Invesco ETF generated $2.8 billion of net long-term inflows in the first quarter, equivalent to a 4% annualized organic growth rate.\nVolumes have been down across the ETF industry from the record highs experienced in the first quarter of 2021 through the first quarter of 2022. But as Marty noted, our ETF business has now been in net inflows for 10 out of the past 11 quarters.\nThe NASDAQ 100 QQQM was one of our top-selling ETFs this quarter and has now grown to over $8 billion in AUM since its launch in late 2020. We also saw strong flows into our S&P 500 Equal Weight and BulletShares corporate bond ETF.\nPartially offsetting growth in equity and fixed income ETFs were $2.5 billion of net outflows and currency and commodity ETFs, which are included in our alternative asset class.\nWe experienced net outflows of $3.7 billion in the retail channel during the first quarter. Net flows were roughly breakeven in EMEA, while Asia Pacific and the Americas were both in net outflows.\nAs Marty highlighted at the top of the call, the institutional channel garnered net inflows for the 14th straight quarter to $6.6 billion . We were net inflows in all 3 of our global regions and growth accelerated to 7% on an annualized basis. After several quarters of strength in institutional fixed income, equity mandates were responsible for our largest fundings in the first quarter.\nAdvancing to Slide 6, net flows by geography improved as compared to last quarter and turned positive for the quarter in both Americas and EMEA. This was mainly due to slower redemptions in the retail channel as well as the funding of several institutional mandates.\nNet flows were breakeven in Asia Pacific, and net outflows in our China joint venture were offset by growth in Japan and our Hong Kong institutional business.\nLooking at flows by asset class, net outflows in active equity strategies improved in the first quarter, led by moderating of redemptions in our global equity capabilities.\nNet outflows in global equity strategies were $2.5 billion in the first quarter, including $1.2 billion from our developing markets funds, compared to $6 billion of net long-term outflows in the fourth quarter, which included $3.1 billion of outflows from developing markets.\nFixed income capabilities garnered $2.5 billion in net long-term inflows, despite higher redemptions in Chinese fixed income products that Marty spoke of earlier.\nGrowth in fixed income this quarter spanned both taxable and tax-exempt offerings as well as the full range of vehicle types, including mutual funds, ETFs and SMA. This reflects the breadth and depth of our global fixed income franchise, and we see opportunity in this asset class over the remainder of this year.\nAlternatives experienced net outflows of $3 billion in the first quarter. Private markets net inflows were $600 million, driven by the launch of 3 CLOs that raised $1.5 billion in aggregate and direct real estate net inflows of $600 million.\nOffsetting growth in these areas of private markets were net outflows in bank loan strategies. Currency and commodity ETF net outflows, as I mentioned earlier, were the primary driver of alternative net outflows.\nI'd like to take a moment to highlight our direct real estate portfolio, which had $73 billion of assets under management as of March 31. Through our real estate business, we offer the full range of investment styles across the risk-return spectrum, and we invest primarily in real estate equity. We also invest in real estate debt, which comprises less than 10% of our global real estate portfolio.\nOur direct real estate holdings are well diversified by property type. Commercial office properties comprise about 1/3 of our assets under management. Apartment and other residential properties account for nearly 1/4 and industrial properties about 1/5. The remaining 20% of our properties span retail and specialty sectors, including mixed-use development, self-storage and medical.\nFinally, we are diversified by geography within each property type. By total asset value, 40% of our office holdings are in EMEA and Asia Pacific, where the market dynamics affecting demand for office space are significantly different than those in the United States and because the adoption of remote working model is much lower outside the U.S.\nSeveral of our direct real estate funds use leverage, but were measured in our approach. And the average loan-to-value across our direct real estate funds was approximately 30% as of December 31. These figures may fluctuate over time, and they vary across specific funds.\nAs Marty mentioned earlier, real estate transaction activity slowed during the first quarter, and we would expect activity to be muted over the balance of the year until markets find more stable footing. Longer term, we expect private markets and more specifically, direct real estate and private credit to be a driver of growth, and we are in a strong position to capture that demand.\nAnd now moving to Slide 7. Our institutional pipeline was $22.1 billion at quarter end, a decrease from $30 billion last quarter. We had good pull-through from our pipeline in the first quarter, which contributed to $6.6 billion of net long-term input.\nOur pipeline has been running in the mid-$20 billion to mid-$30 billion range, dating back to late 2019, so this is on the lower end of that range. But we view this pipeline as strong, given the market environment and the significant fundings that took place in the first quarter.\nAs we've noted previously, market volatility is causing some of these mandates to take longer to fund, and we would estimate the funding cycle of our pipeline is running in the 3 to 4 quarter range versus the 2 to 3 quarters prior to the market downturn.\nOur solutions capability enabled 14% of the global institutional pipeline as of the first quarter, as well as several of the mandates that funded recently. We embed solutions into our client interactions, and we have ongoing engagement about new opportunities. The pipeline reflects a diverse business mix but has helped Invesco sustain organic growth in institutional for more than 3 years now.\nTurning to Slide 8. Net revenue of $1.08 billion in the first quarter was $32 million or 3% lower than the fourth quarter and $176 million or 14% lower than the first quarter of last year.\nThe decline from last quarter was mainly attributable to a seasonal decrease in performance fees, which were $50 million lower and 2 fewer days in the first quarter, which accounted for nearly $25 million in lower net revenue.\nThis was partially offset by higher investment management fees of $25 million. The decline from the first quarter of last year was due largely to lower investment management fees, driven by lower AUM levels.\nTotal adjusted operating expenses in the first quarter were $749 million, $20 million lower than the prior quarter and $9 million lower than the first quarter of 2022.\nCompensation expense increased by $12 million as compared to the fourth quarter as seasonally higher payroll taxes and benefits were largely offset by the lower incentive compensation paid on performance fees.\nIncluded in compensation expense this quarter is $13 million of costs related to executive retirements and other organizational changes. We expect to recognize approximately $20 million of additional costs related to executive retirement in the second quarter.\nAs we discussed, we managed variable compensation to a full-year outcome in line with company performance and competitive industry practices. Historically, our compensation-to-net revenue ratio has been in the 38% to 42% range, trending towards the upper end of that range and periods of revenue decline.\nAt current AUM levels, we would expect the ratio to continue to trend towards the higher end of that range for 2023 when excluding the cost pertaining to executive retirement.\nMarketing expenses of $28 million were $6 million lower than the prior quarter, coming off the seasonal highs we typically see in fourth quarter. Marketing expenses were modestly higher than the same quarter last year by $2 million.\nProperty, office and technology expenses were $5 million lower than last quarter, primarily due to lower software costs and $2 million of property decommissioning associated with our Atlanta move that did not [ occur ]. On that note, I'm happy to share that we are speaking to you from our new global headquarters in Midtown Atlanta as we completed our move earlier this month.\nG&A expenses of $95 million were $21 million lower than the prior quarter, partly due to lower third-party spend on technology projects. As we discussed previously, we continue to invest in foundational technology programs that will enable future scale. These expenses span G&A and property office and technology expenses, and spend may fluctuate from period to period.\nIn the first quarter, we also benefited from $10 million in indirect tax credits. We do not anticipate these tax credits will recur at these levels, going forward.\nWe maintain an extremely disciplined approach to expense management and are focusing hiring and investment in the key capability areas that are driving our growth. As Marty and I have discussed previously, optimizing resource allocation to efficiently drive growth has and will continue to be a top priority for the organization.\nNow moving to Slide 9. Adjusted operating income was $327 million in the first quarter, $12 million lower than the prior quarter due to lower net revenue, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Adjusted operating margin was 30.4% broadly in line with 30.6% in the fourth quarter, but lower than the 39.5% a year ago, prior to significant market declines.\nExcluding $13 million of costs related to retirement and other organizational changes, first quarter operating margin would have been 31.6%, an increase of 100 basis points as compared to last quarter.\nEarnings per share of $0.38 was $0.01 lower than prior quarter and $0.18 lower than the first quarter of '22. Excluding these expenses related to executive retirements and other organizational changes in the first quarter would add $0.02 to earnings per share.\nThe effective tax rate was 24.1% in the first quarter, lower than 26.9% in the prior quarter, primarily due to nonoperating gains on seed money investments and lower tax jurisdictions.\nWe estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 25% for the second quarter of this year. The actual effective rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items.\nI'll wrap up on Slide 10. As you heard earlier from Marty and Andrew, building balance sheet strength remains a critical priority. We're making steady progress, and total debt of $1.5 billion is at its lowest level in more than a decade. We ended the quarter with $889 million of cash and cash equivalents and zero borrowing on our credit facility.\nThe first quarter is typically a period of seasonally higher cash [ means ], and we anticipate building cash in the coming quarters.\nOur leverage ratio, as defined under our credit facility agreement, was 0.8x at the end of the first quarter, in line with both last quarter and the first quarter of 2022. If preferred stock is included, our fourth quarter leverage ratio was 3.4x.\nAs highlighted earlier, we're pleased to note that our Board approved a 7% increase in our quarterly common dividend to $0.20 per share, effective this quarter. This reflects the strength of our balance sheet, cash position and stable cash flows, despite the uncertain markets we have been facing.\nWe also renewed our credit facility for another 5 years with favorable terms as well as increasing the capacity of the facility from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. This builds additional flexibility for managing our balance sheet as we prepare to redeem the $600 million senior note, maturing in January of 2024.\nMarkets have remained volatile thus far in '23. There have also been signs that a modest recovery could be on the horizon. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we made this quarter, returning to organic growth, tightly managing expenses and methodically building balance sheet strength.\nOur firm has successfully navigated market volatility in the past. We're poised to emerge stronger in a market recovery and capitalize on future growth opportunities where they emerge. There's a lot of hard work ahead of us, and I'm excited to partner with Marty, Andrew and the executive team as we lead Invesco into a new era.\nAnd with that, we'll ask the operator to open up the line to Q&A."

(Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Now I would like to turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Invesco's Head of Investor Relations.\n\nGregory Wade Ketron\n\nHead of IR & Treasury, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThanks, operator, and to all of you joining us on Invesco's quarterly earnings call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address today. The press release and presentation are available on our website, invesco.com. This information can be found by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.\nOur presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slide 2 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to the GAAP.\nFinally, Invesco is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcast are located on our website.\nMarty Flanagan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning. After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions. Now I'll turn the call over to Marty.\n\nMartin L. Flanagan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThank you, Greg, and thanks everybody for joining us. And I'm going to start on Slide 3 if you're following along, which is the fourth quarter highlights. The fourth quarter concluded a year of significant headwinds and volatility in global markets. Seemingly, no geography or asset class was immune to the S&P, experienced the worst year since 2008, NASDAQ Composite declined over 30%, MSCI Merchant Markets Index nearly 20%, and bond markets, typically the safe haven when equities suffer, declined significantly due to rise in interest rates with the global aggregate bond index declining by more than 15% for the year. This resulted in the worst markets we've seen in decades.\nRising COVID infections in China and tax loss harvesting in developed economies as the year came to a close made for a challenging organic growth dynamic in our industry. Despite industry challenges in 2022, we're pleased to see key capabilities in areas with high client demand continued to deliver organic growth, offsetting net outflows and capabilities that experienced redemption pressure as investors expressed a preference for risk-off assets.\nKey capabilities that delivered net long-term inflows for the year included ETFs, fixed income, Greater China and the institutional channel. The firm's ability to deliver these outcomes demonstrates the strength and resilience of our diversified platform in the face of extraordinary market headwinds.\nAlthough market showed signs of stabilization in the fourth quarter, the uncertain backdrop continued to weigh on investor sentiment and impacted client demand. Invesco separated itself from most industry peers by generating net inflows in key capability areas led by strong growth in ETFs in the quarter. Our fixed income business and institutional channel continued to build on our track record of organic growth, generating net inflows for 16 and 13 consecutive quarters, respectively. The depth and breadth of our investment capabilities that Invesco brings to market that position the firm to return to organic growth when investor sentiment improves.\nInvesco ETFs delivered $4.3 billion in net long-term inflows during the quarter. For the full year, ETFs brought in $28 billion of net long-term inflows, the equivalent of 11% organic growth rate. Our ETF lineup remains differentiated for most competitive offerings with a focus on higher value, higher revenue market segments like smart beta, and we continue to drive innovation in space with products such as our QQQ Innovation Suite.\nFixed income capabilities in the institutional channel have been pillars of organic growth for several years now, and growth persisted in both of these areas in the fourth quarter with $800 million and $900 million of net inflows, respectively. As Allison will discuss later, our institutional pipeline remains at healthy levels. And as interest rates stabilize, we have a significant opportunity to capture growth in fixed income capabilities in 2023.\nOur business in Greater China performed exceptionally well during 2022, building on our leading position in the world's fastest-growing market asset managers. We experienced modest net long-term outflows of $600 million in the fourth quarter due to significantly higher redemptions in fixed income throughout the industry in China and rising bond yields stroke net asset values for fixed income securities lower.\nDespite these challenges, we raised over $3 billion from new product launches during the quarter in China. For the full year, our China joint venture delivered $7 billion of net inflows, the equivalent of 11% organic growth rate. Market sentiment in China will be mixed for the next few months as the country works through the transition period of higher COVID infection, stabilizing interest rates and redemptions turned to more moderate levels. That said, there are also signs that the outlook for the remainder of 2023 is improving, and I'm optimistic for a return to organic growth rate throughout 2023 in China.\nAlthough we maintain momentum in key capabilities, the firm experienced net long-term outflows this quarter of $3.2 billion. Active global equity remains the biggest drag on organic growth with $6 billion of net outflows in the fourth quarter, including $3 billion in our developing markets fund.\nAs we discussed previously, client appetite for these assets have been lower than in the past, but I'm optimistic, redemptions will slow this client appetite for risk assets will eventually return.\nWe entered 2023 with a strong balance sheet, giving us the needed flexibility to operate strategically in this environment. Long-term debt remains at low levels, the lowest in 10 years, and our cash balance increased to over $1.2 billion at year-end. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to be disciplined in our approach to expenses, tightly managing discretionary spending and limiting higher rolls that are critical to support the organization and future growth.\nWe are thoughtfully managing market headwinds while investing for the long term. We remain focused on identifying areas of expense improvement that will deliver positive operating leverage as the market recovers and organic growth resumes. We are being extremely thoughtful about capital resource allocation in this environment, and we will be well positioned to maintain investments in areas that deliver future growth.\nLooking ahead, we are partnering with our clients to meet the most pressing needs in this dynamic environment. We've dedicated the past decade to build a breadth of investment capabilities and solutions mindset and operating scale at Invesco that few in the industry can match. I'm proud of our talented -- what our talent employees have accomplished in 2022 on behalf of clients and stakeholders, and I'm optimistic for return to organic growth when market sentiment eases.\nMarket direction may be uncertain, but I'm confident that Invesco is prepared to meet challenges that will arise in 2023 and well positioned for future growth.\nWith that, Allison, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nLaura Allison Dukes\n\nSenior MD & CFO, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with Slide 4. Overall, investment performance improved in the fourth quarter with 61% and 63% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or beating benchmark on a 3-year and a 5-year basis, up from 57% and 62% in the third quarter. These results reflect strength in fixed income and balanced strategies where there is strong client demand. Performance lacks benchmark in certain equity strategies, but we experienced improvement over the past quarter in several key funds and short-term performance is trending positively in several U.S. and global equity strategies.\nMoving to Slide 5. We ended 2022 with $1.41 trillion in AUM, an increase of $86 billion from the end of the third quarter as most market indices partially recovered from prior quarter lows. Global market increases, foreign exchange movements and reinvested dividends increased assets under management by $61 billion, and total net inflows were $25 billion, inclusive of $30 billion into money market products.\nAs Marty mentioned earlier, the firm experienced net long-term outflows of $3.2 billion this quarter, equivalent to a 1% annualized organic decline. Despite some stabilization in global financial markets, industry growth remained subdued in the fourth quarter and Invesco's net flow performance was among the best in our peer group.\nPassive capabilities returned to net inflows this quarter was $7.3 billion, while net outflows were $10.5 billion in active strategies. Several of our key capability areas continued to deliver positive organic growth, including ETFs and fixed income as well as the institutional channel. These capabilities also delivered positive organic growth for the full year along with our Greater China business, which enabled Invesco to offset outflows and strategies that experienced net redemptions as investors sought risk-off trade throughout 2022.\nInvesco's ETF lineup was once again a driver of net long-term inflows in the fourth quarter with $4.3 billion. Net inflows were inclusive of $2.4 billion in maturing BulletShares ETFs, which are included in our gross redemptions. Growth this quarter was broad-based. Our top-selling ETFs included the S&P 500 Equal Weight, the NASDAQ 100 Q2QM and Invesco senior loan ETF.\nFor the full year 2022, net long-term inflows into our ETF capabilities were $28 billion, equivalent to an 11% organic growth rate, and we gained market share. Excluding the QQQs, Invesco captured 3.8% of industry net inflows, higher than our 3.1% share of total industry assets under management.\nInstitutional channel has been a steady source of growth and that continued in the fourth quarter as the channel has now achieved 13 straight quarters of net inflows. For calendar year 2022, the channel achieved net inflows of $13 billion or a 4% organic growth rate. We sustained new fundings across geographies, asset classes and the risk return spectrum throughout the year, despite the very challenging market backdrop. This demonstrates the diverse range of client relationships we have nurtured as well as the differentiated set of capabilities that we bring to the market.\nRetail net outflows were $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter, a meaningfully lower pace of outflows than the prior quarter as the channel achieved positive flows in Asia Pacific and ETF flows improved in both the Americas and EMEA, despite an uptick in investors harvesting tax losses as the year ended.\nMoving to Slide 6. Net outflows declined quarter-over-quarter in Americas and EMEA, primarily due to improvement in ETF net flows. Net inflows in Asia Pacific were $3.3 billion, led by Japan and Australia. Our China joint venture experienced modest net long-term outflows of $400 million in the fourth quarter as fixed income products experienced a meaningful industry-wide spike in redemptions throughout China and a rapid rise in COVID-19 cases impacted the Chinese economy and financial markets.\nDespite that, we raised over $3 billion in the fourth quarter from new products and investors showed signs of shifting back into equity products where we garnered $1.8 billion of net long-term inflows. Looking at full year 2022, our China joint venture delivered $7 billion of net long-term inflows, an 11% organic growth rate and regaining market share.\nBuilding on Marty's points from earlier, the Chinese market may remain in transition in the short term and through the first few weeks of 2023, the higher redemptions we experienced in the fourth quarter have persisted driven by fixed income. This dynamic may be a drag on net flows in China through the remainder of the first quarter, though we expect to be launching new products after the Chinese New Year, and there is increasing optimism for the rest of 2023.\nLonger term, we remain one of the best positioned asset managers, and what is expected to be, the world's fastest-growing market for asset management. Fixed income capabilities sustained organic growth in the fourth quarter with $800 million in net inflows. The firm achieved net inflows in this area, despite the heightened redemptions on the Chinese fixed income products as well as a $2.4 billion outflow related to BulletShares ETFs that reached their planned maturity last month.\nAs interest rates stabilize, we have a diverse platform of fixed income offerings with strong investment performance across the full range of risk appetites and durations that are positioned to capture future growth.\nAlternatives experienced net outflows of $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Liquid alts accounted for more than 2/3 of the net outflows driven primarily by commodity-focused ETFs. These strategies experienced net inflows for the full year, but gave back gains from the first half of the year.\nPrivate Markets net outflows were $1.6 billion, primarily due to outflows and bank loan strategies. Net outflows in active equity strategies have been concentrated in Global and Developing Markets equities, which experienced $6 billion of net outflows in the quarter, including $3.1 billion from our developing markets funds.\nMoving to Slide 7. Our institutional pipeline was $30 billion at quarter end, an increase from $23 billion last quarter. Despite the challenging environment, we are winning new mandates, notably in fixed income and active equity in the fourth quarter, which contributed to the increase.\nOur pipeline has been running in the mid-$20 billion to mid-$30 billion range dating back to late 2019, and we're pleased to see the pipeline this robust given the uncertain market environment. As we've noted previously, that uncertainty is causing some mandates to take longer to fund, and we would estimate the funding cycle of our pipeline has extended into the 3 to 4 quarter range versus the 2 to 3 quarters prior to the market downturn.\nOur solutions capability enabled 1/3 of the global institutional pipeline in the fourth quarter, and it remains a differentiator with clients. The pipeline reflects the diverse business mix that has helped Invesco sustain organic growth in the channel throughout the full business cycle.\nTurning to Slide 8. Markets partially recovered in the fourth quarter, but the significant market declines that we experienced in the third quarter, especially in September, drove assets under management lower at the start of the period. Net revenue of $1.11 billion in the fourth quarter was flat to the prior quarter and 19% lower than the fourth quarter of 2021. That's primarily due to lower active assets under management.\nTotal adjusted operating expenses were $769 million, an increase of $28 million from the prior quarter and a decrease of $27 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Compensation expenses increased by $8 million as compared to the third quarter, inclusive of incentive comp paid on the $56 million of performance fees earned in this quarter.\nAs we've discussed, we managed variable compensation to a full year outcome in line with company performance and competitive industry practices. Historically, our compensation to net revenue ratio has been in the 38% to 42% range on an annual basis.\nDuring periods of revenue decline, as we experienced in 2022, the ratio tends to move towards the upper end of this range. For the full year 2022, our compensation to revenue ratio was 41%. At current AUM levels, we would expect the ratio to trend towards the higher end of the range for 2023.\nAs a reminder, looking to first quarter, we expect seasonally higher compensation taxes and benefits of $20 million to $25 million, consistent with prior year trends. We would expect this to be largely offset by lower incentive compensation on performance fee revenue after seasonally high revenues received in the fourth quarter.\nMarketing expenses were $4 million higher than prior quarter, consistent with the seasonally higher activity we typically see in the fourth quarter. The marketing expenses were $9 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2021. Property, office and technology expenses were $6 million higher than the prior quarter. As we've mentioned previously, we're in the process of moving to our new Atlanta headquarters, which we expect to be complete by the middle of this year.\nHowever, we may experience moderate delays as a result of flooding that took place when literally cold temperatures caused pipes to burst around Atlanta in December, and we're working with relevant parties on a resolution. In fourth quarter, we also incurred $2 million of expenses related to the decommissioning of our current office building. These expenses are not repetitive in nature.\nTechnology expenses in the fourth quarter included investment in ongoing technology programs that will benefit future scale, such as upgrading our human resources operating environment and the move of our financial systems to the cloud. G&A expenses were $10 million higher than prior quarter, influenced by $4 million of foreign exchange rate revaluations associated with the impact of currency movements on our balance sheet, and an additional $2 million of value-added taxes paid in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are investing in foundational technology projects that will enable future scale in our operating platform. These expenses span G&A and property office and technology expenses and they are included in our results.\nWe're investing in our key growth capabilities while balancing the need to diligently manage expenses in this uncertain environment. We have focused near-term hiring and the growth areas that we've outlined and deferred hiring for most other positions. Over the longer term, we're building a platform that will rapidly and efficiently scale, delivering positive operating leverage and margin expansion as markets recover.\nNow moving to Slide 9. Adjusted operating income was $339 million in the fourth quarter, $30 million lower than the prior quarter due to flat net revenues combined with higher operating expenses. Adjusted operating margin was 30.6% as compared to 33.3% in the third quarter and 42% in the fourth quarter of 2021, prior to the steep market declines that we experienced in 2022.\nEarnings per share was $0.39 as compared to $0.34 due to higher nonoperating income, driven by gains on our seed capital and co-investment portfolios as markets increased from third quarter lows. The effective tax rate was 26.9% in the fourth quarter, lower than 28.7% in the prior quarter due to losses in lower tax jurisdictions last quarter that did not recur. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 25% and 27% for the first quarter of 2023. The actual effective tax rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items.\nI'm going to conclude on Slide 10. Maintaining a strong balance sheet remains a top priority, further underscored by the volatile environment that we have been navigating. Total debt was managed lower to $1.5 billion as of December 31, which is the lowest level in 10 years. We built cash in the fourth quarter as we ended the year with over $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of more than $200 million from September 30.\nOur leverage ratio, as defined under our credit facility agreement was 0.8x at the end of the fourth quarter, slightly higher than the 0.7x the third quarter as declining markets have led to lower EBITDA. Our leverage ratio is flat to the fourth quarter of 2021. If preferred stock is included, our fourth quarter leverage ratio was 3.2x. In the face of one of the most challenging markets of the past half century, Invesco continues to capture client demand in high-growth areas, and our net flow performance has been among the best in our peer group. Meanwhile, we've been building balance sheet strength and financial flexibility needed to navigate these uncertain times.\nWe will be extremely disciplined in expense management and resource allocation while ensuring that we are meeting the needs of our clients and positioning the firm for long-term growth.\nWith that, we're going to go ahead and open it up for Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) This call will last 1 hour. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Invesco's Head of Investor Relations. Thank you.

After we complete the presentation, we will open up the call for questions.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Marty.\n\nMartin L. Flanagan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Invesco Ltd.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Greg, and those so inclined to follow along. I'll start on Slide 3 on the highlight page. So the challenging backdrop continued in the third quarter as most major equity and bond market indices moved lower. Investors continue to behave cautiously seeking risk off-trades that impact industry flows as well as the level and mix of assets under management.\nThe dynamic environment here in favors money managers that have a broad diversified range of capabilities that meet client demands in this market. Invesco continues to prove to be one of the few global investment managers that can do that with net flows momentum in market leadership positions in areas of high client demand. Despite historic market declines, the firm generated net long-term inflows this quarter in active fixed income, Greater China and our institutional channel.\nAll 3 of these areas also garnered net long-term inflows on a year-to-date basis, along with our global ETF business and the private markets capabilities. I'll begin with our active fixed income capabilities, which has been a steady source of growth this year and is a testament to the diversity of investment platform.\nThe asset class generated net inflows of $3.7 billion in the quarter, with strong demand from clients in Asia Pacific. We managed nearly $380 billion of active fixed income across a full spectrum of investment offerings, vehicles, serving retail clients in some of the world's largest institutions.\nOur Greater China business delivered $2.1 billion of net long-term inflows this quarter. Invesco Great wall, our China joint venture, has fueled our growth, and we continue to successfully launch new products, most notably in fixed income. We've grown consistently in the last several quarters despite the recent difficulties faced by the Chinese economy as a result of our strong local partner and our long-standing reputation as one of the top global investment managers in China.\nOur leading position in China is a result of many years of investment and hard work as China and the global economy eventually recover, we expect our growth to accelerate in the fastest-growing market in our industry. Our institutional channel generated net inflows for the 12th consecutive quarter with $3.9 billion led by clients in Asia Pacific. The business has proven resilient throughout COVID-19 pandemic and the market downturn we are experiencing in 2022.\nGrowth in the institutional business as a result of investment in our distribution team, the range of capabilities we bring to market and the build-out of our solutions capability over the last several years, which is increasingly becoming the differentiator for Invesco.\nDespite volatility in the risk off sentiment impacting global markets, we continue to win new mandates and our pipeline remains solid. We look forward to continuing our partnership with many of the world's leading organizations to meet the challenges of this uncertain time.\nWhile net inflows into ETFs were relatively flat in the third quarter, demand for ETF slowed industry-wide despite -- despite the slowdown, we maintained a leading position in ETFs, and we expect to see growth rebound as market volatility eases. On a year-to-date basis, we have generated strong organic growth and gained market share. We have continued investing in our private markets capability and have experienced net outflows in the third quarter.\nOver the past year, we have generated organic growth against a very volatile market, demonstrating the strength of our alternative platforms. Key to our alternative strategy is our strategic relationship with MassMutual, which is meaningful and continues to strengthen.\nIn addition to managing over $10 billion in broker deal variable annuity and sub-advised assets prior to this decline, we have over $3 billion in other investment relationships with MassMutual. This includes nearly $2.5 billion in commitments to various Invesco alternative strategies. The commitment for MassMutual has been growing over time, and we work on various strategies, including $400 million committed to our in-REIT product.\nHaving a partner like MassMutual as an investor had significant reputational impact to our third-party investors. Considering the combined investment we have in seed and co-investment vehicles, which totals $900 million, along with $2.5 billion in commitment from MassMutual and various alternative strategies.\nThis compelling partnership that enables us to bring products to market more quickly and brings with it the strong reputational backing of a world-class financial institution. While growth continued in key capability areas I mentioned, the firm experienced net long-term outflows of $7.7 billion during the quarter. Equity strategies, which have been under pressure industry-wide, were the largest contributor to net outflows totaling $7.4 billion for the quarter.\nClient demand for emerging markets remain subdued, and our developing markets fund had $2.8 billion from net outflows in the third quarter. While near-term headwinds persist, we have confidence that the equity global capabilities will be a driver of growth in the future when global markets recover and client demand for this important asset class returns. As we discussed last quarter, significant progress has been made, building a stronger balance sheet position to help us weather this market downturn.\nWe ended the quarter with a zero balance on our revolver and total debt outstanding is at the lowest level in years. Our cash balance increased over $1 billion, and we maintain the flexibility we need to sustain investment in key growth areas. Last quarter, we mentioned that we met our target of $200 million in annual cost savings from our strategic evaluation.\nAs market volatility continues, the need to maintain a disciplined approach to expense management is paramount. We are reexamining all aspects of our discretionary spending relative to the environment we're in and we'll be focusing on near-term hiring on critical growth initiatives.\nWe continue to thoughtfully balance managing through near-term market headwinds while investing for long-term growth. As always, we remain focused on helping clients meet their investment objectives, investing in areas of strategic importance, scaling our operating platform and efficiently allocating resources. By executing our long-term strategy, I'm confident Invesco will maintain this position as one of the leading firms in our industry while delivering compelling returns to shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Allison.\n\nLaura Allison Dukes\n\nSenior MD & CFO, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with Slide 4. Investment performance continued to be solid in the third quarter with 57% and 62% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or beating benchmark on a 3-year and a 5-year basis. These results reflect continued strength in fixed income and balanced strategies where we continue to see strong client demand.\nPerformance lags, benchmark and certain equity strategies, but we experienced improvement over the past quarter in several key funds. Turning to Slide 5. We ended third quarter with $1.32 trillion in AUM, a decrease of $67 billion from the end of the second quarter. Global market declines and foreign exchange movements reduced assets under management by $72 billion, partially offset by total net inflows inclusive of $10 billion into money market products.\nAs Marty noted, the firm experienced net long-term outflows of $7.7 billion this quarter, amid continued market volatility. Active capabilities accounted for most of the outflows totaling $7.3 billion for the quarter, while passive net outflows accounted for the remaining $400 million. We sustained organic growth in several of our key capability areas and our net flow performance remained strong relative to industry peers.\nA driver of our resilience and relative outperformance has been the institutional channel, which delivered a 12th consecutive quarter of net inflows with $3.9 billion. We generated the strong inflows despite not renewing a $2.5 billion relationship during the quarter.\nWhile clients are carefully considering new fundings in these challenging markets, our growth in the institutional channel accelerated from the second quarter and we continue to see new mandates fund across geographies, asset classes and the risk return spectrum. Offsetting growth in institutional were $11.6 billion of net outflows in the retail channel this quarter, primarily in the Americas and EMEA as investors continue to seek lower risk exposure amid extreme market volatility.\nNet flows into ETF vehicles were relatively flat in the third quarter with $300 million in net long-term outflows. Demand for ETF slowed industry-wide. That driver, coupled with net outflows in commodities and bank loan products created net flow headwinds for Invesco. Offsetting this were net inflows into fixed income ETFs, the low volatility suite and our Q-to-Q innovation suite led by the Q-to-Qm. Despite the slowdown in the third quarter, we maintained a leading position in ETFs, and we expect to see growth rebound as market volatility eases. On a year-to-date basis, net long-term inflows into our ETF franchise are $23 billion, equivalent to a 12% organic growth rate. We've also gained market share year-to-date.\nExcluding the Q-to-Q, Invesco captured 4.7% of industry net inflows, higher than our 3.1% share of total industry assets under management. Now turning to Slide 6. We experienced continued net outflows in the Americas and EMEA, primarily in the retail channel. Growth picked up in Asia Pacific with over $5 billion of net long-term inflows this quarter, led by China and Japan. Our China joint venture contributed $2.1 billion of net inflows, including $1.8 billion from 9 new products launched during the quarter.\nAs Marty highlighted, our joint venture remains a key strength, and we expect growth to accelerate there as markets recover. Fixed income capabilities have been a reliable source of growth for Invesco for several years now. Despite one of the most difficult bond markets in years, the third quarter was no exception to that reliability with $6.5 billion of net long-term inflows.\nThe firm has now experienced net inflows into fixed income strategies for 15 straight quarters, a testament to the breadth of our offering as well as our strong investment performance in the asset class. Alternatives experienced net outflows of $5.3 billion in the third quarter.\nThe largest drivers of net outflows were bank loans and commodity ETF, which have attractive net inflows year-to-date but saw investors pull back in the third quarter. While growth may slow in the near term, as investors carefully consider asset allocations, we're confident that our alternatives business will be a strategic driver of growth in the years to come.\nIn fact, over the past volatile year, we've generated a 4% organic growth rate, excluding outflows in our GTR product, demonstrating the strength of our alternatives platform. Finally, as Marty noted, we experienced $7.4 billion of net outflows and equity capabilities. Global and developing market -- global and developing markets equities continue to account for the majority of net outflows in the asset class with $4.3 billion in the quarter, including $2.8 billion from our developing markets fund.\nMoving to Slide 7. Our institutional pipeline was $23 billion at quarter end, modestly lower than -- than $24 billion last quarter. Client fundings increased in the third quarter as compared to second quarter, and we continue to win new mandates despite the challenging environment.\nOur pipeline has been running in the mid-$20 billion to mid-$30 billion range dating back to late 2019. So while this is at the lower end of the size range, we still see the pipeline as robust given the uncertain market environment. As we noted last quarter, that uncertainty is causing some mandates to take longer to fund. And we would estimate the funding cycle of our pipeline is now in the 3 to 4 quarter range on average as compared to 2 to 3 quarters previously.\nIn summary, the pipeline continues to reflect a diverse business mix across asset classes, investment styles and geographies. Our solutions capability enabled 38% of the global institutional pipeline and continues to be a differentiator with clients.\nTurning to Slide 8. Significant declines in global markets this year have put downward pressure on our revenue base. Net revenue of $1.11 billion in the third quarter was 5% lower than the prior quarter and 17% lower than third quarter of 2021, primarily due to declines in active asset levels. Total adjusted operating expenses were $741 million, a decrease of $21 million from last quarter and $31 million as compared to the third quarter of 2021.\nThe drivers of the decline from last quarter were G&A expenses, which were $11 million lower than last quarter and marketing expenses, which declined by $7 million, consistent with the seasonally lower activity we often see in third quarter as well as the decline in discretionary spending. We also saw a slight decline in employee compensation expenses. Drivers of the decline from the third quarter of '21 were compensation expenses and property office and technology expenses despite the $3 million in duplicate rent for our new Atlanta headquarters that I mentioned last quarter.\nEmbedded in our third quarter 2022 spending is continued investment in growth capabilities as well as several transformational projects that will enhance the effectiveness of our corporate functions and enable us to reap the benefits of scale as markets recover. Current projects include a technology-enabled human resources transformation, moving core finance systems to the cloud and the foundational elements of the Alpha NextGen program. The savings we achieved in our strategic evaluation and the continued discipline we have installed have enabled us to make these strategic investments without meaningfully growing technology expenses.\nCompensation expenses declined $45 million or 9% from the third quarter of 2021. Given the pace and magnitude of the market decline, it will take some time for certain elements of our expense base to adjust with lower revenue. We manage variable compensation to a full year outcome in line with company performance and competitive industry practices. This can cause quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in compensation expense.\nHistorically, our compensation to net revenue ratio has been in the 38% to 42% range. In periods of revenue growth, the ratio tends to move towards the lower end of this range, similar to 2021 when the ratio declined to 38%. During periods of revenue decline, as we are experiencing this year, the ratio tends to move towards the upper end of this range. Year-to-date, our compensation to net revenue ratio is 40%. If assets remain at quarter end levels, the full year ratio would continue to trend towards the upper end of the range, driven by the lower net revenue base. Given the uncertain market environment, we are diligently managing expenses and evaluating all aspects of discretionary spending.\nWe continue to invest in our key growth capabilities, and we're focusing near-term hiring in those areas. We will defer hiring for certain other positions as we focus our efforts on critical initiatives. As always, we remain focused on meeting the diverse needs of our clients and investing where it's necessary to do so. Finally, we are proceeding with investments in foundational technology projects that will enable growth and support future scale in our operations.\nBalancing these objectives will allow Invesco to provide rewarding careers for our employees, position our business for future growth and prudently manage our expense base. Moving to Slide 9. Adjusted operating income was $369 million in the third quarter, $43 million lower than the second quarter due to lower net revenue driven by market declines, partially offset by lower operating expenses.\nAdjusted operating margin was 33.3% as compared to 35.1% in the second quarter and an all-time high of 42.1% in the third quarter of last year. Earnings per share were $0.34 as compared to $0.39 last quarter, driven by the same factors that impacted adjusted operating income. The effective tax rate was 28.7% in the third quarter due to a change in the mix of income across tax jurisdictions, including nonoperating losses and lower tax entities.\nWe estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 26% and 28% for the fourth quarter of 2022. The actual effective rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items. I'll conclude with a few points on Slide 10. Maintaining balance sheet strength continues to be a top priority, particularly as we navigate this uncertain environment.\nTotal debt was managed lower in the third quarter to $1.5 billion as of September 30, and we ended the quarter with a zero balance on our revolving credit facility. Our cash and cash equivalents balance is over $1 billion, an increase of nearly a $100 million from June 30. Our leverage ratio, as defined under our credit facility agreement was 0.7x at the end of the third quarter in line with last quarter. Our leverage ratio improved from 0.9x in the third quarter of last year despite lower EBITDA driven by the significant market declines. If preferred stock is included, our third quarter leverage ratio was 2.8x.\nIn this challenging environment, Invesco is strategically aligned to areas of high client demand, and we have the financial flexibility that will allow us to navigate current volatility while continuing to invest in the future. We will be extremely thoughtful in managing expenses through the near term so that we can rapidly scale when recovery takes place. We maintain our unwavering commitment to serving the needs of our clients in any market and delivering long-term value for our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line to Q&A."

(Operator Instructions). This call will last 1 hour. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nNow I'd like to turn today's meeting over to your host, Mr. Greg Ketron, Invesco's Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nGregory Wade Ketron\n\nHead of IR & Treasury, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThanks, operator, and to all of you joining us on Invesco's quarterly earnings call. In addition to our press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address today. The press release and presentation are available on our website, invesco.com. This information can be found by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.\nOur presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slide 2 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP.\nFinally, Invesco is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website.\nMarty Flanagan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning. After we complete the presentation, we will open up the call for questions.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Marty.\n\nMartin L. Flanagan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThank you, Greg. And I'll start on Slide 3, which is the highlights of the quarter. So let me start on that page (inaudible). So the market environment we have experienced for the first half of this year has been one of the most challenging in decades, global equity and debt markets delivered the worst first half returns we've seen in decades as investors reacted to uncertainty associated with rising fears, recession fears, higher inflation, interest rate hikes and geopolitical tensions.\nAgainst this backdrop for the industry and despite seeing the first net long-term outflows quarter in 2 years, our diversified product line have maintained net inflows in key capability areas, notably ETFs, active fixed income, Greater China, where we maintain leadership positions.\nOur global ETF platform generated inflows of $4.8 billion in the quarter, the equivalent of a 7% annualized organic growth rate. Our ETF product suite remains differentiated from competitors with a strong presence in higher revenue, higher growth segments, such as smart beta, and we continue to gain market share during the quarter.\nOur active fixed income business generated net inflows of $2.2 billion with strong flows into shorter duration strategies given the market backdrop. Our business in Greater China delivered $1.8 billion in net long-term inflows this quarter. Growth was driven by our China joint venture, where we saw strong demand for fixed income capabilities as investors [sought risk] of assets.\nAs we showcased previously, our business in China is uniquely positioned as a result of many years of investment and hard work building relationships with our clients and key stakeholders in the region. Growth in China continued despite difficult business conditions, which included COVID lockdowns in major cities. We are optimistic that the economic outlook in China is beginning to improve as COVID shutdowns ease and the government takes steps to boost the economy.\nAs markets recover, we are well positioned to capture future growth in the fastest-growing market for asset managers in the world. I also wanted to highlight our institutional business, which was in net inflows for the 11th consecutive quarters with $1.5 billion. The channel has been a steady source of growth, and we have made tremendous progress in building the business to nearly $0.5 trillion in assets under management. The channel is well diversified by asset class, led by fixed income and alternatives as well as geography where we have a significant presence in each of the 3 global regions.\nWe're proud to serve a broad range of client types and our pipeline continues to be solid. Our solutions capability remains integral to the success in this channel and enable 1/3 of our pipeline this quarter. We expect our institutional business to remain a key strength for us in the quarters ahead. Despite broad-based growth and key capabilities and net outflows in equity strategies, we're $7.7 billion in this quarter and drove overall net negative outflows in active global equities, in particular, we experienced net outflows and investor preference for risk off trades, led to higher redemptions in the quarter, including our developing markets fund, we saw $2.6 billion of net outflows.\nWe look at Invesco's ability to weather this volatile period and our focus on building a stronger balance sheet has resulted in much greater flexibility. As I mentioned last quarter, we took advantage of the economically attractive opportunity to early redeem $600 million of long-term debt. As a result, the total debt outstanding at the end of the second quarter is at the lowest level since 2015, and our leverage profile has been steadily improving.\nWe've increased cash return to shareholders this year via share buybacks along with a 10% dividend increase we announced in April. The progress we've made on the balance sheet will allow us to take advantage of future opportunities and continue to invest in our business and increased return to shareholders over the long term.\nWe met our target of $200 million in annual cost savings from our strategic review. Our focus will now shift to ongoing expense management discipline, and we will be deliberate as a management team in continuing to scale our business platform, global business platform, and invest in key areas of growth. In this uncertain environment, clients seek an investment manager that can partner with them to meet a comprehensive range of constantly evolving needs and solve their most challenging problems.\nOur broad set of investment capabilities and a differentiated platform we've built, positions us well to continue to meet our client needs and compete in a dynamic market environment. Looking ahead, we will balance managing through near-term volatility, while continuing to build a business that can compete and win over the long term. When the global industry growth resumes, we are well positioned to capture demands across a wide range of client types and investment capabilities, challenging times truly separate great companies from the back, and we are confident that our unwavering commitment to client needs will distinguish Invesco as one of the top firms in our industry.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Allison. Allison?\n\nLaura Allison Dukes\n\nSenior MD & CFO, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with Slide 4. Our investment performance continued to be solid in the second quarter, with 55% and 60% of actively managed funds and the top half of peers are beating benchmark on a 3- and a 5-year basis. These results reflect continued strength in fixed income and balanced products, areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally.\nMoving to Slide 5. We ended the second quarter with $1.39 trillion in AUM, a decrease of $166 billion from March 31, as significant market declines and FX rate changes contributed to $160 billion of the decline. As Marty mentioned earlier, we experienced our first net long-term outflow quarter in 2 years with $6.8 billion in net outflows. Despite that, our business has proven resilient, and our relative net flow performance in the period was among the strongest in our peer group.\nOur passive business continued to grow at $4.5 billion in net long-term inflows. Growth in passives was offset by $11.3 billion of net long-term outflows and active capabilities. The institutional channel continues to demonstrate the breadth and resilience of our platform with $1.5 billion of net long-term inflows in the second quarter. The channel has been a consistent source of growth and has now been in net inflows for 11 straight quarters. We continue to see mandates fund across a diverse range of capabilities. And as I'll discuss later, our pipeline remains solid.\nGlobal market volatility weighed on the retail channel this quarter, which experienced $8.3 billion of net outflows, primarily in the Americas and EMEA. ETFs and index strategies remain a key growth area for Invesco and were a source of relative strength in the second quarter with $4.8 billion of net long-term inflows. Excluding the [Q-to-Qs], Invesco captured 6.1% of industry net inflows, significantly higher than our 3.2% share of total industry assets under management.\nMoving to Slide 6. We experienced a slowdown in net flows across all regions this quarter amidst exceptional market volatility. Net flows were positive in Asia Pacific, inclusive of $2.2 billion of net long-term inflows into our China joint venture. As we've showcased previously, we are uniquely positioned in China and expect growth to accelerate there as the economy recovers and COVID restrictions ease.\nConsistent with industry trends, net flows slowed in the Americas and EMEA with both regions and net long-term outflows for the quarter. From an asset cost perspective, we saw strength in fixed income in the second quarter with net long-term inflows of $4.8 billion. Drivers of fixed income flows included our China JV, stable value and several fixed income ETFs. We experienced net outflows in alternatives this quarter as net inflows in direct real estate mandates and 2 new CLOs were offset by net outflows in bank loans and our global targeted returns capability.\nYear-to-date, net inflows into alternatives -- excuse me, were $5.9 billion, equivalent to a 6% organic growth rate. Excluding $2.5 billion in net outflows and global targeted returns, organic growth in alternatives is 8% year-to-date. As global markets declined significantly in the quarter, we experienced $7.7 billion of net outflows in equity capabilities. We continue to see higher redemption pressure in some of our larger equity funds, particularly in global and developing market equities, which accounted for $6.6 billion of the net outflows.\nNow moving to Slide 7. Our institutional pipeline was $24 billion at quarter end, a decrease of about $5 billion from the prior quarter due to fundings during the second quarter as well as normal fluctuations in the timing of client investments. Our pipeline has been running in the $25 billion to $35 billion range dating back to late 2019, so this is close to the lower end of that range. While the pipeline is strong, we're seeing some delays in mandates funding due to market uncertainty and expect that the typical funding cycle may lengthen by 1 to 2 quarters.\nThe pipeline also remains relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of fee composition, with an average fee rate running between the mid-20 and mid-30 basis point range. Overall, the pipeline continues to be diversified across asset classes and geographies. Our solutions capability enabled 33% of the global institutional pipeline and created wins and customized mandates. This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network.\nTurning to Slide 8. The significant declines in global markets over the past several months have impacted our revenue base. Second quarter 2022 net revenue of $1.17 billion was 6% lower than last quarter and 10% lower than the second quarter of 2021. Despite the volatile market backdrop, net revenue remained 13% higher than the second quarter of 2020, the last time we experienced this type of broad market decline.\nMoney market fee waivers abated during the quarter after the Federal Reserve raised rates twice to combat inflation. The net money market fee waiver impact had declined to $12 million in the first quarter of this year, and it was less than $4 million in the second quarter. Moving forward, we do not expect money market yield waivers to materially affect our revenue base.\nTotal adjusted operating expenses of $762 million were up $4 million or less than 1% as compared to the first quarter of 2022 and flat to the second quarter of 2021. The client and employee compensation due to seasonally lower payroll taxes and variable incentive pay were offset by increases in other expense categories.\nG&A expenses were $17 million higher than the first quarter. as we incurred $14 million of fund-related expenses during the period that we do not expect to recur in the future. The increase in property office and technology expenses can be attributed to additional rent associated with the move of our Atlanta headquarters to a new development in Midtown Atlanta in early 2023. We took possession of our new building in April as we build out the space while continuing to operate from our current Atlanta office. As a result, property and office expense will remain $2 million to $3 million above the eventual run rate for the next 4 to 5 quarters.\nAs COVID restrictions eased across North America and Europe, we saw a meaningful return of client activity and business travel, which contributed to increases in marketing and G&A expenses that I will cover on the next slide. Interacting in person again with our clients and our colleagues around the globe is integral to our success as we transition to our new normal ways of working. We remain highly focused on disciplined expense management while continuing to deliver for our clients.\nMoving to Slide 9. As of the end of the second quarter, we have met our initial $200 million savings goal from our strategic evaluation program. As compared to a normal pre-COVID run rate of expenses, we have delivered $213 million of annualized savings across employee compensation, our facility portfolio and third-party spend, which includes the new -- a lower new normal level of travel and entertainment expense.\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our travel and entertainment expense ran at significantly depressed levels as COVID mitigation measures were put into place and business travel slowed to near 0. Over the past quarter, we saw a meaningful resumption of business activity as restrictions eased across North America and Europe. We spent approximately $14 million on travel and entertainment this quarter. If we look back to the second half of 2019, travel and entertainment expenses averaged around $25 million per quarter in that pre-COVID environment.\nGiven our new normal ways of working and various measures we've put in place, we do not expect to see travel revert to pre-pandemic norms. We believe that our experience in the second quarter is approaching a new normal range for quarterly spending, and we expect to recognize at least $5 million in savings per quarter or $20 million annualized as compared to prior levels of activity. Moving forward, we will continue to focus on maintaining expense discipline and scaling our global business. We employ a continuous improvement mindset and will take full advantage of efficiencies where there are opportunities.\nIn the second quarter, we incurred $5 million of restructuring costs related to this initiative. In total, we recognized approximately $247 million of our total estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs associated with the program. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results.\nGoing to Slide 10. Adjusted operating income decreased $129 million from the second quarter of last year to $412 million, primarily due to lower revenue as a result of the market declines. Adjusted operating margin was 35.1% as compared to 41.5% in the second quarter of last year. EPS was $0.39 as compared to $0.78 last year due to lower operating and nonoperating income.\nIn the second quarter, equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was a negative $8 million as a result of unfavorable changes in CLO valuations compared to a positive $40 million a year ago when valuations were increasing. Other gains and losses were negative $29 million this quarter as compared to a positive $25 million a year ago, driven by lower valuations of our seed capital associated with market declines.\nThe effective tax rate was 24.8% in the second quarter. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 24% and 25% for the third quarter of 2022. The actual effective rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items.\nOn Slide 11, you can see how our asset base has evolved over the past 2 years as client demand has skewed towards lower-yielding passive products. We have tailored our product offerings to meet that demand and experience significant growth in passive and money market offerings. Realizing that our business mix is shifting, we continue to be focused on aligning our expense base with these changes.\nWhile the declines in global markets pressured our margins this quarter, operating margin of 35.1% is within a normal range for where we are in the business cycle and remains above our second quarter of 2020 levels, the last time we experienced a market drawdown of this magnitude. As I mentioned earlier, we will continue to be vigilant in prudently managing expenses and would expect margins to stabilize and eventually expand as markets recover.\nI'll conclude with a few points on Slide 12. Our balance sheet cash position was $937 million on June 30, a decrease of $396 million as compared to last year. The lower cash balance was due to the $600 million early debt redemption in May at economically attractive terms. To help facilitate the early payoff, we carried a balance of $185 million on our revolving credit facility at the end of this quarter. We expect to repay that balance in the near term and begin to build cash again over future quarters.\nIn terms of the benefits, the early redemption resulted in a net $6 million of savings with the make-whole fee and other transaction-related expenses being $5 million in the quarter and interest expense savings of nearly $11 million this year. Second quarter interest expense included the make-whole fee and other related expenses that totaled $5 million, offset by nearly $3 million in interest expense savings. For the third quarter, we expect interest savings of nearly $5 million and for the fourth quarter, over $3 million. This will result in interest expense being lower by these amounts in the third quarter and the fourth quarter.\nOur leverage ratio, as defined under our credit facility agreement was 0.7x at the end of the second quarter. If preferred stock is included, it was 2.6x. Both metrics are an improvement over 0.9x and 2.9x from 1 year earlier as our total debt outstanding reached its lowest level since 2015 at $1.7 billion. Overall, the progress we have made in managing our cost base and building balance sheet strength has given us a strong base from which to operate an ample flexibility to navigate the current drawdown in global markets.\nWe're confident that by continuing to execute the strategy we have laid out across our key capability areas, Invesco will continue to grow organically over the long run and be the go-to partner for our clients while delivering value to our shareholders.\nWith that, I'm going to turn it over to the operator, and we'll open up the line for Q&A."

These forward-looking statements are made as of today and are not guarantees. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from our expectations.\nFor a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please see risks described in our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. Invesco makes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\nWe may also discuss non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures may be found at the end of our earnings presentation.\n\nOperator\n\nWelcome to Invesco's First Quarter Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.\n\nMartin L. Flanagan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThank you very much, operator, and thanks, everybody, for joining us. And as typically what we do, I'll hit some of the highlights; Allison will hit more details on the results, and then we'll open up to Q&A.\nSo I'm going to start on Slide 3, if you happen to be following along with the deck. Solid business momentum continued during the first 3 months of the year. We did have net term -- long-term inflows of $17.2 billion in the first quarter. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of net long-term inflows. And our annualized organic growth rate in the quarter was 6% despite the market backdrop we were all experiencing.\nThis is a key outcome of the broadly diversified set of capabilities we've built over the past decade. And in this volatile market environment, we continue to be extremely focused on our clients and the strength and diversification of our business enabled us to continue anticipating and meeting their evolving needs.\nIn the first quarter, we continue to see strong demand for our key capability areas in particular, ETFs and fixed income. We maintain our focus on -- and investment in several key areas, including fixed ETFs, fixed income, factor index, private markets, active global equity, Great China solutions. This approach has helped us generate consistently strong and broad organic growth rate, and we ended the quarter with $1.6 trillion in assets under management.\nLooking at our specific capabilities, our global ETF platform closed out a very strong order. ETFs generated net inflows of $19 billion in the first quarter. This includes the flagship QQQ product. We did increase market share in both ETF assets under management and revenues, and Allison is going to spend a few minutes today going more depth into the ETF platform.\nWe continue to see clients increasing their allocation to alternative strategies as they search for diversification and higher returns, and Invesco has built a broad and competitive platform across real estate and private credit to meet these client demand needs. We are confident in our ability to accelerate growth in these capabilities. In private real estate, net long-term inflows for $300 million first quarter, this comprised of new acquisition activities of $2.1 billion and investment realizations of $1.8 billion.\nIn our private credit business, robust bank loan product demand resulted in net long-term inflows of $3.1 billion, including the launch of 2 new CLOs. Our active fixed income business remained strong, generating long-term net inflows of $2.5 billion in the first quarter, including $2.2 billion from Greater China. Our active global equity business, our flagship product, including Invesco Developing Markets Fund, did see net long-term outflows of $1.5 billion due to the impact of the geopolitical environment that we are experiencing.\nOn the institutional side, our solutions-enabled opportunities accounted for 30% of our institutional pipeline at the end of the quarter. Within Greater China, our JV had net long-term inflows of $2.2 billion in the quarter, and our business in China continues to be a source of strength and diversification. And we expect continued strong growth in the years ahead while recognizing the near-term headwinds in China.\nThe momentum in our business has generated strong cash flows, improving our cash position to the point where there were some share buybacks in the first quarter buying back $200 million in common shares during the quarter. Our focus building a strong balance sheet and improving our financial flexibility put us in a position to take advantage of an economically attractive opportunity to redeem $600 million in debt that matures in November, which will now be redeemed in early May.\nGiven the strong momentum and growth in our business, the Board has also approved a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend. And as we look forward, this will determine -- delivering consistent organic growth, together with our disciplined approach to expense management which should enable us to generate attractive operating margins over the long term, while at the same time, allowing us to continue investing in growth and the efficiency of our global business.\nInvesco's position as an investor and client-led firm differentiates us in the marketplace. Combined with the depth and breadth of our capabilities, our competitive strength, we are well positioned to win in a dynamic operating environment. We continue to focus our efforts on delivering positive outcomes for clients while driving future growth and delivering value over the long term for our stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Allison. Allison?\n\nLaura Allison Dukes\n\nSenior MD & CFO, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with Slide 4. Our investment performance continued to be solid in the first quarter, with 59% and 68% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers are beating benchmarks on a 5-year and a 10-year basis. These results reflect continued strength in fixed income, balanced products and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally.\nTurning to Slide 5. We ended the quarter with $1.6 trillion in AUM, a decrease of $55 billion from December 31. As Marty noted earlier, our diversified platforms generated net long-term inflows in the first quarter of $17.2 billion, representing nearly 6% annualized organic growth. Active AUM net long-term inflows were $800 million and path of AUM net long-term inflows were $16.4 billion. Despite the inflows, market declines and FX rate changes led to a decrease in AUM of $85 billion in the quarter.\nThe retail channel generated net long-term inflows of $10.4 billion in the first quarter, driven by inflows into global ETF products. The institutional channel demonstrated the breadth of our platform and generated net long-term inflows of $6.8 billion with diverse mandates, both regionally and by capability funding in the period.\nRegarding retail net inflows, our ETF capabilities generated net inflows of $19.2 billion. Excluding the QQQ, our net long-term inflows were $18.7 billion. I'll provide a little more commentary on our global ETF platform on the next several slides. But before I do, let me take a moment and touch on flows by both geography and asset class on Slide 6.\nYou'll note that the Americas had net long-term inflows of $7.9 billion in the quarter. While we saw strength in ETFs and our institutional business, we did see pressure from select active equity strategies, including developing markets and the diversified dividend funds.\nAsia Pacific saw net long-term inflows of $5.6 billion, representing organic growth of 11%. Net inflows were diversified across the region and included $3.2 billion of net long-term inflows from Invesco Great Wall, our joint venture in China.\nEMEA, excluding the U.K., also delivered a strong quarter of net long-term inflows totaling $5.9 billion, representing organic growth of 16%. This was driven by strength in ETFs and sales of senior loan products. From an asset class perspective, we continue to see broad strength in fixed income in the first quarter with net long-term inflows of $4.8 billion. Drivers of fixed income flows included institutional net flows into various fixed income strategies through our China JV, global investment grade, stable value and various fixed income ETF strategies.\nOur alternative asset class holds many different capabilities, and this is reflected in the strong flows we saw in the first quarter. Net long-term inflows and alternatives were $7.6 billion, representing organic growth of 15% and was driven primarily by our private credit business. This included 2 newly launched CLOs and net long-term inflows into our senior loan capabilities.\nIn addition, we saw net inflows into commodity ETFs in both the Americas and EMEA. When excluding global GTR net outflows of $1.6 billion, alternative net long-term inflows were over $9 billion. Strength of our alternatives platform can be seen through the flows that is generated over the past 5 quarters with net long-term inflows totaling nearly $27 billion, representing a 12% organic growth rate over this time when excluding the impact of the GTR net outflows.\nNow moving to Slide 7. As Marty noted earlier, given the strong growth in our ETF and other index capabilities, we wanted to provide a little more detail -- more detailed view on the business. With over 15 years of experience managing indexed assets and a team of seasoned ETF professionals in different strategic regions, Invesco's index business has always differentiated itself due to the innovative and value-added nature of our products.\nExamples of this include first-to-market types of products like the Invesco senior loan ETF, distinctive families of ETF like the low-volatility suite, the bullet share ETF and our diversified range of commodity pools. We created the fast-growing QQQ innovation suite just a little over 1 year ago, and it has grown to $5.4 billion at the end of the first quarter. We managed $528 billion in ETFs and other index capabilities. The platform is diversified in terms of strategies, asset classes and client geographies.\nOver the last 12 months, net inflows into ETFs and other index capabilities were $87 billion, a 21% growth rate. Net inflows into global ETFs over this period were $66 billion, which was a growth rate of 17% and new fees from these flows were $130 million, a 16% increase over the prior 12 months.\nNow turning to Slide 8. Over the past 5 quarters, the ETF industry has seen over $1 trillion in net inflows, a 12% growth rate. Over the same period, Invesco's 17% growth rate has exceeded that of the industry. In addition, our market share flows has exceeded our market share vending AUM for 4 of the last 5 quarters, increasing our overall global ETF market share of 40 basis points over this period to 4.9%.\nMoving to Slide 9. Invesco is the fourth largest ETF AUM adviser globally. Our platform is much more diverse than just [full] beta. We continue to innovate our product line, focusing on specialized strategies and growth areas such as smart beta, commodities, fixed income and more niche, traditional beta. These capabilities carry higher fee rates compared to both beta fee rates.\nOn a fee basis, we rank fourth in the industry with a 5.6% market share of annual fees. Given the commoditized nature of both beta products, almost 60% of the industry ETF AUM carries a fee rate of less than 10 basis points. In contrast, our ETF capabilities are anchored on strategies that help investors achieve targeted investment goals. The value-add proposition of our ETF business is expressed through sought-after products.\nIf you exclude the QQQ, over 90% of our ETF AUM has a fee rate 10 basis points or higher with the average fee rate being 33 basis points. Our ETF flows in the first quarter were also differentiated with over 80% of our ETF net inflow being in products that carry a fee rate of 10 basis points or higher. Looking at net flows and these higher fee products, our market share was nearly 14% of the industry, almost 3x our market share of ending AUM.\nSlide 10 shows that the ETF industry is expected to almost double in size to $18 trillion or 18% annually by 2025. Invesco is well positioned to continue to gain market share. With our global scale as well as being a leader in commodity, smart beta, fixed income and our focus on innovative and thematic offerings such as the QQQ innovation suite and ESG products, we are positioned to capture client demand around the globe.\nOur ability to capture flows in excess of our market share is driven by a number of factors, including our understanding of markets and clients; multi-decade ETF relationships in institutional and wealth management channels; a fast-growing European ETF product lineup that is now the second fastest-growing ETF business in the region; and our ability to build loyalty with a new generation of retail investors.\nFinally, the brand recognition of the QQQ elevates Invesco's visibility in the global ETF market. The QQQ product has become the fifth largest ETF globally. Its popularity has spurred growth in the rest of our global ETF platform and laid the groundwork for the launch of adjacent fee-generating products as part of the QQQ innovation suite. We launched that suite in October 2020, and it has been highly successful, growing to $5.4 billion by the end of the first quarter, as I previously noted.\nNow moving to Slide 11. Our institutional pipeline was $29 billion at quarter end, consistent with the prior quarter level. Pipeline remains strong and has been running in the $25 billion to $35 billion range dating back to late 2019. Pipeline also remains relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of fee composition. Overall, the pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies. Our solutions capability enabled 30% of the global institutional pipeline and created wins and customized mandates. This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network.\nTurning to Slide 12. Market volatility had a significant impact on our first quarter net revenue. It's the most evident in the $93 million decline in investment management fees from the fourth quarter, as noted on the slide. In prior quarters leading up to the first quarter, we have been generating strong year-over-year net revenue growth, growing at a 17% rate in the second half of 2021. This was being driven by both strong markets and organic growth.\nAs the first quarter unfolded, pressure from market volatility negatively impacted net revenues. As a result, our net revenues were essentially flat year-over-year. We did see improvement in money market fee waivers during the quarter as short-term rates increased and the Fed raised rates 25 basis points in mid-March. The net money market fee waiver impact had been running in the $20 million to $25 million range per quarter. The impact declined to $12 million in the first quarter. We expect the impact will decline to near $5 million in the second quarter. And by the third quarter, we expect little to no impact from money market waivers.\nTotal adjusted operating expenses were up about $10 million or 1% as compared to the first quarter of 2021. $6 million of the increase was due to certain changes to the pricing of transfer agency services that we provided -- that we provide to our funds, which went into effect in the third quarter of last year. The increased impact of property office and technology expenses, which was offset by a corresponding increase in service and distribution revenue.\nTaking this into account, adjusted operating expenses were essentially flat year-over-year. Reductions in employee compensation were offset by higher marketing and G&A expenses, partly due to higher reopening activity in these areas as compared to the first quarter of 2021 when there was no travel. Going forward, the degree of activity in these areas is expected to increase as travel continues to come back.\nMoving to Slide 13. We're very close to our goal of achieving $200 million in net savings this year. In the first quarter, we realized an additional $6.4 million in cost savings; $3 million of the savings was related to compensation expense; and $3 million related to a reduction in property expense as we continue to rightsize our facilities portfolio. The $6 million in cost savings are $26 million annualized, combined with the $167 million in annualized savings realized through 2021 brings us to $193 million in total or 96% of our $200 million net savings expectation.\nIn the first quarter, we incurred $22 million of restructuring costs related to this initiative. In total, we recognized approximately $240 million of our estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs associated with the program. We expect the remaining restructuring costs for the realization of the program to be up to $35 million. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results.\nNow moving to Slide 14. Adjusted operating income decreased $8 million from the first quarter of last year to $495 million, driven by the factors I previously noted. Adjusted operating margin was 39.5%, slightly lower than the first quarter of last year. EPS was $0.56 versus $0.68 a share last year with the main driver being lower nonoperating income.\nIn the first quarter of 2021, equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was $37 million, favorably impacted by the improving CLO valuations at the time as compared to $4 million in the first quarter of 2022. Other gains and losses declined $30 million from last year to a loss of $20 million in the first quarter of 2022, driven by lower mark-to-market valuations of our seed capital due to negative market performance.\nThe effective tax rate was 24.2% in the first quarter. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 24% and 25% for the second quarter of 2022. The actual effective rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items.\nSlide 15 illustrates our ability to drive adjusted operating margin expansion against the backdrop of the client demand-driven change in our AUM mix and the resulting impact on our net revenue yield. Our operating margin 2 years ago in the first quarter of 2020 was 36%. At that time, we reported a net revenue yield ex-performance fees and excluding the QQQ of 41.8 basis points. In the first quarter of 2022, our net revenue yield declined 5.2 basis points to 36.6 basis points, yet our operating margin has improved to 39.5%.\nWe've been building out our product suite to meet client demand, and client demand has been skewed towards lower-fee passive products as evidenced by the mix shift between active and passive AUM. Realizing our business mix is shifting, we continue to be focused on aligning our expense base with these changes. This has enabled the firm to improve and maintain strong operating margin despite the client demand-driven decline in net revenue yields.\nNow a few comments on Slide 16. Our balance sheet cash position was $1.3 billion on March 31, and approximately $708 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements. The cash position improved from the first quarter of '21, even as we deployed $200 million in cash to fund share buybacks in the first quarter. Our leverage ratio, as defined under our credit facility agreement was 0.8x at the end of the quarter. And if you choose to include the preferred stock, the leverage ratio was 2.5x, both being substantial improvements in our leverage profile over the past year.\nAs Marty noted earlier, our stronger balance sheet and financial flexibility put us in position to capitalize on an economically attractive opportunity to early redeem the $600 million of senior notes that have a maturity date of November 30 of this year. As short-term interest rates increased in the first quarter, the make-whole related to an early redemption of the debt became attractive enough to provide a financial benefit to redeem the debt early, and it will be fully redeemed on May 6. This will save us approximately $11 million in interest expense over the period beginning in early May through what would have been the November 30 maturity date.\nThe make-whole and other fees will be approximately $5 million based on current indications, and these will be recognized at the time of redemption, but the savings and the fees will impact interest expense.\nWith respect to our capital strategy, we are committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases. As we stated, we intend to build towards a 30% to 50% total payout ratio over the next several years. We completed the previously announced share buybacks of $200 million in the first quarter, and our Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly common dividend. Overall, we believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to improve liquidity and build financial flexibility, and our first quarter results demonstrate that progress.\nWe remain focused on executing the strategy that aligns with our key areas of focus, continuing to invest ahead of client demand in these areas. At the same time, we're focused on optimizing our organizational model and disciplined expense management. This approach has resulted in a stronger and more resilient operating margin. This has also facilitated stronger cash flows, further strengthening our balance sheet and driving the improvement in our leverage profile, putting us in position to capitalize on opportunities such as the early debt redemption. As we look toward the future, Invesco is in a strong position to deliver value over the long run to all of our stakeholders.\nAnd with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) This call will last 1 hour. (Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nNow I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today. Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.\n\nMartin L. Flanagan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThank you, operator, and thank you, everybody, for joining us and Happy New Year. We did end up 2021 with a strong fourth quarter and momentum going into 2022. So we'll spend a few minutes looking back to the fourth quarter and also take a quick look at 2021 because it really sets the context as we go into the new year.\nOur focus has been and will continue to be on clients and employees as we execute in this COVID operating environment. And we've embedded new ways of working together to deliver outcomes for our clients, and we've maintained our focus on 6 key capability areas: ETFs, factors, index, private markets, active fixed income, active global equity, Greater China and solutions.\nThis approach has helped us generate consistent strong and broad organic growth, and we ended the year crossing over $1.6 trillion in assets under management. And as you can see on Slide 3, our net term -- net long-term inflows of $12.5 billion represents organic annualized long-term growth of 4% despite the market volatility in the fourth quarter.\nThis is the sixth consecutive quarter of strong growth and is a direct result of the investments we've made over time to enhance and evolve our business to meet the needs of our clients, and it also speaks to the broad diversification of our business. Growth was driven by continued strength in our key capability areas as we strategically invest in areas where we see client demand and have competitive strengths.\nFor the year, Invesco delivered the strongest organic growth in our history. We generated over $81 billion of net long-term inflows, representing 7% organic growth rate, which is one of the best in the industry.\nLooking at our specific capabilities, our global ETF platform closed up the year very strong. ETFs generated net inflows of nearly $22 billion in the fourth quarter, including our flagship QQQ product. The QQQ product had an exceptional quarter, generating $13 billion of net inflows. For the year, ETFs globally generated a record $62 billion of net inflows, and we increased our market share in both assets under management and revenue.\nThe Qs had an outstanding year with over $21 billion of net inflows, growing to $215 billion at year-end. QQQ product has become the fifth largest ETF globally. Its popularity has spurred growth in the rest of our global ETF platform and laid the groundwork for the launch of the adjacent fee-generating products such as the Q Innovation Suite.\nWe launched the suite in October 2020, and it has been highly successful, growing to $5 billion in assets under management by the end of 2021. We continue to see clients increasing their allocation to alternative strategies as they search for diversification and higher returns. And Invesco has built a broad real estate to meet client demands. We are confident in our ability to accelerate the growth as we look to the future.\nIn the private real estate business, long-term net inflows were $2.4 billion in 2021, comprised of new acquisition activity of $12.4 billion and investment realizations of $9 billion. Our direct real estate assets under management grew by 12%. Our private credit business, a robust bank loan product demand, resulted in net long-term inflows of $7.5 billion for the year, including the launch of several new CLOs. Our active fixed income business remained strong, generating net inflows of $9.3 billion in the fourth quarter, including $7.1 billion from Greater China and $35 billion for the year, representing organic growth of 13% over the prior year.\nWithin active global equities, although our $45 billion development markets front saw net outflows in the quarter, the fund generated net long-term inflows in 2021 of $1.2 billion, an improvement of $4.3 billion over 2020. On the institutional side, we finished a strong year with solutions-enabled opportunities accounting for 35% of our institutional pipeline. The business in Greater China closed out an exceptional year of growth, with fourth quarter net long-term inflows of $9.5 billion. For the year, net long-term inflows were $28.7 billion, representing organic growth of 32%. Business in China continues to be a source of strength and differentiation, and we expect strong growth in the years ahead.\nOn Slide 4, we highlight a very strong set of results for 2021. In addition to reporting net long-term inflows in 2021, we generated record gross inflows of $427 million, a 37% increase compared to 2020. Net revenues grew 17% over the prior year, helping drive adjusted operating income to nearly $2.2 billion, a 31% increase over 2020. Revenue growth, coupled with strong expense discipline led to a 450 basis point increase in our net operating margin to 41.5%.\nIn the second half of the year, we reported the second highest net operating margin since the company became U.S. listed in 2007. These factors drove a 60% increase in our full year EPS to $3.09. Strength in our business has generated strong cash flows, improving our cash position to a point where we are resuming our share buybacks. We intend to purchase up to $200 million in common shares during the first quarter. We remain focused on continuing to build a stronger balance sheet and improving our financial flexibility for the future.\nI'm pleased with the progress we've made over the last year and even more confident that Invesco is on the right path to sustainable organic growth. And as we look to the future, we're determined to continue delivering consistent organic growth, together with our disciplined approach to expense management, should enable us to generate positive operating leverage while, at the same time, continuing to invest in growth -- the growth of our business and the efficiency of our business.\nI do want to take a moment to thank our employees for their continued resilience, hard work and dedication through this COVID operating environment. Their efforts are delivering the strong results you're seeing from Invesco. The breadth of our capabilities and our competitive strengths position us well as we look forward. We will continue to focus our efforts on delivering positive outcomes for clients while driving future growth and delivering value over the long run for our stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Allison. Allison?\n\nLaura Allison Dukes\n\nSenior MD & CFO, Invesco Ltd.\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with Slide 5. Our investment performance was strong in the fourth quarter with 64% and 75% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or beating benchmark on a 5-year and a 10-year basis. These results reflect continued strength in fixed income and foreign equities, most notably emerging markets and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally.\nTurning to Slide 6. We ended the year with over $1.6 trillion in AUM, a 19% increase over year-end 2020. As Marty noted earlier, our diversified platform generated net long-term inflows in the fourth quarter of $12.5 billion, representing a 4.1% annualized organic growth rate. Active AUM net long-term inflows were $1.8 billion and passive AUM net long-term inflows were $10.7 billion.\nNet market gains led to an increase in AUM of $18.4 billion in the quarter. The retail channel generated net long-term inflows of $3 billion in the quarter driven by inflows in the global ETF products and Greater China. The institutional channel demonstrated the breadth of our platform and generated net long-term inflows of $9.5 billion in the quarter with diverse mandates, both regionally and by capability, funding in the period. Inflows in the Asia Pacific region were particularly strong.\nRegarding retail net inflows, our ETF capabilities generated net inflows of $21.7 billion. Excluding the QQQ, our net long-term inflows were $8.8 billion. As Marty noted, in 2021, our global ETF business generated record net inflows of $52 billion, which was more than 2.5x net inflows in 2020. Our global ETF platform captured 5.6% of net new flows in 2021, increasing our market share of ETF AUM to 4.9% at the end of 2021. Our share capture of incremental ETF revenues was also above market share at 5.2%, excluding the QQQ.\nLooking at flows by geography on Slide 7, you'll note that the Americas had net long-term outflows of $4.3 billion in the quarter. While we saw strength in ETFs and our institutional business, we did see pressure from select active equity strategies, including developing markets and diversified dividend. Our BulletShares suite also experienced year-end maturity activity, which is expected.\nAsia Pacific delivered another strong quarter with net long-term inflows of $12.9 billion. Net inflows were diversified across the region, including a record $9.7 billion of net long-term inflows from our joint venture in China, Invesco Great Wall and $3.2 billion from other countries, including Australia with $1.8 billion and India at $800 million. EMEA, excluding the U.K., also delivered a strong quarter of net long-term inflows totaling $4.7 billion, representing organic growth of 12%. This was driven by strength in ETF, sales of senior loan products and institutional mandates and investment-grade fixed income.\nFrom an asset class perspective, we continue to see broad strength in fixed income in the fourth quarter with net long-term inflows of $9.1 billion. Drivers of fixed income flows include institutional net flows into various fixed income strategies through our China JV in EMEA, global investment grade, stable value and municipal strategies.\nOur alternative asset class holds many different capabilities, and this is reflected in the flows we saw in the fourth quarter. Net long-term flows and alternatives were $3.1 billion driven primarily by our private markets business, which included direct real estate property acquisitions, a newly launched CLO and senior loan capabilities. When excluding global GTR net outflows of $700 million, alternative net long-term inflows were $3.8 billion.\nThe strength of our alternatives platform can be seen through the flows that has generated over the past 4 quarters with net long-term flows totaling over $17 billion, representing a 10% organic growth rate over this time, excluding the impact of GTR net outflows over the period.\nMoving to Slide 8. Our institutional pipeline was $26 billion at year-end. The decline in the pipeline from the prior quarter was due to the funding of several significant mandates in the fourth quarter as reflected in our strong institutional inflows for the quarter. While the size of the pipeline will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, it remains consistently strong, typically running in the $25 billion to $35 billion range, dating back to 2019.\nThe pipeline also remains relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of fee composition. Overall, the pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies. Our solutions capability enabled 35% of the global institutional pipeline and created wins and customized mandates. This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network.\nTurning to Slide 9. You'll note that net revenues increased $40 million or 3% from the third quarter as a result of higher-than-expected performance fees as well as higher average AUM in the fourth quarter. The net revenue yield ex performance fees was 33.4 basis points, a decrease of 1 basis point from the third quarter yield level. The decrease was driven mainly by asset mix shift, including higher QQQ and money market average balances. The incremental impact from higher discretionary money market fee waivers was minimal relative to the third quarter and the full impact on the net revenue yield for the fourth quarter was 0.6 basis point.\nLooking forward, we expect most of the dynamics impacting net revenue yield will continue. In addition, the first quarter contains 2 fewer days than the fourth quarter, which always impacts net revenue yield.\nRegarding discretionary money market fee waivers, given the current prospects for higher rates in the near term, we anticipate that 75% to 90% of these waivers would cease within the first 60 to 90 days after the first 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate. That would result in a recovery of about 0.4 to 0.5 of the negative impact waivers have had on our annualized net revenue yield.\nPerformance fees for the fourth quarter were $53 million, higher than our expectations and were driven by certain portfolios that have annual absolute return performance hurdles, including approximately $20 million from our JV in China. Given the strong influence of the market on these portfolios, these performance fees are clearly difficult to forecast.\nTotal adjusted operating expenses increased 3.1% in the fourth quarter. The increase was mainly driven by the typical seasonal increase we see in marketing and higher G&A expense, which were partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense.\nAlso impacting marketing and G&A expense was an increase in client events and travel in the fourth quarter before we saw the impact of the new Omicron variant. With the impact of the new variant, we have seen a slowdown of travel and in-person client activity in January, and we would not expect first quarter activity to be as high as fourth quarter.\nG&A expense in the fourth quarter also included a nonrecurring $10 million charitable contribution to the Invesco Foundation. The Invesco Foundation exists to support our communities and further progress and pillars of education and financial literacy. We're pleased with the ability to make this contribution at the conclusion of a very strong year.\nAs we look ahead to the first quarter of 2022, consistent with prior years, we expect an increase in compensation expenses related to the seasonal increase in payroll taxes and the reset of other benefits such as our 401(k) plan match. Typically, this is about $25 million to $30 million higher in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter.\nAs noted, one area that's still more difficult to forecast at this point is when COVID impacted travel and entertainment expense levels will begin to normalize.\nMoving to Slide 10. We update you on the progress we have made with our strategic evaluation. In the fourth quarter, we realized $5 million in savings. $4 million of the savings was related to compensation expense, reflecting the planned transition of certain roles in concert with our strategic review, and $1 million related to a reduction in property expense as we continue to rightsize our facilities portfolio.\nThe $5 million in cost savings or $19 million annualized, combined with $148 million in annualized savings realized through the third quarter in 2021, brings us to $167 million in total or 84% of our $200 million net savings expectation.\nAs it relates to timing, the remainder of our net savings will be realized by the end of 2022 as planned. We expect the total program savings of $200 million through 2022 would be roughly 65% from compensation and 35% spread across property office technology and G&A expense.\nIn the fourth quarter, we incurred $32 million of restructuring costs related to the initiative. In total, we recognized nearly $220 million of our estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs associated with the program. We expect the remaining restructuring costs for the realization of this program to be in the range of $30 million to $55 million in 2022. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results.\nGoing to Slide 11. Adjusted operating income improved $16 million to $578 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we have reviewed. Adjusted operating margin was relatively stable at 42%. Excluding the nonrecurring contribution to the foundation, we generated positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter. For the year, the degree of positive operating leverage was 1.8x, underscoring our focus on driving scale and profitability across the company's diversified platform.\nNonoperating income was $51 million driven primarily by recognition of gains from funds that are in liquidation. The effective tax rate was 21.9% in the fourth quarter compared to 24.4% in the third quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance recorded against net operating losses and a decrease in the expense for uncertain tax positions in the fourth quarter.\nWe estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24% for the first quarter of 2022. The actual effective tax rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items.\nSlide 12 illustrates our ability to drive adjusted operating margin improvement against the backdrop of the client demand-driven change in our AUM mix and the resulting impact on our net revenue yield, excluding performance fees. We also illustrate the impact of the exceptional growth of our QQQ product, which does not earn management fees have had on our net revenue yield.\nOur operating margin 2 years ago in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 39.9%. At that time, we reported a net revenue yield of 40.5 basis points. In the fourth quarter of 2021, our net revenue yield declined a little over 7 basis points to 33.4%, yet our operating margin improved to 42%.\nAs Marty noted earlier, the operating margins we have generated in the third and fourth quarters of '21 are the highest since Invesco became a U.S.-listed company in 2007. This is against the backdrop of a mix-driven declining net revenue yield. We have been building out our product suite to meet client demand and client demand has been skewed towards lower fee products, including the highly successful Q22 product.\nGrowth of the QQQ product over this period is remarkable, growing from 7% of our AUM mix in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 13% in the fourth quarter of '21. Even though we do not earn a management fee, a sponsor of the QQQ, we manage the over $100 million annual marketing budget generated by this product.\nGrowth in the QQQ accounts for 2 basis points of the net revenue yield decline over this period shown on this chart. And as I noted earlier, discretionary money market fee waivers account for 0.6 basis point decline in the net revenue yield. The combination of the extraordinary growth in the QQQ combined with a temporary drag for money market fee waivers accounts for over 1/3 of the decline in net revenue yield over this time period.\nRealizing our business mix is shifting, we continue to focus on aligning our expense base with these changes. This has enabled the firm to generate positive operating leverage and operating margin improvement despite the decline in the net revenue yield.\nNow turning to Slide 13, a few comments here. Our balance sheet cash position was $1.9 billion on December 31, and approximately $725 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements. The cash position has improved meaningfully over the past year, increasing by nearly $500 million. We were able to drive improvement in our cash position while also funding the resolution of the remaining contingent liabilities in 2021. These included $294 million in forward repurchase liabilities that we funded earlier in the year and the $254 million in fund shareholder reimbursement to complete the remediation of the MLP matter in the fourth quarter.\nWe also received an insurance recovery of $100 million related to that matter in the fourth quarter. Our debt profile has improved considerably as well. As a result, we've substantially improved our leverage position with a leverage ratio as defined under our credit facility agreement at 0.79x at year-end as compared to 1.37x a year ago. If you choose to include the preferred stock, leverage has declined from almost 4x to 2.47x.\nWith respect to our capital strategy, we are committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases. As we stated, we intend to build towards a 30% to 50% total payout ratio over the next several years by steadily increasing our dividend and resuming a share buyback program. As Marty noted earlier, given our strong and growing cash position, combined with continued opportunity in our valuation, we expect to repurchase $200 million in common shares during the first quarter.\nOverall, we believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to improve liquidity and build financial flexibility, and our 2021 results demonstrate that progress.\nIn summary, 2021 was a very strong year for Invesco. We remain focused on executing the strategy that aligns with our key areas of focus, and we continue to invest ahead of client demand in these areas. At the same time, we're focused on optimizing our organizational model and disciplined expense management. This approach has resulted in strong organic growth, driving positive operating leverage and operating margin improvement. This has also facilitated stronger cash flows, further strengthening our balance sheet and driving the improvement in our leverage profile.\nAs we look towards the future, Invesco is in a very strong position to deliver value over the long run to all of our stakeholders.\nAnd with that, operator, I'd ask you to open up the line for Q&A."

Also joining us for the Q&A portion of the call will be Dan Lippes, our global leader of TAVR and Daveen Chopra, who has global responsibility for TMTT and Surgical.\nJust after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released third quarter 2025 financial results. During this call, management will discuss the results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules and then use the remaining time for Q&A.\nPlease note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements speak only as of the date of which they were made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today.\nAdditionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences can be found in today's press release and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website at edwards.com.\nUnless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to constant currency sales growth which is defined in the quarterly press release issued earlier today. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are also included in today's press release. Quarterly and full year growth rates refer to continuing operations.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernard for his comments.\n\nBernard J. Zovighian\n\nCorporate VP of Transcatheter Mitral & Tricuspid Therapies, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nWelcome for joining us today. We are pleased with the year-to-date performance of the company, including the most recent third quarter, our focus on structural heart has positioned us to execute our growth strategy with agility this year and also give us confidence in 2026 and beyond. This strong Q3 results represent another quarter of double-digit sales growth.\nSales in the quarter grew 12.6% to $1.55 billion driven by our comprehensive portfolio across multiple therapeutic areas, aortic, pulmonic, mitral and [ speed ] as well and as well as an established presence in countries around the world.\nWe were pleased with the better-than-expected results reflecting the performance of our talented employees. We faced strong performance in Q3, we are raising full year sales growth guidance to the high end of a previous 9% to 10% range and are also raising our EPS guidance range to between $2.56 and $2.62.\nAs we look ahead to '26 and beyond, the company is in a good position with multiple growth drivers to deliver sustainable top line growth. While the composition and contribution from product lines and region could vary, you could expect Edwards to grow sales and profitability in line with our commitment from last year. We look forward to talking more about this at the upcoming investor conference in December.\nThis week was an important week for Edwards. And this quarter call comes on the heels of TCT, where I was pleased to see many of you at the conference, physicians feature a significant amount of compelling data on Edward's groundbreaking transcatheter therapies, including SAPIEN, EVOQUE and SAPIEN Ultra. Our unique leadership commitment to high-quality evidence was once again showcased by the multiple late-breaking clinical trials as well as concurrent publication in the New England -- medicine and Lancet.\nOn Monday, at TCT, physicians presented 7-year data for the PARTNER III pivotal trial, which represents the most extensive clinical follow-up to date for low-risk TAVR and surgical patients. The results confirm that rates of all-cause mortality for TAVR remain low and comparable to the surgical control, Additionally, SAPIEN performance and durability indicators were excellent and comparable to SAVR.\nAlso, during the TCT conference 10 years a follow-up on multiple generation of SAPIEN was featured. Long-term data from the PARTNER IIa and the PARTNER IIs [ 3I ] studies demonstrated sustainable performance, excellent durability and consistent clinical outcomes of Edwards TAVR matching the performance of SAVR.\nSo overall, when taken together, the SAPIEN platform has been the most steady valve with more than 15 years of world-class clinical trials involving over 10,000 patients, 10 New England Jurav medicine publication and 1.2 million patients treated around the world. It is clear, but in addition to offering an early clinical benefit with superiority at 1 year for low-risk patients. The excellent performance of TAVR with SAPIEN 3 is now proven at 7 years. This impressive durability is further supported by the 10-year results of the PARTNER II trials.\nAt the end of the day, this groundbreaking evidence sets a new global benchmark, one that is exceptionally reassuring for both patients and physicians. It sets the stage for continued long-term adoption of Sapien to treat patients suffering from aortic stenosis.\nTCT also featured multiple important studies focus on Edward's portfolio of mitral and rice-speed replacement therapies, including the largest real-world registry data on EVOQUE and the 1-year result of the first ever pivotal trial for any transfer -- moral mitral replacement therapy via CIRCLE trial for SAPIEN M3.\nJust over 2 years ago, TRISCEND II 6-month data was presented at TCT 2023. To date, more than 5,000 patients have benefited from this novel therapy solving the large unmet patient needs. And the 1,000-plus patients, the real-world data presented at CRTC demonstrates that the clinical community is embracing this technology broadly across many centers and is excelling at caring for these patients with consistent procedure times and high-quality results for both safety and efficacy. The TVT data on 30 days shows consistent CR elimination in 19% of patients, a very low major life-threatening bleeding rate of 1.3%, a new pacemaker rate of 15%.\nTo put this EVOQUE pacemaker rate into perspective. It is now competitive to the past maker rate seen today in self-expanding TAVR valves available in major regions. It is inspiring to see the practice of medicine progressing for improved patient care.\nTurning to mitral replacement. We know that there are many patients who cannot be treated with by today's existing technology, including trio and TCT in CIRCLE study demonstrated meaningful early benefits for these patients. on all important measures like mortality, quality of life and reinforce the growth potential of this therapy in the years ahead.\nThe introduction of SAPIEN 3 marks the beginning of increased physician awareness and referrals to Bahar team to support treatment for this many patients in need. Over the past decade, we built a comprehensive portfolio of TMTT technologies. These ensure physicians have an opportunity to select the optimal treatment for their mitral and recoil patients, whether replacement or tier, this is creating compounding value across the care continuum for all stakeholders, especially patients.\nAnd in terms of the impact to Edwards, while the contribution to growth from our portfolio of repair and replacement therapy could vary by quarter or year, we know PASCAL, EVOQUE and M3 will be key contributors as TMTT grows to an estimated $2 billion by 2030.\nI am proud of the Edwards team and our physician partners for advancing each of these important clinical trials. Edwards is the world's only company. to provide physicians with a complete portfolio of therapy addressing aortic, mitral, pulmonic and tricuspid valve diseases, built on the foundation of our unique strategy and an unprecedented body of evidence.\nLeveraging our 65 years of deep expertise, we are also extending into heart failure and aortic regurgitation which are next-generation contributors to patient impact and growth. We have aligned our internal resources to support growth across these multiple therapeutic areas. This focus on structural heart has positioned the company for agile execution of our strategy and provide a foundation for sustainable multiyear growth.\nWhen I reflect on all of this, I am proud of our impact when Edwards leads, everyone benefits. Physicians, providers, payers and most importantly, patients who can enjoy restored quality of life and live longer.\nNow I'd like to provide an overview of the third quarter sales performance by product group. In TAVR, our third quarter global sales of $1.15 billion increase 1.6% over the prior year. SAVR growth in the quarter was better than expected as clinicians demonstrated a renewed focus on prioritizing treatment for patients suffering from aortic stenosis.\nDuring the quarter, sales growth increased in multiple regions. Supported by new evidence, guideline updates and expanded education. Growth was comparable in the U.S. and OUS. On a global basis, Edwards' pricing and competitive position remain largely stable. We are pleased that aortic totes management is experiencing significant transformation. Supported by the combination of evidence of superiority in low-risk patients in 1 year, unprecedented data and long-term value performance and durability, expanded asymptomatic indication, and updated ESC EACTS guidelines, combined with the global expert consensus publication.\nThese guidelines for valvular heart disease establish a simplified care pathway for severe AS patients and enable a proactive approach to disease management. They underscore that timely information should be considered for all severe aortic -- patients regardless of symptoms and half function, which is a meaningful step forward from the prior practice of watchful waiting.\nIn the U.S., strong third quarter procedure growth was driven by a continued focus within the clinical community on the importance of timely intervention and streamlining the management of patients with severe AS. We were encouraged by the release of the updated American Society of Echocardiography guidelines which categorize severe AS a critical finding that should be communicated with urgency and encourage echocardiologists to actively participate in patient management.\nThe evolution of policy and guideline changes together with the potential of a new U.S. NCD will provide important catalysts, resulting in a multiyear growth opportunity for U.S. dollar.\nOutside of the U.S., we continue to focus on increasing therapy adoption. Especially in areas where many patients go without care. In Europe, Edwards sales growth was driven by the broad-based adoption of our Sapient platform in addition to the exit of a competitor, which resulted in a rebalancing of the market and a modest contribution to our sales. In Japan, TAVR sales growth continued to improve, reflecting a gradual recovery in market growth. Rest of the World, growth remains strong.\nIn summary, due to our strong Q3 results, we are raising our full year TAVR guidance to 7% to 8% from our previous 6% to 7% range. Longer term, we continue to expect mid- to high single-digit growth in TAVR, supported by proven long-term evidence, new indication, further guideline and policy changes and finally, the potential to serve patients with moderate AS.\nNow let's turn to our TMTT product group. Our differentiated PASCAL mitral and track speed repair system and our unique replacement portfolio of EVOQUE and SAPIEN M3 delivered another strong quarter of growth. Third quarter sales of $144 million increased 53% year-over-year, fueled by the strong performance of both PASCAL and EVOQUE. Globally, we observed a continued trajectory of double-digit global procedure growth for mitral and significantly higher growth for tracker speed.\nThe new ESTS guidelines released in the third quarter also included updates related to the management of patients with mitral and tricuspid diseases which further supports increased global use of transcatheter therapies for these patients. Continued global adoption of PASCAL and EVOQUE in new and existing centers fueled additional substantial growth. We've upsell physician excitement and support of a differentiation of PASCAL and the strong predictable outcome of book, including consistent faced regurgitation elimination.\nOver the last quarter, we released several new groundbreaking clinical evidence updates presented at the ESC Congress pricing to outcomes now show a hard endpoint benefit of EVOQUE versus optimal medical therapy. The data show that the most severe TR patients experienced a combined reduction in mortality and heart failure hospitalization, which is a meaningful advancement.\nIn addition, as previously mentioned, at TCT, we were pleased to share the largest real-world data set of EVOQUE early commercial experience from the STS, ACC, TBT registry. The data showed excellent outcome with consistent elimination of TR and a positive safety profile. We also presented additional TRISCEND I and TRISCEND II sub analysis TCT. And the totality of this new evidence strengthen confidence in tactile replacement therapy with EVOQUE and the impact it can have on this greatly underserved patient population.\nMoving to SAPIEN 3, M3, our early introduction in Europe is off to a great start, providing exceptional clinical patient -- in need and supported by our dedicated field team. The 1-year results from the in-circle pivotal trial studying SAPIEN 3 showed excellent outcome for this first approved transseptal mitral valves. The data showed that in critically sick group of patients who were unsuitable for tear and surgery now had an option to eliminate their remarks, while drastically improving their quality of life with a high survival rate. We now expect U.S. approval by early 2026.\nIn closing with PASCAL, EVOQUE and our SAPIEN M3, we are advancing our vision to meet the complex needs of underserved patients with mitral and tricuspid disease, with a differentiated portfolio comprised of repair and replacement technology. We are pleased with our year-to-date performance in TMTT and remain on track to achieve our full year sales guidance of $530 million to $550 million.\nIn our Surgical product group, third quarter global sales of $258 million increased 5.6% over the prior year. Growth was driven by continued adoption of our Resilient therapy in addition to positive procedure growth for the many patients best treated surgically.\nOur RESILIA portfolio achieved double-digit growth with contribution from spirits, connect and -- risk therapies. We continue to generate dividends on the RESILIA portfolio and expand access globally. We see market approval for connecting -- at the end of the second quarter, we have been able to expand this therapy to patients across European countries during the third quarter.\nI think it is also important to highlight the strong Edward surgical valve performance in the recent PARTNER II -- data. The majority of patients in the control arm were treated with Edward surgical virus and the results were comparable to TAVR at 7 years. This performance reflects over 65 years of valve leadership and innovation.\nIn summary, we continue to expect that our full year 2025 surgical global sales will be in the mid-single digits, driven by resilient portfolio adoption across our key markets and growth in heart valve procedures for patients best treated surgically.\nAnd now Scott will cover the details of the company financial performance.\n\nScott B. Ullem\n\nCorporate Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Edwards Lifesciences Corp.\n\nThanks a lot, Bernard. As Bernard mentioned, we are encouraged with our stronger-than-expected third quarter performance and the progress we made during the quarter, advancing our strategic initiatives. Our double-digit sales growth drove adjusted earnings per share of $0.67, well above our expectations, driven by both stronger-than-expected top line performance and certain spending delayed to Q4.\nOur GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $0.50. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted EPS for this and other items is included with today's release.\nI'll now cover additional details of our P&L. For the third quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.9%, in line with our expectations compared to 80.7% in the same period last year. This year-over-year change was primarily driven by foreign exchange and operational expenses. We continue to expect our full year 2025 adjusted gross profit margin to be within our original guidance range of 78% and 79%. Our guidance continues to assume some pressure from the weakening dollar.\nSelling, general and administrative expense in the third quarter was $515 million or 33.1% of sales compared to $420 million -- $421 million in the prior year. We continue to expect increased SG&A spending this period due to deferral of certain first half spending and investments expected in the fourth quarter to advance our strategy.\nR&D expense was $281 million in the third quarter or 18.1% of sales compared to $253 million or 18.7% of sales in the same period last year. This increase in spending and decrease in R&D as a percentage of sales reflects our intentional strategic prioritization of investments in our expanding structural heart portfolio.\nThird quarter adjusted operating profit margin of 27.5% benefited from our better-than-expected sales performance and the deferral of certain spending to the fourth quarter. As mentioned on our Q1 and Q2 earnings calls, we continue to expect lower second half operating margin levels compared to the first half driven by the timing of key investments. We continue to anticipate full year 2025 operating margin of 27% to 28%, implying a Q4 operating margin in the mid-20s, consistent with prior guidance. We remain committed to annual constant currency operating profit margin expansion over the full year 2025 level in 2026 and beyond consistent with our guidance at last year's investor conference.\nTurning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 16.1% or 16.9%, excluding the impact of special items, in line with our expectations for the quarter. We continue to expect our 2025 tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 15% and 18%.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of the quarter. The Board of Directors has increased the company's repurchase authorization, resulting in approximately $2 billion remaining under the current authorization. Average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter were $586 million.\nBased on year-to-date share repurchases of over $800 million, including the previously announced accelerated share repurchase of $500 million, we now expect lower full year shares outstanding to be between $585 million to $590 million versus original guidance of $585 million to $595 million. Foreign exchange rates increased third quarter reported sales growth by 210 basis points or $24 million compared to the prior year. FX rates negatively impacted our third quarter gross profit margin by 110 basis points compared to the prior year. As a reminder, our program is designed to mitigate the foreign exchange impact on earnings per share compared to our initial guidance for the year.\nAt current rates, we continue to expect FX to have an approximately $30 million upside to full year 2025 sales compared to the prior year. I'll finish with comments related to sales and earnings per share guidance.\nAs Bernard mentioned, we are increasing our underlying growth rate guidance for TAVR to 7% to 8%, with sales of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion and our total company sales growth guidance to now be at the high end of 9% to 10%.\nFor the fourth quarter, we're projecting total company sales of $1.51 billion to $1.59 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.58 to $0.64, bridging to our full year earnings per share range of $2.56 and to $2.62. We're looking forward to providing more forward-looking commentary at our investor conference on December 4. We remain confident in delivering the long-term financial goals for the company and each business unit that we provided at last year's investor conference.\nAnd I do have 1 additional piece of personal news. After 12 years at Edwards, I'm going to be transitioning out of the CFO role by mid-2026. The company has initiated a process to select a successor. We have considered this transition and a CFO succession plan carefully, and I'm confident we'll have a smooth transition. I look forward to serving as a strategic adviser to Edwards after a new CFO is in place.\nAnd now is a good time to pass the baton. The company is in a strong strategic and financial position, and I have confidence that Edwards will continue to perform at a high level in the years ahead. I care deeply about Edwards and know what a special company it is, and it has been an honor and a privilege to serve as CFO for almost half of the company's history as a publicly traded company, and I'm committed to a smooth transition next year.\nSo with that, back to you, Bernard.\n\nBernard J. Zovighian\n\nCorporate VP of Transcatheter Mitral & Tricuspid Therapies, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThank you, Scott. You have been a valued and key partner to me for over 10 years. first, as colleagues on the executive leadership team through the CEO authorization a few years ago. And now in the last 2.5 years since I became CEO. We have worked closely to find the right time for you personally and also for Edwards for the CFO transition and why we will be saving you in your current role, I am pleased that you will continue in the CFO role until the transition occurs by mid-2026, and remain at Edwards as a strategic adviser beyond the transition period. So I am confident that we will have a smooth hand off during this transition, and we are initiating a process to identify the successor.\nIn closing, after more than 20 years of innovation that has benefited more than 1 million patient lives. And this week's 70-year TAVR results. Edward is positioned for strong sustainable growth as many patients remain undiagnosed and untreated.\nMoreover, we are achieving many significant milestone in TMTT that give us confidence about treating the many mitral and -- patients in need. And surgical is positioned for durable long-term growth, driven by a portfolio of differentiated technology.\nIn addition, we are leveraging our structural heart expertise and extending into heart failure and AR, which are next generation contributors to patient impact. Altogether, we are convinced of a tremendous opportunity to drive success in the future through our patient focus, break food technologies and leadership.\nWith that, back to you, Mark.\n\nMark Wilterding\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, Bernard. Before we open it up for questions, I'd like to remind you about our 2025 investor conference on Thursday, December 4 at our headquarters here in Irvine. This event will include updates on our latest technologies views on the longer-term market potential as well as our outlook for 2026. More information and a registration form are available on our website.\nWith that, we're ready to take your questions.\nAs a reminder, please limit the number of questions to 1 plus 1 follow-up to allow for broad participation. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call.\nDiego, over to you."

With me on today's call is our CEO, Bernard Zovighian, and our CFO, Scott Ullem. Also joining us for the Q&A portion of the call will be Larry Wood, our Global Group President of TAVR and Surgical Daveen Chopra, our global leader of TMTT, Wayne Markowitz, our Global Leader of Surgical; and Dan Lippes, Corporate Vice President. Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released second quarter 2025 financial results.\nDuring the call today, management will discuss the results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules and use the remaining time for Q&A. Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections.

Any modifications to such tariffs or any new tariffs could have a material impact on the company's future financial results and guidance. Finally, unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to constant currency sales growth, which is defined in the quarterly results press release issued earlier today. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are also included in today's press release. Quarterly and full year growth rates refer to continuing operations. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernard for his comments.\n\nBernard J. Zovighian\n\nCorporate VP of Transcatheter Mitral & Tricuspid Therapies, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThank you, Mark, and welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before getting into the numbers, let me highlight the many significant achievements we have made across the company. When we introduce our sharpened focused strategy, we did so in anticipation of an asymptomatic AS approval, the expansion of EVOQUE launch the expected introduction of CPN M3 and our strategic entry into structural heart failure and aortic regurgitation, which represents remarkable synergies to our 65 years of valve leadership. These areas represent large and growing opportunities, and we are just getting started. Our focus on structural heart has positioned the company for agile execution of our strategy and provides the foundation for sustainable growth. It is supported by our conviction in mid- to high single-digit TAVR growth over the long term given the undertreatment globally. The potential of our market-leading surgical valve franchise based on compelling ATA resilient data. And finally, the significant patient benefits of our pioneering TMTT technologies. While TAVR is and will remain an important growth driver for our company, Edwards is increasingly defined by a balanced portfolio of differentiated therapies across aortic, mitral and tracker speed that will position us for leadership for many years to come as we help even more patients around the world.\nDuring the call today, we will go into more details on the company's strong second quarter performance across product groups and geographies and our confidence in the outlook for Edwards in the years ahead. We are pleased to report double-digit sales growth in the second quarter, driven by broad-based growth across our unique portfolio of structural heart therapies. Total sales of $1.53 billion grew 10.6% which was better than expected. Based on our strong first half performance and the many catalysts across our portfolio, we are increasingly confident in our full year outlook and are raising our full year 2025 sales growth guidance to 9% to 10% and adjusted EPS guidance to the high end of our original range of $2.40 to $2.50.\nNow I will provide some additional detail by product group for Q2. In TAVR, our second quarter global sales of $1.1 billion increased 7.8% over the prior year. Growth was comparable in the U.S. and OUS. On a global basis, Edward's competitive position and pricing remains stable. TAVR growth in the quarter was better than expected as clinicians continue to adopt our best-in-class Sapien technology. We are encouraged by the renewed focus on TAVR across the clinical community since the early TAVR data released last October. We are pleased with the recent approvals that make the [indiscernible] free platform the first and only TAVR to receive U.S. and European approvals for the symptomatic indication. These two approvals enable all patients diagnosed with severe AS to be evaluated and considered for treatment with TAVR regardless of symptoms.\nThe evolution of policy and guideline changes together with the potential of a new U.S. NCD will provide important catalysts, resulting in a multiyear growth opportunity for TAVR overall. And we remain focused on continuing our deep commitment to advancing evidence for AS patients with 3 important studies in May at the EuroPCR conference, results of the Optum real-world study of more than 24,000 patients demonstrated that intervening on aortic stenosis before symptoms develop reduces the economic and resource burden on the health care system and improves patient outcomes. Additionally, compared with symptomatic severe delaying treatment until the disease progressed resulted in a higher rate of death within 1 year after aortic valve replacement. Alongside data, from the early TAVR trial. These results reinforce the value of early referrals and evaluation by our heart valve team for all patients with severe AS.\nSecond, at the New York Valve conference last month, 10 years outcome from the PARTNER II study were presented under correctly excellent long-term outcomes and durability of Edwards TAVR platform. This is the first FDA-approved TAVR study to report 1-year follow-up and represent the largest TAVR patient cohort studied through 10 years. Finally, new data from the DETECT-A study were also presented the sub analysis demonstrated that electronic provider notification or EcoAlerts, increased both treatment and survival rates in all patients with severe AS. Looking ahead to TCT in October, we expect to be the first company to present 7-year data studying a low surgical risk cohort of TAVR patients. I am proud of our team's commitment to advancing robust dividends to improve outcomes for patients with severe aortic steloses, supported by a decade of clinical research. This significant body of high-quality science underscores the excellent clinical outcomes delivered by Edwards premium Sapien technology, which has benefited over 1 million patients around the world since its launch.\nIn the U.S., we are pleased that the clinical conversations about the successful early TAVR trial have brought a renewed focus to streamlining the management of patients with severe AS, enabling closer follow-up and more timely treatment of patients with aortic stenosis. Outside of the U.S., we continue to focus on the value of our differentiated technology and increasing therapy adoption, especially in areas where many patients go without care. In Europe, the exit of competitor resulted in a rebalancing of market share and a modest contribution to our sales. In Japan, TAVR sales grew in the mid-single digits, an improvement over last quarter and consistent with the company's total sales growth in the region. Rest of the world, growth remains strong. In summary, we are raising our full year guidance to 6% to 7%, up from previous guidance of 5% to 7%.\nLonger term, we are enthusiastic about the mid- to high single-digit growth opportunities in TAVR, supported by the recent early TAVR indication approvals future guideline and policy changes, including an updated NCD. And finally, you have a potential to serve patients with moderate AS I also want to take this opportunity to share with you that Larry Wood, who has been leading the TAVR team has made the personal decision to depart Edwards in early September and pursue a leadership opportunity outside of cardiovascular. We sincerely thank Larry for his 40 years of dedication to Edwards and our patients. During that time, Edwards TAVR has helped more than 1 million aortic stenosis patients around the world. As we heard today, TAVR is well positioned for continued growth and success and we are pleased to announce that [ Dan Lipis ] will assume leadership of TAVR franchise globally.\nWe are fortunate to have a very well-prepared successor who has more than 50 years of deep TAVR experience in the U.S. and Europe, most recently, Dan has also been leading our JPAC region with responsibility for our full portfolio of technologies. I'm very confident that the TAVR leadership team will build on our momentum and deliver long-term success. Dan and Larry will work together on a smooth transition through early September. Now let's turn to our key NTT product group. Our unique portfolio of repair and replacement therapies to treat mitral and reaped diseases drove another quarter of impressive growth with a meaningful contribution to overall company performance.\nSecond quarter sales of $133 million grew 57%, reflecting the strength and differentiation of our portfolio of repair and replacement technologies and demonstrating our team's long-term and steadfast commitment to solving large unmet patient needs. PASCAL and EVOQUE, were both significant contributors to growth as they continue to scale. With the addition of Sapien 3, Edward is uniquely positioned to meet the broad and diverse needs of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve diseases. Mitral tier procedures continue to grow in the double digits globally. And the developing track speed opportunity is growing much faster across both repair and replacement. Adoption of our differentiated PASCAL technology remains strong in both new and existing centers around the world. We continue to see growing interest in the therapy, reinforcing the significant unmet needs of these patients. We are also pleased to announce the completion of enrollment in our 1,000-patient European my class post approval study in patients with both DMR and FMR.\nPublications and presentation of data from this study continue to demonstrate the excellent clinical results delivered by the state-of-the-art Pascal technology. The EVOQUE commercial launch is progressing well in the U.S. and Europe with excellent real-world outcome for patients in line with the successful TICI clinical trial results. Consistent with Edward science-based approach to establishing categories for the many patients in need, we are continuing to generate evidence for EVOQUE. At the recent New York valve conference results from a real-world 176-patient study across 12 centers and 5 countries in Europe demonstrated excellent clinical outcomes that were similar or better than the results shown in [indiscernible] EVOQUE. And we look forward to an EVOQUE late breaking substudy at next month European Society of Cardiology Conference. We have also begun enrollment in the large [indiscernible] clinical trial in Europe. This prospective multicenter study of up to 500 real-world patients with TR disease will track clinical outcomes out to 5 years.\nIn summary, for EVOQUE, there is a great demand for the therapy, and we are continuing to develop important evidence to support expansion globally. We are pleased with the addition of our latest TMTT technology, the pioneering Sapien 3 valve, which received CE Mark approval in Q2 clinical feedback, while early has been positive. We will deploy our differentiated high-value model to support therapy expansion with a continued focus on ensuring access and excellent confirmations. We continue to expect that results from the in-circle pivotal trials studying SAPIEN M3 will be presented at the TCT conference later this year. And we now expect U.S. approval of Sapien 3 to follow in the first half of 2026.\nIn closing, with PASCAL, EVOQUE and the recent Care Span 3, our vision for TMTT has developed into a growth portfolio of groundbreaking fascia repair and replacement technologies meeting the complex need of underserved patients with mitral and tricuspid diseases. We are committed to bringing this impactful therapies to the many patients in need around the world. We are pleased with our year-to-date performance in TMTT and remain on track to achieve our full year sales guidance to $530 million to $550 million. In our Surgical product group, second quarter global sales of $267 million increased 6.8% over the prior year. We continue to see positive procedure growth globally for the many patients best treated surgically with our premium resilient technologies, including [ Spirit ], mitral and Connect.\nOur surgical team is making progress around the world advancing important innovation for patients. We continue to see the impact across the clinical community from the recent presented RESILIA ATM data demonstrated excellent durability and better freedom from reoperation due to structural valve deterioration compared to non-resilient valves. We are also pleased to have received CE Mark approval for Connect in Europe during the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit sales growth in our Surgical product group. And now Scott will cover the details of the company's financial performance.\n\nScott B. Ullem\n\nCorporate Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Edwards Lifesciences Corp.\n\nThanks a lot, Bernard, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bernard mentioned, we are pleased with our better-than-expected Q2 performance and the progress we made during the quarter advancing our strategic initiatives. Our double-digit sales growth drove adjusted earnings per share of $0.67. Our GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.57, which included a onetime charge related to our portfolio of external investments. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share for this and other line items is included with today's release. And now I'll cover additional details of our P&L. For the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.6%, in line with our expectations compared to 80% in the same period last year. This year-over-year change was driven by additional manufacturing expenses related to the expansion of new therapies as well as foreign exchange.\nWe continue to expect our full year 2025 adjusted gross profit margin to be within our original guidance range of 78% and 79% our guidance continues to assume some pressure from the weakening dollar and the impact of announced tariffs, albeit less than initially expected as well as the acquisition of GenaValve, which is not closed yet. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter was $502 million or 32.8% of sales compared to $448 million in the prior year. We expect increased SG&A spending in the second half of the year due to deferral of certain spending year-to-date as well as anticipated spending related to [indiscernible].\nResearch and development expense was $276 million in the second quarter or 18% of sales compared to $272 million or 19.8% of sales in the same period last year. This increase in spending and decrease in R&D as a percentage of sales reflects our strategic prioritization of investments in our expanding structural heart portfolio. The year-over-year improvement in second quarter adjusted operating profit margin of 28.2% benefited from our better-than-expected sales performance and the deferral of certain spending to the second half of the year. As mentioned on the Q1 earnings call, we continue to expect lower second half operating margin levels compared to the first half, reflecting expenses associated with the planned acquisition of Gena valve. We continue to expect full year 2025 operating margin of 27% to 28%. We remain committed to annual constant currency operating profit margin expansion in 2026 and beyond consistent with our guidance at our investor conference in December.\nTurning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 16.1% or 16.8%, excluding the impact of special items in line with our expectation for the quarter. We continue to expect our 2025 tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 15% and 18%. Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30. We Edwards currently has approximately $1 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization. Average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter were $588 million. Based on year-to-date share repurchases, we now expect lower full year shares outstanding to be between $585 million to $590 million, versus original guidance of $585 million to $595 million.\nForeign exchange rates increased second quarter reported sales growth by 130 basis points or $15 million compared to the prior year negatively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 60 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our April guidance, FX rates had a nominal impact on second quarter earnings per share. At current rates, we now expect FX to have an approximately $30 million upside to full year 2025 sales compared to the prior year. I'll finish with comments related to the sales and EPS guidance. As Bernard mentioned, we are increasing our underlying growth rate guidance for TAVR to 6% to 7%, driven by strong performance and our sales guidance range for TAVR to $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion to also reflect stronger OUS currencies. We are also increasing our total company sales growth guidance to 9% to 10%, with sales of $5.9 million to $6.1 million.\nWe now expect full year adjusted earnings per share guidance at the high end of our original range of $2.40 to $2.50. Regarding [indiscernible] and the potential impact on our P&L this year, we are reaching the end of the regulatory review process and expect a decision soon. We remain hopeful that we will be able to close the acquisition during the third quarter. For the third quarter, we're projecting sales of $1.46 billion to $1.54 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 to $0.60. And with that, I'll pass it back to Bernard.\n\nBernard J. Zovighian\n\nCorporate VP of Transcatheter Mitral & Tricuspid Therapies, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThank you, Scott. We are pleased with our strong performance in the first half of 2025 and our outlook for the full year. The milestones achieved showcase the strength of our focused strategy to drive breakthrough innovation in pioneering and leading categories. Looking ahead to '26 and beyond, Edward is positioned to transform care for the many structural heart patients in need. We are confident that our unique innovation strategy supported by the many important catalysts across our portfolio and the exceptional work of our 16,000 employees around the world will deliver significant value to patients the health care ecosystem and shareholders. With that, I turn it back over to Mark.\n\nMark Wilterding\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, Bernard. We're ready to take your questions now. [Operator Instructions]."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce you to your host, Mark Wilterding, Senior Vice President, Global Finance. Thank you, Mark. You may begin.\n\nMark Wilterding\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Alicia, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. With me on today's call is our CEO, Bernard Zovighian, and our CFO, Scott Ullem. Also joining us for the Q&A portion of the call will be Larry Wood, our Group President of TAVR and Surgical; Daveen Chopra, our global leader of TMTT; and Wayne Markowitz, our Global Leader of Surgical. .\nJust after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released first quarter 2025 financial results. During today's call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules and then use the remainder of time for Q&A. Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements speak only as of the date on which they were made and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today.\nAdditionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences can be found in today's press release and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website at edwards.com.\nEdwards' guidance reflects its current estimates of the impact from tariffs that are in effect or has been announced as of the time of this press release and assume such tariffs remain in place for the remainder of 2025. Any modification to such tariffs or new tariffs could have a material impact on the company's future financial results and guidance.\nUnless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to constant currency sales growth, which is defined in the quarterly results press release issued earlier today. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during this call are also included in today's press release. Quarterly and full year growth rates refer to continuing operations and do not include discontinued operations.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernard for his comments.\n\nBernard J. Zovighian\n\nCorporate VP of Transcatheter Mitral & Tricuspid Therapies, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThank you, Mark. Welcome, everyone, and Yes, please? [indiscernible] total company sales grew 8% to $1.41 billion in the first quarter, reflecting the benefits of our broad and differentiated portfolio of therapies to treat patients with structural heart disease. The many milestones achieved in Q1 are the result of our focused strategy and our decades of unwavering dedication to driving breakthrough innovation in pioneering and leading categories.\nCollectively, these milestones mark the significant progress we have made to unlock this large and growing opportunity to transform care for millions of structural heart patients around the world. I'd like to thank our 16,000 global employees for their many contributions to advancing patient care. TAVR growth in the quarter was better than expected as clinicians continue to adopt our best-in-class SAPIEN technology. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we continue to believe that the results of early TAVR trial represents a multiyear growth opportunity that will begin with the expected indication approval in the second quarter and expand with the evolution of policy and guideline changes in the U.S. and globally.\nAnd in late 2026, we look forward to the presentation of the results of a groundbreaking progress trial, which has the potential to further expand the therapy to many new patients with moderate AS. I am proud of our commitment to TAVR innovation and high-quality science that is increasing access to treatment options for all AS patients. We continue to be pleased with TMTT's strong momentum, reflecting our portfolio of differentiated repair and replacement technologies, and we are raising our 2025 TMTT sales guidance range to $530 million to $550 million.\nAs a reminder, our successful TMTT strategy position us to become the first to develop and launch a transcatheter tricuspid valve with EVOQUE in 2024. Today, I am also very proud of the recent approval of our Sapien M3 in Europe, the world's first transcatheter mitral valve replacement system, which will benefit many patients with mitral regurgitation who have limited treatment options. This breakthrough technology demonstrates our team's long-term and steadfast commitment to solving large, unmet patient needs.\nEdwards with EVOQUE, M3 and PASCAL is uniquely positioned to meet the broad and diverse needs of patients with tricuspid and mitral valve diseases. In Surgical, our category-leading business continues to benefit from increasing adoption of our premium RESILIA portfolio in INSPIRIS, MITRIS and KONECT. Edwards continues to invest in surgical innovation and evidence as we expand access to our therapies globally.\nLast week, at the Heart valve Society Meeting, 8-year data were presented, demonstrating the excellent durability of a company's novel RESILIA issue, which is used in a wide range of Edwards surgical platform as well as SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. The results represent the longest follow-up study on the durability of valves which highlights our dedication to pioneering unique innovation with patients of all ages living longer and seeking higher quality of life, the importance of lifetime management has never been greater.\nWe also continue to make steady progress advancing our portfolio of emerging opportunities, which we discussed at our investor conference in December. Our team continued to build capabilities to reach the millions of patients around the world who suffer from structural heart failure. And in aortic regurgitation, we're enrolling patients in joining the pivotal trial for the Edwards J-Valve AR system.\nTurning to our 2025 financial outlook. We are confident in our full year total company sales growth guidance of 8% to 10%. And we have plans in place to offset the estimated impact of a currently announced tariffs and the estimated dilution from the JenaValve acquisition, which we are planning to close midyear. As a result of our plans, we are in a position to deliver on our original EPS guidance of $2.40 to $2.50. Our priorities continue to be serving the patients who count on us and maintaining the highest level of service and support to our physician partners around the world.\nLooking ahead to 2026 and beyond, Edwards is positioned to transform care for the many structural heart patient needs. We are confident that our strategic focus, unique innovation strategy and exceptional work of our employees around the world will deliver significant value to patients, the health care ecosystem and shareholders.\nNow I will provide some additional detail by product group for Q1. In TAVR, our first quarter global sales of $1.05 billion increased 5.4% over the prior year or 6% on when adjusted for billing days, which was a little higher than expected. Growth was comparable in the U.S. and OUS. Edwards' strong competitive position and pricing remained stable globally with some regional variability. I am proud of our team's commitment to leading with science, supported by a decade of clinical research that set the standard for quality evidence and physician decision-making. This significant body of high-quality science from rigorous FDA trials underscores the excellent clinical outcomes delivered by Edwards premium SAPIEN technology.\nLast month, at the American College of Cardiology Conference, new clinical data from the EARLY TAVR trial studying patients with asymptomatic severe AS were released. The data highlighted that delaying -- delayed aortic valve replacement in this patient population was associated with worse outcomes. Additionally, a new study using cardiac biomarkers reveal that the rapid and unpredictable progression of disease. Both studies underscore the need for urgent referrals for treatment, evaluation for severe AS patients regardless of symptoms.\nAlso at ACC, new groundbreaking data from the DETECT-AS study, we are presented. DETECT-AS is the first randomized trial evaluating the impact of physician notification or [indiscernible] for their patient with severe AS that meet treatment guidelines. The study found that these [ ECO alerts ] increased both treatment and survival rate for patients with severe AS. In the U.S., our leading SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA continues to demonstrate strong performance. We are advancing initiatives to help hospitals treat structural heart patients efficiently and manage increasing procedure volumes.\nWe are encouraged by hospitals that have demonstrated the ability to scale to accommodate [ for severe growth ]. We are encouraged by discussion with key clinicians on the long-term impact of EARLY TAVR data to streamline patient care. In addition, we expect asymptomatic indication approval in the second quarter. Outside of the U.S., we continue to focus on the value of our differentiated technology and increasing therapy adoption, especially in areas where TAVR remains underutilized and many patients go without care.\nIn the first quarter, sales growth was supported by the continued expansion of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in Europe. SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA continues to deliver exceptional clinical outcomes reinforcing the differentiation of this best-in-class platform. In Japan, we continue to face weaker procedure growth environment and competitive pressure. We remain dedicated to addressing the significant undertreatment of AS among the substantial elderly population in Japan.\nIn summary, for TAVR, we are maintaining our full year sales growth guidance of 5% to 7%. Long term, we are enthusiastic about the durable mid- to high single-digit growth opportunity in TAVR, supported by the upcoming EARLY TAVR indication approval guideline and policy changes and the potential to serve patients with moderate AS.\nTurning to TMTT. Our unique and increasingly differentiated portfolio drove another quarter of impressive growth with a meaningful contribution to overall company performance. We are pleased with first quarter sales of $115 million, representing growth of about 60% and led by increased adoption and balanced contribution from PASCAL and EVOQUE in the U.S., Europe and globally. We continue to see strong therapy adoption and expansion across both mitral and tricuspid. Globally, mitral TEER procedures continue to grow double digits and the developing tricuspid opportunity is growing even faster across both repair and replacement. PASCAL continues to demonstrate its value for patient care, differentiated features are driving distinguished clinical outcome and adoption is increasing at both new and existing sites around the world.\nThe EVOQUE commercial launch is progressing well in the U.S. and Europe, with continuing excellent patient outcome. At the end of March, we were pleased to see the finalization of the NCD for transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement for patients suffering from tricuspid disease. With the new NCD, EVOQUE is now covered for all Medicare beneficiaries who meet the criteria outlined in the final coverage policy, expanding patient access to this important therapy. We are pleased with the recent approval of the SAPIEN M3 mitral valve replacement system in Europe. This revolutionary transcatheter valve therapy is built on the proven SAPIEN platform, which has been used in more than 8,000 procedures in the mitral position.\nWe continue to expect that results from the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial studying M3 will be presented at the TCT Conference in October 2025. In addition, as part of our deep commitment to advancing science for patients with structural heart disease, a European post market follow-up study is planned to continue evaluation of SAPIEN M3 following patients out to 5 years. As previously shared, we expect U.S. approval of Sapien M3 to follow in 2026. the Launch plan for SAPIEN M3 in Europe is focused on creating a new category as we have done many times before and achieving excellent patient outcomes.\nWith our decades of experience, we are uniquely positioned to bring SAPIEN M3 to the many patients in need across Europe. We will work with all stakeholders to ensure patient access to this novel therapy providing physician training and working with policymakers to establish proper therapy coverage. Edwards is the only company that offers the transcatheter portfolio that includes both replacement and repair treatment option for both the mitral and tricuspid valves, meeting the complex needs of underserved patients. We are committed to bringing this portfolio to patients in need around the world and expect meaningful impact from these advanced therapies in '26 and beyond.\nIn our Surgical product group. First quarter global sales of $251 million increased 3% over the prior year. We continue to see positive procedure growth globally for the many patients, best treated with Edwards premium RESILIA portfolio, including MITRIS, INSPIRIS and KONECT. We continue to generate high-quality evidence on our RESILIA tissue technology. As shown in the 8-year data presented at the recent Heart Valve Society meeting RESILIA tissue valves had significantly improved freedom from structural valve deterioration and freedom from reoperation compared to non-RESILIA valves.\nAlso in the quarter, our surgical team made progress advancing important innovation around the world. MITRIS launched in China with positive surgeon feedback, and we anticipate receiving CE Mark approval for the KONECT aortic valve conduit in Europe before year-end. And now Scott will cover the detail of the company's financial performance.\n\nScott B. Ullem\n\nCorporate Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Edwards Lifesciences Corp.\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot, Bernard. As Bernard mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter total company sales performance and progress on our strategic milestones, which gives us confidence in our full year outlook. We are raising our original sales guidance range for TMTT to $530 million to $550 million, driven by more favorable foreign exchange and continued business momentum. Total company, TAVR and surgical sales growth guidance ranges remain unchanged, but the company is increasing our original total company sales dollar guidance range by $100 million to account for recent movement in FX rates.\nEdwards now expects total company sales of $5.7 billion to $6.1 billion in 2025. So now I'll cover additional details of our Q1 results, starting with earnings per share. We generated adjusted EPS of $0.64 in the quarter with solid operating performance. Our GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.62. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EPS and other items is included with today's release. Moving on to other elements of the P&L.\nFor the first quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 78.7% compared to 78.5% in the same period last year. We are maintaining our full year 78% to 79% gross margin guidance at this stage. However, we do expect some pressure from the weakening dollar, the impact of announced tariffs and the expected close of the JenaValve acquisition. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $466 million or 33% of sales which was better than our expectation for the quarter, driven by lower sequential spending and deferral of certain strategic investments originally planned for Q1.\nResearch and development expense of $255 million in the first quarter was equivalent to 18% of sales, a reduction from 19.6% of sales in the previous quarter. This lower ratio of spending reflects the company's prioritized investments in our structural heart portfolio in areas where we believe there are significant opportunities for breakthrough innovation and profitable growth. Adjusted operating profit margin in the first quarter of 29.1% was driven by better-than-expected sales and favorable mix as well as some variable expenses delayed beyond Q1.\nWe expect pressure on our operating margin as a result of the weakening dollar, the impact of announced tariffs and the expected midyear close of the JenaValve acquisition. However, we are implementing plans to mitigate these anticipated costs, and we maintain our full year operating margin guidance of 27% to 28% and our EPS guidance of $2.40 to $2.50. We continue to expect our 2025 tax rate excluding special items, to be between 15% and 18%.\nForeign exchange rates decreased first quarter reported sales growth by 170 basis points or $22 million compared to the prior year. FX rates positively impacted our first quarter gross profit margin by 40 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our February guidance, FX rates had a nominal impact on first quarter earnings per share. At current rates, we now estimate no impact from foreign exchange on reported sales in 2025 relative to 2024 versus our investor conference guidance of a $100 million reduction. As a reminder, our hedging strategy is designed to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the original EPS guidance we provided in December.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of the quarter. During the first quarter, the company entered into an ASR agreement and repurchased stock through a preestablished plan totaling $300 million. Edwards has approximately $1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter were $588 million.\nWe continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2025 to be between $585 million to $595 million. So I'll finish with one final guidance comment. For the second quarter, we're projecting sales of $1.45 billion to $1.53 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 to $0.65. And with that, I'll pass it back to Bernard.\n\nBernard J. Zovighian\n\nCorporate VP of Transcatheter Mitral & Tricuspid Therapies, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThanks, Scott. Before I close this afternoon, I want to take a moment to acknowledge an important anniversary for the company. It was 25 years ago this month that we rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange and officially began our journey as Edward Lifesciences. Since then, we have transformed care for millions of structural heart patients around the world, solving large and complex patient needs and pioneering therapeutic categories. And Our future is bright, our foundation remains strong, and we will continue to bring new innovation to the many structural heart patients in need around the world. .\nWith that, turn it back to Mark.\n\nMark Wilterding\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, Bernard. We are ready to take your questions. As a reminder, please limit the number of questions to 1 plus 1 follow-up to allow for broad participation. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call.\nAlicia, I'll turn it over to you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mark Wilterding, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nMark Wilterding\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, Kevin. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. With me on today's call is our CEO, Bernard Zovighian, and our CFO, Scott Ullem. Also joining us for the Q&A portion of the call will be Larry Wood, our Global President of TAVR and Surgical Structural Heart; Daveen Chopra, our global leader of TMTT; Wayne Markowitz, our Global Leader of Surgical Structural Heart; and Katie Szyman, our global leader of Critical Care. Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released second quarter 2024 financial results. During today's call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules and then use the remaining time for Q&A.\nPlease note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but are not limited to, financial guidance and expectations for growth opportunities strategy, leverage and integration of acquisitions, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today.\nAdditionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important safety information can be found in the press release, our 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website at edwards.com.\nUnless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to constant currency sales growth, which is defined in the quarterly press release issued earlier today. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are also included in the company's press release.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernard for his comments.\n\nBernard J. Zovighian\n\nCorporate VP of Transcatheter Mitral & Tricuspid Therapies, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us. This afternoon, we issued two press releases, which [indiscernible] the team and I will review in more detail with you now. The first outlining our Q2 results. And the second, highlighting our acquisition of JenaValve, a pioneer in the transcatheter treatment of aortic regurgitation, or AR; and Endotronix, a leader in heart failure management solutions. I will start with our second quarter performance.\nTotal company sales of $1.6 billion increased 8% on a constant currency basis versus the year ago period. In addition, we made important advancements in our clinical research, new product introductions and efforts by Edwards employees to address the unmet needs of many more patients around the world. [indiscernible] growth in the second quarter was lower than expected, yet we are pleased with the increasingly significant contribution from TMTT. Our vision for TMTT is becoming a reality, and our strategic commitment has developed into a growth portfolio of differentiated technology. Overall, Edwards remains well positioned to deliver strong sustainable growth.\nWe also announced this afternoon two acquisitions, JenaValve and Endotronix. We have known these company for many years. Discussions with the companies have been ongoing for some time and the timing of these acquisitions coincided with earnings. We are pleased to expand into two new structural heart therapeutic areas, AR and heart failure, and we will leverage our innovation capabilities with world-class science and clinical evidence to ensure accelerated access to life-saving technologies for patients around the world. Now I will provide some additional detail on Q2 results by product growth.\nIn TAVR, Second quarter global sales of $104 billion increased 6% year-over-year, lower than we planned. Edward's competitive position did not meaningfully change globally, although we experienced some regional pressure and we maintain pricing. We are confident in our differentiated technology, high-quality evidence and the value we continue to demonstrate to patients clinicians and the health care system. We remain focused on continuing our deep commitment to advancing evidence for AS patients.\nAt the New York Valve meeting in June, we presented additional analyses from the PARTNER trials, which demonstrated excellent clinical outcome up to five years in women and patients with small [ analyze ]. Adding to the global body of evidence on the platform, we also anticipate additional data from the [indiscernible] study to be presented at the upcoming ESC meeting in London. [indiscernible] is a prospective randomized study in more than 400 patients across 35 sites in Europe, comparing the safety and efficacy of TAVR versus surgery in women with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. We are actively pursuing significant opportunity to grow TAVR globally over the long term and are proud to continue our deep commitment to advancing science for aortic stenosis patient through the progress and early TAVR trials, which could fundamentally change how AS patients are treated. Early TAVR prior results will be presented at [ TCT ] this year. And we believe if the data are compelling, it could have a meaningful impact on the timing for patient treatment, while also streamlining referral and patient care for all severe AS patients.\nIn the U.S., our year-over-year second quarter TAVR sales growth was slightly below our global constant currency growth rate. We believe our U.S. competitive position was largely unchanged. Second quarter U.S. TAVR sales grew slower than expected. The continued growth and expansion of structural heart therapies, including newly approved [ track-speed ] therapies and other fast-growing structural heart therapies put pressure on hospital workflows, which impacted TAVR. These pressures were also observed in the recent spike in emergent TAVR cases as reflected in claims data as centers adopt these new therapies, and they become part of their standard processes, we expect this will stabilize.\nWe know from experience that hospital have historically demonstrated the ability to scale to support transcatheter procedure growth over time. We believe significant under treatment of severe AS persist evidence demonstrate that a large number of in-system patients currently go untreated. We are accelerating our efforts to improve referrals and treatment rates for patients already in the hospital system who are suffering from severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.\nWe recently launched the Edwards' [ Enact ] patient activation program which leverage a comprehensive cardiovascular AI platform and world-class support to bring real-time insights to TAVR program and improve the quality of care for patients. This first-of-its-kind program is focused on streamlining the identification, evaluation and treatment of severe aortic stenosis patients within the hospital system.\nOutside of the U.S. In the second quarter, our constant currency TAVR sales growth was slightly above our global TAVR growth. In Japan, we generated double-digit sales growth driven by SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. We continue to focus on expanding the ability of this therapy and believe AS remains a significant under treated disease among the substantial elderly population in Japan.\nIn Europe, while share is down slightly on an annualized basis, we were pleased with the momentum driven by the launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. We are pleased with high procedure success rates and exceptional patient outcome. We expect the momentum to continue to build as more centers have experienced with the first choice valves for lifetime management.\nIn closing, we now anticipate second half TAVR sales growth similar to the first half year-over-year growth rate, 5% to 7% full year growth rate versus previously guidance of 8% to 10%. This equates to full year global TAVR sales of $4 billion to $4.2 billion. We believe hospitals are motivated to continue scaling to accommodate increased zinc volume of transcatheter procedures, which will bring tremendous value to patients and the health care system. We remain confident that Edwards is positioned for healthy and sustainable TAVR growth driven by our differentiated TAVR portfolio, our deep commitment to advancing patient care for high-quality clinical evidence and new indications and our investment in patient activation initiative.\nTurning to TMTT. Our deep structural heart expertise has enabled us to significantly advance our portfolio of differentiated technology, including the Pascal repair system, the EVOQUE [indiscernible] replacement system and the SAPIEN 3 [ mitral ] replacement system. Our exciting pipeline of innovation is addressing the large unmet needs for patients with mitral and tricuspid disease. In Q2, we achieved positive results with sales of $83 million, representing a 75% increase versus the prior year. Q2 sales were led by PASCAL globally, and early commercial introduction of EVOQUE in the U.S. and Europe. PASCAL adoption is growing, reflecting its premium differentiation and the value it brings to physicians and patients. We believe the mitral [ tier ] market continues to grow double digit in both the U.S. and Europe. We are excited to bring this therapy to more geographies, more physicians and more patients.\nThe EVOQUE commercial launch continues to progress well. Our disciplined strategy is focused on outstanding patient outcome in centers, investing resources required to grow a successful tricuspid program. We are now opening new centers, both in Europe and the U.S. after having started with our clinical trial sites. We continue to see strong interest in the therapy, which reflects the significant unmet need in this population of patients who have few options for treatment.\nOur early real-world commercial experience has demonstrated excellent clinical results, consistent with [indiscernible] from the [indiscernible] trial. We look forward to presenting the full cohort of [indiscernible] data at the TCT Conference in October. Last month, CMS announced the opening of national cover analysis for transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement. Since EVOQUE was granted FDA breakthrough status, and is utilizing the CMS parallel review process, we believe CMS can move quickly to finalize national coverage.\nSAPIEN 3 remains on track to be our first transcatheter mitral valve replacement therapy to get regulatory approval and launch around the world. We are also pleased to have received a breakthrough designation from the FDA and we completed enrollment in the mitral analyst classification of [indiscernible] arm of our in-circle study. We now expect SAPIEN 3 to receive [ CE ] mark earlier than previously expected by mid-2025, with FDA approval in the U.S. to follow in 2026.\nEarlier this month, we announced the acquisition of JenaValve. JenaValve early-stage technology will add to a growing pipeline of innovative therapy in TMTT, and we expect to close the acquisition later this year. We further expect that JenaValve technology, combined with Edwards expertise in mitral disease will enhance the company's [ TAVR ] technologies to address large unmet structural [indiscernible patient needs and support sustainable long-term growth.\nBased on the first half 2024 momentum and the ongoing global adoption of our differentiated technology, PASCAL and EVOQUE, we are increasing full year sales guidance for TMTT to the higher end of our previous $320 million to $340 million range. We remain confident that our unique portfolio strategy with repair and replacement therapies for both mitral and tricuspid disease will offer clinicians the broader set of options needed to treat this complex underserved patients. The advancement of our long-term TMTT strategy has positioned us for strong sustainable growth over many years, driven by a growing portfolio of innovative therapies.\nIn surgical structural Heart, second quarter sales of $264 million increased 5% over the prior year. Growth was driven by strong global adoption of Edward's premium surgical technologies INSPIRIS, MITRIS and KONECT. We continue to see positive procedure growth globally for the many patients [ best trued ] surgically including those undergoing complex procedures. We continue to expand the overall body of [indiscernible] evidence and have completed enrollment in the U.S. and Canada for a momentous critical trial studying resilient performance in the mitral position. [ Mitral ] adoption in Europe is ramping up, and we are pleased to have been granted reimbursement for the device in France earlier than expected. In summary, we remain confident that our full year 2024 surgical sales will be 6% to 8% driven by continued adoption of our resilient portfolio and growth in overall heart valve surgeries.\nIn Critical Care, second quarter sales were $246 million which increased 7% versus the prior year. Growth was led by our pressure monitoring devices using the ICU with strong contribution from our smart recovery technologies including the Acumen IQ sensor. Demand was also strong for [indiscernible] transcatheter. Critical Care remains focused on driving growth through smart recovery and smart expansion which are designed to help clinicians make more informed decisions and get patients home to their family faster. Since announcing the sales of critical care to [ Becton Dickinson ] in June, our team has made significant progress, and we plan to close by late Q3. I want to thank all of them for their hard work and dedication.\nTurning down to the strategic acquisition of JenaValve and Endotronix. These acquisitions provide an expanded opportunity in new therapeutic areas to address the unmet needs of AR and heart failure patients around the world. Furthermore, the acquisition reflects our deep commitment to advancing patient care through our unique strategy and reinforce our confidence in Edwards sustainable long-term growth. Starting with JenaValve, a pioneer in the transcatheter treatment of AR, a deadly disease that impacts more than 100,000 patients in the U.S. alone and is largely untreated today. Edwards anticipate U.S. FDA approval of a JenaValve [indiscernible] system in late 2025, which will represent the first approved therapy for patients suffering from AR. Edward will invest to accelerate development of this novel technology to enable earlier patient access. As the pioneers in valve innovation, we believe we are best positioned to leave to lead this next frontier of aortic valve disease treatment. We expect this to be the beginning of a long-term iterative strategy similar to TAVR.\nTurning to Endotronix. Edwards made its first investment in the company in 2016. So we are very familiar with the technology, the opportunity and the employees, many structural heart patients Edward [indiscernible] today also suffer from heart failure with a limited options. This acquisition will expand Edwards Structural Heart portfolio into a new therapeutic area to address the large unmet needs of patients suffering from heart failure, which we believe has a significant long-term growth opportunity. Last month, Endotronix received FDA approval for [ Cornella ], an implantable preliminary artery pressure sensor that directly measure the leading indicator of congestion, following the publication of the successful U.S. pivotal trial. We are pleased to enter the structural heart [indiscernible] area with innovation, world-class science and clinical evidence to provide access to life-saving technologies for patients around the world. We anticipate this investment will strengthen its leadership in structural heart innovation and represent long-term growth opportunities. Minimal revenue contribution from JenaValve and Endotronix is expected to begin late in 2025.\nAs you can tell, we have a lot of positive momentum and many catalysts across our core businesses, TAVR, TMTT and Surgical, combined with opportunities to reach new patient population.\nAnd now I will turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott B. Ullem\n\nCorporate Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Edwards Lifesciences Corp.\n\nThanks a lot Bernard, [ so we're obviously not satisfied ] [indiscernible] quarter total company sales performance where TAVR sales growth came in below our expectations. However, it's important to understand broader context, we were pleased that TMTT continues to outperform our expectations. And overall underlying sales growth, including critical care, was nearly 8%, adjusted EPS was $0.70. GAAP earnings per share of $0.61 included onetime separation expenses related to the sale of Critical Care. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release.\nSo now I'll cover additional details of our P&L, which reflects total company results, including Critical Care. Note that Critical Care will be presented as a discontinued operation in the 10-Q we will file next week. As we noted in the press release, we'll provide Q4 2024 information reflecting the sale of Critical Care and the acquisitions announced this month when we report third quarter results.\nFor the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.1% compared to 77.7% in the same period last year. Last year's second quarter gross profit margin benefited from a more favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. We expect Edwards Q3 adjusted gross profit margin, including critical care to be in line with Q2, driven by high-value technologies that yield strong gross profit margins. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $509 million, or 31.2% of sales compared to $469 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by an expansion of field-based personnel to support growth of our transcatheter therapies including the launch and rollout of PASCAL and EVOQUE. Adjusted research and development expenses in the second quarter grew 12% over the prior year to $303 million or 18.6% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity.\nTurning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 5.2% or adjusted 8.4%. Our unusually favorable non-GAAP rate in the second quarter reflects several positive onetime items that were recorded during the quarter. This unexpected favorability in our tax rate benefited earnings per share by $0.04 in the second quarter. Foreign exchange rates decreased second quarter adjusted sales growth by 120 basis points or $17.6 million compared to the prior year. FX rates negatively impacted our second quarter adjusted gross profit margin by 60 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. Free cash flow for the second quarter was reduced $47 million for payments associated with special activities relating to the separation of Critical Care. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted free cash flow was $333 million. First half adjusted free cash flow was $539 million. We expect to receive cash from the sale of Critical Care in the third quarter.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of June 30. And now I'll finish this update with comments about our previously announced sale of Critical Care as well as guidance relating to our acquisition announcements. We announced on June 3 that Edwards entered into an agreement to sell Critical Care to [ BD ], and we are planning to close the sale late in the third quarter. During the second quarter, we recorded $80 million of onetime costs associated with the sale. Additional onetime costs will be incurred throughout 2024. We expect Q3 sales, including the assumption that we own Critical Care for the full quarter of $1.56 billion to $1.64 billion, and Q3 earnings per share of $0.67 to $0.71. We do not expect the recently announced acquisitions to contribute to Edwards sales in 2024. We intend to provide fourth quarter guidance reflecting the sale of Critical Care and the acquisitions announced this month when third quarter results are reported in October. We will also provide 2025 guidance at our investor conference in New York on December 4. In the meantime, I'll share a few early expectations for 2025.\nNext year, we expect minimal revenue from acquisitions while we are planning on incremental operating expenses from these early-stage companies, partially offset by operational efficiencies we plan to realize following the sale of Critical Care. We do not expect increased operating efficiencies to completely offset the loss of profits from the sale of Critical Care in 2025, but we are planning healthy long-term profit growth. In addition, we plan to maintain a strong balance sheet to support continued internal and external investments as well as opportunistic share repurchase.\nMost importantly, we are confident in the moves we have made to reshape our portfolio of technologies to focus specifically on structural heart. The sale of Critical Care provides extra management bandwidth as well as additional liquidity to fund external growth investments. And at the same time, our original vision for TMTT is becoming a reality, and the early-stage investments we made in companies like JenaValve and Endotronix positioned us to acquire high-quality and high potential businesses with talented employees. We have other jewels in our portfolio of internal and external investments that will benefit Edwards in the years ahead. Over the long term, we see an exciting future with expanded opportunities in large and growing markets, which we believe will result in sustainable double-digit revenue and earnings per share growth.\nSo with that, I'll pass it back to Bernard.\n\nBernard J. Zovighian\n\nCorporate VP of Transcatheter Mitral & Tricuspid Therapies, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThank you, Scott. So let me share a few closing thoughts. In TAVR, we have significant opportunities, and we are committed to growing globally by advancing science over the long term. Progress and early TAVR trials could fundamentally change our AS patients are treated. In TMTT, our deep expertise enabled us to significantly advance our exciting portfolio of innovation and our long-term TMTT strategy has positioned us for strong sustainable growth over many years. In Surgical Structural Heart, we continue to see strong global adoption of our premium surgical technology.\nOur JenaValve and Endotronix acquisitions provide an expanded opportunity in new therapeutic areas. The both represents significant long-term opportunities. We remain confident that our innovative therapy will allow Edward to treat more patients around the world and continue to drive strong organic growth in the years to come. As patients and clinicians increasingly recognize the significant benefit of transcatheter-based technology, we remain as optimistic as ever about the long-term growth opportunity.\nWith that, I will turn it back to Mark."

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mark Wilterding, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin.\n\nMark Wilterding\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks a lot, Diego, and good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. With me on today's call is our CEO, Bernard Zovighian, and our CFO, Scott Ullem. Also joining us for the Q&A portion of the call will be Larry Wood, our Global President of TAVR and Surgical Structural Heart; Daveen Chopra, our global leader of TMTT; Wayne Markowitz, our Global Leader of Surgical Structural Heart and Katie Syzman, our Global Leader of Critical Care.\nJust after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released first quarter 2024 financial results. During today's call, management will discuss these results included in the press release and accompanying financial statements and then use the remaining time for Q&A.\nPlease note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but are not limited to, financial guidance and expectations for longer growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they were made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today.\nAdditionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in the press release, our 2023 annual reform on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website at edwards.com.\nFinally, unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to constant currency sales growth, which is defined in the quarterly press release issued earlier today. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned in this call are also included in today's press release.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernard for his comments. Bernard?\n\nBernard J. Zovighian\n\nCorporate VP of Transcatheter Mitral & Tricuspid Therapies, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThank you, Mark. We are pleased with our total company performance with first sales growth of 10% to $1.6 billion versus the year ago period. As a result, we are raising our 2024 set to the high end of 8% to 10%.\nAs we look ahead, I'd like to share some perspective about the strategic direction of our company. Edwards is well positioned to extend our leadership and deliver sustainable growth, driven by the strategic investments we have made across our transcatheter platforms to address the large and growing needs of patients impacted by aortic, mitral and tricuspid disease. We remain confident in the many opportunities to grow TAVR over the long term. In addition, TMTT is becoming an increasingly significant contributor to Edwards growth, and we expect this will continue.\nAn important element in our valve innovation leadership is our advanced tissue technology. We have been an innovator in tissue technology for more than 50 years and we are pleased with our latest [ SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA ]. With differentiated evidence of advanced durability, [ technology ] is used across our comprehensive portfolio with a focus on lifetime management of a patient we serve. We are pleased that 0.5 million of patients will benefit from this tissue technology by the end of 2024.\nAs the global leader in structural heart, we remain deeply committed to bringing the highest key evidence, groundbreaking technology and world-class physician support to advance science and meaningfully improve patient care. This year, we are already making significant progress on multiple clinical trials and next-gen technologies.\nIn January, we achieved an important milestone with the completion of patient treatment in [ progress ], a pivotal trial studying the treatment of moderate aortic stenosis patients, a population estimated to be twice as large [ severe ] aortic stenosis. In February, EVOQUE became the first transcatheter therapy to receive U.S. FDA approval for the treatment of patients with tricuspid regurgitation. EVOQUE is a groundbreaking treatment options that not only have the potential to improve quality of life but also shown favorable clinical trends in all-cause mortality, reintervention and heart failure hospitalization.\nIn March, at the annual CRT Conference, we announced compelling results from 2 large real-world studies demonstrating continued excellent outcome for patients treated with the Edward SAPIEN valve platform. And earlier this month, at the American College of Cardiology Conference, we announced data from the [ Hurdle ] study initiated by Edwards in 2021 with our partner at NFL Alumni Health, the study examine the prevalence of structural heart disease among groups historically known to experience disparities in access to care. Edwards is committed to helping identified and dismantle barriers to access for communities that are [ undersale ] due to race, gender and socioeconomic status.\nEach of these reflect our deep commitment to advancing patient care through our differentiated strategy and reinforce our confidence in sustaining the growth of transcatheter-based structural heart intervention.\nNow I will provide some additional detail on Q1 results by product group. In TAVR, first quarter sales of $1 billion increased 8% year-over-year when adjusted for billing days. Q1 marked the first quarter that Edwards TAVR sales exceeded $1 billion, an exciting milestone for our team and a testament to clinician confidence in our leading technology. Performance was driven by growth in the U.S. and Japan, Edward's global competitive position and selling prices were both stable. In the U.S., our year-over-year first quarter TAVR sales growth rate was higher than our global constant currency growth rate. We estimate total procedure growth was stable. Procedure volumes increased as the quarter progressed.\nWe remain pleased with the continued performance of our best-in-class TAVR platform. SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA, which build on Edward's long-standing leadership in tissue technology and durability. This innovative technology now makes up the majority of our sales in the U.S. This platform is supported by the robust real work data for more than 10,000 patients in the TVT Registry that demonstrated excellent outcomes across hundreds of centers.\nThe technologies optimized tissue treatment is designed to extend durability of a valve, a feature that will be increasingly important as the therapy continues to treat patients with longer life expectancy. We are also proud to continue our deep commitment to advancing science for AS patients through the progress and early TAVR trials. As discussed in January, we completed enrollment and treatment of patients in progress, approximately 2 years of expectation. We also expect to release the results of early TAVR at the TCT Conference this year. Symptom assessment is one of the most significant barriers to referral and the early TAVR trial evaluates the impact of TAVR on asymptomatic patients with severe AS. We believe if data are compelling, early TAVR may have a meaningful impact on deciding when to treat patients while also streamlining [ ran ] and patient care for all severe AS patients.\nOutside of the U.S., in the first quarter, our constant currency TAVR sales growth was slightly below our global TAVR growth, strong growth in Japan and the rest of the world was partially offset by slower-than-expected growth in Europe. In our results were softer than expected in Q1. But we expect full year 2024 performance to normalize. We are actively preparing for the launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in Europe, and we anticipate introducing the technology into the European market in Q2.\nIn Japan, we continue to see strong TAVR adoption driven by SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. We believe AS remains a significantly undertreated disease among the substantial elderly population and continue to focus on expanding the ability of an evidence supporting this therapy.\nIn closing, we are confident that Edwards is positioned for healthy and sustainable TAVR growth well into the future, driven by our element of differentiated TAVR technology our deep commitment to advancing patient care through high-quality clinical evidence and our investment in patient activation initiatives.\nImportantly, we are proud of our groundbreaking research into the treatment of AS through our early TAVR and PROGRESS trial, which could fundamentally change how AS patients are treated. We remain confident in our full year TAVR sales growth of 8% to 10%. We expect higher year-over-year second half growth rate than in the first and second quarter.\nTurning to TMTT. Positive momentum with our unique and broad portfolio strategy for both repair and replacement therapies for mitral and tricuspid patients. We made significant progress in advancing important technologies, including the PASCAL [ wider ] system, the EVOQUE pill replacement system and the SAPIEN 3 [ Ultra RESILIA ] replacement system. We are the only company with multiple approved mitral and tricuspid therapies backed by world-class evidence to improve patient care.\nIn Q1, we achieved positive results with sales of $73 million, representing a 22% increase versus the prior year. The majority of Q1 sales were driven by expanded adoption and new site activation of PASCAL supported by continued double-digit tier market growth in the U.S. and Europe. We are also pleased with strong physician feedback and excellent procedural outcome with the EVOQUE, [ faceted ] valve in both the U.S. and Europe.\nWith this replacement technology, we see the unique elimination of tricuspid regurgitation, significant quality of life improvement for patients and favorable trend in all-cause mortality and heart failure specialization. The increasing physician demand for EVOQUE is a clear indication of unmet need and the potential for this therapy to treat a very large patient population.\nWe continue to invest in expanding our high-touch field organization globally to support this therapy in order to continue to achieve excellent outcome for each patient. Given the strong adoption of our differentiated technology, PASCAL and EVOQUE, we are raising full year TMTT guidance to $320 million to $340 million versus previous guidance, which was the higher end of $280 million to $320 million range. We are confident that our unique portfolio strategy with repair and replacement options for both mitral and tricuspid will offer clinicians the broad set of therapies necessarily to effectively treat many patients in need. This strategy positions us for global leadership, sustainable long-term growth and an increasing contribution to overall Edwards growth.\nIn Surgical, first quarter sales of $266 million increased 8% over the prior year. Growth was driven by strong global adoption of Edwards premium surgical technologies INSPIRIS, MITRIS and [ Connect ]. We continue to see positive procedure growth globally for the many patients, best treated surgically, including for both undergoing complex procedures. We continue to expand the oral body of evidence in multiple technologies and multiple valves and now expect U.S. and Canada enrollment of our Momentis clinical trial studying RESILIA performance in the mitral position to be completed in Q2 2024, 1 year ahead of expectation.\nThe study, we'll continue to open new sites in Europe and Latin America with global enrollment continuing into 2025. We are now raising our full year surgical sales guidance to 6% to 8% and versus expectation of mid-single-digit growth.\nIn Critical Care, variability of demand led to better-than-expected first quarter sales of $251 million which increased 14% versus the prior year, driven by contribution from all product lines. Growth was led by our smart recovery technologies, including the Acumen IQ sensor. Demand was also strong for our [ fungus ] transcatheter and pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU.\nCritical Care remains focused on driving growth through smart recovery and smart expansion which are designed to help clinicians make more informed decisions and get patients home to their family faster. We are now confident in raising our full year critical sales guidance to 8% to 10% versus previous expectation of mid-single-digit growth. Since announcing the spin-off of Critical Care in December, our team has made significant progress, and I want to thank all of them for their hard work and dedication.\nScott will provide additional details. And now I will turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott B. Ullem\n\nCorporate Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Edwards Lifesciences Corp.\n\nThanks a lot, Bernard, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bernard mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter total company sales performance and progress on our strategic milestones. In addition, we achieved $0.66 of adjusted earnings per share. Our GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 included onetime expenses associated with our planned spin-off of Critical Care. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted EPS for this and other items is included with today's release.\nFor the second quarter, we're projecting sales of $1.62 billion to $1.70 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.67 to $0.71. And now I'll cover additional details of our P&L.\nIn Q1, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76% compared to 77.5% in the same period last year. This expected year-over-year reduction was driven by a more favorable impact from foreign exchange in the prior year. We continue to expect our full year 2024 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%, driven by high-value technologies that yield strong gross margins.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $490 million or 30.6% of sales compared to $436 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by an [ extended ] of transcatheter field-based personnel in support of our growth strategy. We expect full year 2024 SG&A as a percent of sales to be approximately 30% as we continue to invest in field-based personnel and patient activation initiatives.\nResearch and development expense in first quarter grew 9% over the prior year to $285 million or 17.8% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter aortic valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect R&D to be 17% to 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence for our structural heart disease initiatives, with the goal of treating even more patients.\nTurning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 14.3% or 14%, excluding the impact of special [ items ]. Our favorable non-GAAP rate in the first quarter includes a higher-than-expected benefit from stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our 2024 tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 15% and 17%.\nForeign exchange rates decreased in first quarter reported sales growth by 40 basis points or $5 million compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our first quarter gross profit margin by 160 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our January guidance, FX rates had a nominal impact on first quarter earnings per share. At current FX rates, we now expect a $70 million or 1% negative impact to full year 2024 sales versus the prior year.\nRegarding the previously announced spinoff of Critical Care, preparations are ongoing. We anticipate completing the unaudited carve-out financial statements next month and we are on track to obtain a tax-free ruling from the IRS by year-end. We are currently assessing capital structure options for the spin-off company, and we plan to share details with investors later this year.\nDuring the first quarter, we incurred $41 million of onetime costs associated with the spin-off. Additional onetime costs will be incurred throughout 2024. Free cash flow for the first quarter was reduced by a $305 million deposit contingent upon the resolution of a tax dispute and $20 million of payments associated with the spin-off of Critical Care. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted free cash flow was $206 million, and we continue to expect full year 2024 adjusted free cash flow will grow to between $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion.\nSo before turning the call back over to Bernard, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet of approximately $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2024 to be between $600 million and $610 million of approximately $1 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.\nAnd so with that, I'll pass it back over to Bernard.\n\nBernard J. Zovighian\n\nCorporate VP of Transcatheter Mitral & Tricuspid Therapies, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThank you, Scott. We are off with a strong start to the year as we continue to focus on helping even more patients worldwide and driving growth with leading innovative technologies. We remain confident in our increased 2024 financial outlook and look forward to launching breakthrough technologies and progressing multiple important clinical trials. We're aggressively investing in our future.\nIn closing, we believe Edwards is uniquely positioned to deliverable growth driven by our significant investment focused on structural heart to address the large growing needs of patients impacted by aortic, mitral and tricuspid disease.\nWith that, I pass it back to Mark to open up Q&A."

At our recent investor conference, I introduced our exciting vision of a new era of structural heart innovation to address significant unmet patient needs. Today, I will build on that theme and share key highlights of our team's strong performance in 2023 as well as our confidence in 2024. We are pleased with our strong 2023 financial performance with full year sales up 12% to 6 billion, including strong growth across each of our 4 product groups. We invested more than 1 billion in research and development, and we achieved key strategic milestones, including the introduction of new technologies and indication expansion to ensure sustainable healthy growth in veneer, mid and long term. We exited the year with strong momentum with Q4 growth of 13% and TAVR growth of 12%. These results were better than expected, driven by our broad portfolio of innovative therapies.\nIn 2024, we are well positioned to enter a new era of structural heart innovation. In TAVR, we are strengthening our leadership. We are experiencing strong adoption of our flagship SAPIEN 3 Ultra resilient and continuing enrollment in our Alliance pivotal trial for our next-gen TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4. In January, we achieved a very important milestone with the completion of enrollment in progress, a pivotal trial studying the treatment of moderate aortic stenosis patients. a population estimated to be twice as large as severe ortictilosis. This randomized trial enrolled approximately 750 patients, 2 years ahead of schedule. At TCT later this year, we plan to present data from early TAVR, a pivotal trial studying the treatment of patients with severe aortic stenosis, but without sentence, we believe that all these initiatives position us for healthy, sustainable TAVR growth well into the future. In TMTT, we achieved significant milestones with continued Pascal global expansion and the introduction of EVOQUE in Europe. In Germany, EVOQUE was recently granted NUB reimbursement status 1, a very important step in therapy adoption. I am also pleased to announce that EVOQUE recently became the first transcatheter therapy to receive USFDA approval for the treatment of TR patients.\nThis is an exciting development for a wide range of U.S. patients. It will enable access to a groundbreaking treatment option that not only has the potential to significantly improve their quality of life, but also shows [ furtherable ] clinical trends in all-cause mortality, reintervention and heart failure hospitalization. With the ongoing introduction of EVOQUE, we are now offering a unique and broad portfolio of trans-catheter repair and replacement solution for mitral and test patients. In addition, the completion of enrollment in the pivotal trial studying SAPIEN M3 put us on track to further enhance our portfolio. I am confident that we are reaching an inflection point as the only company with a commercially approved portfolio of catheter-based technologies to treat the millions of patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid disease. In addition to the meaningful progress of TAVR and TMTT.\nWe are pleased with the company innovative Resilient issue, which was pioneered by our surgical business. We are on track to treat 0.5 million patients with resilient-based hard valve by the end of 2024, supported by 7 years of clinical evidence. The previously announced spinoff of Critical Care is progressing as planned and will enable our sharpened focus on structural heart. As a result, Edward's 2025 organic sales growth rate will be even more distinguished. In addition, this will give us more agility, increase our pace of innovation and provide an expanded opportunity to serve a large and growing patient population. Because we are solely focused on structural heart disease, we are uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable growth and external leadership. Now I will provide some additional detail by product group. In TAVR, our full year 2023 global sales of $3.9 billion increased 10.6% year-over-year. Our U.S. and OUS sales growth rates were similar. In the fourth quarter, our global TAVR sales of 979 million increased 12% year-over-year. Performance was driven by double-digit growth in the U.S., Europe and Japan.\nThe company competitive position was stable globally and local selling price were also stable. In the U.S., we remain pleased with the continued expansion and adoption of a SAPIEN free ultra resilient platform. This technology builds on Edward's long-standing leadership in tissue technology and durability by combining advancements in tissue science with the industry-leading Sapien free Ultra valve. Developing safe effective and durable heart valve requires significant long-term commitment, and we are proud to be on 65 years on valve innovation while leveraging the expertise and know-how of more than 2,000 engineers and R&D specialists across the company. We are proud of uninterrupted leadership in structural heart and will continue to invest vigorously in these platforms. In addition, our scaling of patient activation initiatives, along with next-gen TAVR and additional evidence on asymptomatic and moderate AS patients position us for healthy, sustainable TAVR growth well into the future.\nOutside of the U.S., in the fourth quarter, our double-digit growth was comparable with our global TAVR growth, driven by Europe and Japan. Long term, we continue to anticipate excellent opportunities for growth. As the international adoption of TAVR therapy remained quite low in many regions. In Europe, Edwards sales growth was driven by the broad-based adoption of our [indiscernible] platform. It is encouraging that the growth in Q4 was widespread across all major countries. Looking ahead, we are pleased with the recently announced [ CE Mark ] approval for SAPIEN 3 ultra resilient, and we are planning for a disciplined launch. We were pleased with our sales growth in Japan, and as expected, we grew faster than overall procedural growth. After more than 20 years of rigorous clinical experience and over 1 million patients treated with SAPIEN around the world, our TAVR platform is positioned for continued global leadership and strong sustainable growth. Given the undertreatment rates, we are confident in the future of TAVR, driven by greater awareness, patient activation, a platform that delivers lifetime management for AS patients, advances in new technologies such as resilient as well as indication expansion and increased global adoption.\nTurning to TMTT now. In 2023, we remain focused on our key value drivers to unlock the significant long-term opportunity for patients, a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive clinical care results to support approvals and adoption and favorable real-world clinical outcomes. Based on the deep learnings we have achieved from our clinical trial and real-world experiences, we have carefully constructed a strategic portfolio of leading transcatheter technologies to provide both repair and replacement solutions for mitral intricacy patients. Pascal Precision, EVOQUE and SAPIEN 3 will provide best-in-class therapies to treat a broader range of patients. Full year global sales of 198 million increased 67% versus the prior year. TMTT fourth quarter sales of 56 million increased 71% versus the prior year. Q4 sales were driven by the accelerating adoption of our differentiated Pascal Precision platform and activation of more centers across the U.S. and Europe. We were encouraged by the ongoing double-digit growth of overall transcatheter H2 repair procedure, which highlights the large unmet patient need. We continue to expand global access of Pascal Precision in new countries, including Japan, where we recently completed our first cases.\nSince launch, we have proudly treated more than 20,000 patients around the globe with Pascal repair system. In mitral replacement, we have received FDA approval for SAPIEN 3 continued access program. physicians are continuing to patients with this novel therapy. In tricuspid replacement, we initiated the launch of EVOQUE in Europe, with a focus on outstanding outcomes and the goal of eliminating tricuspid regulation in patients. And in the U.S. Following the recent early FDA approval, we are initiating the introduction of its novel therapy and building the foundation for long-term expansion. As we did for TAVR, we are focusing on best-in-class physician training, generating more evidence and achieving excellent patient outcomes. We are grateful for the strong ongoing collaboration with clinicians all over the world to provide the treatment options to many patients suffering from tricuspid valve disease. In tricuspid repair, the Class II TR pivotal trial with PASCAL continues to enroll well, and remains on track to complete enrollment by the end of this year.\nAs a summary for TMTT, we are reaching an inflection point with the only portfolio of approved catheter-based mitral and tricuspid technologies. We remain committed to bringing our differentiated therapy to patients with this live frightening disease and believe our strategy positions us well for leadership. In our Surgical product group, full year global sales of 999 million increased 13% versus the prior year. Fourth quarter global sales of 248 million increased 10%. Growth was driven by strong global adoption of Edward's premium resilient technology and overall procedural volumes. We are confident about the future of its tissue technology and its role in improving patient lifetime management. We continue to see positive momentum in our innovation globally with continued adoption for patients best treated surgically, including those with complex and [ combitant ] procedures. We continue to expand the overall body of resilient evidence, including ongoing patient enrollment of our momentus clinical study. We received [ C Mark ] approval of our my truth will evolve in the fourth quarter and have begun to range in several European countries with favorable physician feedback.\nTurning to Critical Care. Full year global sales of 928 million increased 10% versus the prior year. Fourth quarter Critical Care sales of 250 million increased 11%. Growth was driven by contribution from all product lines, led by Hemosphere, a smart recovery with strong adoption of our Acumen IQ sensor equipped with the hypotension prediction index algorithm. Critical care strategy is to drive growth through smart recovery and smart expansion. Which are designed to help clinicians make more informed decisions and get patients home to their family faster. And with that, I will turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott B. Ullem\n\nCorporate Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Edwards Lifesciences Corp.\n\nOkay. Thanks a lot, Bernard. So today, I'll provide a wrap-up of 2023, including detailed results of our fourth quarter as well as provide guidance for the first quarter and full year 2024. As Bernard mentioned, we were pleased with our better-than-expected Q4 sales performance with strength across all product groups. We achieved total sales of $1.53 billion which represents 13% year-over-year growth. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.64. Our GAAP earnings per share of $0.61 included onetime expenses associated with our planned spin-off of Critical Care. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted EPS for this and other items is included with today's release. We are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2024 with the exception of TMTT. Absent big moves in foreign exchange, we expect total company sales of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion. TAVR sales of $4.0 billion to $4.3 billion Surgical Structural Heart sales of $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion and Critical Care sales of $900 million to $1 billion.\nGiven the early FDA approval for EVOQUE, we now expect full year TMTT sales to be at the higher end of our previous $280 million to $320 million guidance range. For the first quarter, we're projecting sales of $1.53 billion to $1.61 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.66. And now I'll cover the additional details from our P&L. For the fourth quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.8% compared to 81% in the same period last year. This expected year-over-year reduction was driven by impacts from foreign exchange. Last year, Edwards' gross profit margin was lifted by a significant impact from FX. We continue to expect our full year 2024 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%, and driven by high-value technologies that yield strong gross profit margins.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $480 million or 31.3% of sales compared to $411 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by investments in transcatheter field-based personnel in support of our growth strategy and patient activation initiatives. We continue to expect full year 2024 SG&A as a percent of sales to be 29% to 30% as we invest in field-based personnel and patient activation initiatives and increase our focus on efficient G&A leverage. Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter grew 16% over the prior year to $270 million or 17.6% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect research and development to be 17% to 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and being evidence to support TAVR and TMTT growth with the goal of treating even more patients. During the fourth quarter, we incurred approximately $17 million of onetime costs associated with our previously announced spin-off of Critical Care. Additional onetime costs will be incurred throughout 2024 prior to the expected separation at year-end.\nTurning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 12.3%, or 13.4% excluding the impact of special items. For the full year 2023, our reported tax rate was 12.4% or 15.0% excluding the impact of special items. Our lower-than-expected non-GAAP rate in the fourth quarter benefited primarily from U.S. tax credits on foreign remittances and income tax. We continue to expect our 2024 tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 14% and 17%. Foreign exchange rates decreased fourth quarter reported sales growth by 80 basis points or $9 million compared to the prior year. FX rates negatively impacted our fourth quarter gross profit margin by 320 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our October guidance, FX rates had a nominal impact on fourth quarter earnings per share.\nFree cash flow for the fourth quarter was $48 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $136 million less capital spending of $88 million. Adjusted free cash flow for the full year 2023 was $943 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $896 million less capital spending of $253 million. Adjusted free cash flow excludes the $300 million payment related to the Medtronic intellectual property agreement. We continue to expect full year 2024 adjusted free cash flow will grow to be between $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion. Before turning the call back over to Bernard, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we repurchased 6.0 million shares through an accelerated repurchase agreement and a pre-established 10b5-1 plan. As a result, average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter declined to $607 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2024 and to be between $600 million and $610 million. We have approximately $1 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. And with that, back to you, Bernard.\n\nBernard J. Zovighian\n\nCorporate VP of Transcatheter Mitral & Tricuspid Therapies, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThank you, Scott. In conclusion, we are proud of the significant progress we made in 2023, advancing new breakthrough therapies for patients and delivering solid financial performance and healthy profitability. We are even more excited about 2024. This year, we anticipate launching groundbreaking technologies and advancing multiple important clinical trials. These breakthroughs along with significant unmet patient needs, give us confidence in our ability to accelerate growth in 2025 and beyond. In TAVR, we will continue to drive global adoption of SAPIEN 3 ultra resilient present pivotal trial data from early TAVR studying a symptomatic AS patients and enrolling an a pivotal trial studying the next-generation SAPIEN X4. We also look forward to a number of key developments in TMTT, including the U.S. and European introduction of EVOQUE, the expanded global adoption of Pascal Precision Class 2 Tier enrollment completion and SAPIEN M3 approval in Europe by the end of 2025.\nAnd in Surgical and Critical Care, we remain committed to healthy growth and expanded leadership. In closing, longer term for Edwards, we are confident in our plan to expand the structural heart opportunity, which reflects our sharpened focus on valvular and non-liver patients and our commitment to innovation. We believe that executing our strategy will create value for all of our stakeholders. With that, back to you, Mark.\n\nMark Wilterding\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, Bernard. With that, we're ready to take everyone's questions. As a reminder, please limit the number of questions to one plus one follow-up to allow for broad participation. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue and management will answer as many participants as possible during the remainder of the call. Diego?"

Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are also included in today's press release.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernard for his comments.\n\nBernard J. Zovighian\n\nCorporate VP of Transcatheter Mitral & Tricuspid Therapies, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. As Mark said, we are hosting today's call from TCT in San Francisco. I am going to start by covering some of the exciting development at the conference, share highlights of the significant progress our team has made advancing our strategy, review our strong third quarter results, and finally, discuss our confidence in the outlook for Edwards.\nThere are a lot of data being presented this week about technologies Edwards has developed. Included among these are results from 3 late-breaking clinical trials, all of which reflects Edwards commitment to generating high-quality evidence to advance innovative therapies for patients suffering from structural heart disease.\nYesterday, physicians presented 5-year data from the PARTNER III low-risk pivotal trial. We believe these data demonstrate a TAVR with the SAPIEN platform should continue to be the preferred therapy for treating patients who have severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.\nAfter more than 20 years of rigorous clinical experiences and trials, now 8 New England Journal's Medicine publication, and over 1 million patient treated SAPIEN technology offers patient unique benefits. SAPIEN 3 has demonstrated 99% freedom from death and disabling stroke at 1 year, 90% survival at 5 years and is the only valve with a THV and THV indication. This is true lifetime management benefit which expands option for patients.\nTomorrow at TCT, we are looking forward to the presentation of a 6-month analysis of our EVOQUE transcatheter tricuspid valve, the first of its kind therapy for the millions of patients suffering from tricuspid valve disease. In addition, tomorrow, you will see the 1-year full cohort result of a CLASP IID pivotal trial with PASCAL.\nWe continue to make meaningful progress to advance our vision of offering a portfolio of innovative transcatheter therapies to treat tricuspid and mitral valve disease.\nIn the last several weeks, we achieved 4 important milestones in support of our commitment to patient-focused innovation. First, CE Mark approval for the EVOQUE transfemoral replacement system; second, CE Mark approval for the MITRIS RESILIA surgical mitral valve; third, PASCAL PRECISION approval in Japan.\nFinally, the completion of the enrollment in the first ever pivotal trial for any transfemoral mitral replacement therapy, the ENCIRCLE Trial for SAPIEN M3.\nTurning now to Q3 financial performance. Third quarter global sales grew 11% to $1.5 billion, led by our differentiated portfolio of innovative therapies. We were pleased with the results, which were in line with our expectations and to have present another quarter of double-digit sales growth.\nFor the full year, we continue to expect total company sales growth to be in the 10% to 13% range. Now I will provide an overview of the third quarter sales performance by product group.\nIn TAVR, we continue to see strong demand for our leading SAPIEN platform with third quarter sales of $961 million, up 10% year-over-year. Our U.S. and OUS sales growth rates were comparable. Our U.S. and OUS competitive positions were stable and globally, local selling prices were stable.\nIn the U.S., our third quarter TAVR sales were driven by the continued successful launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. On the clinical side, we are pleased with the pace of enrollment in our pivotal trial alliance designed to study SAPIEN X4, our groundbreaking next-generation TAVR technology.\nIn Europe, Edwards sales growth was driven by the broad-based adoption of our SAPIEN platform. We look forward to additional data supporting the Edwards benchmark program to be presented at the PCR London Valves conference in November.\nOur sales in Japan grew year-over-year, reflecting a gradual recovery in market growth and strong adoption of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA, competitive trialing in the third quarter where it was less pronounced versus in the first half of this year. And as expected, we grew faster than overall procedure growth. Around the world, we remain focused on improving diagnosis and treatment of the many more patients who remain undertreated.\nIn summary, the combination of our global TAVR leadership, along with the data presented at TCT this week, gives the company further confidence in the future of TAVR and the company's expectation of a $10 billion opportunity by 2028.\nNow turning to TMTT. Our commitment to the unmet needs of mitral and tricuspid patients took a significant step forward with the achievement of several important milestones in this past quarter. TMTT third quarter global sales of $52 million increased 65% versus the prior year. This performance was driven by accelerating adoption of our differentiated PASCAL PRECISION platform, the activation of more centers across the U.S. and Europe, as well as TEER procedure growth.\nWe continue to be pleased with our excellent clinical outcomes, reflecting the impressive performance of PASCAL PRECISION and the value brought by our comprehensive high-touch model. We are continuing the expansion of PASCAL PRECISION globally, with the expected launch in Japan before the end of the year.\nIn our mitral clinical trials, we look forward to the 1-year CLASP IID randomized pivotal trial and CLASP IID registry outcomes with PASCAL to be presented as part of a late-breaking scientific sessions tomorrow at TCT. This will add to the body of evidence supporting TEER as an effective therapy for patients.\nWith the earlier-than-expected completion of enrollment in the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3, we believe we are one step closer to offering an important value replacement option, beyond TEER, to serve even more patients suffering from mitral valve disease.\nIn tricuspid, earlier this month, we received CE Mark approval for EVOQUE. We look forward to bringing this new therapy to Europe, through a disciplined launch that will focus on ensuring excellent patient outcomes. Now, with this approval, physicians in Europe will have access to this groundbreaking option in addition to TEER.\nAs noted, tomorrow at TCT, lead breaking data from the TRISCEND II pivotal trial of the EVOQUE replacement technology, will be presented on the first 150 randomized patients based on EVOQUE's FDA breakthrough pathway designation. This landmark presentation on a novel therapy demonstrate our leadership and commitment to innovation and science, and our focus on helping large population of patients with unmet needs.\nIn summary, for TMTT, we are proud of the new therapy introductions, clinical trial achievements and geographic expansion we have achieved to advance our vision to build a portfolio of therapies to transform the lives of mitral and tricuspid patients.\nIn Surgical, third quarter sales of $247 million increased 11%, driven by a balanced combination of stronger global adoption of Edwards premium technology and overall procedure growth. We continue to see strong momentum of our resilient portfolio globally, which has been widely adopted because of the excellent durability of this proven tissue technology supported by the recent 7-year aortic data and 5-year mitral data from our COMMENCE clinical trial.\nWe are confident about the future of this technology as we expand the overall body of resilient evidence, including ongoing patient enrollment of our Momentis clinical study. Finally, we received CE Mark approval for our mitral RESILIA, mitral valves earlier this month. We expect to introduce these valves in the fourth quarter, followed by full European launch in 2024.\nIn Critical Care, third quarter sales of $221 million increased 6%, driven by our smart recovery portfolio with strong adoption of our Acumen IQ sensors equipped with the high potential protection index algorithm. We remain confident in our pipeline of Critical Care innovation as we continue to shift our focus to smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions and get patients home to their family faster.\nAnd now, I will turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott B. Ullem\n\nCorporate Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Edwards Lifesciences Corp.\n\nThanks a lot, Bernard. We are pleased to report third quarter sales performance in line with our expectations, with strength across all product groups.\nWe achieved total sales of $1.48 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.59. Our GAAP earnings per share of $0.63 benefited from a change in U.S. tax regulations. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share for this and other items is included with today's release.\nI'll now cover some additional details of our third quarter sales results and full year 2023 outlook by product group. A continuation of double-digit global TAVR growth reflected a more balanced hospital staffing environment as well as strong adoption of the SAPIEN family of valves.\nU.S. TAVR sales growth was driven by the launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA, which remains on track to represent the majority of our U.S. TAVR sales before year-end.\nIn Europe, Edwards sales growth was driven by the continued demand of our SAPIEN platform and was broad-based by country.\nIn Japan, improved growth in the third quarter was driven by the ongoing launch of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve.\nFor global TAVR sales, we continue to expect full year 2023 sales of $3.85 billion to $4.0 billion, representing 10% to 13% growth. TMTT growth in Q3 was driven by adoption of our differentiated PASCAL PRECISION platform, activation of more centers across the U.S. and Europe and strong procedure volumes.\nOverall, we are pleased with our continued progress towards establishing a portfolio of TMTT therapies, combined with temporary clinical data in order to achieve our vision of transforming the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. We continue to expect full year 2023 TMTT sales of $180 million to $200 million.\nIn Surgical Structural Heart, 11% sales growth in the quarter was driven by the adoption of Edwards RESILIA products. Based on positive year-to-date performance, we continue to expect that our full year sales will be in the range of $960 million to $1.02 billion, implying low double-digit growth in 2023.\nAnd in Critical Care, we continue to expect full year 2023 sales of $870 million to $940 million. For total Edwards, based upon the performance we have delivered year-to-date, we continue to expect full year 2023 sales to be in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion, and full year sales growth to be in the 10% to 13% range.\nLastly, we continue to expect our full year adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.50 and $2.60. We're projecting fourth quarter sales to be between $1.45 billion and $1.53 billion. We are also projecting fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.60 and $0.66.\nNow I'll cover additional details of our P&L. For the third quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.4% as expected, compared to 81% in the same period last year. This year-over-year reduction was driven by impacts from foreign exchange. Remember last year, Edwards' gross profit margin was lifted by an unusually positive impact from foreign exchange. We continue to expect our full year 2023 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $440 million, or 29.7% of sales, compared to $377 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by investments in transcatheter field-based personnel in support of our growth strategy and performance-based compensation. We continue to expect full year 2023 SG&A as a percent of sales to be 29% to 30%, as we invest in field-based personnel and our therapy adoption initiatives.\nResearch and development expenses in the third quarter grew 16% over the prior year to $270 million or 18.3% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity.\nFor the full year 2023, we continue to expect R&D to be 17% to 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT.\nTurning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 12.7% or 18.8%, excluding the impact of special items. Our reported rate benefited from the suspension of certain U.S. tax regulations surrounding foreign tax credits. Our slightly higher-than-expected non-GAAP rate resulted primarily from income mix and a lower excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 13% and 17%.\nForeign exchange rates decreased third quarter reported sales growth by 140 basis points or $16 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximately $40 million year-over-year negative impact to full year 2023 sales compared to 2022. FX rates negatively impacted our third quarter gross profit margin by 410 basis points compared to the prior year.\nRelative to our July guidance, FX rates had a $0.01 negative impact on third quarter earnings per share. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $356 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $411 million, less capital spending of $55 million. We continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow will be between $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion.\nAnd before turning the call back over to Bernard, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a solid and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30. During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares under our 10b-5 plan. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2023 to be between $610 million and $615 million. We have approximately $500 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.\nAnd with that, back over to you, Bernard.\n\nBernard J. Zovighian\n\nCorporate VP of Transcatheter Mitral & Tricuspid Therapies, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThank you, Scott. In closing, after more than 20 years of rigorous clinical experience, over 1 million patients treated and this week's 5-year PARTNER III results. Edwards TAVR is positioned for strong, sustainable growth as many patients remain undiagnosed and untreated.\nIn addition, we have 2 strong global businesses, Critical Care and Surgical, which are positioned for durable long-term growth driven by portfolios of differentiated technology. Moreover, we are achieving many significant milestones in TMTT that gives us the confidence about progressing our vision to treat the many mitral and tricuspid patients in need.\nAltogether, we are convinced of a tremendous opportunity to drive success in the future through our patient focus, breakthrough technologies and leadership.\nWith that, I pass it back to Mark to open up Q&A.\n\nMark Wilterding\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, Bernard. Before we open it up for questions, I'd like to remind you about our 2023 investor conference, which we will host at our headquarters in Irvine, California on Thursday, December 7. This event will include updates on our latest technologies, views on longer-term market potential as well as our outlook for 2024.\nMore information and a registration form are available on our website.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nMark Wilterding\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, Diego. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. With me on today's call is our Chief Executive Officer, Bernard Zovighian; along with our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Ullem. Also joining us for the Q&A portion of the call are Larry Wood, our Group President of TAVR and Surgical Structural Heart; and Daveen Chopra, our global leader of TMTT. [ Katie ] Szyman, our global leader of Critical Care is out of town today, but she'll be with us on future earnings calls.\nJust after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released second quarter 2023 financial results. During today's call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today.\nAdditionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in the press release, our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website at edwards.com.\nFinally, a quick reminder that when using terms constant currency and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during this call are available in today's press release.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernard for his comments. Bernard?\n\nBernard J. Zovighian\n\nCorporate VP of Transcatheter Mitral & Tricuspid Therapies, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThanks, Mark, and hello, everyone. I am pleased to share with you the work that our team did to help more patients than even before with our life-saving therapies. Today, I'm going to talk about the strong second quarter performance across product groups, our progress in advancing our patient-focused innovation strategy and our confidence in the outlook for Edwards in the years ahead.\nIn the second quarter, we achieved double-digit sales growth driven by increased adoption of our innovative therapies. Total sales of $1.53 billion grew 12% on a constant currency basis, slightly higher than our expectation. We experienced broad-based growth across [indiscernible] portfolio. Given improving health care staffing and our first half performance, we continue to expect strong results in 2023. As a result, we have lifted our full year 2023 sales and EPS guidance.\nLonger term, we are confident in our focused and differentiated strategy given heart valve failure is largely underdiagnosed and undertreated. We remain committed to increasing awareness and providing innovative life-saving therapies, so even more patients can benefit.\nNow I will provide an overview of second quarter sales performance by product group. In TAVR, we continue to see strong demand for our leading SAPIEN platform with sales of $992 million, up 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Our U.S. and OUS sales growth rates were comparable. Local selling prices were stable. In the U.S., our second quarter TAVR sales were aided by improved hospital staffing levels and the continued successful launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. We estimate that total procedure growth was in line with our sales growth.\nAdditionally, we will be restarting enrollment this quarter in our pivotal trial alliance designed to study of next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN [ X4 ]. Outside of the U.S., we had positive constant currency sales growth from all regions. In Europe, Edwards sales growth were driven by the broad-based adoption of our SAPIENT platform. Our sales in Japan grew sequentially and year-over-year on a constant currency basis, although our results continued to be impacted by lower-than-expected market growth and competitive trialing in the first half of this year. As a result, we estimate overall OUS TAVR procedure growth in Q2 was slightly higher than Edward's OUS TAVR growth.\nDuring the quarter, at the [ EuroPCR ] medical congress data on the benchmark study we are presented on 2,400 patients treated with SAPIENT valves across 28 European centers. It was very encouraging to note that patients experienced a 33% reduction in the median hospital length of stay while maintaining 30-day clinical outcomes. This study shows that by implementing best practices with the SAPIENT platform, centers can be more efficient without compromising patient outcomes.\nTurning to TMTT. We remain focused on 3 key value drivers to unlock this opportunity, a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive clinical trial results to support approvals and adoption and favorable real-world clinical outcome. TMTT's second quarter global sales of $48 million increased nearly 70% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Growth was driven by continued strong overall procedure volumes, adoption of our differentiated PASCAL PRECISION platform and activation of more centers across the U.S. and Europe. We continue to hire [ trying ] and grow the field team to deliver on our high-touch model as we expand.\nIn [ mitral ], enrollment is going -- is ongoing in the Class IIF pivotal trial for functional [ mitral ] patients. We are also pleased with the enrollment in the [indiscernible] pivotal trial for the SAPIEN and free [ mitral ] valve replacement and remain on track to complete enrollment around the end of this year.\nIn tricuspid, the Class II TR pivotal trial with PASCAL continues and rolling well. With the completion of [indiscernible] enrollment, continued access for [ Evok ] allows U.S. centers to continue to offer this therapy for tricuspid patients. We remain on track for a European approval by the end of 2023 and U.S. approval around the end of 2024.\nIn Surgical, second quarter sales of $256 million increased 13% on a constant currency basis driven by the adoption of our premium RESILIA products across all regions. Physicians and patients value the feature and benefit of this advanced tissue technology for both aortic and [ mitral ] surgical valve procedures. Patient enrollment continued in the second quarter for our [ MOMENTUS ] clinical study designed to demonstrate the durability of RESILIA tissue in the [ mitral ] position. We expect that confidence from the recently presented 7-year data of our [indiscernible] clinical trial will continue to support adoption of our RESILIA family of products.\nIn Critical Care, second quarter sales of $235 million increase, 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by contribution from all product lines. Growth was led by our smart recovery portfolio and healthy adoption of our Acumen IQ sensor. Sales momentum for our HemoSphere monitoring platform was also positive in the second quarter with a healthy pipeline of future opportunities.\nBefore I turn it over to Scott, I also want to mention our expectation for the upcoming [ TCT ] conference in October. During the conference, we expect several important presentation regarding our [ Transcat ] technologies. In TAVR, we are expecting the presentation of 5-year clinical data for the [ PAN-Ilow-risk ] pivotal trial. In TMTT, we anticipate the presentation of a 1-year full cohort of the Class II D pivotal trial results.\nAdditionally, we anticipate a presentation of a planned interim analysis of a TRISCEND II randomized cohort. I look forward to seeing many of you at the investor event we plan to host at [ TCT ]. Our Investor Relations team will communicate details as we get closer to the event.\nAnd now I will turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott B. Ullem\n\nCorporate Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Edwards Lifesciences Corp.\n\nGreat. Thanks, [indiscernible] Bernard. We are pleased with our sales performance in the first half of the year, posting our second consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth. All product groups grew double digits, and sales were balanced across regions with the exception of Japan, which was impacted by the trialing of competitive TAVR products. We achieved total sales in the quarter of $1.53 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year constant currency growth. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.66. Contribution from our better-than-expected sales performance was partially offset by higher performance-based compensation and investments in our transcatheter operations in support of our growth strategy.\nOur GAAP earnings per share of $0.50 was impacted by the intellectual property agreement I commented on last quarter. We previously had a long-term intellectual property agreement with [ Medtronic ] that expired last year. In consideration for the new agreement, we paid $300 million, approximately half of which has been expensed and the other half will be amortized over the next 15 years. Reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share for these and other items is included with today's release.\nI'll now cover some additional details of our second quarter sales results and full year 2023 outlook by product group. A continuation of double-digit global TAVR growth reflected a more stable hospital staffing environment as well as strong adoption of the SAPIEN family of valves. U.S. TAVR sales growth was driven by the launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA, which remains on track to represent the majority of our U.S. TAVR sales before year-end.\nIn Europe, Edwards sales growth was driven by the continued demand of our Sapien platform and was broad-based by country. We still see some health system capacity challenges, but are encouraged that centers are adapting to continue to treat their patients. In Japan, although growth was below our expectations in Q2, we anticipate that growth rates will improve driven by the ongoing launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. For global TAVR sales we are adjusting the low end of our outlook slightly higher to $3.85 billion to $4.0 billion. We now expect full year TAVR growth to be 10% to 13% on a constant currency basis versus previous guidance of 10% to 12%.\nTMTT growth in the second quarter was driven by strong procedure volumes, adoption of our differentiated PASCAL PRECISION platform and activation of more centers across the U.S. and Europe. Overall, we are pleased with our continued progress toward bringing a portfolio of TMTT therapies, combined with contemporary clinical data in order to achieve our vision of transforming the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. We now expect full year 2023 sales of $180 million to $200 million versus our previous expectation of $170 million to $200 million.\nIn Surgical Structural Heart, 13% constant currency sales growth in the quarter was driven by the adoption of Edwards premium products as well as strength in valve surgery procedures as hospital staffing levels have continued to improve. Based on positive year-to-date performance, we now expect that our full year sales will be in the range of $960 million to $1.02 billion versus previous guidance of $870 million to $970 million. This revised range implies low double-digit constant currency growth in 2023.\nFinally, turning to Critical Care. We continue to expect full year 2023 sales of $870 million to $940 million. For total Edwards, based on the strong first half of the year, we now forecast full year 2023 sales to be in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion versus prior guidance of the high end of $5.6 billion to $6.0 billion. We now expect full year total company sales growth to be in the 10% to 13% range on a constant currency basis versus previous guidance of 10% to 12%.\nLastly, we now expect our full year adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.50 and $2.60. We are projecting third quarter sales to be between $1.44 billion and $1.52 billion. We are also projecting third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.55 to $0.61.\nI'll now cover additional details of our P&L. For the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.7%, as expected, compared to 80.5% in the same period last year. This reduction was driven by a less favorable impact from foreign exchange. We continue to expect our full year 2023 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $469 million or 30.6% of sales compared to $409 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by performance-based compensation and investments in transcatheter field-based personnel in support of our growth strategy.\nWe continue to expect full year 2023 SG&A as a percent of sales to be 29% to 30% as we invest in field-based personnel and our therapy adoption initiatives. Research and development expenses in the second quarter grew 8% over the prior year to $270 million or 17.7% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter aortic valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full year 2023 we continue to expect R&D to be 17% to 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT.\nDuring the second quarter, we recorded a $27 million reduction in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities, which benefited earnings per share by $0.04. This benefit was excluded from our adjusted earnings per share of $0.66. This reflects an adjustment of assumptions regarding potential milestone payments for a previous acquisition.\nTurning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 9.7% or 13.1%, excluding the impact of special items. Our rate benefited from higher R&D tax credits and a 200 basis point excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be 13% to 17%. Foreign exchange rates decreased second quarter reported sales growth by 70 basis points or $8 million compared to 2022. At current rates, we continue to expect an approximately flat year-over-year impact to full year 2023 sales compared to 2022.\nForeign exchange rates negatively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 220 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our April guidance, FX rates had a minimal impact on second quarter earnings per share. Adjusted free cash flow for the second quarter was $286 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $34 million, less capital spending of $48 million and excluding a $300 million payment related to the [ Medtronic ] intellectual property agreement I mentioned earlier.\nWe continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow will be between $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion. Before turning the call back over to Bernard. I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a solid and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of June 30. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2023 to be between $610 million and $615 million. We have approximately $650 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it back over to you, Bernard.\n\nBernard J. Zovighian\n\nCorporate VP of Transcatheter Mitral & Tricuspid Therapies, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThank you, Scott. So based on our strong first half results, we have increased confidence that 2023 will be an important year for Edwards. And we expect to deliver 10% to 13% sales growth while making meaningful progress on our innovations to improve care for many more patients. Longer term, I have great confidence in our team to further extend our leadership position by bringing our differentiated technologies to patients globally. In closing, we are well positioned for success.\nWith that, I pass it back to Mark to open up Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, and Treasurer. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nMark Wilterding\n\nVP of IR, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThank you very much, Diego, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and CEO; Scott Ullem, CFO; and Bernard Zovighian, President of Edwards Life Sciences. Also joining us for the Q&A portion of the call are Larry Wood, our Group President of TAVR and Surgical Structural Heart; Daveen Chopra, our global leader of TMTT; and Katie Szyman, our Global Leader of Critical Care.\nJust after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released first quarter 2023 financial results.

Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are included in today's press release.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments. Mike?\n\nMichael Mussallem\n\nThank you, Mark. We're pleased with our first quarter performance, which exceeded our expectations and reflected an improvement in health care staffing along with strong execution of our patient-focused innovation strategy.\nSales of $1.46 billion represented 13% growth on a constant currency basis versus the year ago period. Strong therapy adoption of transcatheter heart valves drove the majority of growth in the first quarter, aided by better-than-expected performance of surgical structural heart and critical care.\nBy geography, strong growth in the U.S., Europe and the rest of the world was partially offset by Japan, where COVID impacts lingered. First quarter results in the U.S. were also positively impacted in the quarter by some catch-up in procedure volumes following a seasonal slowdown late last year. While staffing remains a concern at many sites globally, we are optimistic that the environment will continue to improve.\nIn TAVR, first quarter global sales were $948 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth. Local selling prices were stable. In the U.S., our first quarter TAVR sales grew in the low double digits versus the prior year and we estimate total procedure growth was comparable.\nAs we indicated, we believe that first quarter trends were lifted by improved hospital staffing levels. Results were also lifted by a catch-up in procedure volumes early in the quarter following the holiday season slowdown. We're optimistic about the early results of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA launch in the U.S. As you know, the RESILIA tissue's anti-calcification technology has demonstrated a strong track record of performance in Edwards surgical valves. Adoptions of this advanced technology is proceeding well, and we expect it to represent the majority of our U.S. TAVR sales before year-end.\nTAVR growth in the first quarter was driven by larger volume centers, and our SAPIEN valves continue to demonstrate distinguished clinical performance. We're pleased with the continued enrollment of our PROGRESS clinical trial studying patients with moderate AS. Related to this, last month at the ACC Conference, data were presented that examined mortality rates and cardiac damage of 600,000 early-stage AS patients in the U.S. This study concluded that all degrees of untreated AS severity were associated with increased mortality risk. Of note, the mean 2-year all-cause mortality for moderate AS was approximately 20%, approaching the rate of those with severe AS.\nOutside the U.S., in the first quarter, our constant currency TAVR sales grew approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis. Growth reflected positive contributions from all regions, excluding Japan, which was still impacted by COVID and the recent trialing of competitive products. We expect to see higher OUS growth as international adoption of TAVR therapy remains low.\nIn Japan, although growth was below our expectations, we are encouraged that conditions improved as the quarter progressed, and we expect COVID headwinds to diminish substantially over the course of 2023. With the launch of the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in Japan late last month, we expect growth rates to improve in this country where aortic stenosis remains significantly undertreated relative to other large developed countries.\nIn Europe, Edwards sales growth was driven by the continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN platform and was broad-based across all countries. Total TAVR procedures grew over previous quarters despite persistent disruptions related to hospital staffing shortages. It's encouraging that health care systems across Europe are prioritizing life-saving structural heart therapies, including TAVR, amidst these challenges.\nLooking ahead to the EuroPCR Medical Congress next month in Paris, we anticipate additional data from the Edwards benchmark study focusing on strategies to optimize TAVR programs across 28 European centers. Data will also be presented on the outcomes of balloon expandable valves for TAVR-in-TAVR procedures.\nIn summary, given the strength of our first quarter performance, we now expect constant currency growth of 10% to 12% versus our previous expectation of 9% to 12%. Our outlook assumes that hospital resource constraints continue to improve during the year. We remain confident that this large global opportunity will increase to $10 billion by 2028, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double digits.\nTurning to TMTT. Our confidence continues to grow in the long-term potential to transform care for the many patients with mitral and tricuspid disease who need better solutions. We remain steadfast in our 3 key value drivers to unlock this opportunity, developing a portfolio of differentiated therapies for the complex mitral and tricuspid anatomies, driving positive pivotal trial results to support approvals and adoption and prioritizing favorable real-world clinical outcomes.\nFirst quarter sales of $42 million grew substantially, driven by overall TEER procedure growth, the ongoing launch and growing adoption of PASCAL PRECISION in Europe and the initial launch in the United States. We're pleased that we continue to have excellent outcomes for patients, and clinician feedback on PASCAL PRECISION has been consistently positive, particularly highlighting the differentiated premium features of the system. We are ramping production to support the launches of Europe in the U.S.\nIn mitral, we look forward to presenting 1-year data from the full click cohort of Class IID pivotal trial later this year. Meanwhile, we continue to enroll the Class IIF pivotal trial with PASCAL for patients with functional mitral regurgitation. In mitral replacement, enrollment of the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial with SAPIEN M3 is ongoing, and we anticipate completing enrollment of the main cohort around the end of 2023. We believe that this replacement therapy will expand options for a broader population of mitral patients.\nIn tricuspid, we've completed enrollment of the TRISCEND II pivotal trial of the EVOQUE tricuspid valve replacement system and remain on track for European approval by the end of 2023, and in the U.S. around the end of 2024. The FDA recently approved continued access, allowing U.S. hospitals that were involved in the clinical trial, to continue to offer EVOQUE as a therapy option. In addition, the Class II TR pivotal trial with PASCAL continues enrolling well.\nIn summary, we're pleased with our continued progress toward bringing a portfolio of therapies combined with contemporary clinical data in order to achieve our vision of transforming the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. We now expect full year 2023 sales of $170 million to $200 million versus our previous $160 million to $200 million.\nIn Surgical Structural Heart, better-than-expected first quarter 2023 global sales of $248 million increased a robust 17% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. Growth was driven by penetration of our premium products across all regions, and valve surgery growth was higher than our expectations as hospital staffing levels improved, leading to some catch-up in procedures. We continue to see strong momentum of the RESILIA portfolio globally. Surgeons and patients value the features and benefits of this proprietary tissue technology for both aortic and mitral surgical valve replacement procedures. And we have seen adoption of the mitral valve in the U.S. increase in the first quarter.\nThe 7-year data from our COMMENCE clinical trial will be presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Association of Thoracic Surgeons next month. We also began enrollment of our Momentis clinical trial to demonstrate the durability of RESILIA in the mitral position.\nIn summary, based on our first quarter sales, we are raising our full year sales expectation to the high end of our $870 million to $970 million guidance range. We now expect high single-digit underlying growth in 2023, driven by the adoption of our most advanced technologies and an increase in the overall heart valve surgeries.\nIn Critical Care, first quarter sales of $222 million increased 9% on a constant currency basis driven by balanced contributions from all product lines. Growth was led by our Smart Recovery portfolio and strong adoption of our Acumen IQ sensor and finger cuff, featuring our unique hypotension prediction index algorithm. Demand for our Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheters and our HemoSphere monitoring platform also remained strong in the first quarter with a healthy pipeline of future opportunities.\nBased on the strong first quarter performance, we now expect Critical Care full year 2023 sales of $870 million to $940 million versus our previous $840 million to $940 million. We remain excited about our pipeline of critical care innovations as we continue to shift our focus to Smart Recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions and get patients home to their families faster.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Ullem\n\nThanks a lot, Mike. We are very pleased by our start to the year. Q1 was particularly strong in January relative to historical seasonality, and the rest of the quarter was more consistent with our growth expectations. All product groups performed well and sales were balanced across all regions with the exception of Japan, which was impacted by lingering COVID headwinds.\nWe achieved total sales in the quarter of $1.46 billion which represents 12.6% year-over-year constant currency growth. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.62. Our GAAP EPS was $0.56 and impacted by an intellectual property agreement, which I will speak to later. Contribution from our stronger-than-expected sales performance was partially offset by a higher provision for performance-based compensation. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share for these and other items is included with today's release.\nFor total Edwards, based on the strong start to the year, we now expect 10% to 12% year-over-year sales growth on a constant currency basis, an increase from our prior guidance of 9% to 12%. We now expect to be at the high end of our previous range of $5.6 billion to $6.0 billion. Absent material moves in foreign exchange, we now expect full year TAVR sales of $3.8 billion to $4.0 billion, TMTT sales of $170 million to $200 million, and Critical Care sales of $870 million to $940 million.\nFor Surgical Structural Heart, we now expect to be at the high end of our previous guidance range of $870 million to $970 million. Lastly, we now expect our full year adjusted EPS to be between $2.48 and $2.60. We're projecting second quarter sales to be between $1.48 billion and $1.56 billion. We're also projecting second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.68.\nI'll now cover additional details of our results. For the first quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.5% as expected, compared to 77.8% in the same period last year and 81% in Q4. This slight year-over-year reduction was driven by a less favorable impact from FX. We continue to expect our full year 2023 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $436 million or 29.9% of sales, primarily reflecting increased investments over the prior year in transcatheter field-based personnel in support of our growth strategy. These investments were partially offset by the weakening of the euro and yen against the dollar. We continue to expect full year 2023 SG&A as a percent of sales to be 29% to 30% as we continue to invest in field-based personnel and our therapy adoption initiatives.\nResearch and development expenses in the quarter grew 14% over the prior year to $261 million or 17.9% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect R&D to be 17% to 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT.\nTurning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 14.6%. This rate reflects a 70 basis point excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be 13% to 17%.\nEarlier this month, we were pleased to enter into an intellectual property agreement with Medtronic, in which we agreed to a 15-year mutual covenant not to sue with regard to certain structural heart products. We previously had a long-term IP agreement that expired last year. The terms of the new agreement limit what we disclose, but there will be a reference to it in our Form 10-Q, which we will file soon. In consideration for the agreement, we paid Medtronic $300 million, approximately half of which has been recorded as a onetime charge, and the other half will be amortized over time.\nForeign exchange rates decreased first quarter reported sales growth by 380 percentage points or $44 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we continue to expect an approximately flat year-over-year impact to full year 2023 sales as compared to 2022. FX rates negatively impacted our first quarter gross profit margin by 70 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our January guidance, FX rates had a minimal impact on first quarter earnings per share.\nFree cash flow for the first quarter was $253 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $314 million, less capital spending of $61 million. We continue to expect full year 2023 free cash flow will be between $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion.\nBefore turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $250 million in stock through an accelerated share repurchase agreement as well as pre-established 10b5-1 programs.\nAs a result, average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter declined by approximately 5 million shares to $611 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2023 to be between $610 million and $615 million. We have approximately $650 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it back to Mike. But before I do, I know everyone on both ends of this call joins me in congratulating you on this, your 92nd earnings call. We're now in our tenth year of working together, and it's been a privilege at every step along the way. Your leadership and support as the CEO of Edwards has been an inspiration to me, our employees, and I know it's also fair to say, the investment community. So with that, Mike, back to you.\n\nMichael Mussallem\n\nThanks so much, Scott. That means a lot, and I truly value your trusted partnership over the years. It's also a great segue. As part of the upcoming planned CEO succession, Bernard has been serving as President of Edwards Lifesciences since January 1. Since then, we've invested all our time to successfully transition responsibilities, and I feel confident passing the baton.\nNext month, I expect to transition to my new role as Nonexecutive Chairman of the Board, and Bernard will assume the CEO role. I'm excited with the Board's selection of Bernard and I'm confident that the company is in great hands and will prosper under his proven leadership.\nBut before we go to Q&A, I'll ask Bernard to say a few words, Bernard?\n\nBernard Zovighian\n\nThanks, Mike. I feel extremely fortunate to be leading this special company that has pioneered rightful technologies and transformed care for patients around the world. During the well-planned 5-month transition, Mike has been extremely generous in sharing his learnings and experience, having successfully transformed Edwards over the last 20-plus years.\nI am also grateful for the support of the Board and the partnership of the executive leadership team. In recent months, I have had the pleasure of meeting and listening to our patients, our trusted partners, and our employees around the world. I've come away from this discussion even more confident in Edwards' bright future.\nFor our patients, we will continue to advance breakthrough innovation that will positively impact their lives. While Edwards has grown and evolved, we never lost sight of why we are here. We will stay focused on our long-term strategic goals and foster a patient-first culture that drives everything we do.\nWe know health care innovation requires trusted partnership with physicians, regulators, payers, providers and innovators, and we will continue to build upon and further strengthen our deep partnerships to take on ambitious goals and address large unmet needs.\nTransforming care like we do at Edwards is complex. So we remain committed to fostering a culture where our employees really enjoy their impactful work. Our unique organic innovation strategy requires an expert, motivated and dedicated global team. I want Edwards to continue to be a place that inspires our employees to grow and succeed and attract bright talent.\nAs you heard from Mike and Scott, we believe that 2023 will be an important year for Edwards as we expect a return to higher sales growth and meaningful progress on our innovations to improve care for many more patients. Looking beyond 2023, I remain confident that our long-term strategy and pipeline of innovative therapy will create significant value for patients and health care systems, enabling strong organic sales growth. Finally, I am confident that as we deliver on our innovation strategy, we will create exceptional shareholder value.\nWith that, I will pass it back to Mark to open up for Q&A.\n\nMark Wilterding\n\nVP of IR, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThank you very much, Bernard. We're ready to take questions now. [Operator Instructions] Diego, please go ahead with additional details on accessing the Q&A portion of the call."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nMark Wilterding\n\nVP of IR, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThank you very much, Diego, and good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Ullem, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for the Q&A portion of the call are Bernard Zovighian, President of Edwards Life Sciences; Larry Wood, our global leader of TAVR and Surgical Structural Heart; Daveen Chopra, our global leader of TMTT and Katie Zimon, our Global Leader of Critical Care.\nJust after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released fourth quarter 2022 financial results. During today's call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and the accompanying financial statements and then use the remaining time for Q&A.\nPlease note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they were made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today.\nAdditionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in the press release, our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website at edwards.com.\nFinally, a quick reminder that when using the terms constant currency, underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are included in today's press release.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments.\n\nMichael A. Mussallem\n\nChairman & CEO, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThank you, Mark. During 2022, our company stayed focused on the long term, making meaningful progress on strategic milestones with the potential of transforming patient care. While the challenging environment negatively impacted sales, we still grew 8%.\nLooking forward, we remain optimistic that the health care environment will gradually improve and we expect 9% to 12% sales growth in 2023. We didn't pull back on investing in innovation because of the pandemic, and we didn't pull back because sales fell a little short. We continue to aggressively invest during this challenging period, which positions the company for sustained leadership in a new era of structural heart and critical care innovation.\nLooking back at 2022, in TAVR, we made important strides in executing our long-term strategy. We received approval and launched the innovative SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve. In TMTT -- each of our platforms demonstrated promising clinical performance, and we received approval for PASCAL PRECISION in the U.S. and Europe. In Surgical Structural Heart, we extended our leadership position through the launch of MITRIS in the U.S. And in Critical Care, we continue to drive adoption of our transformative smart recovery technologies.\nAlthough our initial sales expectations for 2022 anticipated a better environment, we delivered balanced contributions across each of our product groups and regions. We achieved 12% growth in adjusted earnings per share while maintaining R&D at more than 17% of sales, which reflects our commitment to driving durable organic sales growth. Consistent with our cash deployment strategy, we opportunistically repurchased stock at an accelerated level in 2022. We continue to invest in our production capacity in anticipation of future growth. and we made a series of external investments in promising early-stage technologies.\nTurning to our fourth quarter financial results. Consistent with our guidance, total company sales grew 7% on a constant currency basis to $1.3 billion. Our broad portfolio of innovative therapies drove this growth despite the health care disruptions in a number of our key geographies.\nIn TAVR, full year 2022 global TAVR sales of $3.5 billion increased 7% on a constant currency basis, building on nearly 20% growth in the year ago period. Sales were below our original guidance of $3.7 billion to $4.0 billion due to foreign exchange headwinds and COVID-induced health care challenges in key countries.\nIn 2022, we announced the approval of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in the U.S. Separately, we continue to advance enrollment in our PROGRESS pivotal trial for moderate AS patients and gained significant learnings from our ALLIANCE pivotal trial to study the next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4. These transformative developments reinforce our long-term confidence in the strong growth of transcatheter-based aortic valve interventions.\nIn the fourth quarter, our global TAVR procedures were comparable with Edwards growth. Our global -- I should say, global TAVR procedures were comparable with Edwards growth. Our global TAVR sales of $868 million increased 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, consistent with our expectations. Sales were up slightly over Q3 in dollars and on a constant currency basis and local selling prices were stable.\nIn the U.S., Edwards fourth quarter TAVR procedures grew in the mid-single-digit range. As expected, our fourth quarter U.S. TAVR procedure volumes were impacted by the U.S. hospital staffing constraints and the holiday season slowdown. We estimate that our share of procedures was stable. Growth in the U.S. was higher in larger volume centers and in states with fewer COVID restrictions as measured by the Oxford Containment and Health Index.\nWe're encouraged by recent hiring trends, which suggests that hospital employment is rebounding. As we mentioned, we began the introduction of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in the U.S. The RESILIA tissue's anti-calcification technology addresses one of the primary causes of reintervention following heart valve replacement and is demonstrating a strong track record of performance in Edwards Surgical house. As of now, this newest valve has been introduced in approximately 10% of U.S. TAVR centers and physician feedback has been encouraging.\nOutside of the U.S., in the fourth quarter, Edwards TAVR procedures also grew in the mid-single digits, and we estimate total procedure growth was comparable. In Q4, geographies outside of Europe and Japan grew even faster in the quarter. Long term, we see excellent opportunities for growth as we believe international adoption of TAVR remains quite low.\nIn Europe, fourth quarter procedures grew in line with the global rate. Market growth continued to be impacted by a bump in the COVID cases and staffing shortages, which reduced hospital capacity, particularly in larger countries such as Germany. And even though there are a broad range of competitors, our leadership position and local selling prices remained stable throughout the year.\nImportantly, a cost-effectiveness study published earlier this month demonstrated that TAVR with SAPIEN 3 was economically beneficial when compared to surgical aortic valve replacement in treating German patients with low surgical risk. The data suggests that TAVR enhances quality of life and offers a cost-effective option over the long term. These findings are consistent with the cost-effective outcomes for the use of SAPIEN 3 in France, Italy and Spain.\nIn Japan, fourth quarter procedure growth was much slower than expected due to an extended COVID wave and continued restrictions, which limited hospital staffing and capacity. We expect these factors to diminish substantially over the course of 2023 and look forward to launching SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in Japan later this year. We remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy driven by the fact that AS remains a significantly undertreated disease amongst this large elderly population.\nIn summary, our outlook assumes COVID-related challenges improved during 2023 as hospital resource constraints decrease. We remain positive in our outlook for 2023 underlying TAVR sales growth of 9% to 12%, consistent with the range we shared at our December investor conference. We remain confident in this large global opportunity that will double to $10 billion by 2028, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range.\nTurning to TMTT. Since launch, we have proudly treated more than 10,000 patients with the PASCAL repair system. We achieved significant milestones in 2022 and made meaningful progress toward achieving our vision to transform care for patients with mitral and tricuspid disease. Following the CLASP IID presentation at TCT and FDA approval in Q3, we initiated the introduction of the PASCAL PRECISION system in the U.S. Initial feedback from clinicians has been positive, and we're pleased with the patient outcomes to date. CLASP IID full cohort of 300 patients with 1-year follow-up will be presented in the second half of 2023.\nIn Europe, the PASCAL PRECISION launch is ongoing with a focus on bringing this latest advancement to our existing centers as well as expanding into new centers. Also aligned with our commitment to generate high-quality scientific evidence we continue to advance enrollment in our CLASP IIF pivotal trial for patients with functional mitral regurgitation.\nIn mitral replacement, we're making good progress on the enrollment of the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and expect to complete enrollment of the main cohort around the end of 2023. The sub French transfemoral valve leverages the SAPIEN 3 platform with a recapturable, repositionable dock. Separately, we've completed enrollment in the MISCEND early feasibility study with the Eos valve and are incorporating the learnings from this early experience into our next generation. We believe the Eos platform has the potential to be an excellent option for mitral patients, who have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options.\nShifting to tricuspid and our strategy of advancing the body of clinical evidence, we are currently enrolling 2 pivotal trials studying both tricuspid replacement and repair, TRISCEND II and the CLASP II TR. We prioritized enrollment in our TRISCEND II study, that study -- trial that's studying EVOQUE as it addresses the large population of patients, who are suffering from debilitating systems and have few treatment options. TRISCEND II is on track for completion of enrollment in the first half of 2023, and we expect EVOQUE CE Mark by the end of this year and U.S. approval around the end of '24.\nWe're very pleased with the recent tricuspid data presented at PCR London Valves meeting, which we reported favorable results from both our TRISCEND study of EVOQUE and the TriCLASP post-market clinical follow-up for PASCAL. In Europe, clinicians are very positive about the performance of our differentiated PASCAL PRECISION system in their tricuspid patients, and we're looking forward to bringing this therapy to patients in the U.S. following the CLASP II TR trial.\nTurning to the sales performance of TMTT. Fourth quarter sales of $32 million were consistent with our latest guidance and driven by the continued adoption of PASCAL in Europe supported by the early initiation of PASCAL PRECISION in the U.S. Full year global sales were $116 million, up nearly 50% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year.\nIn 2023, we expect TMTT sales of $160 million to $200 million. We look forward to advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease through the milestones outlined in our recent investor conference. We remain committed to bringing this differentiated portfolio of therapies to patients with these life-threatening diseases and believe our strategy positions us well for leadership.\nIn Surgical Structural Heart, full year global sales were $893 million, up 6% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Fourth quarter 2022 global sales of $224 million increased 8% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. We are encouraged to see strong global growth driven by the increased penetration of our premium RESILIA products despite COVID challenges in certain regions. Although hospital staffing shortages continue to be a concern, we believe that heart valve surgery was prioritized.\nWe have seen strong momentum of the RESILIA portfolio globally. We believe that surgeons value the features and benefits of this advanced tissue technology for both aortic and mitral surgical valve replacement procedures. We saw adoption of the MITRIS RESILIA valve in the U.S. increased in the fourth quarter. And built upon previous generations of proven mitral valve technology, MITRIS offers greater ease of use and is designed to facilitate potential future transcatheter interventions.\nWe are growing the large body of RESILIA evidence with our new Momentis clinical study to demonstrate the durability of this tissue in the mitral position. Enrollment in this study was initiated earlier this month.\nIn summary, we remain confident that our full year 2023 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-single digits for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by the adoption of our most advanced technologies and growth of overall heart valve surgeries.\nTurning to Critical Care. Full year global sales of $855 million increased 7% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Fourth quarter Critical Care sales of $225 million, increased 13% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. Growth was driven by contributions from all product lines and regions led by HemoSphere and Smart Recovery.\nIn our Smart Recovery portfolio, adoption of FloTrac and ClearSight sensors featuring our unique hypotension prediction index algorithm remains strong. Demand for our pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU due to elevated hospitalizations in the U.S. As discussed at our recent investor conference, the integration of full range of technologies creates a unique offering of enhanced recovery tools and predict of analytics to further strengthen our leadership in hemodynamic monitoring.\nIn summary, we are encouraged by the strong momentum in Critical Care and continue to expect mid-single digit underlying sales growth in 2023. We remain enthusiastic about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations, highlighted by Smart Recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions and get patients home to their families faster.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott B. Ullem\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThanks a lot, Mike. Today, I will provide a wrap-up of 2022, including detailed results for the fourth quarter as well as provide guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2023. So as Mike mentioned, our sales of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter grew 7% on a constant currency basis despite the health care disruptions in a number of our key geographies. Our gross profit margin was healthy, even excluding the temporarily inflated rate due to FX. Combined with sales growth and disciplined spending, this resulted in adjusted earnings per share growth of 25% to $0.64. GAAP earnings per share was $0.65.\nObviously, we were disappointed with our stock performance last year. The only upside to the poor stock price performance was that it provided an opportunistic time to repurchase shares more aggressively. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $750 million of stock through an accelerated share repurchase program. And in total, we repurchased $1.7 billion of stock last year. Average shares outstanding during the fourth quarter fell to 616 million. We have approximately $900 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.\nFor the full year 2022, sales increased 8% over the prior year on a constant currency basis to $5.4 billion. Adjusted earnings per share grew 12% and we generated nearly $1 billion of free cash flow.\nWe expect our sales growth rate to expand in 2023 with a gradual improvement in hospital staffing. Although still early in the year, we saw encouraging signals during Q4 and a good start so far in Q1, which reinforces our confidence about the 9% to 12% full year range. We are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2023. Absent big moves in FX, we expect total company sales of $5.6 billion to $6 billion, TAVR sales of $3.6 billion to $4 billion, TMTT sales of $160 million to $200 million. Surgical Structural Heart sales of $870 million to $970 million and Critical Care sales of $840 million to $940 million. For the first quarter, we're projecting sales of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.58 to $0.64.\nNow I'll cover additional details of our results. Our adjusted gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was 81% compared to 76.8% in the same period last year. This improvement was driven by the expected positive impact from our FX program which includes hedge contract gains and natural hedges that offset the negative sales impact from the weakening of the euro and the yen against the dollar.\nAt current foreign exchange rates, we continue to expect our full year 2023 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%. At current exchange rates, the reduction in this year's forecasted gross profit margin versus 2022 reflects 250 to 300 basis points of reduced benefit from FX plus some incremental inflation.\nSG&A expenses in the fourth quarter decreased 3% over the prior year to $411 million or 30.5% of sales, primarily due to the weakening of the euro and the yen against the dollar and partially offset by continued investments in the ongoing build-out of the U.S. TMTT commercial team and our high-touch model for TAVR. We continue to expect full year 2023 SG&A expenses as a percent of sales to be between 29% and 30%.\nResearch and development expenses in the quarter were consistent with the prior year at $232 million, or 17.2% of sales. We continue to expect R&D expenses in 2023 to be between 17% and 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT growth.\nTurning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 13.3% and or 14%, excluding the impact of special items. We continue to expect our 2023 tax rate, excluding special items, to be 13% to 17%. Foreign exchange rates decreased fourth quarter reported sales growth by 6 percentage points or $73 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect approximately flat year-over-year impact from foreign exchange to full year 2023 sales.\nForeign exchange rates positively impacted our fourth quarter gross margin by 230 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our October guidance, FX rates had a minimal impact on fourth quarter earnings per share.\nFinally, before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of the end of the year. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $214 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $283 million, less capital spending of $69 million. In 2023, we expect free cash flow to grow to $1.0 billion to $1.4 billion.\nAnd with that, I'll pass the call back over to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Mussallem\n\nChairman & CEO, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\n(technical difficulty) informational therapies covering solid financial performance. We expect higher growth and meaningful progress in 2023 with a gradual improvement in hospital (inaudible). We believe the opportunity to serve our patients. We're confident that our patient-focused innovation strategy can transform care and bring value to patients and health care systems worldwide.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark.\n\nMark Wilterding\n\nVP of IR, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThank you, Mike. Thank you, Scott. With that, we're ready to take your questions. (Operator Instructions) Diego?"

(Operator Instructions). Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nMark Wilterding\n\nVP of IR, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThank you very much, Diego. And good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Ullem, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for the Q&A portion of the call are Larry Wood, our Global Leader of TAVR; Bernard Zovighian, our Global Leader of TMTT; Daveen Chopra, our Global Leader of Surgical Structural Heart; and Katie Szyman, our Global Leader of Critical Care. Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released third quarter 2022 financial results.\nDuring today's call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations.\nThese statements speak only as of the date on which they were made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today. Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are included in today's press release.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Mussallem for his comments. Mike?\n\nMichael A. Mussallem\n\nChairman & CEO, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThanks, Mark. The third quarter strengthened our conviction in our company's patient-focused innovation strategy. Globally, structural heart procedures grew less than we expected in the third quarter, but that didn't slow us down, as our team accomplished numerous important milestones and made good progress on our multiple clinical trials and next-generation technologies. In August, we received European regulatory approval for PASCAL PRECISION. This unique system is designed for transcatheter-based edge-to-edge leaflet repair in patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.\nShortly thereafter, in September, we received early U.S. FDA approval for PASCAL PRECISION for the treatment of patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation, which was welcome news for clinicians who appreciate this differentiated platform. And in TAVR, last month, we announced approval to begin selling the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve in the U.S. our industry-leading SAPIEN 3 Ultra transcatheter aortic heart valve now incorporates Edwards' breakthrough RESILIA technology. Additionally, during the third quarter, enrollment accelerated in our 2 TAVR pivotal trials: PROGRESS, evaluating patients with moderate AS; and ALLIANCE, for our next-generation TAVR technology SAPIEN X4. These transformative developments reinforce our confidence in the continued growth of transcatheter-based structural heart inventions. We will continue to aggressively pursue breakthrough technologies with the potential to help even a broader group of patients and in turn drive significant future value.\nNow turning to our financial performance. Third quarter total company sales of $1.3 billion increased 7% on a constant currency basis versus the year ago period. Our broad portfolio of innovative technologies drove this growth, although it was at the lower end of our expectations, reflecting persistent U.S. hospital staffing shortages and COVID headwinds in Japan. Adjusted EPS grew 13% even while aggressively investing in R&D and commercial infrastructure to support new therapies.\nFor full year 2022, we expect total Edwards sales will be negatively impacted by foreign exchange and be at the low end of our previous range of $5.35 billion to $5.55 billion. We anticipate hospital staffing challenges and a predicted difficult winter COVID and flu season will continue into next year. In TAVR, third quarter global sales of $862 million increased 6% on a constant currency basis. Sales were below our expectations due primarily to the persistent U.S. hospital staffing shortages and COVID headwinds in Japan, which intensified the typical impact of summer seasonality.\nIn the third quarter, we're pleased that well over 30,000 patients were treated with SAPIEN across our more than 2,000 global TAVR centers. We estimate that global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with Edwards' growth in the third quarter. Local selling prices were stable, although the average global selling price declined due to the weakening euro and yen. In the U.S., our TAVR procedures increased in the mid-single digits versus the prior year. We estimate that our share of procedures was stable.\nAs expected, our third quarter U.S. TAVR procedure volumes continued to be impacted by regional U.S. staffing constraints, which were somewhat worse than we anticipated. There were a high level of variability in growth rates across centers around the country. And while staffing issues limited overall growth during the quarter, nearly half of our TAVR centers grew double digit in Q3. Outside the U.S., in the third quarter, our TAVR sales grew in the low double digits on a constant currency basis, and we estimate total procedure growth was comparable.\nOur underlying 3-year compounded annual growth rate outside the U.S. remains in the mid-teens. In Q3, geographies outside of Europe and Japan grew even faster in the quarter. Long term, we see excellent opportunities for OUS growth as we believe international adoption of TAVR remains quite low. In Europe, sales were down sequentially as expected. Even though we compete with a broad range of competitors, our competitive position remains stable. Scattered staffing shortages slightly exacerbated summer seasonality, and we anticipate some lingering regional impact on that.\nIn Japan, third quarter procedure growth was impacted by a widespread seventh wave of COVID, which created a significant strain on hospital capacity and limited TAVR procedure volumes. As you might expect, procedure volumes in Q3 varied across the country as patients and the providers were incentivized to turn their focus again to the treatment of patients with COVID. We saw TAVR procedure volumes improve as COVID hospitalizations decreased late in the third quarter. We remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy driven by the fact that AS remains a significantly undertreated disease amongst this large elderly population.\nIn summary, we anticipate the continuation of staffing shortages and a difficult winter, COVID and flu season. We expect Q4 TAVR sales to be around $850 million and full year 2022 TAVR sales to be at the low end of our previous range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion. We remain confident about the long-term potential of TAVR as the rapidly evolving evidence recognized by policymakers around the world supports continued adoption of this therapy for the many patients suffering from aortic stenosis. This broad-based, favorable evidence, combined with the undertreatment rate and growing elderly population supports our expectation that this global TAVR opportunity will reach $10 billion by 2028, which implies a low double-digit compounded annual growth rate.\nTurning now to our Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies product group. Recently, we received U.S. FDA and European CE Mark approval of PASCAL PRECISION. This next-generation system designed to facilitate precise navigation and an intuitive user experience will enable us to initiate our commercial presence in the U.S. for the treatment of patients suffering from degenerative mitral regurgitation and also expand PASCAL adoption in Europe for both mitral and tricuspid patients.\nThis exciting news was followed by the presentation of first results from the CLASP IID pivotal trial at the recent TCT Conference. This first-of-a-kind head-to-head randomized pivotal trial further established the safety and efficacy of mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair. We were pleased that this data demonstrated that PASCAL is the beneficial therapy expanding transcatheter treatment options for DMR patients. In addition, we continue to advance enrollment of our CLASP IIF pivotal trial for patients with functional mitral regurgitation.\nSeparately, we continue to treat patients with our 2 transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND study for EVOQUE Eos. We are pleased with our progress and believe these sub-30 French transfemoral therapies will help transform treatment for patients and expand the mitral opportunity.\nTurning to tricuspid. We continue to make progress enrolling the TRISCEND II pivotal trial of the EVOQUE replacement system and the CLASP IIR (sic) [CLASP IITR] pivotal trial with the PASCAL repair system in patients with symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation. We no longer anticipate CE Mark approval for EVOQUE tricuspid replacement in Europe this year.\nAs uncertainties remain around the MDR process, we now expect a CE Mark approval late in 2023, with sales contribution in 2024 when we expect to have reimbursement in place. We're excited about this therapy for the many tricuspid patients who have few treatment options today. Looking ahead to PCR London Valves conference in November, we expect numerous late-breaking data presentations across the TMTT portfolio. Especially noteworthy is new 1-year follow-up data on our early experience with the EVOQUE tricuspid valve. We expect these presentations to contribute positively to the growing body of compelling clinical evidence for our comprehensive portfolio of transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies.\nTurning to the sales performance of TMTT. Third quarter sales of $30 million grew sequentially from the second quarter despite summer seasonality. Adoption of the PASCAL system in Europe increased as we initiated a limited introduction of PASCAL PRECISION, and we continue to have excellent outcomes for patients as we progress on a gradual expansion into more centers in Europe. We forecast to increase a number of procedures in Q4, yet expect reported Q4 sales to be similar to Q3 as a result of FX headwinds and a spike in COVID in Germany, our largest region in Europe. We're pleased with our continued progress to our [bring-up] portfolio of therapies combined with contemporary clinical data in order to achieve our vision of transforming the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease.\nIn Surgical Structural Heart, third quarter global sales of $220 million increased 8% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. We are encouraged to see strong global growth driven by increased penetration of our premium RESILIA products despite staffing challenges in certain regions. And although staffing shortages continued to be a concern, we're observing that cardiac surgeries are being prioritized.\nWe continue to see strong momentum of the RESILIA portfolio globally as we bolster the overall body of evidence, including 4 abstracts recently presented at the European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery Annual Meeting in Milan. We continue to believe that physicians value the features and benefits of this advanced tissue technology for both aortic and mitral surgical valve replacement procedures. Adoption of the MITRIS valve launched in the U.S. in April now represents the majority of our mitral valve sales in this region.\nSeparately, we've decided to exit our HARPOON surgical mitral repair system and stop enrollment in the related clinical trials. Given our experience to date, we made the difficult decision to focus on developing other innovative therapies to better serve patients and continue to be the partner of choice for cardiac surgeons. In summary, we remain confident that our full year 2022 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-single-digit range for Surgical Structural Heart driven by market adoption of our newest premium technologies and surgical market growth.\nIn Critical Care, third quarter sales of $207 million increased 3% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. The growth rate was impacted by a very strong prior year comparison. Sales growth was driven by increased adoption of our broad portfolio of smart recovery products, including FloTrac and ClearSight sensors with our unique hypotension prediction index algorithm. Additionally, demand for our HemoSphere monitoring platform remains strong. In summary, we continue to expect mid-single-digit underlying sales growth for the full year 2022. We remain enthusiastic about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations, highlighted by smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make even more informed decisions for patients.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott B. Ullem\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. As Mike mentioned, our sales of $1.32 billion in the quarter, representing growth of 6.7% on a constant currency basis, fell short of our expectations, driven by a slower-than-expected recovery of U.S. hospital staffing and COVID in Japan. Our strong underlying gross profit margin combined with a minimal spending increase resulted in adjusted earnings per share growth of 13% to $0.61. GAAP EPS was $0.55, which included a net $57 million pretax charge or $0.07 per share related to the HARPOON discontinuation.\nWe anticipate that the U.S. hospital staffing challenge is likely to persist, and we now expect total company sales at the low end of our previous range of $5.35 billion to $5.55 billion and TAVR sales also at the low end of our previous range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion. We continue to expect Surgical Structural Heart sales of $870 million to $950 million and Critical Care sales of $820 million to $900 million. For the fourth quarter, we're projecting sales and adjusted earnings per share to be similar to Q3.\nWe now expect full year adjusted earnings per share of $2.40 to $2.50, up from 2021 adjusted EPS of $2.22. I'll now cover additional details of our results. Our adjusted gross profit margin in the third quarter was 81.0% compared to 76.3% in the same period last year. This improvement was driven by the expected positive impact from our foreign exchange program, which includes hedge contract gains and natural hedges that offset the negative sales impact from the weakening of the euro and yen against the dollar.\nAt current FX rates, we continue to expect our full year 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to be approximately 80%. This year's forecasted gross margin rate includes approximately 350 basis points of benefit from foreign exchange as compared to 2021. At current rates, FX is expected to result in an approximate 250 basis point reduction in our gross profit and operating margins in 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter increased 3.5% over the prior year to $377 million or 28.6% of sales, primarily due to a resumption of in-person commercial activities, partially offset by the strengthening of the dollar. We continue to expect full year 2022 SG&A expenses as a percent of sales to be between 28% and 30% as we continue to invest in our high-touch model for TAVR and the ongoing build-out of the TMTT commercial team.\nResearch and development expenses in the quarter declined 2% over the prior year to $234 million or 17.7% of sales. The decline reflects unusually high year ago spending. We continue to expect R&D expenses in 2022 to be between 17% and 18% of sales as we invest in developing our new product pipeline and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT. The discontinuation of our surgical HARPOON program resulted in a net $0.07 per share charge consisting of a noncash impairment of intangible assets, a reduction of contingent liabilities and other related exit costs. Additional details of the charge and a reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted EPS is included with today's release.\nTurning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 15.7% or 17% excluding the impact of special items. This quarter's higher rate reflected a lower benefit from stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be at the high end of our 11% to 15% range.\nForeign exchange rates decreased third quarter reported sales growth by 6 percentage points or $74 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we estimate a year-over-year FX impact to fourth quarter sales of more than $100 million. In total, we now expect an approximate $270 million negative impact or 5 percentage points to full year 2022 sales compared to 2021, and we expect nearly the same negative impact to full year 2023 sales. FX rates positively impacted our third quarter gross profit margin by 440 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our July guidance, FX rates had a minimal impact on third quarter earnings per share. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $250 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $310 million, less capital spending of $60 million. So before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities.\nWe continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30. Average shares outstanding during the third quarter were $625 million, down from the prior quarter as we repurchased 1.1 million shares for $100 million. Year-to-date, through the end of Q3, we repurchased 8.4 million shares for $861 million. We expect shares at the end of the year will be slightly below our previous $625 million to $630 million share range. We now have $1.8 billion remaining under our share repurchase program.\nAnd with that, I'll pass it back over to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Mussallem\n\nChairman & CEO, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThanks, Scott. Well, despite ongoing procedure headwinds associated with the pandemic, we're pleased with our year-to-date performance, which includes strong progress on strategic milestones. We believe hospital staffing constraints will gradually improve and are committed to aggressively investing in our focused innovation strategy for the broad group of patients still suffering from structural heart disease. We remain confident that the innovative therapies resulting from our investments will allow us to treat more patients and continue to drive strong organic growth in the years to come.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.\n\nMark Wilterding\n\nVP of IR, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThanks a lot, Mike. Before we transition to Q&A, I want to remind everyone that our 2022 Investor Conference will take place on Thursday, December 8, at the New York Stock Exchange. Thank you to everyone who has confirmed your in-person attendance. We're really looking forward to seeing you soon at this historic venue. In addition to our 2023 financial guidance, you'll hear more about Edwards' focused innovation strategy and our comprehensive and exciting product pipeline. More information will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Edwards website at ir.edwards.com.\nWith that, we're ready to take your questions. (Operator Instructions). Diego?"

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you, sir. You may begin.\n\nMark Wilterding\n\nVP of IR, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nGood one, Diego. And good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Ullem, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for the Q&A portion of the call today will be Larry Wood, our Global Leader of TAVR; Bernard Zovighian, our Global Leader of TMTT; and Daveen Chopra, our Global Leader of Surgical Structural Heart. Katie Szyman, our Global Leader of Critical Care's out of town today, which she'll be with us on future earnings calls.\nJust after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released second quarter 2022 financial results. During today's call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying financial statements and then use the remaining time for Q&A.\nPlease note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they were made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today.\nAdditionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those associated with the pandemic that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important safety information may be found in the press release, our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website at edwards.com.\nFinally, a quick reminder that when using the terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are included in today's press release.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments. Mike?\n\nMichael A. Mussallem\n\nChairman & CEO, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThanks, Mark. In the second quarter, total company sales reflected year-over-year and sequential growth across all 4 of our product groups on a constant currency basis despite several challenging factors. Sales were lifted by a strong performance outside the U.S. with double-digit underlying sales growth in Europe and Japan.\nOn a constant currency basis, total company sales grew 5% compared to the extraordinary second quarter of 2021 when sales increased 44% lifted by the treatment of patients who had postponed their care. Nevertheless, second quarter sales and EPS were at the lower end of our expectations as a result of U.S. hospitals struggling with staffing shortages as well as the stronger U.S. dollar. We now anticipate that these challenges are likely to persist throughout 2022. And as a result, we are lowering our second half outlook to more realistically reflect the current operating environment.\nAlthough the near-term environment remains uncertain, we are unwavering in our long-term pursuit of groundbreaking innovations. We're investing to achieve breakthrough therapies that create significant value for patients in the health care systems, enabling strong organic sales growth. We continue to make meaningful progress on our pipeline and expect to achieve important milestones by year-end.\nAs the global population ages and cardiovascular disease remains the largest health burden, we continue to believe the opportunity to serve our patients will nearly double between now and 2028.\nNow turning to the quarterly results by product group. In TAVR, second quarter global sales of $907 million increased 5% on an underlying basis, despite approximately 50% growth in the year ago period. Sales were below our expectations due to the ongoing U.S. hospital staffing constraints and foreign exchange headwinds, but still represented our highest quarter of TAVR sales.\nWe estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with Edwards growth in the second quarter. In general, local selling prices were stable, although the average global selling price declined slightly due to the weakening euro and yen.\nIn Q2, we continued to advance 2 pivotal trials aiming to expand indications. First, our EARLY TAVR trial is studying the large group of patients with severe aortic stenosis and no diagnosed symptoms. Second, our PROGRESS trial is evaluating patients with moderate AS, which represents a group that is much larger than those with severe AS. And last month, we also began treating patients in our ALLIANCE pivotal trial for our next-generation SAPIEN X4.\nIn the U.S. our TAVR sales were approximately flat with the elevated prior year, but increased in the high single-digit range sequentially. We estimate that our share of procedures was stable. As previously mentioned, our second quarter U.S. TAVR sales were impacted by slower-than-expected improvement in the U.S. hospital staffing and temporary contrast agent shortages.\nAlso recall in Q2 of last year, our U.S. TAVR sales increased over 50% on a year-over-year basis as COVID vaccines became more widely available and patients who had waited were treated. On a 3-year compounded annual basis, our U.S. TAVR sales increased 10% compared to the strong second quarter in 2019.\nOutside the U.S. In the second quarter, our underlying TAVR sales grew in the mid-teens on a year-over-year basis, and we estimate total procedural growth was comparable. This strong growth outside the U.S. was consistent with our underlying 3-year compounded annual growth rate also in the mid-teens.\nLong-term, we see excellent opportunities for OUS growth as we believe international adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low.\nIn Europe, Edwards sales growth was driven by the continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN platform. We estimate that our competitive position was stable. Localized hospital staffing disruptions impacted second quarter results, although this headwind was less pronounced than in the U.S. 15 years after commercialization, it's encouraging to see the resilience of the TAVR programs in Europe despite the challenging backdrop of today's environment.\nIn Japan, we experienced continued strong TAVR adoption as we remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout the country. Similar to last quarter, the number of TAVR procedures performed exceeded surgical aortic valve replacement following approval last year for patients at low surgical risk.\nIn summary, we continue to be very optimistic about the long-term potential of TAVR because of its transformational impact on the many patients suffering from aortic stenosis and because many remain untreated. Recall that we had previously assumed an improvement in the U.S. hospital staffing shortages throughout the year. We're now anticipating a slower improvement. And as a result, we are adjusting our full year outlook.\nWe expect underlying TAVR sales growth of around 10% in full year 2022 versus the previous expectation for 12% to 15%. Longer-term, we remain confident in this large global opportunity and that it will double to $10 billion by 2028, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range.\nNow turning to TMTT. To transform treatment and unlock the significant long-term growth opportunity for mitral and tricuspid patients, we remain focused on 3 key value drivers: a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive clinical trial results to support approvals and adoption and favorable real-world clinical outcomes.\nAt the TCT Conference in September, we expect the first results of the Class IID pivotal trial evaluating patients suffering from degenerative mitral regurgitation. This is -- this first of its kind head-to-head randomized pivotal trial, powered for noninferiority, will be the first of several key pivotal trials evaluating the PASCAL technology.\nAdditionally, at TCT, we expect 3-year data from the earlier class study. This growing contemporary body of clinical evidence will be important for the physician community considering transcatheter edge-to-edge repair treatments for mitral patients.\nWe remain on track for U.S. FDA approval and CE Mark approval of PASCAL precision by year-end. This next-generation system is designed to facilitate precise navigation and an intuitive user experience, extending our differentiated platform. This will allow us to expand PASCAL adoption in Europe, and we're pleased that we'll be launching the newest generation of PASCAL in the U.S.\nIn mitral replacement, we continue to broaden our experience with both of our transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND study for EVOQUE Eos. Growing evidence with these sub-30-French transfemoral therapies furthers our confidence in book platforms.\nTurning to tricuspid. We also continue to make progress on enrolling the TRISCEND II pivotal trial for the EVOQUE replacement system and the Class II TR pivotal trial with PASCAL in patients with symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation.\nWhile we remain hopeful for year-end approval in Europe, uncertainties exist regarding the new MDR approval process for novel technologies seeking a CE Mark. We remain committed to bringing the EVOQUE therapy to these tricuspid patients who have a very poor prognosis and few treatment options today.\nAs we continue to build a body of compelling clinical evidence, we're pleased with the recent data from several late-breaking presentations. One-year results from our CLASS TR study presented at the American College of Cardiology Conference demonstrated significantly reduced TR, improved quality of life and maintain TR reduction.\nAlso at the EuroPCR meeting, 30-day post-market data from our TriCLASP study was presented with 90% of the patients showing improvements in their quality of life. At upcoming medical conferences this year, we plan for contemporary evidence to be presented on both our PASCAL and EVOQUE platforms.\nTurning to results. Second quarter global sales were $28 million, driven by the continued adoption of the PASCAL platform and activation of more centers across Europe. Our Q2 commercial performance was tempered by lower-than-expected market growth related primarily to COVID headwinds. We are now updating our full year guidance to $110 to $140 million, which represents approximately 60% underlying growth over the prior year and reflects a stronger-than-anticipated impact from foreign exchange as the vast majority of TMTT's business is in Europe.\nBigger picture, we continue to be pleased with our progress forward on 3 key value drivers. We're advancing our comprehensive portfolio of differentiated therapies combined with contemporary clinical evidence and favorable real-world patient outcomes. Together, this demonstrates the promise of these therapies for this significant unmet patient need and will help unlock this large market potential.\nIn Surgical Structural Heart, second quarter 2022 global sales of $229 million increased 2% on an underlying basis over the prior year. We are encouraged to see global growth despite sales headwinds from the planned discontinuation of certain noncore cannula products as well as the COVID shutdown in China, which combined reduce growth by approximately 500 basis points. Our growth continues to be driven by increased penetration of our premium RESILIA products.\nWe've seen strong adoption of the MITRIS RESILIA valve in the U.S. since its initial launch in April. Building on the commercial success of INSPIRIS, we believe hospitals value the intuitive product features as well as the benefits of this innovative RESILIA tissue technology. Physician feedback in regions where MITRIS has been launched has been positive and initial clinical outcomes have been favorable.\nIn the second quarter, we continued to bolster the overall body of RESILIA evidence. This includes a commenced trial subanalysis, which demonstrated the excellent performance of this tissue technology when treating bicuspid aortic valve disease, which was presented at the 2022 Annual Meeting of the American Association of Thoracic Surgeons in May. In a cohort of more than 200 patients averaging a relatively young 60 years of age, structural valve deterioration was 0 at 5 years.\nIn summary, we remain confident that our full year 2022 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-single-digit range for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by market adoption of our newest premium technologies and global surgical market growth.\nIn Critical Care, second quarter sales of $211 million increased 3% on an underlying basis. As expected, growth was moderated by strong prior year comparisons. Sales growth was driven by increased adoptions of our Hypotension Prediction Index algorithm and our broad portfolio of sensors.\nAdditionally, we continued enrollment in the HPI Smart-BP trial focused on generating additional clinical evidence to support further adoption. Demand for the HemoSphere monitoring platform remains strong with a healthy pipeline of future opportunities.\nIn summary, we continue to expect mid-single-digit underlying sales growth in 2022. We remain excited about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations as we shift our focus to Smart Recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make more informed decisions for their patients.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott B. Ullem\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nOkay. Thanks, Mike. (inaudible) several challenging factors (inaudible) best hospital staffing and foreign exchange headwinds. Our business fundamentals remain strong. We achieved total sales in the quarter of $1.37 billion with double-digit underlying sales growth in Europe and Japan.\nWe expected our underlying growth in the second quarter would be our lowest of the year, given our strong prior year sales performance. Our higher-than-expected gross profit margin lifted by the positive impact from our foreign exchange program contributed to an adjusted earnings per share of $0.63.\nWe are adjusting our guidance to more accurately reflect the continuation of the more pronounced FX headwinds and slower-than-expected improvement in COVID-related hospital staffing. We expect total company underlying sales growth of approximately 10% in the second half of this year.\nFor full year 2022, we now expect total Edwards sales of $5.35 billion to $5.55 billion. We expect TAVR sales of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion. For TMTT, $110 million to $140 million. For Surgical Structural Heart, $870 million to $950 million; and for Critical Care, $820 million to $900 million.\nNow expect full year adjusted earnings per share guidance at the bottom end of our original guidance range of $2.50 to $2.65. For the third quarter, we're projecting sales to be between $1.30 billion and $1.37 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.58 to $0.66.\nI'll now cover additional details of our results. Our adjusted gross profit margin in the second quarter was 80.5% compared to 75.9% in the same period last year. The improvement was driven by the higher-than-expected positive impact from our FX program, which includes natural hedges and hedge contract gains that offset the sales impact from the weakening of the euro and yen versus the dollar.\nAt current foreign exchange rates, we now expect our full year and second half 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to increase to approximately 80%. This guidance range reflects our assumptions of a favorable impact from FX hedge gains and an improved product mix partially offset by supply chain inflationary pressures.\nThis year's forecasted gross margin rate includes approximately 350 basis points of benefit from foreign exchange versus 2021. At current FX rates, in 2023, we expect an approximate 250 basis point reduction in our gross profit rate.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were $409 million or 29.8% of sales, primarily due to a resumption of in-person commercial activities partially offset by the weakening of the euro and yen against the (inaudible)\nWe continue to expect full year 2022 SG&A expenses as a percent of sales to be between 28% and 30%, as we continue to invest in our high-touch model for TAVR and the ongoing build-out of the TMTT commercial team.\nResearch and development expenses in the quarter grew 11% compared to the same period last year to $251 million or 18.3% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations, including 8 currently enrolling pivotal clinical trials.\nFor the full year 2022, we continue to expect R&D expenses to be between 17% and 18% of sales as we invest in developing our new product pipeline and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT.\nDuring the second quarter, we recorded a $21 million net reduction in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities, which benefited earnings per share by $0.03. This benefit was excluded from our adjusted earnings per share of $0.63. This reflects an accounting adjustment from assumptions regarding potential milestone payments for previous acquisition.\nTurning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 12.5% or 12.9%, excluding the impact of special items. Due to last quarter's new regulations that potentially limit the amount of our foreign tax credits, combined with an estimated reduced tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting, we now expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be at the high end of our previous 11% to 15% range.\nForeign exchange rates decreased second quarter reported sales growth by 4.6 percentage points or $60 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $250 million negative impact or 4.5 percentage points to full year 2022 sales compared to 2021, of which approximately $170 million impacts the second half of the year.\nFX rates positively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 380 basis points compared to the prior year. FX rates had a minimal impact on second quarter earnings per share. We mentioned at the investor conference, in periods of a strengthening dollar like this, sales are negatively impacted. But as a result of financial and natural hedges, margin rates benefit resulting in a minimal impact to the bottom line in the calendar year.\nFree cash flow for the second quarter was $289 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $332 million less capital spending of $43 million.\nBefore turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of June 30, 2022.\nAverage shares outstanding during the quarter were 627 million, down from the prior quarter as we repurchased 3.7 million shares during the second quarter for $355 million. In the first half of the year, we repurchased 7.3 million shares.\nIn July, we obtained Board approval to increase the authorization under our share repurchase program consistent with our long-time practice of seeking new authorization when the prior authorization has been diminished. We now have $1.9 billion remaining under the program.\nGiven our repurchase activity in the first half of the year, we now expect our average diluted shares outstanding for 2022 to be between 625 million and 630 million.\nWith that, I'll pass it back over to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Mussallem\n\nChairman & CEO, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThanks, Scott. Our strong foundation of technology leadership, combined with a robust product pipeline, positions us well for continued success. As patients and clinicians increasingly recognize the significant benefits of transcatheter-based technologies reported by the substantial body of compelling evidence, we remain as optimistic as ever about the long-term growth opportunities.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.\n\nMark Wilterding\n\nVP of IR, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThanks a lot, Mike. Before we open it up for questions, I'm excited to announce that Edwards is planning to host an Investor Update at TCT on Saturday, September 17. This event will recap -- will include a recap of pivotal trial data, updates on our latest technologies and views on longer-term market potential. We hope to see you there. But please note this meeting will be webcast for those who cannot attend in-person. More information will be available in the coming weeks.\nWith that, we're ready to take questions now.

Let me begin by saying I remain very proud of our team's steadfast dedication to our patient-focused strategy. Throughout the first quarter, our supply chain delivered, and our field team continued to support the skilled clinicians and patients who count on Edwards. We continue to believe that 2022 will be an important year for Edwards Lifesciences as we expect low double-digit sales growth and meaningful progress on our pursuit of significant opportunities to improve patient care.\nLooking beyond 2022, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative therapies. Our patient-focused culture drives us and motivates our employees around the world and our R&D targets breakthrough therapies that can create significant value for patients and health systems, enabling strong organic sales growth.\nAs we are hopeful the worst of the pandemic is behind us, we're constantly reminded of the importance of our work as we pursue solutions for cardiovascular disease, which continues to be the #1 killer in the U.S. and the world, well ahead of cancer and other deadly conditions.\nTurning now to our first quarter financial results. Sales of $1.3 billion increased 13% on a constant currency basis versus the year ago period. Despite the impact that Omicron had on hospital capacity, resources and procedure volumes in January, especially in the U.S., Q1 global sales were moderately better than our expectations. Sales were lifted by performance outside the U.S., where we experienced a less pronounced impact from the pandemic. Underlying sales growth was double digit across all regions and benefited from improving trends as we progressed through the first quarter.\nIn TAVR, first quarter global sales were $881 million, an increase of 14% on an underlying basis, with continued strong growth outside the U.S. We estimate the global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our own growth, and average selling prices were stable globally.\nIn the U.S., our first quarter TAVR sales grew approximately 10% versus the prior year, and we estimate total procedure growth was comparable. TAVR adoption was broad-based across hospitals, and our SAPIEN valves continue to demonstrate distinguished clinical performance.\nOutside the U.S., in the first quarter, our underlying TAVR sales grew approximately 20% on a year-over-year basis, and we estimate total procedure growth was comparable. We continue to see excellent opportunities for OUS growth as international adoption of TAVR therapy remains low.\nIn Europe, Edwards' sales growth was driven by the continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN platform and was broad-based across all countries. Our treatment rates recovered nicely throughout the quarter although they differed by country, reflecting variable COVID impacts. We estimate that our competitive position was stable.\nIn Japan, we also experienced strong TAVR adoption, and the number of TAVR procedures performed exceeded surgical aortic valve replacement. Following reimbursement approval last year for the treatment of patients at low surgical risk, we remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout the country. And broadly across the globe, we continue to see encouraging TAVR adoption in many underpenetrated countries.\nIn addition to geographic expansion, we remain focused on helping more patients gain access to TAVR therapy. In Q1, we continued to advance 2 pivotal trials aimed at expanding indication. First, our early TAVR trial for the large group of patients with severe AS and no diagnosed symptoms. And second, our PROGRESS trial that is evaluating patients with moderate AS which represents a group that is much larger than those with severe AS. We also remain on track to begin treating patients this quarter in our ALLIANCE pivotal trial for our next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4.\nIn summary, assuming no new COVID headwinds and a gradual improvement in U.S. hospital staffing shortages throughout the year, we continue to plan for underlying TAVR sales growth to be in the range of 12% to 15%. We remain confident that this large global opportunity will double to $10 billion by 2028, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range.\nNow turning to TMTT. To transform patient care and unlock the significant long-term growth opportunity, we continue to make steady progress on 3 key value drivers: a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive pivotal trial results to support approvals and adoption and favorable real-world clinical outcomes. We're pleased with our high procedural success rates, and we continued our strong momentum with more patients than ever treated with our TMTT technologies this quarter.\nIn mitral repair, we continue to achieve excellent clinical outcomes with PASCAL as we expand commercially and treat more patients in Europe. We remain on track for U.S. approval of PASCAL PRECISION for patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation late this year, supported by our Class IId pivotal trial. We continue to advance the enrollment of Class IIf pivotal study for patients with functional mitral regurgitation. And later this year, we expect European approval of our new PASCAL PRECISION system, which is engineered for enhanced navigation and an intuitive user experience, extending our differentiated platform.\nIn mitral replacement, we continue to broaden our experience with both of our transcatheter mitral replacement technologies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND study for EVOQUE Eos. This early experience with the sub-30-French transfemoral therapies gives us confidence that these platforms have the potential to transform treatment for the many patients in need.\nTurning to transcatheter tricuspid therapies. As we continue to build a body of clinical evidence for PASCAL in the tricuspid position, we are pleased with the recently presented late-breaking data at the ACC meeting last month. We are encouraged by the sustained significant reduction in tricuspid regurgitation and improvements in quality-of-life measures experienced by patients and look forward to bringing additional clinical evidence through our Class II TR pivotal trial, which is currently enrolling.\nIn addition, we continue to make progress in enrolling our TRISCEND II pivotal trial of the EVOQUE system. We expect a late 2022 approval for EVOQUE tricuspid replacement in Europe and remain committed to providing solutions for these patients who have a very poor prognosis and few treatment options today.\nTurning to our results. First quarter global TMTT sales were $27 million, driven by the continued adoption of the PASCAL platform in Europe. Although there was an impact from COVID early in the quarter, we exited March with positive momentum. As we expand in Europe, physicians continue to achieve high procedural success rates and excellent clinical outcomes.\nAssuming a diminishing COVID-related impact, we are planning a gradual ramp in Q2 and a significant acceleration in the second half of the year to reach our 2022 sales guidance of $140 million to $170 million. We look forward to continuing our progress toward advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease.\nIn Surgical Structural Heart, first quarter 2022 global sales of $221 million increased 6% on an underlying basis over the prior year. Despite a soft start to the year associated with COVID, we are encouraged by the steady improvement across most regions over the course of the quarter, driven by increased penetration of premium technologies and procedure growth. Although hospital staffing shortages remain a concern, we believe that life-saving surgical therapies continue to be prioritized.\nAt the end of March, we announced the U.S. FDA approval and commercial launch of our MITRIS RESILIA valve, which adds to the portfolio of durable RESILIA tissue products with a valve designed for the heart's mitral position. Built upon previous generations of proven mitral valve technology, MITRIS offers greater ease of use and is designed to facilitate potential future transcatheter interventions.\nToday, nearly 60% of the world's surgical mitral valves are mechanical. RESILIA tissue should allow patients to thrive without the quality-of-life compromises that may come from having a mechanical valve. Initial feedback from U.S. surgeons has been very positive.\nIn summary, we remain confident that our full year 2022 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-single-digit range for a Surgical Structural Heart driven by market adoption of our newest premium technologies.\nIn Critical Care, first quarter sales of $212 million increased 11% on an underlying basis driven by balanced contributions from all product lines. Demand for our state-of-the-art HemoSphere monitoring platform remains strong and lifted our sales. Our broad portfolio of Smart Recovery sensors and our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices supported the increased number of patients in the ICU in the first quarter. Additionally, we continued enrollment in the HPI SMART-BP trial, focused on generating additional clinical evidence to support the adoption of our hypotension predictive index software.\nIn summary, we continue to expect mid-single-digit underlying sales growth for 2022, which are moderated by the strong prior year comparisons over the remainder of the year. We remain excited about our pipeline of critical care innovations as we continue to shift our focus to Smart Recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott B. Ullem\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike. We are encouraged by our start to the year. Despite the impact from Omicron early in the quarter, all product groups performed well, and sales were balanced across all regions. We achieved total sales in the quarter of $1.341 billion, which represents 12.7% year-over-year underlying growth. This strong sales performance fell through to our operating income, and we achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.60.\nAssuming no new COVID headwinds and a gradual improvement in U.S. hospital staffing shortages, we are projecting second quarter sales to be between $1.36 billion and $1.44 billion, which represents sequential organic growth from the first quarter, partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds. We expect our year-over-year sales growth in the second quarter to be our lowest of the year given our strong prior year sales performance. We are also projecting second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 to $0.69.\nAlthough we haven't fully overcome the January Omicron impact, we are maintaining all of our previous full year guidance ranges for 2022 despite more pronounced foreign exchange headwinds and COVID-related hospital staffing challenges in the U.S. As a reminder, for total Edwards, we expect sales of $5.5 billion to $6 billion; for TAVR, $3.7 billion to $4.0 billion; for TMTT, $140 million to $170 million; for Surgical Structural Heart, $870 million to $950 million; and for Critical Care, $820 million to $900 million. We are also maintaining our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.50 to $2.65, representing mid-teens growth over 2021. And now I'll cover additional details of our results.\nFor the first quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.8% compared to 76.0% in the same period last year. As we expected, this improvement was driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange, primarily the strengthening of the dollar against the euro and the yen.\nWe continue to expect our full year 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 78% and 79%. This guidance range reflects our assumptions of a favorable impact from foreign exchange hedge gains and improved product mix and partially offset by supply chain inflationary pressures.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $370 million or 27.6% of sales, reflecting field-based personnel-related costs and commercial activities in support of our growth. We continue to expect full year 2022 SG&A as a percent of sales to be between 28% and 30% as we continue to invest in our high-touch model for TAVR and ongoing build-out of the TMTT commercial team.\nResearch and development expenses in the quarter grew 10% to $229 million or 17% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect R&D to be 17% to 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT.\nTurning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 14.3% or 14.4%, excluding the impact of special items. This is slightly higher than the midpoint of our full year guidance range because it included the unplanned impact of U.S. tax regulations published in Q1. These regulations potentially limit the amount of foreign taxes that are creditable against U.S. income taxes. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be 11% to 15%, including an estimated benefit of 3 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting.\nForeign exchange rates decreased our first quarter reported sales growth by 2.5 percentage points or $27 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $170 million negative impact or about 3% to full year 2022 sales compared to 2021 versus our previous expectation of a $100 million negative impact. We forecast this additional $70 million negative impact to sales will occur over the remainder of the year. FX rates positively impacted our first quarter gross profit margin by 240 basis points compared to the prior year. Although this benefits our operating margin rate relative to our January guidance, FX rates had a minimal impact on first quarter earnings per share.\nAs we mentioned at the investor conference, in periods of a strengthening dollar like this, sales are negatively impacted. But as a result of financial and natural hedges, margin rates benefit, resulting in little impact to the bottom line. At current rates, our operating margin in 2022 is benefiting by approximately 200 basis points from foreign exchange.\nFree cash flow for the first quarter was $221 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $294 million, less capital spending of $73 million. We continue to expect full year 2022 free cash flow will be between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion. This includes approximately $200 million of accelerated tax payments due to a change in the tax treatment of research and development expenses.\nBefore turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, 2022. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $400 million in stock through an accelerated share repurchase agreement and pre-established 10b5-1 programs. As a result, average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter declined by approximately 3 million to 629 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2022 to be between 630 million to 635 million.\nAnd with that, I'll pass it back over to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Mussallem\n\nChairman & CEO, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThank you, Scott. So we're confident in our long-term outlook for strong sales growth, and our teams remain passionate about helping more patients around the world. We continue to focus on driving organic growth with leading innovative technologies, while aggressively investing in our future. Our foundation of leadership, coupled with a robust product pipeline, positions us well for continued long-term success and greater shareholder value as we pursue significant opportunities to improve patients' lives.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark Wilterding\n\nVP of IR, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThanks a lot, Mike. With that, we're ready to take questions. (Operator Instructions) Diego?"

Mike?\n\nMichael A. Mussallem\n\nChairman & CEO, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThank you, Mark. We're proud of our performance in 2021. Although hospitals continue to be impacted by COVID, it was a year of significant milestones and investment for Edwards and our teams were relentless. In TAVR, we made important strides in executing our long-term strategy. In particular, we invested in increasing awareness, pursued further therapy expansion and advance new technologies. We completed enrollment of the EARLY-TAVR trial, an important pivotal study studying the treatment of severe aortic stenosis patients before their symptoms develop. Separately, we initiated enrollment in our PROGRESS trial for moderate AS patients, and we received FDA approval for our ALLIANCE pivotal trial to start our next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4.\nIn TMTT, we achieved our significant 2021 milestones as we continue to make meaningful progress on advancing our 3 key value drivers: a portfolio of pioneering therapies for patients; positive pivotal trial results to support approvals and adoption; and favorable real-world clinical outcomes. We are pleased to have treated over 3,000 patients in 2021 with our differentiated portfolio of TMTT therapies, gaining valuable learnings through both our clinical and commercial experiences.\nEach of our platforms demonstrated promising outcomes and clinical performance. I'm also pleased to announce that we completed enrollment of our CLASP IID pivotal trial in 2021, an important milestone that keeps us on track for U.S. approval late this year.\nIn Surgical Structural Heart, we extended our leadership position through the adoption of our premium technologies. We also implemented valuable additions to our smart monitoring advancements in critical care. Most importantly, in 2021, even more patients benefited from Edwards' life-saving technologies than ever before.\nI'm also proud to say that throughout the year, our employees remain dedicated to keeping our commitments to patients and to one another. Despite the ongoing pandemic that fueled global challenges, our employees found innovative ways to support hospital procedures and to ensure our ability to supply our life-saving therapies was not impacted. And through their efforts, we were able to get our technologies into the hands of our trusted partners around the world so they could serve their patients.\nNow I'd like to cover several 2021 financial highlights before I get into the quarterly details. In 2021, we are pleased to achieve all of our key financial expectations. Underlying sales increased 18% to $5.2 billion, driven by balanced organic sales growth in each region. We achieved 19% growth in adjusted earnings per share, while also increasing R&D, 19%. The significant increase in R&D and infrastructure investments this year helped strengthen our long-term outlook. And as you heard at our investor conference last month, we are as convinced as ever about the tremendous opportunity we have to enhance patients' lives and bring significant value to the health care system.\nTurning to our financial results. Fourth quarter sales of $1.3 billion increased 13% on a constant currency basis versus the year ago period. Growth was driven by our portfolio of innovative technologies, although at the lower end of our October expectations due to the pronounced impact of Omicron on hospital resources in December, especially in the U.S.\nFull year 2021 global TAVR sales of $3.4 billion increased 18% on an underlying basis versus the prior year. Despite intermittent challenges associated with the pandemic throughout the year, sales were in line with our original guidance of $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion and were driven by increased awareness of the benefits of TAVR therapy with our SAPIEN platform.\nIn the fourth quarter, our global TAVR sales were $872 million, an increase of 13% on an underlying basis, with impressive strength outside the U.S. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth. And globally, average selling prices were stable as we maintained our disciplined pricing strategy.\nIn the U.S., our TAVR sales grew 10% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and we estimate that our share of procedures was stable. As previously mentioned, the Omicron variant had a noticeable impact on hospital resources in December as cases were postponed or limited in a number of hospitals. Growth in the U.S. was highest in small- to mid-volume centers, which are helping provide access to a broader population of aortic stenosis patients.\nOutside the U.S., in the fourth quarter, our sales grew approximately 20% year-over-year on an underlying basis, and we estimate total TAVR procedure growth was comparable. We continue to be encouraged by the strong international adoption of TAVR broadly in all regions.\nIn Europe, Edwards' growth was in the mid-teens, and we estimate that our competitive position was stable. Growth was broad-based across the region. It's worth noting that a recent cost-effectiveness study demonstrated that TAVR with SAPIEN 3 was economically dominant when compared to surgical aortic valve replacement in treating French patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who are at low surgical mortality -- who are at low risk of surgical mortality.\nWe're also encouraged by the recently published guidelines from the European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgery, which now definitively recommend TAVR for patients over 75. We believe both of these developments represents an important long-term opportunity to bring TAVR therapy to even more patients in need.\nSales growth in Japan was also strong, where therapy adoption is still relatively low. Several important milestones were achieved in Q4. For the first time, the number of TAVR procedures performed in Japan was comparable with the surgical aortic valve replacements. Furthermore, in each prefecture in Japan, there is now at least 1 hospital offering SAPIEN. Following the recent reimbursement approval for the treatment of patients at low surgical risk, we remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout the country. Longer term, we see excellent opportunities for continued OUS growth as we believe global adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low.\nIn addition to our geographic expansion of our TAVR therapies, we remain focused on indication expansion. In Q4, we completed enrollment of our EARLY-TAVR pivotal trial, which is focused on the treatment of asymptomatic AS patients. Separately, we initiated enrollment in PROGRESS, an important pivotal trial for moderate aortic stenosis to determine the optimal time to treat patients who have this progressive disease. We believe that some patients may benefit from earlier treatment before they have symptoms or before their AS becomes severe, rather than risking irreversible damage to their heart as the disease progresses.\nWe also took steps to advance our innovative product portfolio. In Q4, we received FDA approval for our ALLIANCE pivotal trial to study our next-generation TAVR device, SAPIEN X4. Additionally, in Q4, we received FDA approval to use SAPIEN 3 with our Alterra adaptive pre-stent for congenital heart patients. This should result in a quality of life improvement and a reduction in the number of procedures that these younger patients will require over their lifetime.\nIn summary, despite a slower-than-expected start to the year, we continue to anticipate 2022 underlying TAVR sales growth of 12% to 15%, consistent with the range we shared at our December investor conference. Our outlook assumes COVID-related challenges early in 2022, turning to more normalized growth environment as headwinds from Omicron subside and hospital resource constraints stabilize. We remain confident in this large global opportunity will double to $10 billion by 2028, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range.\nTurning to TMTT. As I mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we completed enrollment of our CLASP IID pivotal trial, and we remain on track to present data in the second half of 2022. This important milestone keeps us on track for U.S. approval late this year of PASCAL for patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation. We also continue to expect European approval of our next-generation PASCAL Precision System later this year.\nAt the PCR London Valves conference in Q4, PASCAL 30-day outcomes from our MiCLASP post-market approval study of more than 250 patients in Europe were presented. The data highlighted safe and effective MR reduction in a post-market setting. We also progressed on the enrollment of our CLASP IIF pivotal trial for patients with functional mitral disease.\nIn mitral replacement, we continue to expand our experience with both our transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND study for EVOQUE Eos. Early experience with these sub-French transfemoral therapies increase our confidence in both platforms.\nTurning to transcatheter tricuspid therapies, results from the TRISCEND study were presented at the Annual TCT Conference in November and demonstrated that early patient outcomes with the EVOQUE tricuspid were favorable and sustained at 6 months. We are encouraged by the procedural success rates and also the significant TR reduction and sustained improvements in quality of life measures experienced by these patients.\nWe continue to make meaningful progress in enrolling our 2 tricuspid pivotal trials the tri cusp -- the TRISCEND II pivotal trial for the EVOQUE system and the CLASP IITR pivotal trial with PASCAL in patients with symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation. We anticipate a late 2022 approval of EVOQUE tricuspid in Europe and remain committed to providing solutions for these patients that have very poor prognosis and few treatment options today.\nTurning to the sales performance of TMTT. Fourth quarter revenue of $25 million grew sequentially from the third quarter as we saw increased adoption of the PASCAL system despite the negative COVID impact in December. Full year 2021 global sales more than doubled to $86 million. As we continue to expand the availability of PASCAL to more centers in Europe, we are pleased with the excellent outcomes for patients supported by our high-touch model. We look forward to continuing our progress toward advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease in 2022 with the milestones that we outlined in our recent investor conference.\nDespite the COVID impact so far this year, we continue to expect TMTT sales of $140 million to $170 million for 2022. We estimate the global TMTT opportunity will grow to approximately $5 billion by 2028, and we remain committed to bringing our groundbreaking portfolio of therapies to patients with these life-threatening diseases. We are confident our portfolio strategy positions us well for leadership.\nIn Surgical Structural Heart, full year global sales were $889 million, up 15% on an underlying basis versus the prior year. Fourth quarter 2021 global sales of $221 million increased 9% on an underlying basis over the prior year. Although we saw that hospital staffing shortages continued to worsen throughout the quarter, especially in the U.S., life-saving surgical therapies continue to be prioritized over elective procedures. We're excited about the continued global adoption of INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic surgical valve, the KONECT RESILIA aortic tissue valve conduit and our MITRIS RESILIA valve. We remain encouraged by the growing evidence that supports Edwards RESILIA tissue valves, including 2 studies being presented at the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Conference this weekend. The COMMENCE study demonstrates excellent hemodynamics of this tissue technology across all aortic valve sizes at 5 years, while a European economic value study shows a cost reduction with the use of INSPIRIS versus mechanical valves.\nIn summary, we continue to expect that our full year 2022 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-single-digit range for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by adoption of our premium technologies and procedure growth. Even as TAVR adoption expands, we're excited about our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for patients, extend our global leadership and be the partner of choice for cardiac surgeons.\nTurning to Critical Care. Full year global sales of $835 million increased 14% on an underlying basis versus the prior year. 2021 growth was driven by balanced contributions from all product lines led by HemoSphere sales as capital spending resumed. Our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU also remained in high demand due to the elevated COVID hospitalizations in both the U.S. and Europe. Fourth quarter Critical Care sales of $212 million increased 8% on an underlying basis, driven by strong demand for HemoSphere. Demand for our broad portfolio of smart recovery sensors also remained robust in the fourth quarter, including ClearSight, our noninvasive finger cuff, which achieved sustained performance at or above pre-COVID levels.\nAs discussed at our recent investor conference, the integration of a full range of technologies creates a unique offering of enhanced recovery tools and predictive analytics capabilities to further strengthen our leadership in hemodynamic monitoring. In summary, we continue to expect mid-single-digit underlying sales growth for 2022, and we remain excited about our pipeline of innovative critical care products.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott B. Ullem\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThanks a lot, Mike. Today, I'll provide a wrap-up of 2021, including detailed results from the fourth quarter as well as provide an update on guidance for the first quarter and full year of this year. Sales in the fourth quarter increased 12.6% on an underlying basis. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.51, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.53.\nOur fourth quarter sales were negatively impacted by the wave of COVID that began late in the quarter, especially in the U.S. Earnings per share in the quarter was below our expectations as it was impacted by weaker-than-expected sales and we accelerated certain spending into the fourth quarter of 2021 that we had planned to incur during 2022, including preparation for TMTT product launches. For the full year 2021, we are pleased with our performance as sales increased 18% on an underlying basis to $5.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to $2.22.\nI'll now cover the details of our results and then discuss guidance for 2022. For the fourth quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.8% compared to 75.3% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by a favorable impact from foreign exchange. We continue to expect our full year 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 78% and 79%. This year, our rate should be lifted by a favorable impact from foreign exchange and an improved product mix, partially offset by investments in our manufacturing capacity.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were $424 million or 31.9% of sales compared to $339 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by the resumption of medical congresses and commercial activities compared to the COVID impacted prior year as well as the addition of personnel in preparation for new product launches. We continue to expect full year 2022 SG&A as a percent of sales, excluding special items, to be between 28% and 30%.\nResearch and development expenses in the quarter grew 19% to $233 million or 17.5% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations, including increased TMTT clinical trial activity. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT growth.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we recorded an $18 million net reduction in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities, which benefited earnings per share by $0.03. This gain was excluded from the adjusted earnings per share of $0.51 I mentioned earlier. This reduction reflects an accounting adjustment associated with reduced expectations of making a future milestone payment for a previous acquisition.\nTurning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 10.9% or 12.7%, excluding the impact of special items. This rate included an approximate 3 percentage point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. Our full year 2021 tax rate, excluding special items, was 12.6%. We continue to expect our full year rate in 2022 to be between 11% and 15%, which includes an estimated benefit of 3 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting.\nForeign exchange rates decreased fourth quarter reported sales by approximately 1% or $10 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $100 million negative impact or about 2% to full year 2022 sales as compared to 2021. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted our fourth quarter gross profit margin by 140 basis points compared to the prior year.\nFree cash flow for the fourth quarter was $284 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $374 million, less capital spending of $90 million. Full year 2021 free cash flow was $1.4 billion, up from $734 million in 2020. We continue to expect full year 2022 free cash flow to be between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion. In 2022, we expect our cash flow will be reduced by approximately $200 million due to a change in tax regulations involving the timing of the deductions for research and development expenses.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We have a strong balance sheet, with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the year. Consistent with our practice of opportunistically repurchasing shares, we purchased approximately $100 million during the fourth quarter. We still have remaining share repurchase authorization of $1.1 billion.\nAverage shares outstanding during the fourth quarter were $632 million, relatively consistent with the prior quarter. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2022 to be between $630 million and $635 million.\nBefore turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with financial guidance for 2022. Despite a slow start to the year associated with Omicron's impact on hospital resources, we are planning for conditions to gradually improve and therefore, are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2022.\nFor total Edwards, we continue to expect sales to grow at a low double-digit rate to $5.5 billion to $6 billion. For TAVR, we expect sales of $3.7 billion to $4 billion. And for TMTT, we expect sales of $140 million to $170 million. We expect Surgical Structural Heart sales of $870 million to $950 million and Critical Care sales of $820 million to $900 million. For full year 2022, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $2.50 to $2.65. For the first quarter of 2022, we project total sales to be between $1.27 billion and $1.35 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 to $0.62.\nAnd with that, I'll pass it back to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Mussallem\n\nChairman & CEO, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThanks, Scott. So in conclusion, we're proud of the significant progress we made in 2021, advancing new transformational therapies and delivering strong financial performance. We expect continued growth and progress in 2022. We are enthusiastic about the continued expansion of catheter-based therapies for the many structural heart patients still in need, which positions us well long-term success.\nAs the global population ages and cardiovascular disease remains the #1 largest health burden, we believe the opportunity to serve our patients will nearly double between now and 2028. We are confident that our patient-focused innovation strategy can transform care and bring value to patients and the health care system.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.\n\nMark Wilterding\n\nVP of IR, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation\n\nThanks a lot, Mike. With that, we're ready to take your questions. (Operator Instructions) Diego?"
